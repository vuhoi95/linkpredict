Title: Comments on branon dressing and the Standard Model
Authors: Jean Alexandre and Darrel Yawitch
Abstract: This technical note shows how Electrodynamics and a Yukawa model are dressed after integrating out perturbative brane fluctuations, and it is found that first order corrections in the inverse of the brane tension occur for the fermion and scalar wave functions, the couplings and the masses. Nevertheless, field redefinitions actually lead to effective actions where only masses are dressed to this first order. We compare our results with the literature and find discrepancies at the next order, which, however, might not be measurable in the valid regime of low-energy brane fluctuations.
