Title: Non singular bounce in modified gravity
Authors: L. Raul Abramo and Patrick Peter and Ivan Yasuda
Abstract: We investigate bouncing solutions in the framework of the non-singular gravity model of Brandenberger, Mukhanov and Sornborger. We show that a spatially flat universe filled with ordinary matter undergoing a phase of contraction reaches a stage of minimal expansion factor before bouncing in a regular way to reach the expanding phase. The expansion can be connected to the usual radiation- and matter-dominated epochs before reaching a final expanding de Sitter phase. In general relativity (GR), a bounce can only take place provided that the spatial sections are positively curved, a fact that has been shown to translate into a constraint on the characteristic duration of the bounce. In our model, on the other hand, a bounce can occur also in the absence of spatial curvature, which means that the timescale for the bounce can be made arbitrarily short or long. The implication is that constraints on the bounce characteristic time obtained in GR rely heavily on the assumed theory of gravity. Although the model we investigate is fourth order in the derivatives of the metric (and therefore unstable vis-a-vis the perturbations), this generic bounce dynamics should extend to string-motivated non singular models which can accommodate a spatially flat bounce.
