Title: Black hole gas in the early universe
Authors: Monica Borunda and Manuel Masip
Abstract: We consider the early universe at temperatures close to the fundamental scale of gravity (M_D << M_Planck) in models with extra dimensions. At such temperatures a small fraction of particles will experience transplanckian collisions that may result in microscopic black holes (BHs). BHs colder than the environment will gain mass, and as they grow their temperature drops further. We study the dynamics of a system (a black hole gas) defined by radiation at a given temperature coupled to a distribution of BHs of different mass. Our analysis includes the production of BHs in photon-photon collisions, BH evaporation, the absorption of radiation, collisions of two BHs to give a larger one, and the effects of the expansion. We show that the system may follow two different generic paths depending on the initial temperature of the plasma.
