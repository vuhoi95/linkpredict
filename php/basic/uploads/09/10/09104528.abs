Title: Diagonal Kaluza-Klein expansion under brane localized potential
Authors: Naoyuki Haba and Kin-ya Oda and Ryo Takahashi
Abstract: We clarify and study our previous observation that, under a compactification with boundaries or orbifolding, vacuum expectation value of a bulk scalar field can have different extra-dimensional wave-function profile from that of the lowest Kaluza-Klein mode of its quantum fluctuation, under presence of boundary-localized potentials which would be necessarily generated through renormalization group running. For concreteness, we analyze the Universal Extra Dimension model compactified on orbifold $S^1/Z_2$, with brane-localized Higgs potentials at the orbifold fixed points. We compute the Kaluza-Klein expansion of the Higgs and gauge bosons in an $R_\xi$-like gauge by treating the brane-localized potential as a small perturbation. We also check that the $\rho$ parameter is not altered by the brane localized potential.
