Title: Three-flavor quark mass dependence of baryon spectra in holographic QCD
Authors: Koji Hashimoto and Norihiro Iizuka and Takaaki Ishii and Daisuke Kadoh
Abstract: We introduce the strange quark mass to the Sakai-Sugimoto model of holographic QCD. We compute mass shifts in the spectra of three-flavor baryons at the leading order in perturbation in quark masses. Comparison with experimental data shows an agreement only qualitatively.
