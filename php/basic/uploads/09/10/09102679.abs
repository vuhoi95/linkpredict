Abstract: We study the time evolution of superposition of product states of two dressed atoms in a spherical cavity in the extreme situations of an arbitrarily large cavity (free space) and of a small one. In the large-cavity case, the system dissipates, whereas, for the small finite cavity, the system evolves in an oscillating way and never completely decays. We also compute the von Neumann entropy for such a system, a measurement of the degree of entanglement of the two atoms, as the superposed state evolves in time. We find that this entropy does not depend on time, nor on the size of the cavity.
