Abstract: We study influence of center vortices on infrared properties of gluons in the deconfinement phase of quenched QCD. We observe a significant suppression of the magnetic component of the gluon propagator in the low-momentum region after the vortices are removed from the gluon configurations. The propagator of the electric gluon stays almost unaffected by the vortex removal. Our results demonstrate that the center vortices are responsible for important nonperturbative properties of the magnetic component of the quark-gluon plasma.
