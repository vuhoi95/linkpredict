Title: Nonperturbative access to Casimir-Polder forces
Authors: Babette DÃ¶brich and Maarten DeKieviet and Holger Gies
Abstract: We discuss the scalar analogue of the Casimir-Polder force between a sphere and a uniaxially corrugated surface with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Presenting a formulation that is nonperturbative in the height profile of the surface, we give explicit numerical results for a sinuosoidal corrugation profile.
