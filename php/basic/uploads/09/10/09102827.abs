Title: Supersymmetric extensions of k-field models
Authors: D. Bazeia and R. Menezes and A. Yu. Petrov
Abstract: We investigate the supersymmetric extension of k-field models, in which the scalar field is described by generalized dynamics. We illustrate some results with models that support static solutions with the standard kink or the compact profile.
