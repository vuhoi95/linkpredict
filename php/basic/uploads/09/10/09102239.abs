Title: Mass Hierarchies vs. Proton Decay in MSSM Orientifold Compactifications
Authors: Mirjam Cvetiƒç and James Halverson and Robert Richter
Abstract: We review two systematic bottom-up analyses of MSSM quivers recently performed by the authors. We extend the analysis of arXiv:0905.3379 by including constraints arising from proton decay via dimension 5 operators and present all four-stack quivers in the Madrid embedding which satisfy this additional constraint. Furthermore, we investigate and make precise the interplay between mass hierarchies obtained via factorizable Yukawa textures and the presence of dimension 5 proton decay operators in MSSM orientifold compactifications. We discuss this issue in a five-stack quiver, first presented in arXiv:0909.4292, which exhibits proper mass hierarchies and no rapid proton decay.
