Title: Linearized Lorentz-Violating Gravity and Discriminant Locus in the  Moduli Space of Mass Terms
Authors: Andrei Mironov and Sergey Mironov and Alexei Morozov and Andrey Morozov
Abstract: We analyze the pattern of normal modes in linearized Lorentz-violating massive gravity over the 5-dimensional moduli space of mass terms. Ghost-free theories arise at bifurcation points when the ghosts get out of the spectrum of propagating particles due to vanishing of the coefficient in front of \omega^2 in the propagator. Similarly, the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov (DVZ) discontinuities in the Newton law arise at another type of bifurcations, when the coefficient vanishes in front of \vec k^2. When the Lorentz invariance is broken, these two kinds of bifurcations get independent and one can easily find a ghost-free model without the DVZ discontinuity in the moduli space, at least, in the quadratic (linearized) approximation.
