Title: Exploring Vacuum Structure around Identity-Based Solutions
Authors: Isao Kishimoto and Tomohiko Takahashi
Abstract: We explore the vacuum structure in bosonic open string field theory expanded around an identity-based solution parameterized by $a(>=-1/2)$. Analyzing the expanded theory using level truncation approximation up to level 20, we find that the theory has the tachyon vacuum solution for $a>-1/2$. We also find that, at $a=-1/2$, there exists an unstable vacuum solution in the expanded theory and the solution is expected to be the perturbative open string vacuum. These results reasonably support the expectation that the identity-based solution is a trivial pure gauge configuration for $a>-1/2$, but it can be regarded as the tachyon vacuum solution at $a=-1/2$.
