Title: On the absence of reflection in AdS4/CFT3
Authors: Changrim Ahn and Patrick Dorey and Rafael I. Nepomechie
Abstract: A noteworthy feature of the S-matrix which has been proposed for AdS4/CFT3 is that the scattering of an A-particle ("soliton") with a B-particle ("antisoliton") is reflectionless. We argue, following Zamolodchikov, that the absence of reflection is a result of the existence of certain local conserved charges which act differently on the two types of particles.
