Title: Compactification of IIB Theory with Fluxes and Axion-Dilaton String  Cosmology
Authors: Eiji Konishi and Jnanadeva Maharana
Abstract: Compactification of type IIB theory on torus, in the presence of fluxes, is considered. The reduced effective action is expressed in manifestly S-duality invariant form. Cosmological solutions of the model are discussed in several cases in the Pre-Big Bang scenario.
