Title: Noncommuting Coordinates and Magnetic Monopoles
Authors: Jan Govaerts and Sean Murray
Abstract: The appearance of noncommuting spatial coordinates is studied in quantum systems containing a magnetic monopole and under the influence of a radial potential. We derive expressions for the commutators of the coordinates that have been restricted to the lowest energy level. Quantum corrections are found to previous results by Frenkel and Pereira based on quantizing the Dirac brackets of the classical theory. For two different potentials, the modified harmonic oscillator potential and the modified Coulomb potential, we also calculate the commutators for a projection to a fixed energy level.
