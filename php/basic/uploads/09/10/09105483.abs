Title: Quantum Decoherence of Photons in the Presence of Hidden U(1)s
Authors: M. Ahlers and L. A. Anchordoqui and M. C. Gonzalez-Garcia
Abstract: Many extensions of the standard model predict the existence of hidden sectors that may contain unbroken abelian gauge groups. We argue that in the presence of quantum decoherence photons may convert into hidden photons on sufficiently long time scales and show that this effect is strongly constrained by CMB and supernova data. In particular, Planck-scale suppressed decoherence scales D ~ E^2/M_Pl (characteristic for non-critical string theories) are incompatible with the presence of even a single hidden U(1). The corresponding bounds on the decoherence scale are four orders of magnitude stronger than analogous bounds derived from solar and reactor neutrino data and complement other bounds derived from atmospheric neutrino data.
