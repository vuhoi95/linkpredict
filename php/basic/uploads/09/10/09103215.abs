Authors: Kimball A. Milton and Prachi Parashar and Jef Wagner and Ines Cavero-Pelaez
Abstract: Various applications of the multiple scattering technique to calculating Casimir energy are described. These include the interaction between dilute bodies of various sizes and shapes, temperature dependence, interactions with multilayered and corrugated bodies, and new examples of exactly solvable separable bodies.
