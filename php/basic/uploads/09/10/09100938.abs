Title: Sequences of dipole black rings and Kaluza-Klein bubbles
Authors: Stoytcho S. Yazadjiev and Petia G. Nedkova
Abstract: We construct new exact solutions to 5D Einstein-Maxwell equations describing sequences of Kaluza-Klein bubbles and dipole black rings. The solutions are generated by 2-soliton transformations from vacuum black ring - bubble sequences. The properties of the solutions are investigated. We also derive the Smarr-like relations and the mass and tension first laws in the general case for such configurations of Kaluza-Klein bubbles and dipole black rings. The novel moment is the appearance of the magnetic flux in the Smarr-like relations and the first laws.
