Title: Field theories with homogenous momentum space
Authors: Florian Girelli and Etera R. Livine
Abstract: We discuss the construction of a scalar field theory with momentum space given by a coset. By introducing a generalized Fourier transform, we show how the dual scalar field theory actually lives in Snyder's space-time. As a side-product we identify a star product realization of Snyder's non-commutative space, but also the deformation of the Poincare symmetries necessary to have these symmetries realized in Snyder's space-time. A key feature of the construction is that the star product is non-associative.
