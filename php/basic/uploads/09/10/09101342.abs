Title: Cylindrically Symmetric Vacuum Solutions in Higher Dimensional  Brans-Dicke Theory
Authors: Ahmet Baykal and Dilek K. Ciftci and Ozgur Delice
Abstract: Higher dimensional, static, cylindrically symmetric vacuum solutions with and without a cosmological constant in the Brans-Dicke theory are presented. We show that, for a negative cosmological constant and for specific values of the parameters, a particular subclass of these solutions include higher dimensional topological black hole-type solutions with a flat horizon topology. We briefly extend our discussion to stationary vacuum and $\Lambda-$vacuum solutions.
