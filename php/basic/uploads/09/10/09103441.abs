Title: Noncommutative Deformation of Spinor Zero Mode and ADHM Construction
Authors: Yoshiaki Maeda and Akifumi Sako
Abstract: A method to construct noncommutative instantons as deformations from commutative instantons was provided in arXiv:0805.3373. Using this noncommutative deformed instanton, we investigate the spinor zero modes of the Dirac operator in a noncommutative instanton background on noncommutative R^4, and we modify the index of the Dirac operator on the noncommutative space slightly and show that the number of the zero mode of the Dirac operator is preserved under the noncommutative deformation. We prove the existence of the Green's function associated with instantons on noncommutative R^4, as a smooth deformation of the commutative case. The feature of the zero modes of the Dirac operator and the Green's function derives noncommutative ADHM equations which coincide with the ones introduced by Nekrasov and Schwarz. We show a one-to-one correspondence between the instantons on noncommutative R^4 and ADHM data. An example of a noncommutative instanton and a spinor zero mode are also given.
