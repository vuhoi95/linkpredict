Title: The Effective Potential of the Conformal Factor in Asymptotically Safe  Quantum Gravity
Authors: Jan-Eric Daum and Martin Reuter
Abstract: The effective potential of the conformal factor in the effective average action approach to Quantum Einstein Gravity is discussed. It is shown, without invoking any truncation or other approximations, that if the theory has has a non-Gaussian ultraviolet fixed point and is asymptotically safe the potential has a characteristic behavior near the origin. This behavior might be observable in numerical simulations.
