Title: Casimir Energy, Holographic Dark Energy and Electromagnetic Metamaterial  Mimicking de Sitter
Authors: Miao Li and Rong-Xin Miao and Yi Pang
Abstract: We compute the Casimir energy of the photon field in a de Sitter space and find it to be proportional to the size of the horizon, the same form of the holographic dark energy. We suggest to make metamaterials to mimic de Sitter space in laboratory and measure the predicted Casimir energy.
