Title: On three dimensional bigravity
Authors: Hamid R. Afshar and Mohsen Alishahiha and Ali Naseh
Abstract: In this paper we explore some features of f-g theory in three dimensions. We show that the theory has (A)dS and (A)dS wave solutions. In particular at a critical value of the coupling constant we see that the model admits Log gravity solution as well, reminiscing TMG and NMG. We have also studied a class of exact static spherically symmetric black hole solution in the model.
