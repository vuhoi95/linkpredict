Title: Non-singular modified gravity: the unification of the inflation, dark  energy and dark mater
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: Using the fluid representation, we formulate the conditions for the appearance of all four types finite-time future singularity in modified gravity in accelerating FRW universe. It stressed that number of standard quintessence/phantom DE theories (including scalar, fluid, DBI ones, etc) brings the accelerating cosmology to future singularity precisely in the same way as singular modified gravity DE. The viable non-singular modified gravity unifying the early-time inflation with late-time acceleration is considered. It is shown that adding such non-singular theory to another realistic singular modified gravity which has the accelerating solution with future singularity may cure the singularity of resulting combined model. This universal scenario may be naturally applied to standard singular DE models as well as to inflationary theories with initial singularity. This suggests the additional fundamental reasoning for modification of General Relativity.
