Title: Infinite-N limit of the eigenvalue density of Wilson loops in 2D SU(N)  YM
Authors: Robert Lohmayer and Herbert Neuberger and Tilo Wettig
Abstract: Starting from an integral representation for the eigenvalue density at finite N, it is shown by a saddle-point analysis that the known result (Durhuus and Olesen, 1981) can be recovered.
