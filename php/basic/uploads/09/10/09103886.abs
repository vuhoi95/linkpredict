Title: Stability Conditions For a Noncommutative Scalar Field Coupled to  Gravity via the Positive Energy Theorem
Authors: Orfeu Bertolami and Carlos A. D. Zarro
Abstract: The stability requirements for a noncommutative scalar field coupled to gravity is investigated through the positive energy theorem. It is shown that for a noncommutative scalar with a polynomial potential, the stability conditions are similar to the ones for the commutative case. This result remains valid even whether the space-time has horizons.
