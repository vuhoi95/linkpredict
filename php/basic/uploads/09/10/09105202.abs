Title: Radiatively Induced Lorentz and Gauge Symmetry Violation in  Electrodynamics with Varying alpha
Authors: Alejandro Ferrero and Brett Altschul
Abstract: A time-varying fine structure constant alpha(t) could give rise to Lorentz- and CPT-violating changes to the vacuum polarization, which would affect photon propagation. Such changes to the effective action can violate gauge invariance, but they are otherwise permitted. However, in the minimal theory of varying alpha, no such terms are generated at lowest order. At second order, vacuum polarization can generate an instability--a Lorentz-violating analogue of a negative photon mass squared -m^2 proportional to alpha [(d alpha/dt) / alpha]^2 log (Lambda^2), where Lambda is the cutoff for the low-energy effective theory.
