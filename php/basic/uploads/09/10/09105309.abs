Title: State-space Correlations and Stabilities
Authors: Stefano Bellucci and Bhupendra Nath Tiwari
Abstract: The state-space pair correlation functions and notion of stability of extremal and non-extremal black holes in string theory and M-theory are considered from the viewpoints of thermodynamic Ruppeiner geometry. From the perspective of intrinsic Riemannian geometry, the stability properties of these black branes are divulged from the positivity of principle minors of the space-state metric tensor. We have explicitly analyzed the state-space configurations for (i) the two and three charge extremal black holes, (ii) the four and six charge non-extremal black branes, which both arise from the string theory solutions. An extension is considered for the $D_6$-$D_4$-$D_2$-$D_0$ multi-centered black branes, fractional small black branes and two charge rotating fuzzy rings in the setup of Mathur's fuzzball configurations. The state-space pair correlations and nature of stabilities have been investigated for three charged bubbling black brane foams, and thereby the M-theory solutions are brought into the present consideration. In the case of extremal black brane configurations, we have pointed out that the ratio of diagonal space-state correlations varies as inverse square of the chosen parameters, while the off diagonal components vary as inverse of the chosen parameters. We discuss the significance of this observation for the non-extremal black brane configurations, and find similar conclusion that the state-space correlations extenuate as the chosen parameters are increased.
