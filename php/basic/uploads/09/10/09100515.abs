Title: Holographic dark energy with non-minimal coupling
Authors: L. N. Granda and L. D. Escobar
Abstract: We study a scalar field non-minimally coupled to the curvature, in the framework of holographic dark energy. We obtain a relation between the coupling of the scalar field and the holographic DE parameters. In the model without potential we found the EOS parameter in different regions of the parameters, giving rise to accelerated expansion. For some restrictions on the parameters, the model presents quintom behavior.
