Abstract: We study the effects of the Chern-Simons term in the hydrodynamics of the five-dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS background. We work out the decoupling problem of the equations of motion and calculate the retarded Green functions explicitly. We then find that the Chern-Simons term induces the magnetic conductivity caused by the anomaly effect. It is increasing function of temperature running from a non-zero value at zero temperature to the twice the value at infinite temperature.
