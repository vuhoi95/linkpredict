Abstract: We consider Yukawa couplings generated by a configuration of intersecting seven-branes in F-theory. In configurations with a single interaction point and no fluxes turned on, the Yukawa matrices have rank one. This is no longer true when the three-form H-flux is turned on, which is generically the case for F-theory compactifications on Calabi-Yau fourfolds. In the presence of H-fluxes, the Yukawa coupling is computed using a non-commutative deformation of holomorphic Chern-Simons theory (and its reduction to seven-branes) and subsequently the rank of the Yukawa matrix changes. Such fluxes give rise to a hierarchical structure in the Yukawa matrix in F-theory GUTs of the type which has recently been proposed as a resolution of the flavor hierarchy problem.
