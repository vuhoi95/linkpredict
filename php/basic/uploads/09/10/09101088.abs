Title: Resonant Tunneling in Scalar Quantum Field Theory
Authors: S. -H. Henry Tye and Daniel Wohns
Abstract: The resonant tunneling phenomenon is well understood in quantum mechanics. We argue why a similar phenomenon must be present in quantum field theory. We then use the functional Schr\"odinger method to show how resonant tunneling through multiple barriers takes place in quantum field theory with a single scalar field. We also show how this phenomenon in scalar quantum field theory can lead to an exponential enhancement of the single-barrier tunneling rate. Our analysis is carried out in the thin-wall approximation.
