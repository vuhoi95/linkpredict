Title: The Sine-Gordon model revisited I
Authors: G. Niccoli and J. Teschner
Abstract: We study integrable lattice regularizations of the sine-Gordon model with the help of the separation of variables method of Sklyanin and the Baxter Q-operators. This leads us to the complete characterization of the spectrum (eigenvalues and eigenstates), in terms of the solutions to the Bethe ansatz equations. The completeness of the set of states that can be constructed from the solutions to the Bethe ansatz equations is proven by our approach.
