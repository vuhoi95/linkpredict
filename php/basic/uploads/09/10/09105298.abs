Title: New Gauged Linear Sigma Models for 8D HyperKahler Manifolds and  Calabi-Yau Crystals
Authors: Yutaka Baba and Ta-Sheng Tai
Abstract: We propose two kinds of gauged linear sigma models whose moduli spaces are real eight-dimensional hyperKahler and Calabi-Yau manifolds, respectively. Here, hyperKahler manifolds have sp(2) holonomy in general and are dual to Type IIB (p,q)5-brane configurations. On the other hand, Calabi-Yau fourfolds are toric varieties expressed as quotient spaces. Our model involving fourfolds is different from the usual one which is directly related to a symplectic quotient procedure. Remarkable features in newly-found three-dimensional Chern-Simons-matter theories appear here as well, such as dynamical Fayet-Iliopoulos parameters, one dualized photon and its residual discrete gauge symmetry.
