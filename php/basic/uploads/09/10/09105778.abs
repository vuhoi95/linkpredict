Title: $Îº$-deformed Dirac Equation
Authors: E. Harikumar and M. Sivakumar and N. Srinivas
Abstract: We construct a Dirac equation in $\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime and analyse its implications. This $\kappa$-deformed Dirac equation is expanded as a power series involving derivatives with respect to commutative coordinates and the deformation parameter, $a$. We show that the $\kappa$-deformation breaks the charge conjugation invariance but preserves parity and time reversal. We then study how the Hydrogen atom spectrum is modified due to the $\kappa$-deformation, applying perturbation theory. Using this, we obtain bounds on the deformation parameter $a$, which are few orders higher than the Planck length. We also show that the effects of deformation on the spectrum are distinct from that of Moyal deformation and generalized uncertainty principle.
