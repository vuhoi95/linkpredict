Title: Jordan-Schwinger Representations and Factorised Yang-Baxter Operators
Authors: David Karakhanyan and Roland Kirschner
Abstract: The construction elements of the factorised form of the Yang-Baxter R operator acting on generic representations of q-deformed sl(n+1) are studied. We rely on the iterative construction of such representations by the restricted class of Jordan-Schwinger representations. The latter are formulated explicitly. On this basis the parameter exchange and intertwining operators are derived.
