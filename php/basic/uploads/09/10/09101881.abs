Title: The Electron Propagator in External Electromagnetic Fields in Lower  Dimensions
Authors: Gabriela Murguia and Alfredo Raya and Angel Sanchez and Edward Reyes
Abstract: We study the electron propagator in quantum electrodynamics in lower dimensions. In the case of free electrons, it is well known that the propagator in momentum space takes the simple form $S_F(p)=1/(\gamma\cdot p-m)$. In the presence of external electromagnetic fields, electron asymptotic states are no longer plane-waves, and hence the propagator in the basis of momentum eigenstates has a more intricate form. Nevertheless, in the basis of the eigenfunctions of the operator $(\gamma\cdot \Pi)^2$, where $\Pi_\mu$ is the canonical momentum operator, it acquires the free form $S_F(p)=1/(\gamma\cdot \bar{p}-m)$ where $\bar{p}_\mu$ depends on the dynamical quantum numbers. We construct the electron propagator in the basis of the $(\gamma\cdot \Pi)^2$ eigenfunctions. In the (2+1)-dimensional case, we obtain it in an irreducible representation of the Clifford algebra incorporating to all orders the effects of a magnetic field of arbitrary spatial shape pointing perpendicularly to the plane of motion of the electrons. Such an exercise is of relevance in graphene in the massless limit. The specific examples considered include the uniform magnetic field and the exponentially damped static magnetic field. We further consider the electron propagator for the massive Schwinger model incorporating the effects of a constant electric field to all orders within this framework.
