Title: A Bound on the Superpotential
Authors: Michael Dine and Guido Festuccia and Zohar Komargodski
Abstract: We prove a general bound on the superpotential in theories with broken supersymmetry and broken R-symmetry, 2|W|< f_a F, where f_a and F are the R-axion and Goldstino decay constants, respectively. The bound holds for weakly coupled as well as strongly coupled theories, thereby providing an exact result in theories with broken supersymmetry. We briefly discuss several possible applications.
