Title: Signature of the interaction between dark energy and dark matter in  observations
Authors: Elcio Abdalla and L. Raul Abramo and Jose C. C. de Souza
Abstract: We investigate the effect of an interaction between dark energy and dark matter upon the dynamics of galaxy clusters. This effect is computed through the Layser-Irvine equation, which describes how an astrophysical system reaches virial equilibrium and was modified to include the dark interactions. Using observational data from almost 100 purportedly relaxed galaxy clusters we put constraints on the strength of the couplings in the dark sector. We compare our results with those from other observations and find that a positive (in the sense of energy flow from dark energy to dark matter) non vanishing interaction is consistent with the data within several standard deviations.
