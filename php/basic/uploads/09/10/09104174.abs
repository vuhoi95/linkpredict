Title: Casimir energy of finite width mirrors: renormalization,  self-interaction limit and Lifshitz formula
Authors: I. V. Fialkovsky and V. N. Markov and Yu. M. Pis'mak
Abstract: We study the field theoretical model of a scalar field in presence of spacial inhomogeneities in form of one and two finite width mirrors (material slabs). The interaction of the scalar field with the defect is described with position-dependent mass term. Within this model we derive the interaction of two finite width mirrors, establish the correspondence of the model to the Lifshitz formula and construct limiting procedure to obtain finite self-energy of a single mirror without any normalization condition.
