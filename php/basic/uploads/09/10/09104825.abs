Title: Constraints on Dark Energy and Modified Gravity models by the  Cosmological Redshift Drift test
Authors: Deepak Jain and Sanjay Jhingan
Abstract: We study cosmological constraints on the various accelerating models of the universe using the time evolution of the cosmological redshift of distant sources. The important characteristic of this test is that it directly probes the expansion history of the universe. In this work we analyze the various models of the universe which can explain the late time acceleration, within the framework of General Theory of Relativity (GR) (XCDM, scalar field potentials) and beyond GR (f(R) gravity model).
