Abstract: Inspired in the AdS/CFT correspondence, a variety of holographic phenomenological models have been proposed in the last years to describe non-perturbative aspects of strong interactions. These models are denominated as AdS/QCD. In this work we review the use of the AdS/QCD soft-wall model to investigate the spectrum of scalar glueballs at finite temperature. The scalar glueball states are identified as the poles of the retarded correlation function of the glueball operator. In the gauge/gravity duality, these poles are determined by the quasinormal spectrum of a massless scalar field propagating in the bulk geometry that consists on an ${AdS}_{5}$ black hole with a background dilaton field. We discuss some results for masses and decay widths of scalar glueballs in the plasma phase and analyse how these quantities evolve with temperature and momentum.
