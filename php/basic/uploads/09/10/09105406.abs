Authors: R. Rakhi and K. Indulekha
Abstract: In this paper, basics and some theoretical models of dark energy are reviewed. Theoretical models include cosmological constant, vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields, scalar field models, chaplygin gas, vector field models and Brane world models. Besides this, some alternate models of dark energy are also included. Finally, some elementary ideas on tracker models are also discussed.
