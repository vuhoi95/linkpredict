Abstract: The binding energy of baryon has been studied in the dual $AdS_5\times S^5$ string theory with a black hole interior. In this picture baryon is constructed of a $D_5$ brane vertex wrapping on $S^5$ and $N_c$ fundamental strings connected to it. Here, we calculate the baryon binding energy in Sakai-Sugimoto model with a $D_4/D_8/\bar{D_8}$ in which the supersymmetry is completely broken. Also we check the $T$ dependence of the baryon binding energy. We believe that this model represents an accurate description of baryons due to the existence of Chern-Simones coupling with the gauge field on the brane. We obtain an analytical expression for the baryon binding energy . In that case we plot the baryon binding energy in terms of radial coordinate. Then by using the binding energy diagram, we determine the stability range for baryon configuration. And also the position and energy of the stable equilibrium point is obtained by the corresponding diagram. Also we plot the baryon binding energy in terms of temperature and estimate a critical temperature in which the baryon would be dissociated.
