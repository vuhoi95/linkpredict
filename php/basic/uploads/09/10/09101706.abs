Abstract: We correct a sign in the first variation of the on-shell action of cosmological topologically massive gravity at the chiral point and present the three equations affected by that sign. While this does not change any of the main conclusions of arXiv:0805.2610, it modifies the finite part of the Brown-York stress tensor. Our corrected Brown-York stress tensor is still finite, conserved and traceless, but no longer coincides with that of global AdS_3. It agrees with results found in recent literature.
