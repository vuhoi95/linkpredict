Abstract: We study a generalized version of Chaplygin gas as unified model of dark matter and dark energy. Using realistic theoretical models and the currently available observational data from the age of the universe, the expansion history based on the type Ia supernovae, the matter power spectrum, the cosmic microwave background radiation anisotropy power spectra, and the perturbation growth factor we put the unified model under observational test. As the model has only two free parameters in the flat Friedmann background [$\Lambda$CDM (cold dark matter) model has only one free parameter] we show that the model is already tightly constrained by currently available observations. The only parameter space extremely close to the $\Lambda$CDM model is allowed in this unified model.
