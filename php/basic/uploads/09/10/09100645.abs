Title: Transport Coefficients at Zero Temperature from Extremal Black Holes
Authors: Mohammad Edalati and Juan I. Jottar and Robert G. Leigh
Abstract: Using the AdS/CFT correspondence we study transport coefficients of a strongly-coupled (2 +1)-dimensional field theory at {\it zero} temperature and finite charge density. The field theory under consideration is dual to the extremal Reissner-Nordstrom AdS_4 black hole in the bulk. We show that, like the cases of scalar and spinor operators studied in \cite{Faulkner:2009wj}, the correlators of charge (vector) current and energy-momentum (tensor) operators exhibit scaling behavior at low frequency. The existence of such low frequency behavior is related to the fact that the near-horizon geometry of the extremal black hole background has an AdS_2 factor. We carefully calculate the shear viscosity (at zero temperature) and show that the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density takes the value of 1/4\pi. Because of the AdS_2 factor, we argue that this result stays the same for all d-dimensional boundary field theories dual to the extremal Reissner-Nordstrom AdS_{d+1} black holes. Also, we compute the charge conductivity at zero temperature. The limiting behavior of the conductivity for small frequencies is also attributed to the near horizon AdS_2 factor and is argued to hold regardless of the dimension of the zero-temperature boundary field theory. Finally, using the extremal dyonic AdS_4 black hole as the background, we extract the conductivity in the presence of a constant magnetic field.
