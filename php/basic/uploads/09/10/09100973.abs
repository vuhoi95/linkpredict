Title: Spherical Non-Abelian Solutions in Conformal Gravity
Authors: Y. Brihaye and Y. Verbin
Abstract: We study static spherically-symmetric solutions of non-Abelian gauge theory coupled to Conformal Gravity. We find solutions for the self-gravitating pure Yang-Mills case as well as monopole-like solutions of the Higgs system. The former are localized enough to have finite mass and approach asymptotically the vacuum geometry of Conformal Gravity, while the latter do not decay fast enough to have analogous properties.
