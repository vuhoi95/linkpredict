Title: Comparing the vacuum structure of quenched and dynamical configurations
Authors: Falk Bruckmann and Florian Gruber and Andreas Sch√§fer
Abstract: We systematically compare filtering methods used to extract topological structures on SU(3) lattice configurations. We show that there is a strong correlation of the topological charge densities obtained by APE and Stout smearing. To get rid of artifacts of these methods, we analyze structures that are also seen by Laplace filtering. This combined analysis shows that the topological charge density is more fragmented in the presence of dynamical quarks.
