Title: Some comments on the integrability of the noncommutative generalized  massive Thirring model
Authors: H. Blas and H. L. Carrion and B. M. Cerna
Abstract: Some properties of a non-commutative version of the generalized massive Thirring theory (NCGMT) are studied. We develop explicit calculations for the affine Lie algebra $gl(3)$ case. The NCGMT model is written in terms of Dirac type fields corresponding to the Moyal product extension of the ordinary multi-field massive Thirring model. We discuss the Lagrangian formulation, its zero-curvature representation and integrability property of certain submodels.
