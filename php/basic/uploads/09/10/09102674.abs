Title: Phenomenology of Pure General Gauge Mediation
Authors: Steven Abel and Matthew J. Dolan and Joerg Jaeckel and Valentin V. Khoze
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenology of general gauge mediation in the MSSM. We apply the strict definition of gauge mediated SUSY-breaking where B_mu is generated only through gauge interactions, and as a result is very close to zero at the messenger scale. In this setup tan beta is a prediction rather than an input. The input parameters are independent scales for the gaugino masses, the scalar masses and the messenger mass in accord with general gauge mediation. We investigate the spectra, the constraints on the parameter space from direct searches and indirect observables, as well as fine-tuning. The favoured region of parameter space includes and interpolates between non-split and mildly split SUSY, characteristic of ordinary gauge mediation and direct gauge mediation models, respectively.
