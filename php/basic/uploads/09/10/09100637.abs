Title: Scattering and duality in the 2 dimensional OSP(2|2) Gross Neveu and  sigma models
Authors: H. Saleur and B. Pozsgay
Abstract: We write the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz for the massive OSp(2|2) Gross Neveu and sigma models. We find evidence that the GN S matrix proposed by Bassi and Leclair [12] is the correct one. We determine features of the sigma model S matrix, which seem highly unconventional; we conjecture in particular a relation between this sigma model and the complex sine-Gordon model at a particular value of the coupling. We uncover an intriguing duality between the OSp(2|2) GN (resp. sigma) model on the one hand, and the SO(4) sigma (resp. GN model) on the other, somewhat generalizing to the massive case recent results on OSp(4|2). Finally, we write the TBA for the (SUSY version of the) flow into the random bond Ising model proposed by Cabra et al. [39], and conclude that their S matrix cannot be correct.
