Title: Floating Black Hole in the Karch-Randall Model and its Holographic Dual
Authors: Norihiro Tanahashi and Takahiro Tanaka
Abstract: To investigate the holography in the Karch-Randall (KR) braneworld model, we construct time-symmetric initial data of black holes floating in the bulk, and compare it with its holographic dual, which is described by four-dimensional self-gravitating quantum field theory in asymptotically AdS_4 spacetime. We also give a definition and an explicit formula of mass in the KR model extending the definition by Abbott and Deser for asymptotically AdS spacetime. We obtain supporting evidence for the holography in the KR model such as good agreements of phase structures and characteristic values between the two theories, and find clues that the Hawking-Page transition of the four-dimensional quantum theory in a microcanonical ensemble is holographically dual to a transition in the bulk black hole configuration.
