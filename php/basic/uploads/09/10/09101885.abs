Title: Cosmological Implications of 5-dimensional Brans-Dicke Theory
Authors: Li-e Qiang and Yan Gong and Yongge Ma and Xuelei Chen
Abstract: The five dimensional Brans-Dicke theory naturally provides two scalar fields by the Killing reduction mechanism. These two scalar fields could account for the accelerated expansion of the universe. We test this model and constrain its parameter by using the type Ia supernova (SN Ia) data. We find that the best fit value of the 5-dimensional Brans-Dicke coupling contant is $\omega = -1.9$. This result is also consistent with other observations such as the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO).
