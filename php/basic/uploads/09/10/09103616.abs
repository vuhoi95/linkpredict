Title: Toric Lego: A method for modular model building
Authors: Vijay Balasubramanian and Per Berglund and Iñaki García-Etxebarria
Abstract: Within the context of local type IIB models arising from branes at toric Calabi-Yau singularities, we present a systematic way of joining any number of desired sectors into a consistent theory. The different sectors interact via massive messengers with masses controlled by tunable parameters. We apply this method to a toy model of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) interacting via gauge mediation with a metastable supersymmetry breaking sector and an interacting dark matter sector. We discuss how a mirror procedure can be applied in the type IIA case, allowing us to join certain intersecting brane configurations through massive mediators.
