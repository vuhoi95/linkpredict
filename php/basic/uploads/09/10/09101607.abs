Title: Type-1.5 Superconducting State from an Intrinsic Proximity Effect in  Two-Band Superconductors
Authors: Egor Babaev and Johan Carlstrom and Martin Speight
Abstract: We show that in multiband superconductors even small interband proximity effect can lead to a qualitative change in the interaction potential between superconducting vortices by producing long-range intervortex attraction. This type of vortex interaction results in unusual response to low magnetic fields leading to phase separation into domains of a two-component Meissner states and vortex droplets.
