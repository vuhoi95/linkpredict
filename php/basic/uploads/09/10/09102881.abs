Title: A review about Invariance Induced Gravity: Gravity and Spin from Local  Conformal-Affine Symmetry
Authors: S. Capozziello and M. De Laurentis
Abstract: In this review paper, we discuss how gravity and spin can be obtained as the realization of the local Conformal-Affine group of symmetry transformations. In particular, we show how gravitation is a gauge theory which can be obtained starting from local invariance as the Poincar\'{e} local symmetry.
