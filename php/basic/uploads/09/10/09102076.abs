Title: The RN/CFT Correspondence Revisited
Authors: Chiang-Mei Chen and Jia-Rui Sun and Shou-Jyun Zou
Abstract: We reconsidered the quantum gravity description of the near horizon extremal Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m black hole in the viewpoint of the AdS$_2$/CFT$_1$ correspondence. We found that, for pure electric case, the right moving central charge of dual 1D CFT is $6 Q^2$ which is different from the previous result $6 Q^3$ of left moving sector obtained by warped AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ description. We discussed the discrepancy in these two approaches and examined novel properties of our result.
