Title: Logarithmic corrections to black hole and black ring entropy in  tunneling approach
Authors: Yi-Xin Chen and Jian-Long Li and Kai-Nan Shao
Abstract: The tunneling approach beyond semiclassical approximation has been used to calculate the corrected Hawking temperature and entropy for various black holes and FRW universe model. We examine their derivations, and prove that the quantity $H$ in the corrected temperature is the explicit function of the only free parameter $\mathcal{A}$ (which is an auxiliary parameter defined by $\mathcal{A}=\hbar S_{BH}$). Our analysis improves previous calculations, and indicates that the leading order logarithmic correction to entropy is a natural result of the corrected temperature and the first law of thermodynamics. Additionally, we apply the tunneling approach beyond semiclassical approximation to neutral black rings. Based on the analysis, we show that the entropy of neutral black rings also has a logarithmic leading order correction.
