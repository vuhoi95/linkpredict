Title: Parity-odd and CPT-even electrodynamics of the SME at Finite Temperature
Authors: Rodolfo Casana and Manoel M. Ferreira Jr and Madson R. O. Silva
Abstract: This work examines the finite temperature properties of the CPT-even and parity-odd electrodynamics of the standard model extension. We start from the partition function written into the functional integral formalism in Ref. \cite{Finite}. After specializing the Lorentz-violating tensor $ W_{\alpha \nu \rho \varphi}$ for the nonbirefringent and parity-odd coefficients, the partition function is explicitly carry out, showing that it is a power of the Maxwell's partition function. Also, it is observed that the LIV coefficients induce an anisotropy in the black body angular energy density distribution. The Planck's radiation law retains its usual frequency dependence and the Stefan-Boltzmann law keeps the same form, except for a global proportionality constant.
