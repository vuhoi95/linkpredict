Title: Gauge invariance and classical dynamics of noncommutative particle  theory
Authors: D. M. Gitman and V. G. Kupriyanov
Abstract: We consider a model of classical noncommutative particle in an external electromagnetic field. For this model, we prove the existence of generalized gauge transformations. Classical dynamics in Hamiltonian and Lagrangian form is discussed, in particular, the motion in the constant magnetic field is studied in detail.
