Title: A Three-Generation Calabi-Yau Manifold with Small Hodge Numbers
Authors: Volker Braun and Philip Candelas and Rhys Davies
Abstract: We present a complete intersection Calabi-Yau manifold Y that has Euler number -72 and which admits free actions by two groups of automorphisms of order 12. These are the cyclic group Z_12 and the non-Abelian dicyclic group Dic_3. The quotient manifolds have chi=-6 and Hodge numbers (h^11,h^21)=(1,4). With the standard embedding of the spin connection in the gauge group, Y gives rise to an E_6 gauge theory with 3 chiral generations of particles. The gauge group may be broken further by means of the Hosotani mechanism combined with continuous deformation of the background gauge field. For the non-Abelian quotient we obtain a model with 3 generations with the gauge group broken to that of the standard model. Moreover there is a limit in which the quotients develop 3 conifold points. These singularities may be resolved simultaneously to give another manifold with (h^11,h^21)=(2,2) that lies right at the tip of the distribution of Calabi-Yau manifolds. This strongly suggests that there is a heterotic vacuum for this manifold that derives from the 3 generation model on the quotient of Y. The manifold Y may also be realised as a hypersurface in the toric variety. The symmetry group does not act torically, nevertheless we are able to identify the mirror of the quotient manifold by adapting the construction of Batyrev.
