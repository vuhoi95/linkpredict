Title: Pseudomoduli Dark Matter and Quiver Gauge Theories
Authors: Antonio Amariti and Luciano Girardello and Alberto Mariotti
Abstract: We investigate supersymmetric models for dark matter which is represented by pseudomoduli in weakly coupled hidden sectors. We propose a scheme to add a dark matter sector to quiver gauge theories with metastable supersymmetry breaking. We discuss the embedding of such scheme in string theory and we describe the dark matter sector in terms of D7 flavour branes. We explore the phenomenology in various regions of the parameters.
