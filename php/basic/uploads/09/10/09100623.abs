Title: Preferred foliation effects in Quantum General Relativity
Authors: Tim Koslowski and Alexander Schenkel
Abstract: We investigate the infrared (IR) effects of Lorentz violating terms in the gravitational sector using functional renormalization group methods similar to Reuter and collaborators. The model we consider consists of pure quantum gravity coupled to a preferred foliation, described effectively via a scalar field with non-standard dynamics. We find that vanishing Lorentz violation is a UV attractive fixed-point of this model in the local potential approximation. Since larger truncations may lead to differing results, we study as a first example effects of additional matter fields on the RG running of the Lorentz violating term and provide a general argument why they are small.
