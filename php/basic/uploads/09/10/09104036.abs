Title: Symmetries of spin systems and Birman-Wenzl-Murakami algebra
Authors: P. P. Kulish and N. Manojlovic and Z. Nagy
Abstract: We consider integrable open spin chains related to the quantum affine algebras U_q(o(3)) and U_q(A_2^{(2)}). We discuss the symmetry algebras of these chains with the local C^3 space related to the Birman-Wenzl-Murakami algebra. The symmetry algebra and the Birman-Wenzl-Murakami algebra centralize each other in the representation space, and this defines the structure of the spin system spectra. Consequently, the corresponding multiplet structure of the energy spectra is obtained.
