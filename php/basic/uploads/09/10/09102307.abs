Title: Horizon Thermodynamics and Gravitational Field Equations in  Horava-Lifshitz Gravity
Authors: Rong-Gen Cai and Nobuyoshi Ohta
Abstract: We explore the relationship between the first law of thermodynamics and gravitational field equation at a static, spherically symmetric black hole horizon in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshtiz theory with/without detailed balance. It turns out that as in the cases of Einstein gravity and Lovelock gravity, the gravitational field equation can be cast to a form of the first law of thermodynamics at the black hole horizon. This way we obtain the expressions for entropy and mass in terms of black hole horizon, consistent with those from other approaches. We also define a generalized Misner-Sharp energy for static, spherically symmetric spacetimes in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshtiz theory. The generalized Misner-Sharp energy is conserved in the case without matter field, and its variation gives the first law of black hole thermodynamics at black hole horizon.
