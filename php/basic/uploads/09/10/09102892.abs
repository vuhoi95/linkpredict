Authors: J. Grain and T. Cailleteau and A. Barrau and A. Gorecki
Abstract: The cosmological primordial power spectrum is known to be one of the most promising observable to probe quantum gravity effects. In this article, we investigate how the tensor power spectrum is modified by Loop Quantum Gravity corrections. The two most important quantum terms, holonomy and inverse volume, are explicitly taken into account in a unified framework. The equation of propagation of gravitational waves is derived and solved for one set of parameters.
