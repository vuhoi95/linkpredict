Abstract: Thermodynamic properties of Schwarzschild-Anti de-Sitter (Sch-AdS) and Reissner-Nordstr\"om-Anti de-Sitter (RN-AdS) blackholes in 3+1 dimensional spacetime are studied critically with special reference to the warped braneworld black holes with non-vanishing cosmological constant on the brane. Explicit dependence of the thermodynamic variables on the parameters of the braneworld model such as the induced three brane cosmological constant as well as the bulk cosmological constant have been determined. Hawking-Page phase transition has been discussed for both Sch-AdS and RN-AdS black holes. At the phase transition point it is shown that the parameters mass, charge and cosmological constant get correlated by an inequality relation which originates from the background warped geometry model.
