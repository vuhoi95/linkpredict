Title: Solutions of coupled BPS equations for two-family Calogero and matrix  models
Authors: Velimir Bardek and Stjepan Meljanac and Daniel Meljanac
Abstract: We consider a large N, two-family Calogero and matrix model in the Hamiltonian, collective-field approach. The Bogomol'nyi limit appears and the solutions to the coupled Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfeld equations are given by the static soliton configurations. We find all solutions close to constant and construct exact one-parameter solutions in the strong-weak dual case. Full classification of these solutions is presented.
