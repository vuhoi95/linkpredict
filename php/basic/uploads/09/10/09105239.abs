Title: The Active Universe
Authors: Alexander Gluck and Helmuth Huffel and Sasa Ilijic and Gerald Kelnhofer
Abstract: Active motion is a concept in complex systems theory and was successfully applied to various problems in nonlinear dynamics. Explicit studies for gravitational potentials were missing so far. We interpret the Friedmann equations with cosmological constant as a dynamical system, which can be made active in a straightforward way. These active Friedmann equations lead to a cyclic universe, which is shown numerically.
