Title: Constrained Superfields and Standard Realization of Nonlinear  Supersymmetry
Authors: Hui Luo and Mingxing Luo and Sibo Zheng
Abstract: A constrained superfield formalism has been proposed recently to analyze the low energy physics related to Goldstinos. We prove that this formalism can be reformulated in the language of standard realization of nonlinear supersymmetry. New relations have been uncovered in the standard realization of nonlinear supersymmetry.
