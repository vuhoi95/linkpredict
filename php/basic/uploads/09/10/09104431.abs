Title: Five-dimensional AGT Conjecture and the Deformed Virasoro Algebra
Authors: Hidetoshi Awata and Yasuhiko Yamada
Abstract: We study an analog of the AGT relation in five dimensions. We conjecture that the instanton partition function of 5D N=1 pure SU(2) gauge theory coincides with the inner product of the Gaiotto-like state in the deformed Virasoro algebra. In four dimensional case, a relation between the Gaiotto construction and the theory of Braverman and Etingof is also discussed.
