Title: Perturbing Around A Warped Product Of AdS_4 and Seven-Ellipsoid
Authors: Changhyun Ahn and Kyungsung Woo
Abstract: We compute the spin-2 Kaluza-Klein modes around a warped product of AdS_4 and a seven-ellipsoid. This background with global G_2 symmetry is related to a U(N) x U(N) N=1 superconformal Chern-Simons matter theory with sixth order superpotential. The mass-squared in AdS_4 is quadratic in G_2 quantum number and KK excitation number. We determine the dimensions of spin-2 operators using the AdS/CFT correspondence. The connection to N=2 theory preserving SU(3) x U(1)_R is also discussed.
