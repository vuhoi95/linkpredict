Title: Disappearance of Schwinger's string at the charge - monopole "molecule"
Authors: S. E. Korenblit and Kieun Lee
Abstract: An equivalence of total momentum operator of charge - monopole system to the momentum operator of a symmetrical quantum top is observed. This explicitly shows the string independence of Dirac's quantization condition leading to disappearance of Schwinger's string and reveals some properties of diatomic molecule for this system.
