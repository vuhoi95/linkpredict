Title: Wrapped brane gas as a candidate for Dark Matter
Authors: Masakazu Sano and Hisao Suzuki
Abstract: We consider brane gas models based on type II string theories and analyze the mass, the Ramond-Ramond charge and the charge on moduli fluctuations of branes wrapping over cycles of a compactified space in the four-dimensional Einstein frame. A six-dimensional torus and Calabi-Yau threefolds are considered for the Kaluza-Klein reduction. A large volume of the compactified space and a weak string coupling gives rise to point particles of the wrapped branes which have a light mass and a small charge of the Ramond-Ramond flux and of the moduli fluctuations, while the particles become very heavy in the string frame. We find that the masses and the charges satisfy the sea-saw like dual relations which become time-independent in the four-dimensional Einstein frame.
