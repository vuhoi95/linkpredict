Title: A New Limit for the Non-Commutative Space-Time Parameter
Authors: Mustafa Moumni and Achour BenSlama and Slimane Zaim
Abstract: We study space-time noncommutativity applied to the hydrogen atom and the phenomenological aspects induced. We find that the noncommutative effects are similar to those obtained by considering the extended charged nature of the proton in the atom. To the first order in the noncommutative parameter, it is equivalent to an electron in the fields of a Coulomb potential and an electric dipole and this allows us to get a bound for the parameter. In a second step, we compute noncommutative corrections of the energy levels and find that they are at the second order in the parameter of noncommutativity. By comparing our results to those obtained from experimental spectroscopy, we get another limit for the parameter.
