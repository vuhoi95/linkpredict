Title: Ectoplasm & Superspace Integration Measure for 2D Supergravity with Four  Spinorial Supercurrents
Authors: S. James Gates Jr. and Gabriele Tartaglino-Mazzucchelli
Abstract: Building on a previous derivation of the local chiral projector for a two dimensional superspace with eight real supercharges, we provide the complete density projection formula required for locally supersymmetrical theories in this context. The derivation of this result is shown to be very efficient using techniques based on the Ectoplasmic construction of local measures in superspace.
