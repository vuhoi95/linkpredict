Title: Exact form factors of the SU(N) Gross-Neveu model and 1/N expansion
Authors: Hrachya Babujian and Angela Foerster and Michael Karowski
Abstract: The general SU(N) form factor formula is constructed. Exact form factors for the field, the energy momentum and the current operators are derived and compared with the 1/N-expansion of the chiral Gross-Neveu model and full agreement is found. As an application of the form factor approach the equal time commutation rules of arbitrary local fields are derived and in general anyonic behavior is found.
