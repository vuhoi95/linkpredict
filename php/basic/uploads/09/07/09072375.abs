Title: Eternity and the cosmological constant
Authors: Enrique √Ålvarez and Roberto Vidal
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the stability of interacting matter in the presence of a cosmological constant. Using an approach based on the heat equation, no imaginary part is found for the effective potential in the presence of a fixed background, which is the n-dimensional sphere or else an analytical continuation thereof, which is explored in some detail.
