Title: Spinning Q-balls in the complex signum-Gordon model
Authors: H. Arodź and J. Karkowski and Z. Świerczyński
Abstract: Rotational excitations of compact Q-balls in the complex signum-Gordon model in 2+1 dimensions are investigated. We find that almost all such spinning Q-balls have the form of a ring of strictly finite width. In the limit of large angular momentum M_z their energy is proportional to |M_z|^(1/5).
