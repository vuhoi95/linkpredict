Abstract: We present a theory of the density correlations that appear in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate as a consequence of the dynamical Casimir emission of pairs of Bogoliubov phonons when the atom-atom scattering length is modulated in time. Different regimes as a function of the temporal shape of the modulation are identified and a simple physical picture of the phenomenon is discussed. Analytical expressions for the density correlation function are provided for the most significant limiting cases. This theory is able to explain some unexpected features recently observed in numerical calculations of Hawking radiation from analog black holes.
