Title: Exact solutions in 3D gravity with torsion
Authors: P. A. González and Yerko Vásquez
Abstract: We study the three-dimensional gravity with torsion given by the Mielke-Baekler (MB) model coupled to gravitational Chern-Simons term, and that possess electric charge described by Maxwell-Chern-Simons electrodynamics. We find and discuss this theory's charged black holes solutions and uncharged solutions. We find that for vanishing torsion our solutions by means of a coordinate transformation can be written as three-dimensional Chern-Simons black holes. We also discuss a special case of this theory, Topologically Massive Gravity (TMG) at chiral point, and we show that the logarithmic solution of TMG is also a solution of the MB model at a fixed point in the space of parameters. Furthermore, we show that our solutions generalize Godel type solutions in a particular case. Also, we recover BTZ black hole in Riemann-Cartan spacetime for vanishing charge.
