Title: Comments on Baryon Melting in Quark Gluon Plasma with Gluon Condensation
Authors: Sang-Jin Sin and Shuo Yang and Yang Zhou
Abstract: We consider a black hole solution with a non-trivial dilaton from IIB super gravity which is expected to describe a strongly coupled hot gauge plasma with non-vanishing gluon condensation present. We construct a rotating and moving baryon to probe the screening and phases of the plasma. Melting of the baryons in hot plasma in this background had been studied previously, however, we show that baryons melt much lower temperature than has been suggested previously.
