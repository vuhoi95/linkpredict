Authors: V. Pangon and S. Nagy and J. Polonyi and K. Sailer
Abstract: A numerical algorithm is used to solve the bare and the effective potential for the scalar $\phi^4$ model in the local potential approximation. An approximate dynamical Maxwell-cut is found which reveals itself in the degeneracy of the action for modes at some scale. This result indicates that the potential develop singular field dependence as far as one can see it by an lgorithm of limited numerical accuracy
