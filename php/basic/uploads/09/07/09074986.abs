Title: Zipping and Unzipping of Cosmic String Loops in Collision
Authors: Hassan Firouzjahi and Johanna Karouby and Shahram Khosravi and Robert Brandenberger
Abstract: In this paper the collision of two cosmic string loops is studied. After collision junctions are formed and the loops are entangled. We show that after their formation the junctions start to unzip and the loops disentangle. This analysis provides a theoretical understanding of the unzipping effect observed in numerical simulations of a network of cosmic strings with more than one type of cosmic strings. The unzipping phenomena have important effects in the evolution of cosmic string networks when junctions are formed upon collision, such as in a network of cosmic superstrings.
