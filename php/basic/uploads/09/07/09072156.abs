Title: A Non-Relativistic Weyl Anomaly
Authors: Ido Adam and Ilarion V. Melnikov and Stefan Theisen
Abstract: We examine the Weyl anomaly for a four-dimensional z=3 Lifshitz scalar coupled to Horava's theory of anisotropic gravity. We find a one-loop break-down of scale-invariance at second order in the gravitational background.
