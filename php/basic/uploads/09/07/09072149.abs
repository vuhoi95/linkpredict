Title: Parafermions for higher order extensions of the Poincar√© algebra and  their associated superspace
Authors: R. Campoamor-Stursberg and M. Rausch de Traubenberg
Abstract: Parafermions of order two and three are shown to be the fundamental tool to construct superspaces related to cubic and quartic extensions of the Poincar\'e algebra. The corresponding superfields are constructed, and some of their main properties analyzed in detail. In this context, the existence problem of operators acting like covariant derivatives is analyzed, and the associated operators are explicitly constructed.
