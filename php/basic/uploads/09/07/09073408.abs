Title: New reflection matrices for the U_q(gl(m|n)) case
Authors: Anastasia Doikou and Nikos Karaiskos
Abstract: We examine super symmetric representations of the B-type Hecke algebra. We exploit such representations to obtain new non-diagonal solutions of the reflection equation associated to the super algebra U_q(gl(m|n)). The boundary super algebra is briefly discussed and it is shown to be central to the super symmetric realization of the B-type Hecke algebra
