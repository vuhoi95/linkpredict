Title: Chiral Magnetic conductivity
Authors: Dmitri E. Kharzeev and Harmen J. Warringa
Abstract: Gluon field configurations with nonzero topological charge generate chirality, inducing P- and CP-odd effects. When a magnetic field is applied to a system with nonzero chirality, an electromagnetic current is generated along the direction of the magnetic field. The induced current is equal to the Chiral Magnetic conductivity times the magnetic field. In this article we will compute the Chiral Magnetic conductivity of a high-temperature plasma for nonzero frequencies. This allows us to discuss the effects of time-dependent magnetic fields, such as produced in heavy ion collisions, on chirally asymmetric systems.
