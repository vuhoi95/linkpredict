Title: Vertex Operators and Scattering Amplitudes of the Bosonic Open String  Theory in the Linear Dilaton Background
Authors: Chuan-Tsung Chan and Wei-Ming Chen
Abstract: The operator formalism of the first quantized string theory is applied to the stringy excitations in the linear dilaton background. In particular, the normal-ordered vertex operators in the old-covariant spectrum of the bosonic open string, which correspond to the physical state solutions of the Virasoro constraints, are shown to satisfy the conformal algebra. Tree-level scattering amplitudes among different stringy states are computed using the coherent-state method and the modified inner product of the Hilbert space. Decoupling of the zero-norm states, i.e., the on-shell stringy Ward identities are shown to hold for all tree-level amplitudes under consideration.
