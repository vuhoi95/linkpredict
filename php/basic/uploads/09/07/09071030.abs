Title: Magnetic fields from inflation?
Authors: Vittoria Demozzi and Viatcheslav Mukhanov and Hector Rubinstein
Abstract: We consider the possibility of generation of the seeds of primordial magnetic field on inflation and show that the effect of the back reaction of this field can be very important. Assuming that back reaction does not spoil inflation we find a rather strong restriction on the amplitude of the primordial seeds which could be generated on inflation. Namely, this amplitude recalculated to the present epoch cannot exceed $10^{-32}G$ in $Mpc$ scales. This field seems to be too small to be amplified to the observable values by galactic dynamo mechanism.
