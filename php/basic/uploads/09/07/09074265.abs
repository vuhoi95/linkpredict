Title: Functional Determinants in Higher Derivative Lagrangian Theories
Authors: Roberto Di Criscienzo and Sergio Zerbini
Abstract: Motivated by the considerable success of alternative theories of gravity, we consider the toy model of a higher derivative Lagrangian theory, namely the Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator studied in a recent paper by Hawking-Hertog. Its Euclidean Path Integral is studied with a certain detail and a pedagogical derivation of the propagator, which makes use of a Theorem due to Forman, is consequently proposed
