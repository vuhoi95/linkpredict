Title: Quark Masses from Gaugino Condensation in String Theories
Authors: Christos Kokorelis and Van E. Mayes and Dimitri V. Nanopoulos
Abstract: We present a mechanism able to generate the perturbatively absent up/down $<{\bf 10} \cdot {\bf 10} \cdot {\bf 5}^H>$ quark Yukawa couplings of SU(5)/flipped SU(5) GUTS in Type II orientifold compactifications with D-branes. The mechanism works when there are Sp(N) gauge groups involved. The ${\bf {\bar 5}}$'s get charged under the Sp(N) gauge groups and the generation of quark masses proceeds via the generation of the fermionic Sp(N) singlet condensate $<{\bf {\bar 5} \cdot {\bar 5} \cdot {\bar 5} \cdot {\bar 5}}>$ in the term $(1/{M_s^5}) {\bf 10} \cdot {\bf 10} \cdot < {\bf {\bar 5} \cdot {\bar 5} \cdot {\bar 5} \cdot {\bar 5}}>$. Also non-chiral states charged under Sp gauge groups may become constrained by the requirement of Sp's becoming strongly coupled.
