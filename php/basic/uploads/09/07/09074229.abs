Authors: Franziska Synatschke and Holger Gies and Andreas Wipf
Abstract: We study the phases and fixed-point structure of two-dimensional supersymmetric Wess-Zumino models with one supercharge. Our work is based on the functional renormalization group formulated in terms of a manifestly off-shell supersymmetric flow equation for the effective action. Within the derivative expansion, we solve the flow of the superpotential also including the anomalous dimension of the superfield. The models exhibit a surprisingly rich fixed-point structure with a discrete number of fixed-point superpotentials. Each fixed-point superpotential is characterized by its number of nodes and by the number of RG relevant directions. In limiting cases, we find periodic superpotentials and potentials which confine the fields to a compact target space. The maximally IR-attractive fixed point has one relevant direction, the tuning of which distinguishes between supersymmetric and broken phases. For the Wess-Zumino model defined near the Gaussian fixed point, we determine the phase diagram and compute the corresponding ground-state masses.
