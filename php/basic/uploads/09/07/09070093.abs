Abstract: Reconsidering the analysis of the moduli space of N=2 eight dimensional supergravity coupled to seven scalars, we propose a new scalar manifold factorization given by \frac{\textsc {SO(2,2)}}{{\textsc{SO(2)}}\times {\textsc{SO(2)}}}\times \frac{\textsc{SO(2,1)}}{\textsc{SO(2)}}\times \textsc {SO(1,1)}. This factorization is supported by the appearance of three solutions of Type IIA extremal black p-branes (p=0,1,2) with AdS_{p+2}\times S^{6-p} near-horizon geometries in eight dimensions. We analyze the corresponding attractor mechanism. In particular, we give an interplay between the scalar manifold factors and the extremal black p-brane charges. Then we show that the dilaton can be stabilized by the dyonic black 2-brane charges.
