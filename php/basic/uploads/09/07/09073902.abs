Title: N=2 Superconformal Symmetry in Super Coset Models
Authors: Thomas Creutzig and Peter B. Ronne and Volker Schomerus
Abstract: We extend the Kazama-Suzuki construction of models with N=(2,2) world-sheet supersymmetry to cosets S/K of supergroups. Among the admissible target spaces that allow for an extension to N=2 superconformal algebras are some simple Lie supergroups, including PSL(N|N). Our general analysis is illustrated at the example of the N=1 WZNW model on GL(1|1). After constructing its N=2 superconformal algebra we determine the (anti-)chiral ring of the theory. It exhibits an interesting interplay between world-sheet and target space supersymmetry.
