Title: Current Exchanges for Reducible Higher Spin Multiplets and Gauge Fixing
Authors: A. Fotopoulos and M. Tsulaia
Abstract: We compute the current exchanges between triplets of higher spin fields which describe reducible representations of the Poincare group. Through this computation we can extract the propagator of the reducible higher spin fields which compose the triplet. We show how to decompose the triplet fields into irreducible HS fields which obey Fronsdal equations, and how to compute the current-current interaction for the cubic couplings which appear in ArXiv:0708.1399 [hep-th] using the decomposition into irreducible modes. We compare this result with the same computation using a gauge fixed (Feynman) version of the triplet Lagrangian which allows us to write very simple HS propagators for the triplet fields.
