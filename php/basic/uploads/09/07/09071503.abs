Title: First Order String Theory and the Kodaira-Spencer Equations. II
Authors: O. Gamayun and A. Marshakov
Abstract: The first-order bosonic string theory, perturbed by primary operator, corresponding to the deformation of target-space complex structure is considered. We compute the correlation functions in this theory and study their divergencies. It is found, that consistency of these correlation functions with the world-sheet conformal invariance requires the Kodaira-Spencer equations to be satisfied by target-space Beltrami differentials. This statement is checked explicitly for the three-point and four-point correlators, containing one probe operator. We discuss the origin of these divergences and their relation with beta-functions or effective action and polyvertex structures in BRST approach.
