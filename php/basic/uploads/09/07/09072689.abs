Title: Single-Sector Supersymmetry Breaking in Supersymmetric QCD
Authors: Sebastian Franco and Shamit Kachru
Abstract: We construct examples of single-sector supersymmetry breaking based on simple deformations of supersymmetric QCD with (weakly) gauged flavor group. These theories are calculable in a weakly coupled Seiberg dual description. In these models, some of the particles in the first two generations of quarks and leptons are composites of the same strong dynamics which leads to dynamical supersymmetry breaking. Such models can explain the hierarchies of Yukawa couplings in the Standard Model, in a way that predictively correlates with the spectrum of SUSY-breaking soft terms.
