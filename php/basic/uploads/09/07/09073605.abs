Title: Dimensional Enhancement via Supersymmetry
Authors: M. G. Faux and K. M. Iga and G. D. Landweber
Abstract: We explain how the representation theory associated with supersymmetry in diverse dimensions is encoded within the representation theory of supersymmetry in one time-like dimension. This is enabled by algebraic criteria, derived, exhibited, and utilized in this paper, which indicate which subset of one-dimensional supersymmetric models describe "shadows" of higher-dimensional models. This formalism delineates that minority of one-dimensional supersymmetric models which can "enhance" to accommodate extra dimensions. As a consistency test, we use our formalism to reproduce well-known conclusions about supersymmetric field theories using one-dimensional reasoning exclusively. And we introduce the notion of "phantoms" which usefully accommodate higher-dimensional gauge invariance in the context of shadow multiplets in supersymmetric quantum mechanics.
