Title: N=2 SU Quiver with USP Ends or SU Ends with Antisymmetric Matter
Authors: Dimitri Nanopoulos and Dan Xie
Abstract: We consider the four dimensional scale invariant N=2 SU quiver gauge theories with USp(2N) ends or SU(2N) ends with antisymmetric matter representations. We argue that these theories are realized as six dimensional A_{2N-1} (0,2) theories compactified on spheres with punctures. With this realization, we can study various strongly coupled cusps in moduli space and find the S-dual theories. We find a class of isolated superconformal field theories with only odd dimensional operators $D(\phi)\geq3$ and superconformal field theories with only even dimensional operators $D(\phi)\geq4$.
