Title: Grothendieck ring and Verlinde-like formula for the W-extended  logarithmic minimal model WLM(1,p)
Authors: Paul A. Pearce and Jorgen Rasmussen and Philippe Ruelle
Abstract: We consider the Grothendieck ring of the fusion algebra of the W-extended logarithmic minimal model WLM(1,p). Informally, this is the fusion ring of W-irreducible characters so it is blind to the Jordan block structures associated with reducible yet indecomposable representations. As in the rational models, the Grothendieck ring is described by a simple graph fusion algebra. The 2p-dimensional matrices of the regular representation are mutually commuting but not diagonalizable. They are brought simultaneously to Jordan form by the modular data coming from the full (3p-1)-dimensional S-matrix which includes transformations of the p-1 pseudo-characters. The spectral decomposition yields a Verlinde-like formula that is manifestly independent of the modular parameter $\tau$ but is, in fact, equivalent to the Verlinde-like formula recently proposed by Gaberdiel and Runkel involving a $\tau$-dependent S-matrix.
