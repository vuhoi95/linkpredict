Title: Charged Schrodinger Black Holes
Authors: Allan Adams and Charles Max Brown and Oliver DeWolfe and Christopher Rosen
Abstract: We construct charged and rotating asymptotically Schrodinger black hole solutions of IIB supergravity. We begin by obtaining a closed-form expression for the null Melvin twist of a broad class of type IIB backgrounds, including solutions of minimal five-dimensional gauged supergravity, and identify the resulting five-dimensional effective action. We use these results to demonstrate that the near-horizon physics and thermodynamics of asymptotically Schrodinger black holes obtained in this way are essentially inherited from their AdS progenitors, and verify that they admit zero-temperature extremal limits with AdS_2 near-horizon geometries. Notably, the AdS_2 radius is parametrically larger than that of the asymptotic Schrodinger space.
