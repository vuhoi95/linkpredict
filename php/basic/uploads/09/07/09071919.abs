Title: Konishi at strong coupling from ABE
Authors: Adam Rej and Fabian Spill
Abstract: In this letter, we derive analytically the scaling dimension of the Konishi operator in planar N=4 gauge theory at strong coupling from the asymptotic Bethe equations. The first two leading terms agree with the recent string computation and numerical analysis of TBA equations. At the third order we find spurious logarithm of the coupling constant, which should be absent in the anomalous dimension of any finite operator of planar N=4 SYM theory. Showing the cancelation of this term would provide an important test at strong coupling for the recently proposed sets of TBA equations for planar AdS/CFT correspondence.
