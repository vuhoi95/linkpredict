Title: Spin Holography via Dimensional Enhancement
Authors: Michael G. Faux and Gregory D. Landweber
Abstract: We explain how all information about ambient component field spin assignments in higher-dimensional off-shell supersymmetry is accessibly coded in one-dimensional restrictions, known as shadows. We also explain how to determine whether the components of a given one-dimensional supermultiplet may assemble into representations of $\spin(1,D-1)$ and, if so, how to specifically determine those representations.
