Title: Operator mixing and three-point functions in N=4 SYM
Authors: George Georgiou and Valeria L. Gili and Rodolfo Russo
Abstract: We study the three-point functions between two BPS and one non-BPS local gauge invariant operators in N=4 Super Yang-Mills theory. In particular we show, in explicit 1-loop examples, that the operator mixing discussed in arXiv:0810.0499 plays an important role in the computations of the correlators and is necessary to cancel contributions that would violate the constraints following from the superconformal and the bonus U(1)_Y symmetries. We analyse the same type of correlators also at strong coupling by using the BMN limit of the AdS_5xS^5 string theory. Again the mixing between states with different types of impurities is crucial to ensure the cancellation of various amplitudes that would violate the constraints mentioned above. However, on the string side, we also find some examples of interactions between one non-BPS and two BPS states that do not satisfy expectations based on the superconformal and the bonus U(1)_Y symmetries.
