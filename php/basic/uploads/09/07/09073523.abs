Title: Fermion Flavor in Soft-Wall AdS
Authors: Tony Gherghetta and Daniel Sword
Abstract: The formalism for modeling multiple fermion generations in a warped extra dimension with a soft-wall is presented. A bulk Higgs condensate is responsible for generating mass for the zero-mode fermions but leads to additional complexity from large mixing between different flavors. We extend existing single-generation analyses by considering new special cases in which analytical solutions can be derived and discuss flavor constraints. The general three-generation case is then treated using a simple numerical routine. Assuming anarchic 5D parameters we find a fermion mass spectrum resembling the standard model quarks and leptons with highly degenerate couplings to Kaluza-Klein gauge bosons. This confirms that the soft-wall model has similar attractive features as that found in hard-wall models, providing a framework to generalize existing phenomenological analyses.
