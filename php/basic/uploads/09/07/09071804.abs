Title: Uniqueness of Rotating Charged Black Holes in Five-Dimensional Minimal  Gauged Supergravity
Authors: Haji Ahmedov and Alikram N. Aliev
Abstract: We study a five-dimensional spacetime admitting, in the presence of torsion, a non-degenerate conformal Killing-Yano 2-form which is closed with respect to both the usual exterior differentiation and the exterior differentiation with torsion. Furthermore, assuming that the torsion is closed and co-closed with respect to the exterior differentiation with torsion, we prove that such a spacetime is the only spacetime given by the Chong-Cvetic-Lu-Pope solution for stationary, rotating charged black holes with two independent angular momenta in five-dimensional minimal gauged supergravity.
