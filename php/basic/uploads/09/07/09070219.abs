Title: New Charged Black Holes with Conformal Scalar Hair
Authors: Andres Anabalon and Hideki Maeda
Abstract: A new class of four-dimensional, hairy, stationary solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell-Lambda system with a conformally coupled scalar field is constructed in this paper. The metric belongs to the Plebanski-Demianski family and hence its static limit has the form of the charged C-metric. It is shown that, in the static case, a new family of hairy black holes arises. They turn out to be cohomogeneity-two, with horizons that are neither Einstein nor homogenous manifolds. The conical singularities in the C-metric can be removed due to the back reaction of the scalar field providing a new kind of regular, radiative spacetime. The scalar field carries a continuous parameter proportional to the usual acceleration present in the C-metric. In the zero-acceleration limit, the static solution reduces to the dyonic Bocharova-Bronnikov-Melnikov-Bekenstein solution or the dyonic extension of the Martinez-Troncoso-Zanelli black holes, depending on the value of the cosmological constant.
