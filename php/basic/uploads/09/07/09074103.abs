Title: Recovering General Relativity from massive gravity
Authors: E. Babichev and C. Deffayet and R. Ziour
Abstract: We obtain static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically flat numerical solutions of massive gravity with a source. Those solutions show, for the first time explicitly, a recovery of the Schwarzschild solution of General Relativity via the so-called Vainshtein mechanism.
