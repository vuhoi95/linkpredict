Title: Magnetic flux, Wilson line and orbifold
Authors: Hiroyuki Abe and Kang-Sin Choi and Tatsuo Kobayashi and Hiroshi Ohki
Abstract: We study torus/orbifold models with magnetic flux and Wilson line background. The number of zero-modes and their profiles depend on those backgrounds. That has interesting implications from the viewpoint of particle phenomenology.
