Title: Manifestly Conformal Descriptions and Higher Symmetries of Bosonic  Singletons
Authors: Xavier Bekaert and Maxim Grigoriev
Abstract: The usual ambient space approach to conformal fields is based on identifying the d-dimensional conformal space as the Dirac projective hypercone in a flat d+2-dimensional ambient space. In this work, we explicitly concentrate on singletons of any integer spin and propose an approach that allows one to have both locality and conformal symmetry manifest. This is achieved by using the ambient space representation in the fiber rather than in spacetime. This approach allows us to characterize a subalgebra of higher symmetries for any bosonic singleton, which is a candidate higher-spin algebra for mixed symmetry gauge fields on anti de Sitter spacetime. Furthermore, we argue that this algebra actually exhausts all higher symmetries.
