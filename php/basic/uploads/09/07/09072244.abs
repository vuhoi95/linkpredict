Title: A new class of solutions to the WDVV equation
Authors: Olaf Lechtenfeld and Kirill Polovnikov
Abstract: The known prepotential solutions F to the Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde (WDVV) equation are parametrized by a set {alpha} of covectors. This set may be taken to be indecomposable, since F_{alpha oplus beta}=F_{alpha}+F_{beta}. We couple mutually orthogonal covector sets by adding so-called radial terms to the standard form of F. The resulting reducible covector set yields a new type of irreducible solution to the WDVV equation.
