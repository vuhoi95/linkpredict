Title: Testing Gaussianity in the WMAP data of OT foreground reduced map
Authors: A. Bernui and M. J. Reboucas
Abstract: A considerable effort has recently gone into the study of Gaussianity of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. Among such attempts, there is one with two non-Gaussianity indicators, proposed by the authors, and used in a search for significant deviation from Gaussianity in the WMAP internal linear combination (ILC) and in the single frequency WMAP maps with the KQ75 mask. Here we extend and complement these results by performing a similar analysis for the de Oliveira-Costa and Tegmark (OT) WMAP three-year $KQ75$ masked map, in which the foreground is reduced through a different statistical cleaning procedure.
