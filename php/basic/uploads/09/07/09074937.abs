Title: Large-N reduced models of supersymmetric quiver, Chern-Simons gauge  theories and ABJM
Authors: Masanori Hanada and Lorenzo Mannelli and Yoshinori Matsuo
Abstract: Using the Eguchi-Kawai equivalence, we provide regularizations of supersymmetric quiver and Chern-Simons gauge theories which leave the supersymmetries unbroken. This allow us to study many interesting theories on a computer. As examples we construct large-$N$ reduced models of supersymmetric QCD with flavor and the ABJM model of multiple M2 branes.
