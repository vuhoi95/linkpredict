Title: Quantum scalar fields in the half-line. A heat kernel/zeta function  approach
Authors: J. Mateos Guilarte and J. M. Munoz-Castaneda and M. J. Senosiain
Abstract: In this paper we shall study vacuum fluctuations of a single scalar field with Dirichlet boundary conditions in a finite but very long line. The spectral heat kernel, the heat partition function and the spectral zeta function are calculated in terms of Riemann Theta functions, the error function, and hypergeometric PFQ functions.
