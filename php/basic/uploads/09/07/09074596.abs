Title: BLG-motivated Lagrangian formulation for the chiral two-form gauge field  in D=6 and M5-branes
Authors: Paolo Pasti and Igor Samsonov and Dmitri Sorokin and Mario Tonin
Abstract: We reveal non-manifest gauge and SO(1,5) Lorentz symmetries in the Lagrangian description of a six-dimensional free chiral field derived from the Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson model in arXiv:0804.3629 and make this formulation covariant with the use of a triplet of auxiliary scalar fields. We consider the coupling of this self-dual construction to gravity and its supersymmetrization. In the case of the non-linear model of arXiv:0805.2898 we solve the equations of motion of the gauge field, prove that its non-linear field strength is self-dual and find a gauge-covariant form of the non-linear action. Issues of the relation of this model to the known formulations of the M5-brane worldvolume theory are discussed.
