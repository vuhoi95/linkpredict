Title: Holography for Cosmology
Authors: Paul McFadden and Kostas Skenderis
Abstract: We propose a holographic description of four-dimensional single-scalar inflationary universes, and show how cosmological observables, such as the primordial power spectrum, are encoded in the correlation functions of a three-dimensional QFT. The holographic description correctly reproduces standard inflationary predictions in the limit where a perturbative quantization of fluctuations is justified. In the opposite limit, wherein gravity is strongly coupled at early times, we propose a holographic description in terms of perturbative large N QFT. Initiating a holographic phenomenological approach, we show that models containing only two parameters, N and a dimensionful coupling constant, are capable of satisfying the current observational constraints.
