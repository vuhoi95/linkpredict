Title: Harmonic N=2 Mechanics
Authors: Anton Galajinsky and Olaf Lechtenfeld
Abstract: N=2 superconformal many-body quantum mechanics in arbitrary dimensions is governed by a single scalar prepotential which determines the bosonic potential and the boson-fermion couplings. We present a special class of such models, for which the bosonic potential is absent. They are classified by homogeneous harmonic functions subject to physical symmetry requirements, such as translation, rotation and permutation invariance. The central charge is naturally quantized. We provide some examples for systems of identical particles in any dimension.
