Title: The Dual Quark Models
Authors: K. Bardakci and M. B. Halpern
Abstract: We briefly recall the historical environment around our 1971 and 1975 constructions of current-algebraic internal symmetry on the open string. These constructions included the introduction of world sheet fermions, the independent discovery of affine Lie algebra in physics (level one of affine su(3)), the first examples of the affine-Sugawara and coset constructions, and finally - from compactified spatial dimensions on the string - the first vertex-operator constructions of the fermions and level one of affine su(n).
