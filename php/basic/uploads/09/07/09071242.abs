Title: Asymptotic Symmetries of String Theory on AdS3 X S3 with Ramond-Ramond  Fluxes
Authors: Sujay K. Ashok and Raphael Benichou and Jan Troost
Abstract: String theory on AdS3 space-times with boundary conditions that allow for black hole states has global asymptotic symmetries which include an infinite dimensional conformal algebra. Using the conformal current algebra for sigma-models on PSU(1,1|2), we explicitly construct the R-symmetry and Virasoro charges in the worldsheet theory describing string theory on AdS3 X S3 with Ramond-Ramond fluxes. We also indicate how to construct the full boundary superconformal algebra. The boundary superconformal algebra plays an important role in classifying the full spectrum of string theory on AdS3 with Ramond-Ramond fluxes, and in the microscopic entropy counting in D1-D5 systems.
