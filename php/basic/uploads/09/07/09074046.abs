Title: Motives: an introductory survey for physicists
Authors: Abhijnan Rej and Matilde Marcolli
Abstract: We survey certain accessible aspects of Grothendieck's theory of motives in arithmetic algebraic geometry for mathematical physicists, focussing on areas that have recently found applications in quantum field theory. An appendix (by Matilde Marcolli) sketches further connections between motivic theory and theoretical physics.
