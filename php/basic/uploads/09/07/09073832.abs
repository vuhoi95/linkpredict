Title: Topological String on OSP(1|2)/U(1)
Authors: Gaston Giribet and Yasuaki Hikida and Tadashi Takayanagi
Abstract: We propose an equivalence between topological string on OSP(1|2)/U(1) and \hat{c} \leq 1 superstring with N=1 world-sheet supersymmetry. We examine this by employing a free field representation of OSP(1|2) WZNW model and find an agreement on the spectrum. We also analyze this proposal at the level of scattering amplitudes by applying a map between correlation functions of OSP(1|2) WZNW model and those of N=1 Liouville theory.
