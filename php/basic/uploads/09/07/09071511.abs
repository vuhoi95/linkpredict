Abstract: Recent works have included the effect of rotation on simulations of black hole events at the LHC, showing that the angular momentum of the black hole cannot be ignored and it makes a non-trivial contribution for most of the lifetime of the black hole. A key consequence of the rotation of the black hole is that the Hawking radiation is no longer isotropic, making it more difficult to infer space-time parameters from measurements of the emitted particles. In this letter we study the angular distribution of the Hawking emission of non-zero spin particles with specific helicity on the brane. We argue that the shape of the distribution could be used as a measure of the angular momentum of the black hole.
