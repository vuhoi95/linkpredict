Title: Fermionic dual of one-dimensional bosonic particles with derivative  delta function potential
Authors: B. Basu-Mallick and Tanaya Bhattacharyya
Abstract: We investigate the boson-fermion duality relation for the case of quantum integrable derivative $\delta$-function bose gas. In particular, we find out a dual fermionic system with nonvanishing zero-range interaction for the simplest case of two bosonic particles with derivative $\delta$-function interaction. The coupling constant of this dual fermionic system becomes inversely proportional to the product of the coupling constant of its bosonic counterpart and the centre-of-mass momentum of the corresponding eigenfunction.
