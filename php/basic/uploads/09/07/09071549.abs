Title: Breaking the scale invariance of the primordial power spectrum in  Horava-Lifshitz Cosmology
Authors: Kazuhiro Yamamoto and Tsutomu Kobayashi and Gen Nakamura
Abstract: We study the spectral tilt of primordial perturbations in Horava-Lifshitz cosmology. The uniform approximation, which is a generalization of the familiar Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method, is employed to compute the spectral index both numerically and analytically in a closed form. We clarify how the spectral index depends on the inflation model and parameters in the modified dispersion relation.
