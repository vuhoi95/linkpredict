Title: Vacuum quantum effect for curved boundaries in static Robertson--Walker  spacetime
Authors: M R Setare and J Sadeghi
Abstract: The energy-momentum tensor for a massless conformally coupled scalar field in the region between two curved boundaries in $k=-1$ static Robertson--Walker spacetime is investigated. We assume that the scalar field satisfies the Dirichlet boundary condition on the boundaries. $k=-1$ Robertson--Walker space is conformally related to the Rindler space, as a result we can obtain vacuum expectation values of energy-momentum tensor for conformally invariant field in Robertson--Walker space from the corresponding Rindler counterpart by the conformal transformation.
