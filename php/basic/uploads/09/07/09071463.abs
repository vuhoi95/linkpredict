Abstract: We constrain the one-parameter class of TeVeS models by testing the theory against both rotation curve and strong gravitational lensing data on galactic scales, remaining fully relativistic in our formalism. The upshot of our analysis is that -- at least in its simplest original form, which is the only one studied in the literature so far -- TeVeS is ruled out, in the sense that the models cannot consistently fit simultaneously the two sets of data without including a significant dark matter component. It is also shown that the details of the underlying cosmological model are not relevant for our analysis, which pertains to galactic scales. The choice of the stellar Initial Mass Function -- which affects the estimates of baryonic mass -- is found not to change our conclusions.
