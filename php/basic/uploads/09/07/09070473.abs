Title: Flat 3-Brane with Tension in Cascading Gravity
Authors: Claudia de Rham and Justin Khoury and Andrew J. Tolley
Abstract: In the Cascading Gravity brane-world scenario, our 3-brane lies within a succession of lower-codimension branes, each with their own induced gravity term, embedded into each other in a higher-dimensional space-time. In the 6+1-dimensional version of this scenario, we show that a 3-brane with tension remains flat, at least for sufficiently small tension that the weak-field approximation is valid. The bulk solution is nowhere singular and remains in the perturbative regime everywhere.
