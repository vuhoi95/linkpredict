Title: Extremal black holes in the HoÅ™ava-Lifshitz gravity
Authors: Hyung Won Lee and Yong-Wan Kim and Yun Soo Myung
Abstract: We study the near-horizon geometry of extremal black holes in the $z=3$ Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity with a flow parameter $\lambda$. For $\lambda>1/2$, near-horizon geometry of extremal black holes are AdS$_2 \times S^2$ with different radii, depending on the (modified) Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity. For $1/3\le \lambda \le 1/2$, the radius $v_2$ of $S^2$ is negative, which means that the near-horizon geometry is ill-defined and the corresponding Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is zero. We show explicitly that the entropy function approach does not work for obtaining the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of extremal black holes.
