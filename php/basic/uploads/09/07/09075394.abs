Title: The Cosmological Spacetime
Authors: Fulvio Melia and Majd Abdelqader
Abstract: We present here the transformations required to recast the Robertson-Walker metric and Friedmann-Robertson-Walker equations in terms of observer-dependent coordinates for several commonly assumed cosmologies. The overriding motivation is the derivation of explicit expressions for the radius R_h of our cosmic horizon in terms of measurable quantities for each of the cases we consider. We show that the cosmological time dt diverges for any finite interval ds associated with a process at R -> R_h, which therefore represents a physical limit to our observations. This is a key component required for a complete interpretation of the data, particularly as they pertain to the nature of dark energy. With these results, we affirm the conclusion drawn in our earlier work that the identification of dark energy as a cosmological constant does not appear to be consistent with the data.
