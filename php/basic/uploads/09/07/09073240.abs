Title: The Hilbert space of Chern-Simons theory on the cylinder. A Loop Quantum  Gravity approach
Authors: Clisthenis P. Constantinidis and Gabriel Luchini and Olivier Piguet
Abstract: As a laboratory for loop quantum gravity, we consider the canonical quantization of the three-dimensional Chern-Simons theory on a noncompact space with the topology of a cylinder. Working within the loop quantization formalism, we define at the quantum level the constraints appearing in the canonical approach and completely solve them, thus constructing a gauge and diffeomorphism invariant physical Hilbert space for the theory. This space turns out to be infinite dimensional, but separable.
