Title: $CPT$ Violating Electrodynamics and Chern-Simons Modified Gravity
Authors: Mingzhe Li and Yi-Fu Cai and Xiulian Wang and Xinmin Zhang
Abstract: The electrodynamics with a Chern-Simons term $p_{\mu}A_{\nu}\widetilde{F}^{\mu\nu}$ violates Lorentz and $CPT$ symmetries with a non-vanishing $p_{\mu}$. For a fixed vector $p_{\mu}$, in this paper we point out that the energy-momentum tensor of this theory coupled to the gravity minimally is symmetric but not divergence free, which consequently makes the gravitational field equation inconsistent. To preserve the consistency, we introduce a Chern-Simons term in the gravity sector with the coefficient determined by the Lorentz and $CPT$ violating term in the electromagnetic field. Further we study the phenomenologies of the model on the cosmic microwave background radiation and the relic gravitational waves.
