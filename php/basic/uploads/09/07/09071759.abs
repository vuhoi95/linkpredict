Title: The finite size spectrum of the 2-dimensional O(3) nonlinear sigma-model
Authors: Janos Balog and Arpad Hegedus
Abstract: Nonlinear integral equations are proposed for the description of the full finite size spectrum of the 2-dimensional O(3) nonlinear sigma-model in a periodic box. Numerical results for the energy eigenvalues are compared to the rotator spectrum and perturbation theory for small volumes and with the recently proposed generalized Luscher formulas at large volumes.
