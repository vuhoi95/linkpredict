Title: Abundance of local actions for the vacuum Einstein equations
Authors: Michel Dubois-Violette and Mohamed Lagraa
Abstract: We exhibit large classes of local actions for the vacuum Einstein equations. In presence of fermions, or more generally of matter which couple to the connection, these actions lead to inequivalent equations revealing an arbitrary number of parameters. Even in the pure gravitational sector, any corresponding quantum theory would depend on these parameters.
