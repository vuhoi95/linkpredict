Title: Conformal invariance from non-conformal gravity
Authors: Krzysztof A. Meissner and Hermann Nicolai
Abstract: We discuss the conditions under which classically conformally invariant models in four dimensions can arise out of non-conformal (Einstein) gravity. As an `existence proof' that this is indeed possible we show how to derive N=4 super Yang Mills theory with any compact gauge group G from non-conformal gauged N=4 supergravity as a special flat space limit. We stress the role that the anticipated UV finiteness of the (so far unknown) underlying theory of quantum gravity would have to play in such a scheme, as well as the fact that the masses of elementary particles would have to arise via quantum gravitational effects which mimic the conformal anomalies of standard (flat space) UV divergent quantum field theory.
