Authors: Yuri N. Obukhov and Alexander J. Silenko and Oleg V. Teryaev
Abstract: We discuss the quantum and classical dynamics of a particle with spin in the gravitational field of a rotating source. A relativistic equation describing the motion of classical spin in curved spacetimes is obtained. We demonstrate that the precession of the classical spin is in a perfect agreement with the motion of the quantum spin derived from the Foldy-Wouthuysen approach for the Dirac particle in a curved spacetime. We show that the precession effect depends crucially on the choice of a tetrad. The results obtained are compared to the earlier computations for different tetrad gauges.
