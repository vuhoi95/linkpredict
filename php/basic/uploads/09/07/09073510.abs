Abstract: We establish that in a large class of strongly coupled 3+1 dimensional N=1 quiver conformal field theories with gravity duals, adding a chemical potential for the R-charge leads to the existence of superfluid states in which a chiral primary operator of the schematic form O = \lambda\lambda + W condenses. Here \lambda is a gluino and W is the superpotential. Our argument is based on the construction of a consistent truncation of type IIB supergravity that includes a U(1) gauge field and a complex scalar.
