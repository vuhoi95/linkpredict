Title: Over-spinning a black hole with a test body
Authors: Ted Jacobson and Thomas P. Sotiriou
Abstract: It has long been known that a maximally spinning black hole can not be over-spun by tossing in a test body. Here we show that if instead the black hole starts out with below maximal spin, then indeed over-spinning can be achieved when adding either orbital or spin angular momentum. We find that requirements on the size and internal structure of the test body can be met as well. Our analysis neglects radiative and self-force effects,which may prevent the over-spinning.
