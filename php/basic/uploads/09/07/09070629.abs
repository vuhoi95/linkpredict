Title: Minimal Length Scale in Annihilation
Authors: Irina Dymnikova and Alexander Sakharov and Jurgen Ulbricht
Abstract: Experimental data suggest the existence of a minimal length scale in annihilation process for the reaction e+e- --> gamma gamma (gamma). Nonlinear electrodynamics coupled to gravity and satisfying the weak energy condition predicts, for an arbitrary gauge invariant lagrangian, the existence of a spinning charged electromagnetic soliton asymptotically Kerr-Newman for a distant observer with a gyromagnetic ratio g=2. Its internal structure includes an equatorial disk of de Sitter vacuum which has properties of a perfect conductor and ideal diamagnetic, and displays superconducting behavior within a single spinning soliton. De Sitter vacuum supplies a particle with the finite positive electromagnetic mass related to breaking of space-time symmetry. We apply this approach to interpret the existence of a minimal characteristic length scale in annihilation.
