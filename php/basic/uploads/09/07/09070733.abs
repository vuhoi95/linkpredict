Title: Unified approach to Quantum and Classical Dualities
Authors: E. Cobanera and G. Ortiz and Z. Nussinov
Abstract: We show how classical and quantum dualities, as well as duality relations that appear only in a sector of certain theories ("emergent dualities"), can be unveiled, and systematically established. Our method relies on the use of morphisms of the "bond algebra" of a quantum Hamiltonian. Dualities are characterized as unitary mappings implementing such morphisms, whose even powers become symmetries of the quantum problem. Dual variables -which were guessed in the past- can be derived in our formalism. We obtain new self-dualities for four-dimensional Abelian gauge field theories.
