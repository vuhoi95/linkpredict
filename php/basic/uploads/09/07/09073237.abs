Title: Strong Coupling Holography
Authors: Gia Dvali and Cesar Gomez
Abstract: We show that whenever a 4-dimensional theory with N particle species emerges as a consistent low energy description of a 3-brane embedded in an asymptotically-flat (4+d)-dimensional space, the holographic scale of high-dimensional gravity sets the strong coupling scale of the 4D theory. This connection persists in the limit in which gravity can be consistently decoupled. We demonstrate this effect for orbifold planes, as well as for the solitonic branes and string theoretic D-branes. In all cases the emergence of a 4D strong coupling scale from bulk holography is a persistent phenomenon. The effect turns out to be insensitive even to such extreme deformations of the brane action that seemingly shield 4D theory from the bulk gravity effects. A well understood example of such deformation is given by large 4D Einstein term in the 3-brane action, which is known to suppress the strength of 5D gravity at short distances and change the 5D Newton's law into the four-dimensional one. Nevertheless, we observe that the scale at which the scalar polarization of an effective 4D-graviton becomes strongly coupled is again set by the bulk holographic scale. The effect persist in the gravity decoupling limit, when the full theory reduces to a 4D system in which the only memory about the high-dimensional holography is encoded in the strong coupling scale. The observed intrinsic connection between the high-dimensional flat space holography and 4D strong coupling suggests a possible guideline for generalization of AdS/CFT duality to other systems.
