Title: Multidimensional gravity in non-relativistic limit
Authors: Maxim Eingorn and Alexander Zhuk
Abstract: It is found the exact solution of the Poisson equation for the multidimensional space with topology $M_{3+d}=\mathbb{R}^3\times T^d$. This solution describes smooth transition from the newtonian behavior $1/r_3$ for distances bigger than periods of tori (the extra dimension sizes) to multidimensional behavior $1/r^{1+d}_{3+d}$ in opposite limit. In the case of one extra dimension $d=1$, the gravitational potential is expressed via compact and elegant formula. It is shown that the corrections to the gravitational constant in the Cavendish-type experiment can be within the measurement accuracy of Newton's gravitational constant $G_N$. It is proposed models where the test masses are smeared over some (or all) extra dimensions. In 10-dimensional spacetime with 3 smeared extra dimensions, it is shown that the size of 3 rest extra dimensions can be enlarged up to submillimeter for the case of 1TeV fundamental Planck scale $M_{Pl(10)}$. In the models where all extra dimensions are smeared, the gravitational potential exactly coincides with the newtonian one. Nevertheless, the hierarchy problem can be solved in these models.
