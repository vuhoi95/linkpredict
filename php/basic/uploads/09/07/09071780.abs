Title: On asymptotically flat algebraically special spacetimes in higher  dimensions
Authors: Marcello Ortaggio and Vojtech Pravda and Alena Pravdova
Abstract: We analyze asymptotic properties of higher-dimensional vacuum spacetimes admitting a "non-degenerate" geodetic multiple WAND. After imposing a fall-off condition necessary for asymptotic flatness, we determine the behaviour of the Weyl tensor as null infinity is approached along the WAND. This demonstrates that these spacetimes do not "peel-off" and do not contain gravitational radiation (in contrast to their four-dimensional counterparts). In the non-twisting case, the uniqueness of the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini metric is also proven.
