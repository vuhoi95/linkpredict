Title: Critical domain walls in the Ashkin-Teller model
Authors: M. Caselle and S. Lottini and M. A. Rajabpour
Abstract: We study the fractal properties of interfaces in the 2d Ashkin-Teller model. The fractal dimension of the symmetric interfaces is calculated along the critical line of the model in the interval between the Ising and the four-states Potts models. Using Schramm's formula for crossing probabilities we show that such interfaces can not be related to the simple SLE$_\kappa$, except for the Ising point. The same calculation on non-symmetric interfaces is performed at the four-states Potts model: the fractal dimension is compatible with the result coming from Schramm's formula, and we expect a simple SLE$_\kappa$ in this case.
