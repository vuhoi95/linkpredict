Title: Solar system constraints on f(G) gravity models
Authors: Antonio De Felice and Shinji Tsujikawa
Abstract: We discuss solar system constraints on f(G) gravity models, where f is a function of the Gauss-Bonnet term G. We focus on cosmologically viable f(G) models that can be responsible for late-time cosmic acceleration. These models generally give rise to corrections of the form epsilon*(r/rs)^p to the vacuum Schwarzschild solution, where epsilon = H^2 rs^2 << 1, rs is the Schwarzschild radius of Sun, and H is the Hubble parameter today. We generally estimate the strength of modifications to General Relativity in order to confront models with a number of experiments such as the deflection of light and the perihelion shift. We show that cosmologically viable f(G) models can be consistent with solar system constraints for a wide range of model parameters.
