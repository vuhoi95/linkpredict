Title: Non-relativistic metrics with extremal limits
Authors: Emiliano Imeroni and Aninda Sinha
Abstract: We present solutions of type IIB supergravity with z=2 Schrodinger asymptotics that admit an extremal limit, i.e. the black hole horizon has a double zero. These solutions are obtained as TsT transformations of the charged planar black hole in AdS_5 \times S^5. Unlike the uncharged solution, the Ramond-Ramond two-form is turned on. We study the thermodynamic properties of these new solutions, and we show that the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density is 1/4\pi even in the extremal limit. We also consider the TsT-transformed soliton and show that, for a special radius of the compact circle, there is a confinement-deconfinement phase transition at zero temperature between the soliton and black hole phases.
