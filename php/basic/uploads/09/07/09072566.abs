Title: The fundamental Gray 3-groupoid of a smooth manifold and local  3-dimensional holonomy based on a 2-crossed module
Authors: Joao Faria Martins and Roger Picken
Abstract: We define the thin fundamental Gray 3-groupoid $S_3(M)$ of a smooth manifold $M$ and define (by using differential geometric data) 3-dimensional holonomies, to be smooth strict Gray 3-groupoid maps $S_3(M) \to C(H)$, where $H$ is a 2-crossed module of Lie groups and $C(H)$ is the Gray 3-groupoid naturally constructed from $H$. As an application, we define Wilson 3-sphere observables.
