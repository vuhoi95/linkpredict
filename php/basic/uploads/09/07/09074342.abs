Title: Recent Developments in the Skyrme Model
Authors: Steffen Krusch and Mark Roberts
Abstract: In this talk, we describe recent developments in the Skyrme model. Our main focus is on discussing various effects which need to be taken into account, when calculating the properties of light atomic nuclei in the Skyrme model. We argue that an important step is to understand "spinning Skyrmions" and discuss the theory of relative equilibria in this context.
