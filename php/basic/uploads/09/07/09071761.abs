Title: Schrodinger invariant solutions of type IIB with enhanced supersymmetry
Authors: Aristomenis Donos and Jerome P. Gauntlett
Abstract: We construct the Killing spinors for a class of supersymmetric solutions of type IIB supergravity that are invariant under the non-relativistic Schrodinger algebra. The solutions depend on a five-dimensional Sasaki-Einstein space and it has been shown that they admit two Killing spinors. Here we will show that, for generic Sasaki-Einstein space, there are special subclasses of solutions which admit six Killing spinors and we determine the corresponding superisometry algebra. We also show that for the special case that the Sasaki-Einstein space is the round five-sphere, the number of Killing spinors can be increased to twelve.
