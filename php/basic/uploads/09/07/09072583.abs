Title: Numerical tests of causal relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics
Authors: E. Moln√°r and H. Niemi and D. H. Rischke
Abstract: We present numerical methods to solve the Israel-Stewart (IS) equations of causal relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics with bulk and shear viscosities. We then test these methods studying the Riemann problem in (1+1)-- and (2+1)-dimensional geometry. The numerical schemes investigated here are applicable to realistic (3+1)--dimensional modeling of a relativistic dissipative fluid.
