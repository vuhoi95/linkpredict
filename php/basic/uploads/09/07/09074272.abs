Title: Yet Another Realization of Kerr/CFT Correspondence
Authors: Yoshinori Matsuo and Takuya Tsukioka and Chul-Moon Yoo
Abstract: The correspondence between the Kerr black hole and a boundary CFT has been conjectured recently. The conjecture has been proposed first only for the half of the CFT, namely for left movers. For right movers, the correspondence has been also found out through the suitable asymptotic boundary condition. However, the boundary conditions for these two studies are exclusive to each other. The boundary condition for left movers does not allow the symmetry of right movers, and vice versa. We propose new boundary condition which allows both of left and right movers.
