Title: Oblique DLCQ M-theory and Multiple M2-branes
Authors: Jin-Ho Cho and Sunyoung Shin
Abstract: We propose an oblique DLCQ as a limit to realize a theory of multiple M2-branes in M(atrix)-theory context. The limit is a combination of an infinite boosting of a space-like circle and a tuned tilting of the circle direction. We obtain a series of supergravity solutions describing various dual configurations including multiple M2-branes. For an infinite boosting along a circle wrapped obliquely around a rectangular torus, Seiberg's DLCQ limit distorts the torus modulus. In the context of supergravity, we show explicitly how this torus modulus of $\widetilde{\text M}$-theory is realized as the vacuum modulus of dual IIB-theory.
