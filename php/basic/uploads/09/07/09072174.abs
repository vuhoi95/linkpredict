Title: Gravitational waves in the black string braneworld
Authors: Sanjeev S. Seahra and Chris Clarkson
Abstract: We study gravitational waves in the black string Randall-Sundrum braneworld. We present a reasonably self-contained and complete derivation of the equations governing the evolution of gravitational perturbations in the presence of a brane localized source, and then specialize to the case of spherical radiation from a pointlike body in orbit around the black string. We solve for the resulting gravitational waveform numerically for a number of different orbital parameters.
