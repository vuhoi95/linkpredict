Title: Higgsinoless Supersymmetry and Hidden Gravity
Authors: Michael L. Graesser and Ryuichiro Kitano and Masafumi Kurachi
Abstract: We present a simple formulation of non-linear supersymmetry where superfields and partnerless fields can coexist. Using this formalism, we propose a supersymmetric Standard Model without the Higgsino as an effective model for the TeV-scale supersymmetry breaking scenario. We also consider an application of the Hidden Local Symmetry in non-linear supersymmetry, where we can naturally incorporate a spin-two resonance into the theory in a manifestly supersymmetric way. Possible signatures at the LHC experiments are discussed.
