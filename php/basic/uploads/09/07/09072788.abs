Title: Dark energy and Josephson junctions
Authors: Vincenzo Branchina and Marco Di Liberto and Ivano Lodato
Abstract: It has been recently claimed that dark energy can be (and has been) observed in laboratory experiments by measuring the power spectrum $S_I(\omega)$ of the noise current in a resistively shunted Josephson junction and that in new dedicated experiments, which will soon test a higher frequency range, $S_I(\omega)$ should show a deviation from the linear rising observed in the lower frequency region because higher frequencies should not contribute to dark energy. Based on previous work on theoretical aspects of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, we carefully investigate these issues and show that these claims are based on a misunderstanding of the physical origin of the spectral function $S_I(\omega)$. According to our analysis, dark energy has never been (and will never be) observed in Josephson junctions experiments. We also predict that no deviation from the linear rising behavior of $S_I(\omega)$ will be observed in forthcoming experiments. Our findings provide new (we believe definite) arguments which strongly support previous criticisms.
