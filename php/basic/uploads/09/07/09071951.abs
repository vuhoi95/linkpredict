Title: Spherical Structures in Conformal Gravity and its Scalar-Tensor  Extension
Authors: Y. Brihaye and Y. Verbin
Abstract: We study spherically-symmetric structures in Conformal Gravity and in a scalar-tensor extension and gain some more insight about these gravitational theories. In both cases we analyze solutions in two systems: perfect fluid solutions and boson stars of a self-interacting complex scalar field. In the purely tensorial (original) theory we find in a certain domain of parameter space finite mass solutions with a linear gravitational potential but without a Newtonian contribution. The scalar-tensor theory exhibits a very rich structure of solutions whose main properties are discussed. Among them, solutions with a finite radial extension, open solutions with a linear potential and logarithmic modifications and also a (scalar-tensor) gravitational soliton. This may also be viewed as a static self-gravitating boson star in purely tensorial Conformal Gravity.
