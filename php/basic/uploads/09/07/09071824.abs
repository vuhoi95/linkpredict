Title: Generalization of Hypervirial and Feynman-Hellmann Theorems for Singular  Potentials
Authors: T. Nadareishvili and A. Khelashvili
Abstract: Using well-known methods we generalize (hyper)virial theorems to case of singular potential. Discussion is performed for most general second order differential equation, which involves all physically interesting cases, as Schrodinger and Klein-Gordon equations with singular potentials. Some physical consequences are discussed. The connection with Feynman-Hellmann like theorems are also considered and some relevant differences are underlined.
