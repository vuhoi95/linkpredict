Title: Thermodynamics of black branes in asymptotically Lifshitz spacetimes
Authors: Gaetano Bertoldi and Benjamin A. Burrington and Amanda W. Peet
Abstract: Recently, a class of gravitational backgrounds in 3+1 dimensions have been proposed as holographic duals to a Lifshitz theory describing critical phenomena in 2+1 dimensions with critical exponent $z\geq 1$. We continue our earlier work \cite{Bertoldi:2009vn}, exploring the thermodynamic properties of the "black brane" solutions with horizon topology $\mathbb{R}^2$. We find that the black branes satisfy the relation $\mathcal{E}=\frac{2}{2+z}Ts$ where $\mathcal{E}$ is the energy density, $T$ is the temperature, and $s$ is the entropy density. This matches the expected behavior for a 2+1 dimensional theory with a scaling symmetry $(x_1,x_2)\to \lambda (x_1,x_2)$, $t\to \lambda^z t$.
