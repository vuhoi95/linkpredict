Title: Flux moduli stabilisation, Supergravity algebras and no-go theorems
Authors: Beatriz de Carlos and Adolfo Guarino and Jesus M. Moreno
Abstract: We perform a complete classification of the flux-induced 12d algebras compatible with the set of N=1 type II orientifold models that are T-duality invariant, and allowed by the symmetries of the T^6/(Z_2 x Z_2) isotropic orbifold. The classification is performed in a type IIB frame, where only H_3 and Q fluxes are present. We then study no-go theorems, formulated in a type IIA frame, on the existence of Minkowski/de Sitter (Mkw/dS) vacua. By deriving a dictionary between the sources of potential energy for the three moduli (S, T and U) in types IIA and IIB, we are able to combine algebra results and no-go theorems. The outcome is a systematic procedure for identifying phenomenologically viable models where Mkw/dS vacua may exist. We present a complete table of the allowed algebras and the viability of their resulting scalar potential, and we point at the models which stand any chance of producing a fully stable vacuum.
