Title: Another Realization of Kerr/CFT Correspondence
Authors: Yoshinori Matsuo and Takuya Tsukioka and Chul-Moon Yoo
Abstract: We study another realization of the Kerr/CFT correspondence. By imposing new asymptotic conditions for the near horizon geometry of Kerr black hole, an asymptotic symmetry which contains all of the exact isometries can be obtained. In particular, the Virasoro algebra can be realized as an enhancement of SL(2,R) symmetry of the AdS geometry. By using this asymptotic symmetry, we discuss finite temperature effects and show the correspondence concretely.
