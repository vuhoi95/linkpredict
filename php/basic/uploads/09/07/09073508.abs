Title: An index theorem in differential K-theory
Authors: Daniel S. Freed and John Lott
Abstract: Let X --> B be a proper submersion with a Riemannian structure. Given a differential K-theory class on X, we define its analytic and topological indices as differential K-theory classes on B. We prove that the two indices are the same.
