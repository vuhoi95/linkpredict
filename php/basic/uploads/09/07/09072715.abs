Abstract: We present a two-dimensional heterotic N=(0,2) CP(N-1) model with twisted masses. It is supposed to describe internal dynamics of non-Abelian strings in massive N=2 SQCD with N=1-preserving deformations. We present gauge and geometric formulations of the world-sheet theory and check its N=(0,2) supersymmetry. It turns out that the set of twisted masses in the heterotic model has N complex mass parameters, rather than N-1. In the general case, when all mass parameters are nonvanishing, N=(0,2) supersymmetry is spontaneously broken already at the classical level. If at least one of the above mass parameters vanishes, then N=(0,2) is unbroken at the classical level. The spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry in this case occurs through nonperturbative effects.
