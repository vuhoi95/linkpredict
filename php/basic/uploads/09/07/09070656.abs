Title: Universal description of viscoelasticity with foliation preserving  diffeomorphisms
Authors: Tatsuo Azeyanagi and Masafumi Fukuma and Hikaru Kawai and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: A universal description is proposed for generic viscoelastic systems with a single relaxation time. Foliation preserving diffeomorphisms are introduced as an underlying symmetry which naturally interpolates between the two extreme limits of elasticity and fluidity. The symmetry is found to be powerful enough to determine the dynamics in the first order of strains.
