Title: Static wormholes in vacuum for conformal gravity
Authors: Julio Oliva and David Tempo and Ricardo Troncoso
Abstract: A static spherically symmetric wormhole solution for conformal gravity in vacuum is found. The solution possesses a single integration constant which determines the size of the neck connecting two static homogeneous universes of constant spatial curvature. Time runs at different rates on each side of the neck, and depending on the value of the parameter, the wormhole can develop a cosmological horizon only at one side. It is shown that the wormholes correspond to the matching of different Einstein spacetimes by means of improper conformal transformations.
