Title: A note on string solutions in AdS_3
Authors: Kazuhiro Sakai and Yuji Satoh
Abstract: We systematically search for classical open string solutions in AdS_3 within the general class expressed by elliptic functions (i.e., the genus-one finite-gap solutions). By explicitly solving the reality and Virasoro conditions, we give a classification of the allowed solutions. When the elliptic modulus degenerates, we find a class of solutions with six null boundaries, among which two pairs are collinear. By adding the S^1 sector, we also find four-cusp solutions with null boundaries expressed by the elliptic functions.
