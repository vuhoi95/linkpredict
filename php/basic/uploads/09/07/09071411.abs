Title: Black Holes in Higher Dimensional Gravity Theory with Quadratic in  Curvature Corrections
Authors: Valeri P. Frolov and Ilya L. Shapiro
Abstract: Static spherically symmetric black holes are discussed in the framework of higher dimensional gravity with quadratic in curvature terms. Such terms naturally arise as a result of quantum corrections induced by quantum fields propagating in the gravitational background. We focus our attention on the correction of the form ${\cal C}^2=C_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta} C^{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}$. The Gauss-Bonnet equation in four-dimensional (4D) spacetime enables one to reduce this term in the action to the terms quadratic in the Ricci tensor and scalar curvature. As a result the Schwarzschild solution which is Ricci flat will be also a solution of the theory with the Weyl scalar ${\cal C}^2$ correction. An important new feature of the spaces with dimension $D > 4$ is that in the presence of the Weyl curvature-squared term a solution necessary differs from the corresponding `classical' vacuum Tangherlini metric. This difference is related to the presence of {\em secondary} or {\em induced} hair. We explore how the Tangherlini solution is modified by `quantum corrections', assuming that the gravitational radius $r_0$ is much larger than the scale of the quantum corrections. We also demonstrated that finding a general solution beyond the perturbation method can be reduced to solving a single third order ODE (master equation).
