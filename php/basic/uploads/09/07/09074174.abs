Title: Generalized instantons in N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory and spinorial  geometry
Authors: Stephane Detournay and Dietmar Klemm and Carlo Pedroli
Abstract: Using spinorial geometry techniques, we classify the supersymmetric solutions of euclidean ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory. These backgrounds represent generalizations of instantons with nontrivial scalar fields turned on, and satisfy some constraints that bear a similarity with the Hitchin equations, and contain the Donaldson equations as a special subcase. It turns out that these constraints can be obtained by dimensional reduction of the octonionic instanton equations, and may be rephrased in terms of a selfduality-like condition for a complex connection. We also show that the supersymmetry conditions imply the equations of motion only partially.
