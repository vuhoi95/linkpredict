Title: Black Hole Superradiance From Kerr/CFT
Authors: Irene Bredberg and Thomas Hartman and Wei Song and Andrew Strominger
Abstract: The superradiant scattering of a scalar field with frequency and angular momentum (\omega,m) by a near-extreme Kerr black hole with mass and spin (M,J) was derived in the seventies by Starobinsky, Churilov, Press and Teukolsky. In this paper we show that for frequencies scaled to the superradiant bound the full functional dependence on (\omega,m,M,J) of the scattering amplitudes is precisely reproduced by a dual two-dimensional conformal field theory in which the black hole corresponds to a specific thermal state and the scalar field to a specific operator. This striking agreement corroborates a conjectured Kerr/CFT correspondence.
