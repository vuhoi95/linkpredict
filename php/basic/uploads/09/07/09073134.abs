Title: Dynamical delocalization of Majorana edge states by sweeping across a  quantum critical point
Authors: A. Bermudez and L. Amico and M. A. Martin-Delgado
Abstract: We study the adiabatic dynamics of Majorana fermions across a quantum phase transition. We show that the Kibble-Zurek scaling, which describes the density of bulk defects produced during the critical point crossing, is not valid for edge Majorana fermions. Therefore, the dynamics governing an edge state quench is nonuniversal and depends on the topological features of the system. Besides, we show that the localization of Majorana fermions is a necessary ingredient to guaranty robustness against defect production.
