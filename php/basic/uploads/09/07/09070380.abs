Abstract: We provide an algebraic study of the local composite operators A_\mu A_\nu-\delta_{\mu\nu}/d A^2 and A^2, with d=4 the spacetime dimension. We prove that these are separately renormalizable to all orders in the Landau gauge. This corresponds to a renormalizable decomposition of the operator A_\mu A_\nu into its trace and traceless part. We present explicit results for the relevant renormalization group functions to three loop order, accompanied with various tests of these results. We then develop a formalism to determine the zero temperature effective potential for the corresponding condensates, and recover the already known result for <A^2> \neq 0, together with <A_\mu A_\nu-\delta_{\mu\nu}/d A^2>=0, a nontrivial check that the approach is consistent with Lorentz symmetry. The formalism is such that it is readily generalizable to the finite temperature case, which shall allow a future analytical study of the electric-magnetic symmetry of the <A^2> condensate, which received strong evidence from recent lattice simulations by Chernodub and Ilgenfritz, who related their results to 3 regions in the Yang-Mills phase diagram.
