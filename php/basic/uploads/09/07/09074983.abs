Title: Crosschecks for Unification at the LHC
Authors: Valéri Löwen and Hans Peter Nilles
Abstract: Experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) might test the picture of supersymmetric Grand Unification in particle physics. We argue that the identification of gaugino masses is the most promising step in this direction. Mass predictions for gauginos are pretty robust and often related to the values of the gauge couplings constants. They might allow a meaningful crosscheck for grand unification, at least in simple schemes like gravity, anomaly or mirage mediation.
