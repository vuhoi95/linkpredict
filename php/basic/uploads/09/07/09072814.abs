Title: The thawing dark energy dynamics: Can we detect it?
Authors: S. Sen and A. A. Sen and M. Sami
Abstract: We consider different classes of scalar field models including quintessence, and tachyon scalar fields with a variety of generic potential belonging to thawing type. Assuming the scalar field is initially frozen at $w=-1$, we evolve the system until the present time. We focus on observational quantities like Hubble parameter, luminosity distance as well as quantities related to the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurement. Our study shows that with present state of observations, one can not distinguish amongst various models which in turn can not be distinguished from cosmological constant. This lead us to a conclusion that there is a thin chance to observe the dark energy metamorphosis in near future.
