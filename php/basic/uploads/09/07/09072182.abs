Title: Combinatorial Dyson-Schwinger equations in noncommutative field theory
Authors: Adrian Tanasa and Dirk Kreimer
Abstract: We give here the Hopf algebra structure describing the noncommutative renormalization of a recently introduced translation-invariant model on Moyal space. We define Hochschild one-cocyles $B_+^\gamma$ which allows us to write down the combinatorial Dyson-Schwinger equations for noncommutative quantum field theory. One- and two-loops examples are explicitly worked out.
