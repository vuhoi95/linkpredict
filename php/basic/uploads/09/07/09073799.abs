Title: Heterotic compactifications on SU(2)-structure backgrounds
Authors: Jan Louis and Danny Martinez-Pedrera and Andrei Micu
Abstract: In this paper we study the reduction of heterotic string theory on SU(2)-structure backgrounds. We compute the bosonic low-energy gauged N=2 supergravity specified by the Killing vectors corresponding to the gauged isometries. We check that the obtained Lagrangian is consistent with the one of N=2 local supersymmetry. We also determine the Killing prepotentials.
