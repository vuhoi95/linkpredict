Title: On Gauge Threshold Corrections for Local IIB/F-theory GUTs
Authors: Joseph P. Conlon and Eran Palti
Abstract: We study gauge threshold corrections for local GUT models in IIB/F-theory. Consistency with holomorphy requirements of supergravity and the Kaplunovsky-Louis formula implies that the unification scale is enhanced by the bulk radius R from the string scale to M_X =RM_S. We argue that the stringy interpretation of this is via a locally uncancelled tadpole sourced by the hypercharge flux. This sources closed string modes propagating into the bulk; equivalently open string gauge coupling running up to the winding scale M_X. The enhancement to R M_s is tied to GUT breaking by a globally trivial hypercharge flux and will occur in all models realising this mechanism.
