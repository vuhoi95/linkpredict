Abstract: In this paper, we study the implementation of brane worlds in type II string theory. Starting with the NS/NS sector of type II string, we first compactify the $(D+d_{+} + d_{-})$-dimensional spacetime, and reduce the corresponding action to a D-dimensional effective action, where the topologies of $M_{d_{+}}$ and $M_{d_{-}}$ are arbitrary. We further compactify one of the $(D-1)$ spatial dimensions on an $S^{1}/Z_{2}$ orbifold, and derive the gravitational and matter field equations both in the bulk and on the branes. Then, we investigate two key issues in such a setup: (i) the radion stability and radion mass; and (ii) the localization of gravity, and the corresponding Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes. We show explicitly that the radion is stable and its mass can be in the order of $GeV$. In addition, the gravity is localized on the visible brane, and its spectrum of the gravitational KK towers is discrete and can have a mass gap of $TeV$, too. The high order Yukawa corrections to the 4-dimensional Newtonian potential is exponentially suppressed, and can be negligible. Applying such a setup to cosmology, we obtain explicitly the field equations in the bulk and the generalized Friedmann equations on the branes.
