Title: Simplified TBA equations of the AdS_5 x S^5 mirror model
Authors: Gleb Arutyunov and Sergey Frolov
Abstract: We use the recently found integral representation for the dressing phase in the kinematic region of the mirror theory to simplify the TBA equations for the AdS_5 x S^5 mirror model. The resulting set of equations provides an efficient starting point for both analytic and numerical studies.
