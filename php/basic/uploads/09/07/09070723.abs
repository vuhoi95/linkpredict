Title: Magnetization of Planar Four-Fermion Systems
Authors: Heron Caldas and Rudnei O. Ramos
Abstract: We consider a planar system of fermions, at finite temperature and density, under a static magnetic field parallel to the two-dimensional plane. This magnetic field generates a Zeeman effect and, then, a spin polarization of the system. The critical properties are studied from the Landau's free energy. The possible observable consequences of the magnetization of planar systems such as polymer films and graphene are discussed.
