Title: Scattering of charged tensor bosons in gauge and superstring theories
Authors: Ignatios Antoniadis and George Savvidy
Abstract: We calculate the leading-order scattering amplitude of one vector and two tensor gauge bosons in a recently proposed non-Abelian tensor gauge field theory and open superstring theory. The linear in momenta part of the superstring amplitude has identical Lorentz structure with the gauge theory, while its cubic in momenta part can be identified with an effective Lagrangian which is constructed using generalized non-Abelian field strength tensors.
