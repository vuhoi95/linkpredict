Title: Torsion formulation of gravity
Authors: M. A. Lledo and L. Sommovigo
Abstract: We make it precise what it means to have a connection with torsion as solution of the Einstein equations. While locally the theory remains the same, the new formulation allows for topologies that would have been excluded in the standard formulation of gravity. In this formulation it is possible to couple arbitrary torsion to gauge fields without breaking the gauge invariance.
