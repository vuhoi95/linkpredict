Title: Holographic superconductivity in M-Theory
Authors: Jerome P. Gauntlett and Julian Sonner and Toby Wiseman
Abstract: Using seven-dimensional Sasaki-Einstein spaces we construct solutions of D=11 supergravity that are holographically dual to superconductors in three spacetime dimensions. Our numerical results indicate a new zero temperature solution dual to a quantum critical point.
