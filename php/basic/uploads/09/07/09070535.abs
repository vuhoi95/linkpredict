Title: Relating the generating functionals in field/antifield formulation  through finite field dependent BRST transformation
Authors: Sumit Kumar Rai and Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: We study the field/antifield formulation of pure Yang Mills theory in the framework of finite field dependent BRST transformation. We show that the generating functionals corresponding to different solutions of quantum master equation are connected through the finite field dependent BRST transformations. We establish this result with the help of several explicit examples.
