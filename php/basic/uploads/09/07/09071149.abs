Title: Casimir densities for a plate in de Sitter spacetime
Authors: A. A. Saharian and T. A. Vardanyan
Abstract: Wightman function, the vacuum expectation values of the field squared and the energy-momentum tensor are investigated for a scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter in the geometry of a plate in the de Sitter spacetime. Robin boundary condition for the field operator is assumed on the plate. The vacuum expectation values are presented as the sum of two terms. The first one corresponds to the geometry of de Sitter bulk without boundaries and the second one is induced by the presence of the plate. We show that for non-conformal fields the vacuum energy-momentum tensor is non-diagonal with the off-diagonal component corresponding to the energy flux along the direction perpendicular to the plate. In dependence of the parameters, this flux can be either positive or negative. The asymptotic behavior of the field squared, vacuum energy density and stresses near the plate and at large distances is investigated.
