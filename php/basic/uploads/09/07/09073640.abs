Title: Translation Invariance, Commutation Relations and Ultraviolet/Infrared  Mixing
Authors: Salvatore Galluccio and Fedele Lizzi and Patrizia Vitale
Abstract: We show that the Ultraviolet/Infrared mixing of noncommutative field theories with the Gronewold-Moyal product, whereby some (but not all) ultraviolet divergences become infrared, is a generic feature of translationally invariant associative products. We find, with an explicit calculation that the phase appearing in the nonplanar diagrams is the one given by the commutator of the coordinates, the semiclassical Poisson structure of the non commutative spacetime. We do this with an explicit calculation for represented generic products.
