Title: Studying Gaugino Mass in Semi-Direct Gauge Mediation
Authors: M. Ibe and Izawa K. -I. and Y. Nakai
Abstract: We study gaugino mass generation in the context of semi-direct gauge mediation models, where the messengers are charged under both the hidden sector and the standard model gauge groups while they do not play important roles in dynamical supersymmetry breaking. We clarify the cancellation of the leading contributions of the supersymmetry breaking effects to the gaugino mass in this class of models in terms of the macroscopic effective theory of the hidden sector dynamics. We also consider how to retrofit the model so that we obtain the non-vanishing leading contribution to the gaugino mass.
