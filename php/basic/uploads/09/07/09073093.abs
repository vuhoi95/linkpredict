Title: Surplus Solid Angle as an Imprint of Horava-Lifshitz Gravity
Authors: Sung-Soo Kim and Taekyung Kim and Yoonbai Kim
Abstract: We consider the electrostatic field of a point charge coupled to Horava-Lifshitz gravity and find an exact solution describing the space with a surplus (or deficit) solid angle. Although, theoretically in general relativity, a surplus angle is hardly to be obtained in the presence of ordinary matter with positive energy distribution, it seems natural in Horava-Lifshitz gravity. We present the sudden disappearance and reappearance of a star image as an astrophysical effect of a surplus angle. We also consider matter configurations of all possible power law behaviors coupled to Horava-Lifshitz gravity and obtain a series of exact solutions.
