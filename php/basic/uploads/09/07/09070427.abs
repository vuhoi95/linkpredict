Title: Power spectra from an inflaton coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet term
Authors: Zong-Kuan Guo and Dominik J. Schwarz
Abstract: We consider power-law inflation with a Gauss-Bonnet correction inspired by string theory. We analyze the stability of cosmological perturbations and obtain the allowed parameter space. We find that for GB-dominated inflation ultra-violet instabilities of either scalar or tensor perturbations show up on small scales. The Gauss-Bonnet correction with a positive (or negative) coupling may lead to a reduction (or enhancement) of the tensor-to-scalar ratio in the potential-dominated case. We place tight constraints on the model parameters by making use of the WMAP 5-year data.
