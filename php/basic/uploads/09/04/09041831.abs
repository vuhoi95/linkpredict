Title: Differential operators for elliptic genera
Authors: Matthias R. Gaberdiel and Christoph A. Keller
Abstract: Using the generalisation of Zhu's recursion relations to N=2 superconformal field theories we construct modular covariant differential operators for weak Jacobi forms. We show that differential operators of this type characterise the elliptic genera of N=2 superconformal minimal models, and sketch how they can be used to constrain extremal N=2 superconformal field theories.
