Title: A Phenomenological Model for the Early Universe
Authors: N. C. Tsamis and R. P. Woodard
Abstract: We consider the description of cosmological dynamics from the onset of inflation by a perfect fluid whose parameters must be consistent with the strength of the enhanced quantum loop effects that can arise during inflation. The source of these effects must be non-local and a simple incarnation of it is studied both analytically and numerically. The resulting evolution stops inflation in a calculable amount of time and leads to an oscillatory universe with a vanishing mean value for the curvature scalar and an oscillation frequency which we compute.
