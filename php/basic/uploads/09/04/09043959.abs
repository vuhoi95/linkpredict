Title: Perturbing gauge/gravity duals by a Romans mass
Authors: Davide Gaiotto and Alessandro Tomasiello
Abstract: We show how to produce algorithmically gravity solutions in massive IIA (as infinitesimal first order perturbations in the Romans mass parameter) dual to assigned conformal field theories. We illustrate the procedure on a family of Chern--Simons--matter conformal field theories that we recently obtained from the N=6 theory by waiving the condition that the levels sum up to zero.
