Title: Solving for tadpole coefficients in one-loop amplitudes
Authors: Ruth Britto and Bo Feng
Abstract: One-loop amplitudes may be expanded in a basis of scalar integrals multiplied by rational coefficients. We relate the coefficient of the one-point integral to the coefficients of higher-point integrals, by considering the effects of introducing an additional, unphysical propagator, subject to certain conditions.
