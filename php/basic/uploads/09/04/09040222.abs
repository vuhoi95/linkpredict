Title: Tadpoles and commutative spectral triples
Authors: Bruno Iochum and Cyril Levy
Abstract: Using the Chamseddine--Connes approach of the noncommutative action on spectral triples, we show that there are no tadpoles of any order for compact spin manifolds without boundary, and also consider a case of a chiral boundary condition. Using pseudodifferential techniques, we track zero terms in spectral actions.
