Title: Relativistic Mott criticality in graphene
Authors: Igor F. Herbut and Vladimir Juricic and Oskar Vafek
Abstract: We formulate the effective Gross-Neveu-Yukawa theory of the semimetal-insulator transitions on the honeycomb lattice and compute its quantum critical behavior near three (spatial) dimensions. We find that at the critical point Dirac fermions do not survive as coherent excitations and that the $\sim 1/r$ tail of the weak Coulomb interaction is an irrelevant coupling. The emergent Lorentz invariance near criticality implies a universal ratio of the low-temperature specific heats of the metallic and the rotational-symmetry-broken insulating phase.
