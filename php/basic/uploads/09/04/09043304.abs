Title: Geometry of Schroedinger Space-Times, Global Coordinates, and Harmonic  Trapping
Authors: Matthias Blau and Jelle Hartong and Blaise Rollier
Abstract: We study various geometrical aspects of Schroedinger space-times with dynamical exponent z>1 and compare them with the properties of AdS (z=1). The Schroedinger metrics are singular for 1<z<2 while the usual Poincare coordinates are incomplete for z \geq 2. For z=2 we obtain a global coordinate system and we explain the relations among its geodesic completeness, the choice of global time, and the harmonic trapping of non-relativistic CFTs. For z>2, we show that the Schroedinger space-times admit no global timelike Killing vectors.
