Title: D-Terms and Supersymmetry Breaking from Branes
Authors: Amit Giveon and David Kutasov and Jock McOrist and Andrew B. Royston
Abstract: Metastable supersymmetry breaking configurations of D-branes and NS5-branes in string theory often owe their existence to classical gravitational interactions between the branes. We show that in the effective theory of the light fields, these interactions give rise to a non-canonical K\"ahler potential and other D-terms. String theory provides a UV completion in which these non-renormalizable terms can be computed. We use these observations to clarify the relation between the phase structure of ISS-type models and their brane realizations.
