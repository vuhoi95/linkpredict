Title: Massive Fermion Emission from Higher Dimensional Black Holes
Authors: Marek Rogatko and Agnieszka Szyp≈Çowska
Abstract: We study the effect of extra dimensions on the process of massive Dirac fermion emission in the spacetime of (4+n)-dimensional black hole, by examining the Dirac operator in arbitrary spacetime dimension. We comment on both bulk and brane emission and find absorption cross section and luminosity of Hawking radiation in the low-energy approximation.
