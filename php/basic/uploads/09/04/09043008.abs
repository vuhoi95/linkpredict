Title: Leading Chiral Logarithms for Pion Form Factors to Arbitrary Number of  Loops
Authors: N. A. Kivel and M. V. Polyakov and A. A. Vladimirov
Abstract: We develop the method of calculation of the leading chiral (infrared) logarithms to an arbitrary loop order for various form factors of Nambu-Goldstone bosons. The method is illustrated on example of scalar and vector form factors in massless 4D O(N+1)/O(N) sigma-model. The analytical properties of the form factors are derived. The leading chiral (infrared) logarithms are summed up in the large N limit.
