Title: Linking the trans-Planckian and the information loss problems in black  hole physics
Authors: Stefano Liberati and Lorenzo Sindoni and Sebastiano Sonego
Abstract: The trans-Planckian and information loss problems are usually discussed in the literature as separate issues concerning the nature of Hawking radiation. Here we instead argue that they are intimately linked, and can be understood as "two sides of the same coin" once it is accepted that general relativity is an effective field theory.
