Title: Gromov-Witten Gauge Theory I
Authors: Edward Frenkel and Constantin Teleman and A. J. Tolland
Abstract: We introduce a geometric completion of the stack of maps from stable marked curves to the quotient stack [point/GL(1)], and use it to construct some gauge-theoretic analogues of the Gromov-Witten invariants. We also indicate the generalization of these invariants to the quotient stacks [X/GL(1)], where X is a smooth proper complex algebraic variety.
