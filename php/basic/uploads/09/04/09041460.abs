Title: Surface operators in the Klebanov-Witten theory
Authors: Eunkyung Koh and Satoshi Yamaguchi
Abstract: We investigate 1/2 BPS conformal surface operators in the Klebanov-Witten theory. These surface operators preserve certain parts of the conformal symmetry and R-symmetry as well as half of the supersymmetry. We propose the gravity dual of the surface operator as a configuration of a D3-brane in AdS_5 x T^{1,1}. This D3-brane preserves the same amount of the supersymmetry as the surface operator. We also compute the correlation function of the surface operator and a chiral primary operator.
