Authors: A. Arianto and Freddy P. Zen and Bobby E. Gunara
Abstract: The modified gravitational equations to describe a four-dimensional braneworld in the case with the Lorentz invariant violation in a bulk spacetime is presented. It contains a trace part of the brane energy-momentum tensor and the coefficients of all terms describe the Lorentz violation effects from the bulk spacetime. As an application, we apply this formalism to study cosmology. In respect to standard effective Friedmann equations on the brane, Lorentz invariance violation in the bulk causes a modification of this equations that can lead to significant physical consequences. In particular, the effective Friedmann equation on the brane explicitly depends on the equation of state of the brane matter and the Lorentz violating parameters. We show that the components of five-dimensional Weyl curvature are related to the matter on brane even at low energies. We also find that the constraints on the theory parameters are depend on the equation of state of the energy components of the brane matter. Finally, the stability of the model depend on the specific choices of initial conditions and the parameters $\beta_i$.
