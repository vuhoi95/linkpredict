Title: $d\geq 5$ static black holes with $S^2\times S^{d-4}$ event horizon  topology
Authors: Burkhard Kleihaus and Jutta Kunz and Eugen Radu
Abstract: We present numerical evidence for the existence of new black hole solutions in $d\geq 6$ spacetime dimensions. They approach asymptotically the Minkowski background and have an event horizon topology $S^2\times S^{d-4}$. These static solutions share the basic properties of the nonrotating black rings in five dimensions, in particular the presence of a conical singularity.
