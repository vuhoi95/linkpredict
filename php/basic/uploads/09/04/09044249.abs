Title: Holographic melting of Heavy Baryons in Plasma with Gluon Condensation
Authors: Sang-Jin Sin and Yang Zhou
Abstract: We propose a Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) D5 vertex brane plus N_c fundamental strings configuration to describe a baryon probe in strongly coupled gauge theory with gluon condensation at finite temperature via AdS/CFT correspondence. We investigate properties of this configuration in a dilaton deformed AdS_5\times S^5 background, in which IIB string theroy is dual to super Yang-Mills thery in a state with a constant self-dual gauge field (F_{mn}=F^*_{mn}) background. We find that for most values of temperature T and gluon condensation parameter q (q = \pi^2<F_{mn}F_{mn}>), there always exists a screening length L_s. The relation L_s\sim{1\ov T} has been checked. We give the q dependence of L_s. We calculate the boost velocity v(v=-\tanh\eta) and angular velocity \omega dependence of L_s for a baryon probe, and obtain L_s=L_0*(1-v^2)^{1/4} for large v and L_s\sim\omega^{-1}, which are consistent with those dependence relations in the point brane plus strings case, and find that the usual relations have been modified by q. We also calculate the mass of baryon and find T dependence of baryon mass.
