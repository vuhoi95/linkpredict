Title: Euclidean Path Integral and Higher-Derivative Theories
Authors: Krzysztof Andrzejewski and Joanna Gonera and Pawel Maslanka
Abstract: We consider the Euclidean path integral approach to higher-derivative theories proposed by Hawking and Hertog (Phys. Rev. D65 (2002), 103515). The Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator is studied in some detail. The operator algebra is reconstructed and the structure of the space of states revealed. It is shown that the quantum theory results from quantizing the classical complex dynamics in which the original dynamics is consistently immersed. The field-theoretical counterpart of Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator is also considered.
