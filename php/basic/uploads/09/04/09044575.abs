Title: The Dressing Factor and Crossing Equations
Authors: Gleb Arutyunov and Sergey Frolov
Abstract: We utilize the DHM integral representation for the BES dressing factor of the world-sheet S-matrix of the AdS_5xS^5 light-cone string theory, and the crossing equations to fix the principal branch of the dressing factor on the rapidity torus. The results obtained are further used, in conjunction with the fusion procedure, to determine the bound state dressing factor of the mirror theory. We convincingly demonstrate that the mirror bound state S-matrix found in this way does not depend on the internal structure of a bound state solution employed in the fusion procedure. This welcome feature is in perfect parallel to string theory, where the corresponding bound state S-matrix has no bearing on bound state constituent particles as well. The mirror bound state S-matrix we found provides the final missing piece in setting up the TBA equations for the AdS_5xS^5 mirror theory.
