Title: Deformations of Holographic Duals to Non-Relativistic CFTs
Authors: Nikolay Bobev and Arnab Kundu
Abstract: We construct the non-relativistic counterparts of some well-known supergravity solutions dual to relevant and marginal deformations of N=4 super Yang-Mills. The main tool we use is the null Melvin twist and we apply it to the N=1 and N=2* Pilch-Warner RG flow solutions as well as the Lunin-Maldacena solution dual to beta-deformations of N=4 super Yang-Mills. We also obtain a family of supergravity solutions with Schrodinger symmetry interpolating between the non-relativistic version of the N=1 Pilch-Warner and Klebanov-Witten fixed points. A generic feature of these non-relativistic backgrounds is the presence of non-vanishing internal fluxes. We also find the most general, three-parameter, null Melvin twist of the AdS_5xS^5 black hole. We briefly comment on the field theories dual to these supergravity solutions.
