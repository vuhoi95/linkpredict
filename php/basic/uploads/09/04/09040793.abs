Title: Preheating and the non-gaussianity of the curvature perturbation
Authors: Kazunori Kohri and David H. Lyth and Cesar A. Valenzuela-Toledo
Abstract: The perturbation of a light field might affect preheating and hence generate a contribution to the spectrum and non-gaussianity of the curvature perturbation \zeta. The field might appear directly in the preheating model (curvaton-type preheating) or indirectly through its effect on a mass or coupling (modulated preheating). We give general expressions for \zeta based on the \delta N formula, and apply them to the cases of quadratic and quartic chaotic inflation. For the quadratic case, curvaton-type preheating is ineffective in contributing to \zeta, but modulated preheating can be effective. For quartic inflation, curvaton-type preheating may be effective but the usual \delta N formalism has to be modified. We see under what circumstances the recent numerical simulation of Bond et al. [0903.3407] may be enough to provide a rough estimate for this case. This paper is dedicated to the memory of Lev Kofman who died on 12th November 2009
