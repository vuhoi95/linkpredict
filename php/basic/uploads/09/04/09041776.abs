Title: Higher Dimensional Charged Rotating Dilaton Black Holes
Authors: A. Sheykhi and M. Allahverdizadeh
Abstract: In this paper, we present the metric for the $n$-dimensional charged slowly rotating dilaton black hole with $N = [(n -1)/2]$ independent rotation parameters, associated with $N$ orthogonal planes of rotation in the background of asymptotically flat and asymptotically (anti)-de Sitter spacetime. The mass, angular momentum and the gyromagnetic ratio of such a black hole are determined for the arbitrary values of the dilaton coupling constant. We find that the gyromagnetic ratio crucially depends on the dilaton coupling constant, $\alpha$, and decreases with increasing $\alpha$ in any dimension.
