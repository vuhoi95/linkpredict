Abstract: We consider QED in a constant axial vector background (\AE ther). Further Lorentz invariance violations (LIV) might occur owing to radiative corrections. The phenomenology of this model is studied, clarifying issues related to the various regularizations employed, with a particular emphasis on the induced photon mass. To this concern, it is shown that in the presence of LIV dimensional regularization may produce a radiatively induced finite photon mass. The possible physical role of the large momentum cutoff is elucidated and the finite temperature radiative corrections are evaluated. Finally, various experimental bounds on the parameters of the model are discussed.
