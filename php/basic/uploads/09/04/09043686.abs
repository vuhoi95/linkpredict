Title: The Cauchy problem for metric-affine f(R)-gravity in presence of  perfect-fluid matter
Authors: S. Capozziello and S. Vignolo
Abstract: The Cauchy problem for metric-affine f(R)-gravity `a la Palatini and with torsion, in presence of perfect fluid matter acting as source, is discussed following the well-known Bruhat prescriptions for General Relativity. The problem results well-formulated and well-posed when the perfect-fluid form of the stress-energy tensor is preserved under conformal transformations. The key role of conservation laws in Jordan and in Einstein frame is also discussed.
