Title: The Cosmology of Asymmetric Brane Modified Gravity
Authors: Eimear O'Callaghan and Ruth Gregory and Alkistis Pourtsidou
Abstract: We consider the asymmetric branes model of modified gravity, which can produce late time acceleration of the universe and compare the cosmology of this model to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and to the DGP braneworld model. We show how the asymmetric cosmology at relevant physical scales can be regarded as a one-parameter extension of the DGP model, and investigate the effect of this additional parameter on the expansion history of the universe.
