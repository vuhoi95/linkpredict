Title: Dynamical Density Fluctuations around QCD Critical Point Based on  Dissipative Relativistic Fluid Dynamics-possible fate of Mach cone at the  critical point-
Authors: Y. Minami and T. Kunihiro
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we study the dynamical density fluctuations around the critical point(CP) of Quantum Chromodynamics(QCD) using dissipative relativistic fluid dynamics in which the coupling of the density fluctuations to those of other conserved quantities is taken into account. We show that the sound mode which is directly coupled to the mechanical density fluctuation is attenuated and in turn the thermal mode becomes the genuine soft mode at the QCD CP. We give a speculation on the possible fate of a Mach cone in the vicinity of the QCD CP as a signal of the existence of the CP on the basis of the above findings. Secondly, we clarify that the so called first-order relativistic fluid dynamic equations have generically no problem to describe fluid dynamic phenomena with long wave lengths contrary to a naive suspect whereas even Israel-Stewart equation, a popular second-order equation, may not describe the hydrodynamic mode in general depending on the value of the relaxation time.
