Title: Effective field theories for the $ν= 5/2$ edge
Authors: Alexey Boyarsky and Vadim Cheianov and Jürg Fröhlich
Abstract: We present a list of possible effective theories which may describe a QHE edge at filling fraction $\nu =5/2$. We show that there exist several abelian and non-abelian effective theories (apart from those discussed in the literature) compatible with the physical requirements imposed by the microscopic nature of the system. We compare predictions of these theories with previous proposals and with the results of recent experiments. We identify a set of theories, both abelian and non-abelian, that cannot be distinguished based on the quasihole tunneling data only. We discuss what experimental information may be useful in resolving the ambiguity.
