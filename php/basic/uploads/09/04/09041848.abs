Abstract: We show that vortices of Yang-Mills-Higgs model in $R^{2}$ space can be regarded as instantons of Yang-Mills model in $R^{2}\times Z_{2}$ space. For this, we construct the noncommutative $Z_{2}$ space by explicitly fixing the $Z_{2}$ coordinates and then show, by using the $Z_{2}$ coordinates, that BPS equation for the vortices can be considered as a self-dual equation. We also propose the possibility to rewrite the BPS equations for vortices as ADHM equations through the use of self-dual equation.
