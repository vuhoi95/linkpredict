Title: Non-Abelian Discrete Flavor Symmetries from Magnetized/Intersecting  Brane Models
Authors: Hiroyuki Abe and Kang-Sin Choi and Tatsuo Kobayashi and Hiroshi Ohki
Abstract: We study non-abelian discrete flavor symmetries, which can appear in magnetized brane models. For example, $D_4$, $\Delta(27)$ and $\Delta(54)$ can appear and matter fields with several representations can appear. We also study the orbifold background, where non-abelian flavor symmetries are broken in a certain way.
