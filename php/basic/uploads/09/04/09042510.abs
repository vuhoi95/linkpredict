Title: Conformally reduced quantum gravity revisited
Authors: P. F. Machado and R. Percacci
Abstract: Applying functional renormalization group methods, we describe two inequivalent ways of defining the renormalization group of matter-coupled four dimensional gravity, in the approximation where only the conformal factor is dynamical and taking the trace anomaly explicitly into account. We make contact with earlier work and briefly discuss the presence or absence of fixed points, depending on the truncation of the action and other approximations.
