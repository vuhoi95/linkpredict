Title: Eight Fermion Terms in the Effective Action of the ABJM Model
Authors: Jong-Hyun Baek and Seungjoon Hyun and Sang-Heon Yi
Abstract: We study eight fermion terms in the effective action of the ABJM model. We show the non-renormalization of $v^2$ terms. After classifying all the possible eight fermion structures, we show that $\CN=6$ supersymmetry determines all these terms completely up to an overall constant. This confirms the one loop non-renormalization of $v^4$ terms.
