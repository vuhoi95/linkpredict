Title: N=2 solutions of massive type IIA and their Chern-Simons duals
Authors: Michela Petrini and Alberto Zaffaroni
Abstract: We find explicit AdS4 solutions of massive type IIA with N=2 supersymmetry obtained deforming with a Roman mass the type IIA supersymmetric reduction of the M theory background AdS4 times M111. The family of solutions have SU(3) times SU(3) structure and isometry SU(3) times U(1)^2. They are conjectured to be dual to three-dimensional N=2 Chern-Simons theories with generic Chern-Simons couplings and gauge group ranks.
