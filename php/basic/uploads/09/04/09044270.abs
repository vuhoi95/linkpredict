Title: Real-Time Correlators and Non-Relativistic Holography
Authors: Robert G. Leigh and Nam Nguyen Hoang
Abstract: We consider Lorentzian correlation functions in theories with non-relativistic Schrodinger symmetry. We employ the method developed by Skenderis and van Rees in which the contour in complex time defining a given correlation function is associated holographically with the gluing together of Euclidean and Lorentzian patches of spacetimes. This formalism extends appropriately to geometries with Schrodinger isometry.
