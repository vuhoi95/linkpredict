Title: Functional renormalization group approach to the sine-Gordon model
Authors: S. Nagy and I. Nandori and J. Polonyi and K. Sailer
Abstract: The renormalization group flow is presented for the two-dimensional sine-Gordon model within the framework of the functional renormalization group method by including the wave-function renormalization constant. The Kosterlitz-Thouless-Berezinski type phase structure is recovered as the interpolating scaling law between two competing IR attractive area of the global renormalization group flow.
