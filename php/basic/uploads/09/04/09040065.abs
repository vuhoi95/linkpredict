Title: N-dimensional plane symmetric solution with perfect fluid source
Authors: Hongsheng Zhang and Hyerim Noh
Abstract: A new class of plane symmetric solution sourced by a perfect fluid is found in our recent work. An n-dimensional ($n\geq 4$) global plane symmetric solution of Einstein field equation generated by a perfect fluid source is investigated, which is the direct generalization of our previous 4-dimensional solution. One time-like Killing vector and $(n-2)(n-1)/2$ space-like Killing vectors, which span a Euclidean group $G_{(n-2)(n-1)/2}$, are permitted in this solution. The regions of the parameters constrained by weak, strong and dominant energy conditions for the source are studied. The boundary condition to match to n-dimensional Taub metric and Minkowski metric are analyzed respectively.
