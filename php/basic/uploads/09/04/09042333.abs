Title: E7(7) formulation of N=2 backgrounds
Authors: Mariana Grana and Jan Louis and Aaron Sim and Daniel Waldram
Abstract: In this paper we reformulate N=2 supergravity backgrounds arising in type II string theory in terms of quantities transforming under the U-duality group E7(7). In particular we combine the Ramond--Ramond scalar degrees of freedom together with the O(6,6) pure spinors which govern the Neveu-Schwarz sector by considering an extended version of generalised geometry. We give E7(7)-invariant expressions for the Kahler and hyperkahler potentials describing the moduli space of vector and hypermultiplets, demonstrating that both correspond to standard E7(7) coset spaces. We also find E7(7) expressions for the Killing prepotentials defining the scalar potential, and discuss the equations governing N=1 vacua in this formalism.
