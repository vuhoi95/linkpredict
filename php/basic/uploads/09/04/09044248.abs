Title: Quantum equivalence in Poisson-Lie T-duality
Authors: Konstadinos Sfetsos and Konstadinos Siampos
Abstract: We prove that, general $\s$-models related by Poisson-Lie T-duality are quantum equivalent under one-loop renormalization group flow. We reveal general properties of the flows, we study the associated generalized coset models and provide explicit examples.
