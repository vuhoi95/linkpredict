Title: Phenomenologically viable Lorentz-violating quantum gravity
Authors: Thomas P. Sotiriou and Matt Visser and Silke Weinfurtner
Abstract: Horava's "Lifschitz point gravity" has many desirable features, but in its original incarnation one is forced to accept a non-zero cosmological constant of the wrong sign to be compatible with observation. We develop an extension of Horava's model that abandons "detailed balance", and in 3+1 dimensions exhibit all five marginal (renormalizable) and four relevant (super-renormalizable) operators, as determined by power counting. We also consider the classical limit of this theory, evaluate the Hamiltonian and super-momentum constraints, and extract the classical equations of motion in a form similar to the ADM formulation of general relativity. This puts the model in a framework amenable to developing detailed precision tests.
