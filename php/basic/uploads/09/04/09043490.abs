Title: Perturbation theory in the Hamiltonian approach to Yang-Mills theory in  Coulomb gauge
Authors: Davide R. Campagnari and Hugo Reinhardt and Axel Weber
Abstract: We study the Hamiltonian approach to Yang-Mills theory in Coulomb gauge in Rayleigh-Schroedinger perturbation theory. The static gluon and ghost propagator as well as the potential between static colour sources are calculated to one-loop order. Furthermore, the one-loop $\beta$-function is calculated from both the ghost-gluon vertex and the static potential and found to agree with the result of covariant perturbation theory.
