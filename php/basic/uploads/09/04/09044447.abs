Title: Unconstrained Higher Spins of Mixed Symmetry. II. Fermi Fields
Authors: Andrea Campoleoni and Dario Francia and Jihad Mourad and Augusto Sagnotti
Abstract: This paper is a sequel of arXiv:0810.4350 [hep-th], and is also devoted to the local "metric-like" unconstrained Lagrangians and field equations for higher-spin fields of mixed symmetry in flat space. Here we complete the previous constrained on-shell formulation of Labastida for Fermi fields, deriving the corresponding constrained Lagrangians both via the Bianchi identities and via the requirement of self-adjointness. We also describe two types of unconstrained Lagrangian formulations: a "minimal" one, containing higher derivatives of the compensator fields, and another non-minimal one, containing only one-derivative terms. We identify classes of these systems that are invariant under Weyl-like symmetry transformations.
