Abstract: An irreducible canonical approach to second-class constraints reducible of an arbitrary order is given. This method generalizes our previous results from [Europhys. Lett. 50 (2000) 169, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 40 (2007) 14537] for first- and respectively second-order reducible second-class constraints. The general procedure is illustrated on Abelian gauge-fixed p-forms.
