Title: Generalized Dynamical Spin Chain and 4-Loop Integrability in N=6  Superconformal Chern-Simons Theory
Authors: Dongsu Bak and Hyunsoo Min and Soo-Jong Rey
Abstract: We revisit unitary representation of centrally extended (2 | 2) excitation superalgebra. We find most generally that `pseudo-momentum', not lattice momentum, diagonalizes spin chain Hamiltonian and leads to generalized dynamic spin chain. All known results point to lattice momentum diagonalization for N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. Having different interacting structure, we ask if N=6 superconformal Chern-Simons theory provides an example of pseudo-momentum diagonalization. For SO(6) sector, we study maximal shuffling and next-to-maximal shuffling terms in the dilatation operator and compare them with results expected from psu(2|2) superalgebbra and integrability. At two loops, we rederive maximal shuffling term (3-site) and find perfect agreement with known results. At four loops, we first find absence of next-to-maximal shuffling term (4-site), in agreement with prediction based on integrability. We next extract maximal shuffling term (5-site), the most relevant term for checking the possibility of pseudo-momentum diagonalization. Curiously, we find that result agrees with integraility prediction based on lattice momentum, as in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. Consistency of our results is fully ensured by checks of renormalizability up to six loops.
