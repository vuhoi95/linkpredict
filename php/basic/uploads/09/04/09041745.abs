Title: (In)visible Z' and dark matter
Authors: E. Dudas and Y. Mambrini and S. Pokorski and A. Romagnoni
Abstract: We study the consequences of an extension of the standard model containing an invisible extra gauge group under which the SM particles are neutral. We show that effective operators, generated by loops of heavy chiral fermions charged under both gauge groups and connecting the new gauge sector to the Standard Model, can give rise to a viable dark matter candidate. Its annihilations produce clean visible signals through a gamma-ray line. This would be a smoking gun signature of such models observable by actual experiments.
