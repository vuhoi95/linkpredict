Title: A Dual Four Dimensional Superstring
Authors: B. B. Deo and P. K. Jena
Abstract: The 26 dimensional bosonic string, first suggested by Nambu and Goto, is reduced to a four dimensional superstring by using two species of 6 and 5 Majorana fermions as proposed by Deo. These two species of fermions differ in their 'neutrino-like' phase, and are vectors in the bosonic representation SO(d-1,1).Using Polchinski's equivalence between operators and states, we can write the Virasoro generators for 4 dimensional string theory. The theory is shown to give the same results as given by other superstrings and also reveals the well known aspects of four dimensional string theory.The bosons and the fermions are found to be the basis for constructing this string theory which includes gravity and exhibits strong-weak coupling duality as well as the usual electric-magnetic duality. This formalism is used to calculate the metric tensor as well as the entropy area relation for a black hole.
