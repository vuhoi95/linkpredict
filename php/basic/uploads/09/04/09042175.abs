Title: Spontaneous SUSY Breaking in Various Dimensions
Authors: Amit Giveon and David Kutasov and Oleg Lunin
Abstract: We generalize the ISS model of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking to lower dimensions. We also comment on the dynamics of the corresponding brane systems in string theory, and on possible applications to gauge/gravity duality.
