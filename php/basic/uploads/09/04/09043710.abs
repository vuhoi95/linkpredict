Title: Electromagnetic Nucleon-to-Delta Transition in Holographic QCD
Authors: Hovhannes R. Grigoryan and T. -S. H. Lee and Ho-Ung Yee
Abstract: We study nucleon-to-delta electromagnetic transition form factors and relations between them within the framework of holographic dual model of QCD proposed by Sakai and Sugimoto. In this setup, baryons appear as topological solitons of the five dimensional holographic gauge theory that describes a tower of mesons and their interactions. We find a relativistic extension of the nucleon-delta-vector meson interaction vertices and use these to calculate transition form factors from holographic QCD. We observe that at low momentum transfer, magnetic dipole, electric and Coulomb quadrupole form factors and their ratios follow the patterns expected in the large N_c limit. Our results at this approximation are in reasonable agreement with experiment.
