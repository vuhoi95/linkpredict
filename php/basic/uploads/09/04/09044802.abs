Title: Spinning Supersymmetric Q-balls
Authors: L. Campanelli and M. Ruggieri
Abstract: We construct nontopological solitonic solutions in (3+1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime carrying a conserved global U(1) charge and nonvanishing angular momentum in a supersymmetric extension of the standard model with low-energy, gauge-mediated symmetry breaking.
