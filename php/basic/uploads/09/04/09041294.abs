Title: Foldy-Wouthuysen Transformation for a Spinning Particle with Anomalous  Magnetic Moment
Authors: A. Barducci and R. Giachetti and G. Pettini
Abstract: We study the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation for a pseudoclassical particle with anomalous magnetic moment in an external, stationary electromagnetic field. We show that the transformation can be expressed in a closed form for neutral particles in purely electrostatic fields and for neutral and charged particles in external magnetostatic fields. The explicit expressions of the diagonalized Hamiltonians are calculated.
