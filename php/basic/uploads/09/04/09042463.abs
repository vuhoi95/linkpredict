Title: QCD properties of twist operators in the N=6 Chern-Simons theory
Authors: Matteo Beccaria and Guido Macorini
Abstract: We consider twist-1, 2 operators in planar N=6 superconformal Chern-Simons ABJM theory. We derive higher order anomalous dimensions from integrability and test various QCD-inspired predictions known to hold in N=4 SYM. In particular, we show that the asymptotic anomalous dimensions display intriguing remnants of Gribov-Lipatov reciprocity and Low-Burnett-Kroll logarithmic cancellations. Wrapping effects are also discussed and shown to be subleading at large spin.
