Title: Twin Supergravities
Authors: Diederik Roest and Henning Samtleben
Abstract: We study the phenomenon that pairs of supergravities can have identical bosonic field content but different fermionic extensions. Such twin theories are classified and shown to originate as truncations of a common theory with more supersymmetry. Moreover, we discuss the possible gaugings and scalar potentials of twin theories. This allows to pinpoint to which extent these structures are determined by the purely bosonic structure of the underlying Kac-Moody algebras and where supersymmetry comes to plays its role. As an example, we analyze the gaugings of the six-dimensional N=(0,1) and N=(2,1) theories with identical bosonic sector and explicitly work out their scalar potentials. The discrepancy between the potentials finds a natural explanation within maximal supergravity, in which both theories may be embedded.
