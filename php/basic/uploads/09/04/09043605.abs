Title: Magnetized configurations with black holes and Kaluza-Klein bubbles:  Smarr-like relations and first law
Authors: Stoytcho S. Yazadjiev and Petia G. Nedkova
Abstract: We present a general class of exact solutions in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity describing configurations of black holes and Kaluza-Klein bubbles magnetized along the compact dimension. Smarr-like relations for the mass and the tension are found. We also derive the mass and tension first law for the configurations under consideration using the Noether current approach. The solutions we consider are explicit examples showing that in Kaluza-Klein spacetimes the interval (rod) structure and the charges (which are zero by construction for the solutions here), are insufficient to classify the solutions and additional data is necessary, namely the magnetic flux(es).
