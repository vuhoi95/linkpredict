Title: The Cheshire Cat Principle from Holography
Authors: Holger Bech Nielsen and Ismail Zahed
Abstract: The Cheshire cat principle states that hadronic observables at low energy do not distinguish between hard (quark) or soft (meson) constituents. As a result, the delineation between hard/soft (bag radius) is like the Cheshire cat smile in Alice in wonderland. This principle reemerges from current holographic descriptions of chiral baryons whereby the smile appears in the holographic direction. We illustrate this point for the baryonic form factor.
