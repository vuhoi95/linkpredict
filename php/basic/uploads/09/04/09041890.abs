Abstract: We consider a scalar field interaction with a cosmic string configuration in a flat 3-brane. The origin of this field is given by a compactification mechanism in the context of a 5-dimensional Brans-Dicke theory. We use the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation constraint to analyse a possibility of optical activity effect in connection with the Brans-Dicke parameter w and obtain relations between the compactification modes. We show that the dilatons produced by a cosmic string can decay into gauge bosons with masses given by the compactification modes. The Brans- Dicke parameter w imposes stringent constraints on the mass of the dilaton which lives in the brane and help us to understand the energy scales. In this scenario we estimate the lifetime of the dilaton which decays into light gauge bosons and the dependence of this phenomenon with the Brans-Dicke parameter.
