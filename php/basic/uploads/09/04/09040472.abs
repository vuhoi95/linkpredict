Title: Generalised DBI-Quintessence
Authors: Burin Gumjudpai and John Ward
Abstract: We investigate the phase space of a quintessence theory governed by a generalised version of the DBI action, using a combination of numeric and analytic methods. The additional degrees of freedom lead to a vastly richer phase space structure, where the field covers the full equation of state parameter space; $-1 \le \omega \le 1$. We find many non-trivial solution curves to the equations of motion which indicate that DBI quintessence is an interesting candidate for a viable k-essence model.
