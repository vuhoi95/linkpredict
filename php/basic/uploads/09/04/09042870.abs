Title: Polarized Deep Inelastic and Elastic Scattering From Gauge/String  Duality
Authors: Jian-Hua Gao and Bo-Wen Xiao
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate deep inelastic and elastic scattering on a polarized spin-1/2 hadron using gauge/string duality. This spin-1/2 hadron corresponds to a supergravity mode of the dilatino. The polarized deep inelastic structure functions are computed in supergravity approximation at large t' Hooft coupling $\lambda$ and finite $x$ with $\lambda^{-1/2}\ll x<1$. Furthermore, we discuss the moments of all structure functions, and propose an interesting sum rule $\int_{0}^{1} \textrm{d}x g_2(x, q^2) =0$ for $g_2$ structure function which is known as the Burkhardt-Cottingham sum rule in QCD. In the end, the elastic scattering is studied and elastic form factors of the spin-1/2 hadron are calculated within the same framework.
