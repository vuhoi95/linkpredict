Title: Ricci Dark Energy in braneworld models with a Gauss-Bonnet term in the  bulk
Authors: Chao-Jun Feng and Xin-Zhou Li
Abstract: We investigate the Ricci Dark Energy (RDE) in the braneworld models with a Gauss-Bonnet term in the Bulk. We solve the generalized Friedmann equation on the brane analytically and find that the universe will finally enter into a pure de Sitter spacetime in stead of the big rip that appears in the usual 4D Ricci dark energy model with parameter $\alpha<1/2$. We also consider the Hubble horizon as the IR cutoff in holographic dark energy model and find it can not accelerate the universe as in the usual case without interacting.
