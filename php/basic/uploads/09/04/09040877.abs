Title: Dynamics of a scalar field in Robertson-Walker spacetimes
Authors: Edmund J. Copeland and Shuntaro Mizuno and Maryam Shaeri
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of a single scalar field in Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universes with spatial curvature. We obtain the fixed point solutions which are shown to be late time attractors. In particular, we determine the corresponding scalar field potentials which correspond to these stable solutions. The analysis is quite general and incorporates expanding and contracting universes with both positive and negative scalar potentials. We demonstrate that the known power law, exponential, and de-Sitter solutions are certain limits of our general set of solutions.
