Title: Shock Treatment: Heavy Quark Drag in a Novel AdS Geometry
Authors: W. A. Horowitz and Yuri V. Kovchegov
Abstract: We calculate the drag force on a heavy quark hit by a shock wave, thus generalizing the strongly coupled AdS/CFT heavy quark drag calculations to both hot and cold nuclear matter. The derivation employs the trailing string configuration, similar to that used in the literature for a quark moving through a thermal medium, though in the shock metric the string profile is described by a much simpler analytic function. Our expression for the drag depends on the typical transverse momentum scale of the matter in the shock. For a thermal medium this scale becomes proportional to the temperature, making our drag coefficient and momentum limit of applicability identical to those found previously. As the shock wave can be composed of either thermalized or non-thermalized media, our derivation extends the existing drag calculations to the case of arbitrarily distributed matter.
