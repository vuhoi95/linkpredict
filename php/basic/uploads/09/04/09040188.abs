Title: Charged seven-dimensional spacetimes with spherically symmetric  extra-dimensions
Authors: Antonio De Felice and Christophe Ringeval
Abstract: We derive exact solutions of the seven-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell equations for a spacetime exhibiting Poincare invariance along four-dimensions and spherical symmetry in the extra-dimensions. Such topology generically arises in the context of braneworld models. Our solutions generalise previous results on Ricci-flat spacetimes admitting the two-sphere and are shown to include wormhole configurations. A regular coordinate system suitable to describe the whole spacetime is singled-out and we discuss the physical relevance of the derived solutions.
