Title: Large non-Gaussianity generated after D-term Inflation by Right-Handed  Sneutrino Curvaton
Authors: Chia-Min Lin and Kingman Cheung
Abstract: In this paper, we consider large non-Gaussianity generated after D-term inflation in the case that the adiabatic curvature perturbation produced is dominated by a right-handed (RH) sneutrino curvaton. The cosmic string problem can also be evaded with around 10% contribution to the CMB power spectrum and the spectral index $n_s \simeq 1$. The non-Gaussianity produced can be as large as $10<f_{NL}<100$ for the right-handed sneutrino mass being around $m_\Phi=10 {GeV}$ with the Yukawa coupling $\lambda_\nu \sim 10^{-10}$. In this case, the lightest neutrino mass is $10^{-10}{eV}$ which favors RH sneutrino leptogenesis.
