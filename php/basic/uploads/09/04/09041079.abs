Title: Non-Commutativity, Teleology and GRB Time Delay
Authors: Miao Li and Yi Pang and Yi Wang
Abstract: We propose a model in which an energy-dependent time delay of a photon originates from space-time non-commutativity, the time delay is due to a noncommutative coupling between dilaton and photon. We predict that in our model, high energy photons with different momenta can either be delayed or superluminal, this may be related to a possible time delay reported by the Fermi LAT and Fermi GBM Collaborations.
