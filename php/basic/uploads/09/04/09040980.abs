Abstract: The effect of quantum particle production near the big rip singularity has been investigated previously, with the conclusion that the energy of the produced particle decreases as the future singularity is approached. Hence, the effect of particle production would not be effective to avoid the big rip singularity. That calculation was performed by introducing an ultra-violet cut-off. In the present work we consider a renormalization of the energy-momentum tensor, obtainning a different expression for the particle production. The new expression seems to indicate that the effect of particle production may be dominant as the singularity is approached.
