Title: Roberge-Weiss phase transition and its endpoint
Authors: Hiroaki Kouno and Yuji Sakai and Kouji Kashiwa and Masanobu Yahiro
Abstract: The Roberge-Weiss (RW) phase transition in the imaginary chemical potential region is analyzed by the Polyakov-loop extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model. In the RW phase transition, the charge-conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken, while the extended Z3 symmetry (the RW periodicity) is preserved. The RW transition is of second order at the endpoint. At the zero chemical potential, a crossover deconfinement transition appears as a remnant of the second-order RW phase transition at the endpoint, while the charge-conjugation symmetry is always preserved.
