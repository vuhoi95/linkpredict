Title: Quantum Tunneling in Flux Compactifications
Authors: Jose J. Blanco-Pillado and Delia Schwartz-Perlov and Alexander Vilenkin
Abstract: We identify instantons representing vacuum decay in a 6-dimensional toy model for string theory flux compactifications, with the two extra dimensions compactified on a sphere. We evaluate the instanton action for tunneling between different flux vacua, as well as for the decompactification decay channel. The bubbles resulting from flux tunneling have an unusual structure. They are bounded by two-dimensional branes, which are localized in the extra dimensions. This has important implications for bubble collisions.
