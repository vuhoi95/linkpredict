Title: Thermodynamic structure of Lanczos-Lovelock field equations from  near-horizon symmetries
Authors: Dawood Kothawala and T. Padmanabhan
Abstract: It is well known that, for a wide class of spacetimes with horizons, Einstein equations near the horizon can be written as a thermodynamic identity. It is also known that the Einstein tensor acquires a highly symmetric form near static, as well as stationary, horizons. We show that, for generic static spacetimes, this highly symmetric form of the Einstein tensor leads quite naturally and generically to the interpretation of the near-horizon field equations as a thermodynamic identity. We further extend this result to generic static spacetimes in Lanczos-Lovelock gravity, and show that the near-horizon field equations again represent a thermodynamic identity in all these models. These results confirm the conjecture that this thermodynamic perspective of gravity extends far beyond Einstein's theory.
