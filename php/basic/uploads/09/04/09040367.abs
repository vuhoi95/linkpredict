Title: Gauss-Bonnet Chameleon Mechanism of Dark Energy
Authors: Yusaku Ito and Shin'ichi Nojiri
Abstract: As a model of the current accelerated expansion of the universe, we consider a model of the scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. This model includes the propagating scalar modes, which might give a large correction to the Newton law. In order to avoid this problem, we propose an extension of the Chameleon mechanism where the scalar mode becomes massive due to the coupling with the Gauss-Bonnet term. Since the Gauss-Bonnet invariant does not vanish near the earth or in the Solar System, even in the vacuum, the scalar mode is massive even in the vacuum and the correction to the Newton law could be small. We also discuss about the possibility that the model could describe simultaneously the inflation in the early universe, in addition to the current accelerated expansion.
