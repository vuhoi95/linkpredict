Title: Anomalous conductivity in holographic QCD
Authors: Gilad Lifschytz and Matthew Lippert
Abstract: We compute the longitudinal and Hall conductivities in the parallel phase of the Sakai-Sugimoto model with a transverse magnetic field. We find that the conductivities behave as if the charge of the system is made out of two different types; one behaves as charge carriers flowing through a dissipative neutral medium, while the other does not feel the dissipation. We also investigate the case of an electric field parallel to the magnetic field and find that in this case the system behaves as a perfect conductor. Both of the unusual behaviors stem from the axial anomaly.
