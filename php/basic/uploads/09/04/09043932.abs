Title: F-theory Compactifications for Supersymmetric GUTs
Authors: Joseph Marsano and Natalia Saulina and Sakura Schafer-Nameki
Abstract: We construct a family of elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau four-folds Y_4 for F-theory compactifications that realize SU(5) GUTs in the low-energy limit. The three-fold base X_3 of these fibrations is almost Fano and satisfies the topological criteria required to ensure that the U(1)_Y gauge boson remains massless, while allowing a decoupling of GUT and Planck scale physics. We study generic features of these models and the ability to engineer three chiral generations of MSSM matter. Finally, we demonstrate that it is relatively easy to implement the topological conditions required to reproduce certain successful features of local F-theory models, such as the emergence of flavor hierarchies.
