Title: Dynamical supersymmetry breaking from unoriented D-brane instantons
Authors: Massimo Bianchi and Francesco Fucito and Jose F. Morales
Abstract: We study the non-perturbative dynamics of an unoriented Z_5-quiver theory of GUT kind with gauge group U(5) and chiral matter. At strong coupling the non-perturbative dynamics is described in terms of set of baryon/meson variables satisfying a quantum deformed constraint. We compute the effective superpotential of the theory and show that it admits a line of supersymmetric vacua and a phase where supersymmetry is dynamically broken via gaugino condensation.
