Title: The vacuum energy for two cylinders one of which becoming large
Authors: M. Bordag and V. Nikolaev
Abstract: We consider the vacuum energy for a configuration of two cylinders and obtain its asymptotic expansion if the radius of one of these cylinders becomes large while the radius of the other one and their separation are kept fixed. We calculate explicitly the next-to-leading order correction to the vacuum energy for the radius of the other cylinder becoming large or small.
