Title: Flavors in the microscopic approach to N=1 gauge theories
Authors: Frank Ferrari and Vincent Wens
Abstract: In this note, we solve an extended version of the N=1 super Yang-Mills theory with gauge group U(N), an adjoint chiral multiplet and Nf flavors of quarks, by using the N=1 microscopic formalism based on Nekrasov's sums over colored partitions. Our main new result is the computation of the general mesonic operators. We prove that the generalized Konishi anomaly equations with flavors are satisfied at the non-perturbative level. This yields in particular a microscopic, first principle derivation of the matrix model disk diagram contributions that must be included in the Dijkgraaf-Vafa approach.
