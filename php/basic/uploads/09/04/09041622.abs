Title: Hidden fine tuning in the quark sector of little higgs models
Authors: Benjam√≠n Grinstein and Randall Kelley and Patipan Uttayarat
Abstract: In little higgs models a collective symmetry prevents the higgs from acquiring a quadratically divergent mass at one loop. By considering first the littlest higgs model we show that this requires a fine tuning: the couplings in the model introduced to give the top quark a mass do not naturally respect the collective symmetry. We show the problem is generic: it arises from the fact that the would be collective symmetry of any one top quark mass term is broken by gauge interactions.
