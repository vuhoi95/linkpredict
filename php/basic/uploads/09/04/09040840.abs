Title: Abelian duality, walls and boundary conditions in diverse dimensions
Authors: Anton Kapustin and Mikhail Tikhonov
Abstract: We systematically apply the formalism of duality walls to study the action of duality transformations on boundary conditions and local and nonlocal operators in two, three, and four-dimensional free field theories. In particular, we construct a large class of D-branes for two-dimensional sigma-models with toroidal targets and determine the action of the T-duality group on it. It is manifest in this formalism that T-duality transformations on D-branes are given by a differential-geometric version of the Fourier-Mukai transform.
