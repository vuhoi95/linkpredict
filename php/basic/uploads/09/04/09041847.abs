Title: Chern-Simons: Fano and Calabi-Yau
Authors: Amihay Hanany and Yang-Hui He
Abstract: We present the complete classification of smooth toric Fano threefolds, known to the algebraic geometry literature, and perform some preliminary analyses in the context of brane-tilings and Chern-Simons theory on M2-branes probing Calabi-Yau fourfold singularities. We emphasise that these 18 spaces should be as intensely studied as their well-known counter-parts: the del Pezzo surfaces.
