Title: Tachyon Field in Intermediate Inflation
Authors: Sergio del Campo and Ramon Herrera and Adolfo Toloza
Abstract: The tachyonic inflationary universe model in the context of intermediate inflation is studied. General conditions for this model to be realizable are discussed. In the slow-roll approximation, we describe in great details the characteristics of this model.
