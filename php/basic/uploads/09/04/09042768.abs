Title: The Bogoliubov/de Gennes system, the AKNS hierarchy, and nonlinear  quantum mechanical supersymmetry
Authors: Francisco Correa and Gerald V. Dunne and Mikhail S. Plyushchay
Abstract: We show that the Ginzburg-Landau expansion of the grand potential for the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian is determined by the integrable nonlinear equations of the AKNS hierarchy, and that this provides the natural mathematical framework for a hidden nonlinear quantum mechanical supersymmetry underlying the dynamics.
