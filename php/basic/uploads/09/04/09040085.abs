Title: Absorption cross section in the topologically massive gravity at the  critical point
Authors: John J. Oh and Wontae Kim
Abstract: The absorption cross section for the the warped AdS$_3$ black hole background shows that it is larger than the area even if the s-wave limit is considered. It raises some question whether the deviation from the areal cross section is due to the warped configuration of the geometry or the rotating coordinate system, where these two effects are mixed up in the warped AdS$_3$ black hole. So, we study the low-frequency scattering dynamics of propagating scalar fields under the warped AdS$_3$ background at the critical point which reduces to the BTZ black hole in the rotating frame without the warped factor, which shows that the deformation effect at the critical point does not appear.
