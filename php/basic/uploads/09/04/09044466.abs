Title: The gravity duals of N=2 superconformal field theories
Authors: Davide Gaiotto and Juan Maldacena
Abstract: We study the gauge/gravity duality for theories with four dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetries. We consider the large class of generalized quiver field theories constructed recently by one of us (D.G.). These field theories can also be viewed as the IR limit of M5 branes wrapping a Riemann surface with punctures. We give a prescription for constructing the corresponding geometries and we discuss a few special cases in detail. There is a precise match for various quantities between the field theory and the M-theory description.
