Title: Hawking Radiation from an Acoustic Black Hole on an Ion Ring
Authors: Birger Horstmann and Benni Reznik and Serena Fagnocchi and J. Ignacio Cirac
Abstract: In this article we propose to simulate acoustic black holes with ions in rings. If the ions are rotating with a stationary and inhomogeneous velocity profile, regions can appear where the ion velocity exceeds the group velocity of the phonons. In these regions phonons are trapped like light in black holes, even though we have a discrete field theory and a nonlinear dispersion relation. We study the appearance of Hawking radiation in this setup and propose a scheme to detect it.
