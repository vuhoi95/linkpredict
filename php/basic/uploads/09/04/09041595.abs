Title: Solutions to Horava Gravity
Authors: H. Lu and Jianwei Mei and C. N. Pope
Abstract: Recently Horava proposed a non-relativistic renormalisable theory of gravitation, which reduces to Einstein's general relativity at large distances, and that may provide a candidate for a UV completion of Einstein's theory. In this paper, we derive the full set of equations of motion, and then we obtain spherically symmetric solutions and discuss their properties. We also obtain solutions for the Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmological metric.
