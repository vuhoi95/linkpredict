Title: Dyonic solution of Horava-Lifshitz Gravity
Authors: Eoin Ó Colgáin and Hossein Yavartanoo
Abstract: Recently proposed Horava-Lifshitz gravity promises a UV completion of Einstein's theory by sacrificing general covariance at short distances and introducing anisotropic spacetime scaling. Here we present a dyonic solution by coupling this theory to a vector field and we discuss some properties of solution.
