Title: Universality class of holographic superconductors
Authors: Kengo Maeda and Makoto Natsuume and Takashi Okamura
Abstract: We study "holographic superconductors" in various spacetime dimensions. We compute most of the static critical exponents in the linear perturbations and show that they take the standard mean-field values. We also consider the dynamic universality class for these models and show that they belong to model A with dynamic critical exponent z=2.
