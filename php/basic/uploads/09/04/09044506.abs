Title: More on N=8 Attractors
Authors: A. Ceresole and S. Ferrara and A. Gnecchi and A. Marrani
Abstract: We examine few simple extremal black hole configurations of N=8, d=4 supergravity. We first elucidate the relation between the BPS Reissner-Nordstrom black hole and the non-BPS Kaluza-Klein dyonic black hole. Their classical entropy, given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, can be reproduced via the attractor mechanism by suitable choices of symplectic frame. Then, we display the embedding of the axion-dilaton black hole into N=8 supergravity.
