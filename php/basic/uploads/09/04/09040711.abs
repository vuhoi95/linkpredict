Title: First Class Constrained Systems and Twisting of Courant Algebroids by a  Closed 4-form
Authors: Markus Hansen and Thomas Strobl
Abstract: We show that in analogy to the introduction of Poisson structures twisted by a closed 3-form by Park and Klimcik-Strobl, the study of three dimensional sigma models with Wess-Zumino term leads in a likewise way to twisting of Courant algebroid structures by closed 4-forms H. The presentation is kept pedagogical and accessible to physicists as well as to mathematicians, explaining in detail in particular the interplay of field transformations in a sigma model with the type of geometrical structures induced on a target. In fact, as we also show, even if one does not know the mathematical concept of a Courant algebroid, the study of a rather general class of 3-dimensional sigma models leads one to that notion by itself. Courant algebroids became of relevance for mathematical physics lately from several perspectives - like for example by means of using generalized complex structures in String Theory. One may expect that their twisting by the curvature H of some 3-form Ramond-Ramond gauge field will become of relevance as well.
