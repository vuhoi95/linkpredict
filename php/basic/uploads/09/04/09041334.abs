Title: Horava-Lifshitz Cosmology
Authors: Elias Kiritsis and Georgios Kofinas
Abstract: The cosmological equations suggested by the non-relativistic renormalizable gravitational theory proposed by Ho\v{r}ava are considered. It is pointed out that the early universe cosmology has features that may give an alternative to inflation and the theory may be able to escape singularities.
