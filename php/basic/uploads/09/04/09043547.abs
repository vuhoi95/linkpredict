Abstract: We consider extensions of the standard model based on open strings ending on D-branes, with gauge bosons due to strings attached to stacks of D-branes and chiral matter due to strings stretching between intersecting D-branes. Assuming that the fundamental string mass scale is in the TeV range and the theory is weakly coupled, we discuss possible signals of string physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In previous works, direct channel excitations of Regge recurrences in parton-parton scattering supplied the outstanding new signature. The present work considers the deviation from standard model expectations for the 4-fermion processes qq\to qq and qq' \to qq', in which the s-channel excitation of string resonances is absent. In this case, we find that Kaluza-Klein recurrences at masses somewhat less than the string scale generate effective 4-fermion contact terms which can significantly enhance the dijet R ratio above its QCD value of about 0.6. The simultaneous observation of a nearby resonant structure in the dijet mass spectrum would provide a "smoking gun" for TeV scale string theory. In this work, we also show that (1) for M_{string}<3.5 TeV, the rates for various topologies arising from the pp \to Z^0 + jet channel could deviate significantly from standard model predictions and (2) that the sizeable cross sections for Regge recurrences can allow a 6\sigma discovery for string scales as large as 3 TeV after about 1 year of LHC operation at \sqrt{s} =10 TeV and \int L dt ~ 100 pb^{-1}.
