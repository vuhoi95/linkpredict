Title: Meson Spectra and Magnetic Fields in the Sakai-Sugimoto Model
Authors: Clifford V. Johnson and Arnab Kundu
Abstract: We continue our study of the dynamics of the flavour sector of the Sakai-Sugimoto model in the presence of an external magnetic field, uncovering several features of the meson spectrum at high and low temperatures. We employ both analytical and numerical methods to study the coupled non-linear equations that result from the gravity dual.
