Title: Comments on Holography with Broken Lorentz Invariance
Authors: Ivan Gordeli and Peter Koroteev
Abstract: Recently a family of solutions of Einstein equations in backgrounds with broken Lorentz invariance was found ArXiv:0712.1136. We show that the gravitational solution recently obtained by Kachru, Liu and Mulligan in ArXiv:0808.1725 is a part of the former solution which was derived earlier in the framework of extra dimensional theories. We show how the energy-momentum and Einstein tensors are related and establish a correspondence between parameters which govern Lorentz invariance violation. Then we demonstrate that scaling behavior of two point correlation functions of local operators in scalar field theory is reproduced correctly for two cases with critical values of scaling parameters. Therefore, we complete the dictionary of "tree-level" duality for all known solutions of the bulk theory. In the end we speculate on relations between RG flow of a boundary theory and asymptotic behavior of gravitational solutions in the bulk.
