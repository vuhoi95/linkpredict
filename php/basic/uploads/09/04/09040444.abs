Title: S-duality and the giant magnon dispersion relation
Authors: David Berenstein and Diego Trancanelli
Abstract: We use S-duality and planarity to propose an argument for the non-renormalization of the dispersion relation of giant magnon solutions in type IIB string theory on AdS_5 x S^5. We compute the spectrum of giant magnons for (p,q)-strings from field theory at strong coupling by using the central charge properties of electrically and magnetically charged supersymmetric states in the Coulomb branch of N=4 super Yang-Mills. We argue that the coupling dependence of the giant magnon dispersion relation conjectured in the literature using integrability assumptions is in fact the only functional dependence compatible with S-duality.
