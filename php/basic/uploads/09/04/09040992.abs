Title: Darboux transformation for a general Dirac equation in two dimensions
Authors: Ekaterina Pozdeeva and Axel Schulze-Halberg
Abstract: We construct explicit Darboux transformations for a generalized, two-dimensional Dirac equation. Our results contain former findings for the one-dimensional, stationary Dirac equation, as well as for the fully time-dependent case in (1+1) dimensions. We show that our Darboux transformations are applicable to the two-dimensional Dirac equation in cylindrical coordinates and give several examples.
