Title: Five-Dimensional Black Hole String Backgrounds and Brane Universe  Acceleration
Authors: C. Chiou-Lahanas and G. A. Diamandis and B. C. Georgalas
Abstract: We examine background solutions of black hole type arising from the string effective action in five dimensions. We derive the unique metric - dilaton vacuum which is a Schwarzschild type black hole. It is found that it can be extended to incorporate electric charge without changing the topology of the three space. Kalb-Ramond charge may also be introduced if the three space is closed. The basic features of the cosmology induced on a three brane evolving in this background are also discussed.
