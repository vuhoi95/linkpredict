Title: CP Violation and F-theory GUTs
Authors: Jonathan J. Heckman and Cumrun Vafa
Abstract: Recent work on F-theory GUTs has shown that the predicted masses, and magnitudes of the mixing matrix elements in the quark and lepton sectors are in close accord with experiment. In this note we estimate the CP violating phase of the mixing matrices by considering the Jarlskog invariant. We find by carefully treating certain cancellations in the computation of the Jarlskog invariant that |J_quark| ~ alpha_GUT^(3) ~ 6*10^(-5), and that the CP violating phase of the quark sector is large, in accord with experiment. Moreover, we predict (up to order one factors) that |J_lepton| ~ alpha_GUT ~ 4*10^(-2) and that the CP violating phase of the lepton sector is also large.
