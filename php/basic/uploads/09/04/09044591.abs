Title: Cosmic strings interacting with dark strings
Authors: Betti Hartmann and Farhad Arbabzadah
Abstract: Motivated by astrophysical observations of excess electronic production in the galaxy, new theoretical models of the dark matter sector have been proposed in which the Standard model couples to the dark matter sector through an attractive interaction. The coupling of the Standard model to "dark strings", which are solutions of the low energy dark sector has been investigated recently. Here, we discuss the interaction between dark strings and standard cosmic strings and show that they can form bound states. In the presence of the interaction term, a Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bound exists that depends on the interaction parameter and we observe that the attractive interaction between dark strings and cosmic strings is most efficient if the two strings are identical. Moreover, our model allows for dark string solution that can lower their energy by coupling to an electromagnetic field. We also investigate the gravitational properties of these solutions and show that they become supermassive with a singular space-time for values of the gravitational coupling larger as compared to the non-interacting case. Moreover, the deficit angle of the solutions decreases with increasing interaction.
