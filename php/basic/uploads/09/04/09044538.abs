Title: Central Charges in 2d Reduced Cosmological Massive Gravity
Authors: Wontae Kim and Edwin J. Son
Abstract: In the dimensionally reduced model of the 2+1 dimensional cosmological massive gravity, we obtain the central charges of the two types of the black hole based on the entropy function method. One is for the BTZ black hole and the other one is actually for the warped AdS$_3$ black hole.
