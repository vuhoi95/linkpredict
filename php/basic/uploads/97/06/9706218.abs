Title: The Quantum Geometry of N=(2,2) Non-Linear Sigma-Models
Authors: M. T. Grisaru and M. Massar and A. Sevrin and J. Troost
Abstract: We consider a general N=(2,2) non-linear sigma-model in (2,2) superspace. Depending on the details of the complex structures involved, an off-shell description can be given in terms of chiral, twisted chiral and semi-chiral superfields. Using superspace techniques, we derive the conditions the potential has to satisfy in order to be ultra-violet finite at one loop. We pay particular attention to the effects due to the presence of semi-chiral superfields. A complete description of N=(2,2) strings follows from this.
