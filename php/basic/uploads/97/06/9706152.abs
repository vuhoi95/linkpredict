Title: On possible generalization of the superstring action to eleven  dimensions
Authors: A. A. Deriglazov and A. V. Galajinsky
Abstract: We suggest a D=11 super Poincar\'e invariant action for the superstring which has free dynamics in the physical variables sector. Instead of the standard approach based on the searching for an action with local $\kappa$-symmetry (or, equivalently, with corresponding first class constraints), we propose a theory with fermionic constraints of second class only. Then the $\kappa$-symmetry and the well known $\Gamma$-matrix identities are not necessary for the construction. Thus, at the classical level, the superstring action of the type described can exist in any spacetime dimensions and the known brane-scan can be revisited.
