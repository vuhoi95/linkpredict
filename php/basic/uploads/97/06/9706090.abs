Title: On the Stability of Compactified D=11 Supermembranes
Authors: I. Martin and A. Restuccia and R. Torrealba
Abstract: We prove D=11 supermembrane theories wrapping around in an irreducible way over $S^{1} \times S^{1}\times M^{9}$ on the target manifold, have a hamiltonian with strict minima and without infinite dimensional valleys at the minima for the bosonic sector. The minima occur at monopole connections of an associated U(1) bundle over topologically non trivial Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus. Explicit expressions for the minimal connections in terms of membrane maps are presented. The minimal maps and corresponding connections satisfy the BPS condition with half SUSY.
