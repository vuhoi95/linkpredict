Title: On axioms for a vertex algebra and the locality of quantum fields
Authors: Atsushi Matsuo and Kiyokazu Nagatomo
Abstract: The identities satisfied by two-dimensional chiral quantum fields are studied from the point of view of vertex algebras. The Cauchy-Jacobi identity (or the Borcherds identity) for three mutually local fields is proved and consequently a direct proof of Li's theorem on a local system of vertex operators is provided. Several characterizations of vertex algebras are also discussed.
