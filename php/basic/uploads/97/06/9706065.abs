Title: Chaos in the Einstein-Yang-Mills Equations
Authors: John D. Barrow and Janna Levin
Abstract: Yang-Mills color fields evolve chaotically in an anisotropically expanding universe. The chaotic behaviour differs from that found in anisotropic Mixmaster universes. The universe isotropizes at late times, approaching the mean expansion rate of a radiation-dominated universe. However, small chaotic oscillations of the shear and color stresses continue indefinitely. An invariant, coordinate-independent characterisation of the chaos is provided by means of fractal basin boundaries.
