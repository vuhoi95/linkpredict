Title: Higher Order Graviton Scattering in M(atrix) Theory
Authors: K. Becker and M. Becker and J. Polchinski and A. Tseytlin
Abstract: In matrix theory the effective action for graviton-graviton scattering is a double expansion in the relative velocity and inverse separation. We discuss the systematics of this expansion and subject matrix theory to a new test. Low energy supergravity predicts the coefficient of the $v^6/r^{14}$ term, a two-loop effect, in agreement with explicit matrix model calculation.
