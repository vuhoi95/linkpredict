Title: Supersymmetric quantum theory, non-commutative geometry, and  gravitation. Lecture Notes Les Houches 1995
Authors: J. Froehlich and O. Grandjean and A. Recknagel
Abstract: This is an expanded version of the notes to a course taught by the first author at the 1995 Les Houches Summer School. Constraints on a tentative reconciliation of quantum theory and general relativity are reviewed. It is explained what supersymmetric quantum theory teaches us about differential topology and geometry. Non-commutative differential topology and geometry are developed in some detail. As an example, the non-commutative torus is studied. An introduction to string theory and $M$(atrix) models is provided, and it is outlined how tools of non-commutative geometry can be used to explore the geometry of string theory and conformal field theory.
