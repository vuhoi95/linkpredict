Title: Manifestly Gauge Covariant Treatment of Lattice Chiral Fermions. II
Authors: Kiyoshi Okuyama and Hiroshi Suzuki
Abstract: We propose a new formulation of chiral fermions on a lattice, on the basis of a lattice extension of the covariant regularization scheme in continuum field theory. The species doublers do not emerge. The real part of the effective action is just one half of that of Dirac-Wilson fermion and is always gauge invariant even with a finite lattice spacing. The gauge invariance of the imaginary part, on the other hand, sets a severe constraint which is a lattice analogue of the gauge anomaly free condition. For real gauge representations, the imaginary part identically vanishes and the gauge invariance becomes exact.
