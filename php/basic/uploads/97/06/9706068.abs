Title: On Quantum Corrections to Chern-Simons Spinor Electrodynamics
Authors: M. Chaichian and W. F. Chen and V. Ya. Fainberg
Abstract: We make a detailed investigation on the quantum corrections to Chern-Simons spinor electrodynamics. Starting from Chern-Simons spinor quantum electrodynamics with the Maxwell term $-1/(4\gamma){\int}d^3x F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$ and by calculating the vacuum polarization tensor, electron self-energy and on-shell vertex, we explicitly show that the Ward identity is satisfied and hence verify that the physical quantities are independent of the procedure of taking ${\gamma}{\to}{\infty}$ at one-loop and tree levels. In particular, we find the three-dimensional analogue of the Schwinger anomalous magnetic moment term of the electron produced from the quantum corrections.
