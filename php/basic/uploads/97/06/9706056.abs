Title: Group analysis and renormgroup symmetries
Authors: V. F. Kovalev and V. V. Pustovalov and D. V. Shirkov
Abstract: An original regular approach to constructing special type symmetries for boundary value problems, namely renormgroup symmetries, is presented. Different methods of calculating these symmetries, based on modern group analysis are described. Application of the approach to boundary value problems is demonstrated with the help of a simple mathematical model.
