Title: Phase structure of four-dimensional gonihedric spin system
Authors: G. Koutsoumbas and G. K. Savvidy and K. G. Savvidy
Abstract: We perform Monte Carlo simulations of a gauge invariant spin system which describes random surfaces with gonihedric action in four dimensions. The Hamiltonian is a mixture of one-plaquette and additional two- and three-plaquette interaction terms with specially adjusted coupling constants. For the system with the large self-intersection coupling constant $k$ we observe the second-order phase transition at temperature $\beta_{c}\simeq 1.75$. The string tension is generated by quantum fluctuations as it was expected theoretically. This result suggests the existence of a noncritical string in four dimensions. For smaller values of $k$ the system undergoes the first order phase transition and for $k$ close to zero exhibits a smooth crossover.
