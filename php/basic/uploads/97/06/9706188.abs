Title: Non-relativistic Maxwell-Chern-Simons Vortices
Authors: M. Hassaïne and P. A. Horváthy and J. -C. Yera
Abstract: The non-relativistic Maxwell-Chern-Simons model recently introduced by Manton is shown to admit self-dual vortex solutions with non-zero electric field. The interrelated ``geometric'' and ``hidden'' symmetries are explained. The theory is also extended to (non-relativistic) spinors. A relativistic, self-dual model, whose non-relativistic limit is the Manton model is also presented. The relation to previous work is discussed.
