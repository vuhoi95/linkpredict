Title: Exactly and Quasi-Exactly Solvable Models on the Basis of $osp(2|1)$
Authors: A. Shafiekhani and M. Khorrami
Abstract: The exactly and quasi-exactly solvable problems for spin one-half in one dimension on the basis of a hidden dynamical symmetry algebra of Hamiltonian are discussed. We take the supergroup, $OSP(2|1)$, as such a symmetry. A number of exactly solvable examples are considered and their spectrum are evaluated explicitly. Also, a class of quasi-exactly solvable problems on the basis of such a symmetry has been obtained.
