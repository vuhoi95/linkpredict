Title: Interaction of moving D-branes on orbifolds
Authors: Faheem Hussain and Roberto Iengo and Carmen Núñez and Claudio A. Scrucca
Abstract: We use the boundary state formalism to study the interaction of two moving identical D-branes in the Type II superstring theory compactified on orbifolds. By computing the velocity dependence of the amplitude in the limit of large separation we can identify the nature of the different forces between the branes. In particular, in the Z_3 orbifold case we find a boundary state which is coupled only to the N=2 graviton multiplet containing just a graviton and a vector like in the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m configuration. We also discuss other cases including $T_4/Z_2$.
