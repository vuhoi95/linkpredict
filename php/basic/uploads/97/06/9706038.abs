Title: Interaction of boundaries with heterogeneous matter states in matrix  models
Authors: Masahiro Anazawa and Atushi Ishikawa and Hirokazu Tanaka
Abstract: We study disk amplitudes whose boundary conditions on matter configurations are not restricted to homogeneous ones. They are examined in the two-matrix model as well as in the three-matrix model for the case of the tricritical Ising model. Comparing these amplitudes, we demonstrate relations between degrees of freedom of matter states in the two models. We also show that they have a simple geometrical interpretation in terms of interactions of the boundaries. It plays an important role that two parts of a boundary with different matter states stick each other. We also find two closed sets of Schwinger-Dyson equations which determine disk amplitudes in the three-matrix model.
