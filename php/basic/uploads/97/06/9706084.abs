Title: Regge Behaviour from an Environmentally Friendly Renormalization Group
Authors: C. R. Stephens and J. C. Lopez Vieyra and A. Weber and P. O. Hess
Abstract: The asymptotic behaviour of cubic field theories is investigated in the Regge limit using the techniques of environmentally friendly renormalization, environmentally friendly in the present context meaning asymmetric in its momentum dependence. In particular we consider the crossover between large and small energies at fixed momentum transfer for a model scalar theory of the type phi^2 psi. The asymptotic forms of the crossover scaling functions are exhibited for all two particle scattering processes in this channel to one loop in a renormalization group improved perturbation theory.
