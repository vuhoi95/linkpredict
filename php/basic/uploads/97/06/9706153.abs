Title: Towards the Classification of Non-Marginal Bound States of M-branes and  Their Construction Rules
Authors: Nobuyoshi Ohta and Jian-Ge Zhou
Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of possible bound states of M-brane solutions (including waves and monopoles) by using the solution generating technique of reduction of M-brane to 10 dimensions, use of T-duality and then lifting back to 11 dimensions. We summarize a list of bound states for one- and two-charge cases including tilted brane solutions. Construction rules for these non-marginal solutions are also discussed.
