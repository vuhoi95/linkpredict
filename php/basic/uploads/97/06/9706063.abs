Title: Grassmann manifold Bosonization of QCD in Two Dimensions
Authors: KyoungHo Han and H. J. Shin
Abstract: Two dimensional QCD is bosonized to be an integrably deformed Wess-Zumino-Witten model under proper limit. Fermions are identified having indices of the Grassmann manifold. Conditions for integrability are analyzed and their physical meanings are discussed. We also address the nature of the exactly solvable part of the theory and find the infinitely many conserved quantities.
