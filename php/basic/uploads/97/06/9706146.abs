Title: Knots and Matrix Models
Authors: I. Ya. Arefeva and I. V. Volovich
Abstract: We consider a matrix model with d matrices NxN and show that in the limit of large N and d=0 the model describes the knot diagrams. The same limit in matrix string theory is also discussed. We speculate that a prototypical M(atrix) without matrix theory exists in void.
