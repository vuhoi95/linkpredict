Title: The Seiberg-Witten Differential From M-Theory
Authors: Ansar Fayyazuddin and Michael Spalinski
Abstract: The form of the Seiberg-Witten differential is derived from the M-theory approach to N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories by directly imposing the BPS condition for twobranes ending on fivebranes. The BPS condition also implies that the pullback of the Kahler form onto the space part of the twobrane world-volume vanishes.
