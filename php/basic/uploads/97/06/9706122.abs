Title: On the classification of (2,1) heterotic strings
Authors: E. Rabinovici and A. N. Schellekens
Abstract: We classify all untwisted (2,1) heterotic strings. The only solutions are the three already known cases, having massless spectra consisting either of 24 chiral fermions, or of 24 bosons, or of 8 scalars and 8 fermions of each chirality.
