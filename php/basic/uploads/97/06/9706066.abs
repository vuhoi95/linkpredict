Title: Singular Regions in Black Hole Solutions in Higher Order Curvature  Gravity
Authors: S. O. Alexeyev and M. V. Pomazanov
Abstract: Four-dimensional black hole solutions generated by the low energy string effective action are investigated outside and inside the event horizon. A restriction for a minimal black hole size is obtained in the frame of the model discussed. Intersections, turning points and other singular points of the solution are investigated. It is shown that the position and the behavior of these particular points are definded by various kinds of zeros of the main system determinant. Some new aspects of the $r_s$ singularity are discussed.
