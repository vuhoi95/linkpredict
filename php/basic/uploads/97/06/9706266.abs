Title: How to kick a soliton ?
Authors: J. Dziarmaga and W. Zakrzewski
Abstract: A simple method how to study response of solitons in dissipative systems to external impulsive perturbations is developed. Thanks to nontrivial choice of small parameter, the perturbative scheme captures genuine nonlinear phenomena. The method is developed and tested by numerical simulations for kinks in 1+1 dimensions and for skyrmions in 2+1 dimensions. Extension to models including second order time derivatives is discussed.
