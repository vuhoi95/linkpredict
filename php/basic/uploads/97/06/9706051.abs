Title: Vacuum Fluctuations and Decoherence in Mesoscopic and Microscopic  Systems
Authors: John Ellis and N. E. Mavromatos and D. V. Nanopoulos
Abstract: We discuss recent experimental evidence of decoherence in a laboratory mesoscopic system in a cavity, from which we draw analogies with the decoherence that we argue is induced by microscopic quantum-gravity fluctuations in the space-time background. We emphasize the parallel r\^oles played in both cases by dissipation through non-trivial vacuum fluctuations that trigger the collapse of an initially coherent quantum state. We review a phenomenological parametrization of possible effects of this kind in the neutral kaon system, where they would induce CPT violation, and describe some epxerimental tests.
