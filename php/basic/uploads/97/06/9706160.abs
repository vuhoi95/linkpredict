Title: BRST Symmetries for the Tangent Gauge Group
Authors: A. S. Cattaneo and P. Cotta-Ramusino and M. Rinaldi
Abstract: For any principal bundle $P$, one can consider the subspace of the space of connections on its tangent bundle $TP$ given by the tangent bundle $T{\cal A}$ of the space of connections ${\cal A}$ on $P$. The tangent gauge group acts freely on $T{\cal A}$. Appropriate BRST operators are introduced for quantum field theories that include as fields elements of $T{\cal A}$, as well as tangent vectors to the space of curvatures. As the simplest application, the BRST symmetry of the so-called $BF$-Yang-Mills theory is described and the relevant gauge fixing conditions are analyzed. A brief account on the topological $BF$ theories is also included and the relevant Batalin-Vilkovisky operator is described.
