Title: Universality of hypercubic random surfaces
Authors: S. Bilke and Z. Burda and B. Petersson
Abstract: We study universality properties of the Weingarten hyper-cubic random surfaces. Since a long time ago the model with a local restriction forbidding surface self-bendings has been thought to be in a different universality class from the unrestricted model defined on the full set of surfaces. We show that both models in fact belong to the same universality class with the entropy exponent gamma = 1/2 and differ by finite size effects which are much more pronounced in the restricted model.
