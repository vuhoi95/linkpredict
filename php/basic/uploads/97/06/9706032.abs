Title: Supersymmetric Solutions in Three-Dimensional Heterotic String Theory
Authors: Ioannis Bakas and Michele Bourdeau and Gabriel Lopes Cardoso
Abstract: We consider the low-energy effective field theory of heterotic string theory compactified on a seven-torus, and we construct electrically charged as well as more general solitonic solutions. These solutions preserve 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 of N=8, D=3 supersymmetry and have Killing spinors which exist due to cancellation of holonomies. The associated space-time line elements do not exhibit the conical structure that often arises in 2+1 dimensional gravity theories.
