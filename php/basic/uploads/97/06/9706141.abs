Title: BPS-Saturated Walls in Supersymmetric Theories
Authors: B. Chibisov and M. Shifman
Abstract: Domain-wall solutions in four-dimensional supersymmetric field theories with distinct discrete vacuum states lead to the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry, either completely or partially. We consider in detail the case when the domain walls are the BPS-saturated states, and 1/2 of supersymmetry is preserved. Several useful criteria that relate the preservation of 1/2 of supersymmetry on the domain walls to the central extension appearing in the N=1 superalgebras are established. We explain how the central extension can appear in N=1 supersymmetry and explicitly obtain the central charge in various models: the generalized Wess-Zumino models, and supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories with or without matter. The BPS-saturated domain walls satisfy the first-order differential equations which we call the creek equations, since they formally coincide with the (complexified) equations of motion of an analog high-viscosity fluid on a profile which is given by the superpotential of the original problem. Some possible applications are considered.
