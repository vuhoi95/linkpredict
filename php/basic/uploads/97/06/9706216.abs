Title: A Two-Form Formulation of the Vector-Tensor Multiplet in Central Charge  Superspace
Authors: Ioseph Buchbinder and Ahmed Hindawi and Burt A. Ovrut
Abstract: A two-form formulation for the N=2 vector-tensor multiplet is constructed using superfield methods in central charge superspace. The N=2 non-Abelian standard supergauge multiplet in central charge superspace is also discussed, as is with the associated Chern-Simons form. We give the constraints, solve the Bianchi identities and present the action for a theory of the vector-tensor multiplet coupled to the non-Abelian supergauge multiplet via the Chern-Simons form.
