Title: Duality and asymptotic geometries
Authors: H. J. Boonstra and B. Peeters and K. Skenderis
Abstract: We consider a series of duality transformations that leads to a constant shift in the harmonic functions appearing in the description of a configuration of branes. This way, for several intersections of branes, we can relate the original brane configuration which is asymptotically flat to a geometry of the type $adS_k \xx E^l \xx S^m$. The implications of our results for supersymmetry enhancement, M(atrix) theory at finite N, and for supergravity theories in diverse dimensions are discussed.
