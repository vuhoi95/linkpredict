Title: Noncommutative Yang-Mills and Noncommutative Relativity: A Bridge Over  Trouble Water
Authors: Lionel Carminati and Bruno Iochum and Thomas Schucker
Abstract: Connes' view at Yang-Mills theories is reviewed with special emphasis on the gauge invariant scalar product. This landscape is shown to contain Chamseddine and Connes' noncommutative extension of general relativity restricted to flat space-time, if the top mass is between 172 and 204 GeV. Then the Higgs mass is between 188 and 201 GeV.
