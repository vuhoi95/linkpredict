Title: Greybody factors for rotating black holes in four dimensions
Authors: Mirjam Cvetic and Finn Larsen
Abstract: We present the wave equation for a minimally coupled scalar field in the background of a rotating four-dimensional black hole that is parametrized by its mass, angular momentum, and four independent U(1) charges. The near horizon structure is identical to the five-dimensional case, and suggestive of an underlying description in string theory that is valid in the general non-extremal case. We calculate the greybody factors for the Hawking radiation. For sufficiently large partial wave number the emission spectrum can be calculated for general non-extremal black holes and any particle energy. We interpret this spectrum in terms of a multi-body process in an effective string theory.
