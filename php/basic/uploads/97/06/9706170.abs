Title: Magnetic solutions to 2+1 dimensional gravity with dilaton field
Authors: Takao Koikawa and Takuya Maki and Atsushi Nakamula
Abstract: We show a general method to solve 2+1 dimensional dilatonic Maxwell-Einstein equation with a positive or negative cosmological constant. All the physical solutions are listed with assumptions that they are static, rotationally symmetric, and has a nonzero magnetic field and a nonzero dilaton field. On the contrary to the magnetic solution without a dilaton field, some of the present solutions with a dilaton field possess a horizon.
