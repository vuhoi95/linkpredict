Title: Monads, Strings, and M Theory
Authors: Christiaan Hofman and Jae-Suk Park
Abstract: The recent developments in string theory suggest that the space-time coordinates should be generalized to non-commuting matrices. Postulating this suggestion as the fundamental geometrical principle, we formulate a candidate for covariant second quantized RNS superstrings as a topological field theory in two dimensions. Our construction is a natural non-Abelian extension of the RNS string. It also naturally leads to a model with manifest 11-dimensional covariance, which we conjecture to be a formulation of M theory. The non-commuting space-time coordinates of the strings are further generalized to non-commuting anti-symmetric tensors. The usual space-time picture and the free superstrings appear only in certain special phases of the model. We derive a simple set of algebraic equations, which determine the moduli space of our model. We test some aspects of our conjectual M theory for the case of compactification on $T^2$.
