Title: Massive IIA supergravity from the topologically massive D-2-brane
Authors: E. Bergshoeff and P. M. Cowdall and P. K. Townsend
Abstract: The superfield equations of massive IIA supergravity, in the form of constraints on the superspace geometry, are shown to be implied by $\kappa$-symmetry of the topologically massive D-2-brane.
