Title: Gravitational excitons from extra dimensions
Authors: U. Guenther and A. Zhuk
Abstract: Inhomogeneous multidimensional cosmological models with a higher dimensional space-time manifold are investigated under dimensional reduction. In the Einstein conformal frame, small excitations of the scale factors of the internal spaces near minima of an effective potential have a form of massive scalar fields in the external space-time. Parameters of models which ensure minima of the effective potentials are obtained for particular cases and masses of gravitational excitons are estimated.
