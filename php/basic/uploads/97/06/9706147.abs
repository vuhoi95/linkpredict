Title: The Riemann-Hilbert problem associated with the quantum Nonlinear  Schrodinger equation
Authors: V. E. Korepin and N. A. Slavnov
Abstract: We consider the dynamical correlation functions of the quantum Nonlinear Schrodinger equation. In a previous paper we found that the dynamical correlation functions can be described by the vacuum expectation value of an operator-valued Fredholm determinant. In this paper we show that a Riemann-Hilbert problem can be associated with this Fredholm determinant. This Riemann-Hilbert problem formulation permits us to write down completely integrable equations for the Fredholm determinant and to perform an asymptotic analysis for the correlation function.
