Title: Yukawa Unification in Moduli-dominant SUSY Breaking
Authors: Shaaban Khalil and Tatsuo Kobayashi
Abstract: We study Yukawa unification in string models with moduli-dominant SUSY breaking. This type of SUSY breaking in general leads to non-universal soft masses, i.e., soft scalar masses and gaugino masses. Such non-universality is important for phenomenological aspects of Yukawa unification, i.e., successful electroweak breaking, SUSY corrections to the bottom mass and the branching ratio of $b \to s \gamma$. We show three regions in the whole parameter space which lead to successful electroweak breaking and allow small SUSY corrections to the bottom mass. For these three regions we investigate the $b \to s \gamma$ decay and mass spectra.
