Title: Moving Frames Hierarchy and BF Theory
Authors: Jyh-Hao Lee and Oktay K. Pashaev
Abstract: We show that the one-dimensional projection of Chern-Simons gauged Nonlinear Schrodinger model is equivalent to an Abelian gauge field theory of continuum Heisenberg spin chain. In such a theory, the matter field has geometrical meaning of coordinates in tangent plane to the spin phase space, while the U(1) gauge symmetry relates to rotation in the plane. This allows us to construct the infinite hierarchy of integrable gauge theories and corresponding magnetic models. To each of them a U(1) invariant gauge fixing constraint of non-Abelian BF theory is derived. The corresponding moving frames hierarchy is obtained and the spectral parameter is interpreted as a constant-valued statistical gauge potential constrained by the 1-cocycle condition.
