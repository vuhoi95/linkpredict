Title: Domain Walls in Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theories
Authors: A. Kovner and M. Shifman and A. Smilga
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the domain walls in supersymmetric gluodynamics and SQCD. We use the (corrected) Veneziano-Yankielowicz effective Lagrangians to explicitely obtain the wall profiles and check recent results of Dvali and Shifman (Phys. Lett. B396, (1997) 64: (i) the BPS-saturated nature of the walls; (ii) the exact expressions for the wall energy density which depend only on global features of dynamics (the existence of a non-trivial central extension of N=1 superalgebra in the theories which admit wall-like solutions). If supersymmetry is softly broken by the gluino mass, the degeneracy of the distinct vacua is gone, and one can consider the decay rate of the "false" vacuum into the genuine one. We do this calculation in the limit of the small gluino mass. Finally, we comment on the controversy regarding the existence of $N$ distinct chirally asymmetric vacua in SU(N) SUSY gluodynamics.
