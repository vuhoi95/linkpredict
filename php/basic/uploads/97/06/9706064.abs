Title: Composite Skyrme Model with Vector Mesons
Authors: Kwanghoon Hahm and KyoungHo Han and H. J. Shin
Abstract: We study the composite Skyrme model, proposed by Cheung and G\"{u}rsey, introducing vector mesons in a chiral Lagrangian. We calculate the static properties of baryons and compare with results obtained from models without vector mesons.
