Title: Moduli Space Dynamics of a First-Order Vortex System
Authors: Dongsu Bak and Hyuk-jae Lee
Abstract: The moduli space dynamics of vortices in the Jackiw-Pi model where a non-relativistic Schrodinger field couples minimally to Chern-Simons gauge field, is considered. It is shown that the difficulties in direct application of Manton's method to obtain a moduli-space metric in the first order system can be circumvented by turning the Lagrangian into a second order system. We obtain exact metrics for some simple cases and describe how the vortices respond to an external U(1) field. We then construct an effective Lagrangian describing dynamics of the vortices. In addition, we clarify strong-weak coupling duality between fundamental particles and vortices.
