Title: Domain Ribbons Inside Domain Walls at Finite Temperature
Authors: F. A. Brito and D. Bazeia
Abstract: In this paper we deal with defects inside defects in systems of two scalar fields in 3+1 dimensions. The systems we consider are defined by potentials containing two real scalar fields, and so we are going to investigate domain ribbons inside domain walls. After introducing some general comments on the possibility of finding defects that support internal structure in two specific systems, we introduce thermal effects to show how the picture for domain walls hosting domain ribbons appears at high temperature.
