Title: Product Einstein Manifolds, Zeta-Function Regularization and the  Multiplicative Anomaly
Authors: A. A. Bytsenko and F. L. Williams
Abstract: The global additive and multiplicative properties of Laplace type operators acting on irreducible rank 1 symmetric spaces are considered. The explicit form of the zeta function on product spaces and of the multiplicative anomaly is derived.
