Title: Chiral Determinant Formulae and Subsingular Vectors for the N=2  Superconformal Algebras
Authors: Beatriz Gato-Rivera and Jose Ignacio Rosado
Abstract: We derive conjectures for the N=2 "chiral" determinant formulae of the Topological algebra, the Antiperiodic NS algebra, and the Periodic R algebra, corresponding to incomplete Verma modules built on chiral topological primaries, chiral and antichiral NS primaries, and Ramond ground states, respectively. Our method is based on the analysis of the singular vectors in chiral Verma modules and their spectral flow symmetries, together with some computer exploration and some consistency checks. In addition, and as a consequence, we uncover the existence of subsingular vectors in these algebras, giving examples (subsingular vectors are non-highest-weight null vectors which are not descendants of any highest-weight singular vectors).
