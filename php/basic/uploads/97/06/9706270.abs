Title: Scaling limit of the one-dimensional attractive Hubbard model: The  half-filled band case
Authors: F. Woynarovich and P. Forgacs
Abstract: The scaling limit of the higher level Bethe Ansatz (HLBA) equations for a macroscopically half-filled Hubbard chain is considered. These equations practically decouple into three disjoint sets which are again of the BA type, and correspond to the secular equations of three different kinds of dressed particles (one massive and two massless). The finite size corrections and the fine structure of the spectrum show that the massless sector corresponds to a conformal field with central charge c=1 and Gaussian anomalous dimensions. The zero temperature free energy is also calculated and is found to be in perfect agreement with the results of a perturbative calculation in the SU(2) chiral Gross-Neveu (CGN) model.
