Title: kappa-Deformed Covariant Phase Space and Quantum-Gravity Uncertainty  Relations
Authors: Giovanni Amelino-Camelia and Jerzy Lukierski and Anatol Nowicki
Abstract: We describe the deformed covariant phase space corresponding to the so-called kappa-deformation of D=4 relativistic symmetries, with quantum ``time'' coordinate and Heisenberg algebra obtained according to the Heisenberg double construction. The associated modified uncertainty relations are analyzed, and in particular it is shown that these relations are consistent with independent estimates of quantum-gravity limitations on the measurability of space-time distances.
