Title: Branes, central charges and U-duality invariant BPS conditions
Authors: Sergio Ferrara and Juan M. Maldacena
Abstract: In extended supergravity theories there are $p$-brane solutions preserving different numbers of supersymmetries, depending on the charges, the spacetime dimension and the number of original supersymmetries (8, 16 or 32). We find U-duality invariant conditions on the quantized charges which specify the number of supersymmetries preserved with a particular charge configuration. These conditions relate U-duality invariants to the picture of intersecting branes. The analysis is carried out for all extended supergravities with 16 or 32 supersymmetries in various dimensions.
