Abstract: We analyse the BRST constraints and corresponding Hilbert-space structure of chiral QCD$_2$ in the decoupled formulation for the case of the Jackiw-Rajaraman parameter $a=2$. We show that despite formal similarities this theory is not equivalent to QCD$_2$, and that its extension to U(N) does not lead to an infinite vacuum degeneracy.
