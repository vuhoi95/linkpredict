Title: NRQED and Next-to-Leading Hyperfine Splitting in Positronium
Authors: P. Labelle and S. M. Zebarjad and C. P. Burgess
Abstract: We compute the next-to-leading, O(m alpha^5), contribution to the hyperfine splitting in positronium within the framework of NRQED. When applied to the ground state, our calculation reproduces known results, providing a further test of NRQED techniques. Besides providing a very simple method of calculation of the standard result, we also obtain new expressions for excited states of positronium with negligible additional effort. Our calculation requires the complete next-to-leading matching of the lowest-dimension NRQED four-fermi couplings, which we publish here for the first time.
