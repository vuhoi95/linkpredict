Title: One loop in eleven dimensions
Authors: M. B. Green and M. Gutperle and P. Vanhove
Abstract: Four-graviton scattering in eleven-dimensional supergravity is considered at one loop compactified on one, two and three-dimensional tori. The dependence on the toroidal geometry determines the known perturbative and non-perturbative terms in the corresponding processes in type II superstring theories in ten, nine and eight dimensions. The ultra-violet divergence must be regularized so that it has a precisely determined finite value that is consistent both with T-duality in nine dimensions and with eleven-dimensional supersymmetry.
