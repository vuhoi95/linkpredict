Title: $q\bar q$ interaction in light-cone gauge formulations of Yang-Mills  theory in 1+1 dimensions
Authors: A. Bassetto and D. Colferai and G. Nardelli
Abstract: A rectangular Wilson loop with sides parallel to space and time directions is perturbatively evaluated in two light-cone gauge formulations of Yang-Mills theory in 1+1 dimensions, with ``instantaneous'' and ``causal'' interactions between static quarks. In the instantaneous formulation we get Abelian-like exponentiation of the area in terms of $C_F$. In the ``causal'' formulation the loop depends not only on the area, but also on the dimensionless ratio $\beta = {L \over T}$, $2L$ and $2T$ being the lengths of the rectangular sides. Besides it also exhibits dependence on $C_A$. In the limit $T \to \infty$ the area law is recovered, but dependence on $C_A$ survives. Consequences of these results are pointed out.
