Title: Semi-classical spectrum of the Homogeneous sine-Gordon theories
Authors: C. R. Fern√°ndez-Pousa and J. L. Miramontes
Abstract: The semi-classical spectrum of the Homogeneous sine-Gordon theories associated with an arbitrary compact simple Lie group G is obtained and shown to be entirely given by solitons. These theories describe quantum integrable massive perturbations of Gepner's G-parafermions whose classical equations-of-motion are non-abelian affine Toda equations. One-soliton solutions are constructed by embeddings of the SU(2) complex sine-Gordon soliton in the regular SU(2) subgroups of G. The resulting spectrum exhibits both stable and unstable particles, which is a peculiar feature shared with the spectrum of monopoles and dyons in N=2 and N=4 supersymmetric gauge theories.
