Title: Constrained quantization and $Î¸$-angles
Authors: N. P. Landsman and K. K. Wren
Abstract: We apply a new and mathematically rigorous method for the quantization of constrained systems to two-dimensional gauge theories. In this method, which quantizes Marsden-Weinstein symplectic reduction, the inner product on the physical state space is expressed through a certain integral over the gauge group. The present paper, the first of a series, specializes to the Minkowski theory defined on a cylinder. The integral in question is then constructed in terms of the Wiener measure on a loop group. It is shown how $\th$-angles emerge in the new method, and the abstract theory is illustrated in detail in an example.
