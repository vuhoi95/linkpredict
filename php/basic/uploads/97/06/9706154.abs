Title: Graceful exit problem and stress-energy-momentum tensors revisited in  the two-dimensional string cosmology
Authors: Won Tae Kim and Myung Seok Yoon
Abstract: We study the graceful exit problem and the role of the stress-energy-momentum tensors in the two-dimensional string cosmology. The one-loop quantum correction of conformal fields is incorporated in the arbitrary large $N$ limit to ensure exact quantum solvability. The only solution which gives the bounded curvature with the asymptotic flatness is restricted to the first branch under some conditions. However, even in this case, the accelerating expansion is forever. We show that the only nonvanishing quantum stress-momentum tensor is the pressure part($T_{xx}$) which is of relevance to the dynamical evolution of the universe in the comoving coordinate. The quantum energy part is zero since the negative contribution of the induced conformal matters always cancels the positive quantity of the induced dilaton part in terms of the constraint equation.
