Title: The Calogero Model: Integrable Structures and Orthogonal Basis
Authors: Miki Wadati and Hideaki Ujino
Abstract: Integrability, algebraic structures and orthogonal basis of the Calogero model are studied by the quantum Lax and Dunkl operator formulations. The commutator algebra among operators including conserved operators and creation-annihilation operators has the structure of the W-algebra. Through an algebraic construction of the simultaneous eigenfunctions of all the commuting conserved operators, we show that the Hi-Jack (hidden-Jack) polynomials, which are an multi-variable generalization of the Hermite polynomials, form the orthogonal basis.
