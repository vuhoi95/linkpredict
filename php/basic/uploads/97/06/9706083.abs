Title: Many-body Dynamics of D0--Branes
Authors: H. Awata and S. Chaudhuri and M. Li and D. Minic
Abstract: We show that the growth of the size with the number of partons holds in a Thomas-Fermi analysis of the threshold bound state of D0--branes. Our results sharpen the evidence that for a fixed value of the eleven dimensional radius the partonic velocities can be made arbitrarily small as one approaches the large N limit.
