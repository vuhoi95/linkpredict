Title: An analytic description of the vector constrained KP hierarchy
Authors: G. F. Helminck and J. W. van de Leur
Abstract: In this paper we give a geometric description in terms of the Grassmann manifold of Segal and Wilson, of the reduction of the KP hierarchy known as the vector $k$-constrained KP hierarchy. We also show in a geometric way that these hierarchies are equivalent to Krichever's general rational reductions of the KP hierarchy.
