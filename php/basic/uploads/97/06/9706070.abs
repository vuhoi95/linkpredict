Title: Non-perturbative regularization and renormalization: simple examples  from non-relativistic quantum mechanics
Authors: Daniel R. Phillips and Silas R. Beane and Thomas D. Cohen
Abstract: We examine several zero-range potentials in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. The study of such potentials requires regularization and renormalization. We contrast physical results obtained using dimensional regularization and cutoff schemes and show explicitly that in certain cases dimensional regularization fails to reproduce the results obtained using cutoff regularization. First we consider a delta-function potential in arbitrary space dimensions. Using cutoff regularization we show that for $d \ge 4$ the renormalized scattering amplitude is trivial. In contrast, dimensional regularization can yield a nontrivial scattering amplitude for odd dimensions greater than or equal to five. We also consider a potential consisting of a delta function plus the derivative-squared of a delta function in three dimensions. We show that the renormalized scattering amplitudes obtained using the two regularization schemes are different. Moreover we find that in the cutoff-regulated calculation the effective range is necessarily negative in the limit that the cutoff is taken to infinity. In contrast, in dimensional regularization the effective range is unconstrained. We discuss how these discrepancies arise from the dimensional regularization prescription that all power-law divergences vanish. We argue that these results demonstrate that dimensional regularization can fail in a non-perturbative setting.
