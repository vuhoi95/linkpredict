Title: Heat-kernel coefficients for oblique boundary conditions
Authors: J. S. Dowker and Klaus Kirsten
Abstract: We calculate the heat-kernel coefficients, up to $a_2$, for a U(1) bundle on the 4-Ball for boundary conditions which are such that the normal derivative of the field at the boundary is related to a first-order operator in boundary derivatives acting on the field. The results are used to place restrictions on the general forms of the coefficients. In the specific case considered, there can be a breakdown of ellipticity.
