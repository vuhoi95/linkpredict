Title: Supersymmetry Breaking with Vanishing F-terms in Supergravity Theories
Authors: Gia Dvali and Alex Pomarol
Abstract: In conventional supergravity theories, supersymmetry is broken by a non-zero F-term, and the cosmological constant is fine tuned to zero by a constant in the superpotential W. We discuss a class of supergravity theories with vanishing F-terms but $W \not= 0$ being generated dynamically. The cosmological constant is assumed to be cancelled by a non-zero D-term. In this scenario the gravity-mediated soft masses depend only on a single parameter, the gravitino mass. They are automatically universal, independently of the Kahler metric, and real. Thus, dangerous flavor or CP violating interactions are suppressed. Unlike in conventional supergravity models, the Polonyi problem does not arise.
