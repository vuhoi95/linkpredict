Title: Bogomol'nyi equations in gauge theories
Authors: M. S. Cunha and H. R. Christiansen and C. A. S. Almeida
Abstract: By imposing self-duality conditions, we obtain the explicit form in which gauge theories spontaneously breakdown in the Bogomol'nyi limit. In this context, we reconsider the Abelian Higgs, Chern-Simons Higgs and Maxwell-Chern-Simons Higgs models. On the same footing, we find a topological Higgs potential for a Maxwell-Chern-Simons extended theory presenting both minimal and nonminimal coupling. Finally, we perform a numerical calculation in the asymmetric phase and show the solutions to the self-dual equations of motion of the topological theory. We argue about certain relations among the parameters of the model in order to obtain such vortex configurations.
