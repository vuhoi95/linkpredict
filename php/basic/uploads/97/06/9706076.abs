Title: ADE Confining Phase Superpotentials
Authors: Seiji Terashima and Sung-Kil Yang
Abstract: We obtain a low-energy effective superpotential for a phase with a single confined photon in N=1 gauge theory with an adjoint matter with ADE gauge groups. The expectation values of gauge invariants built out of the adjoint field parametrize the singularities of moduli space of the Coulomb phase. The result can be used to derive the N=2 curve in the form of a foliation over $CP^1$. Our N=1 theory exhibits non-trivial fixed points which naturally inherit the properties of the ADE classification of N=2 superconformal field theories in four dimensions. We also discuss how to include matter hypermultiplets toward deriving the Riemann surface which describes N=2 QCD with exceptional gauge groups.
