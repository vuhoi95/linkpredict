Title: Soliton scattering in the O(3) model on a torus
Authors: R. J. Cova and W. J. Zakrzewski
Abstract: Using numerical simulations, the stability and scattering properties of the O(3) model on a two-dimensional torus are studied. Its solitons are found to be unstable but can be stabilized by the addition of a Skyrme term to the Lagrangian. Scattering at right angles with respect to the initial direction of motion is observed in all cases considered. The model has no solutions of degree one, so when a field configuration that resembles a soliton is considered, it shrinks to become infinitely thin. A comparison of these results with those of the model defined on the sphere is made.
