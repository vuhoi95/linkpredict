Title: On the inflationary solutions in higher-derivative gravity with dilaton  field
Authors: A. L. Maroto and I. L. Shapiro
Abstract: We discuss the existence of de Sitter inflationary solutions for the string-inspired fourth-derivative gravity theories with dilaton field. We consider a space-time of arbitrary dimension D and an arbitrary parametrization of the target space metric. The specific features of the theory in dimension D=4 and those of the special ghost-free parametrization of the metric are found. We also consider similar string-inspired theories with torsion and construct an inflationary solution with torsion and dilaton for D=4. The stability of the inflationary solutions is also investigated.
