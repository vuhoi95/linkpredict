Title: Duality in 2D Spin Models on Torus
Authors: A. I. Bugrij and V. N. Shadura
Abstract: Method of derivation of the duality relations for two-dimensional Z(N)-symmetric spin models on finite square lattice wrapped on the torus is proposed. As example, exact duality relations for the nonhomogeneous Ising model (N=2) and the Z(N)-Berezinsky-Villain model are obtained.
