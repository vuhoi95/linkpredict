Title: Anomaly Matching Conditions in Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
Authors: Gustavo Dotti and Aneesh V. Manohar
Abstract: Sufficient conditions are proven for 't Hooft's consistency conditions to hold at points in the moduli space of supersymmetric gauge theories. Known results for anomaly matching in supersymmetric QCD are rederived as a sample application of the results. The results can be used to show that the anomaly matching conditions hold for s-confining theories.
