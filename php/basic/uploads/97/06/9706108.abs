Title: The N=2 vector-tensor multiplet, central charge superspace, and  Chern-Simons couplings
Authors: Richard Grimm and Maximilian Hasler and Carl Herrmann
Abstract: We present a new, alternative interpretation of the vector-tensor multiplet as a 2-form in central charge superspace. This approach provides a geometric description of the (non-trivial) central charge transformations ab initio and is naturally generalized to include couplings of Chern-Simons forms to the antisymmetric tensor gauge field, giving rise to a N=2 supersymmetric version of the Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism.
