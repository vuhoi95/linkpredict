Abstract: In N=1 supersymmetric theories, quasi Nambu-Goldstone (QNG) bosons appear in addition to ordinary Nambu-Goldstone (NG) bosons when the global symmetry G breaks down spontaneously. We investigate two-body scattering amplitudes of these bosons in the low-energy effective Lagrangian formalism. They are expressed by the curvature of Kahler manifold. The scattering amplitudes of QNG bosons are shown to coincide with those of NG bosons though the effective Lagrangian contains an arbitrary function, and those with odd number of QNG bosons all vanish.
