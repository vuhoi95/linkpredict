Title: Trace anomaly induced effective action for 2D and 4D dilaton coupled  scalars
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: The spherically symmetric reduction of higher dimensional Einstein-scalar theory leads to lower dimensional dilatonic gravity with dilaton coupled scalar (for example, from 4D to 2D system). We calculate trace anomaly and anomaly induced effective action for 2D and 4D dilaton coupled scalars. The large-N effective action for 2D quantum dilaton-scalar gravity is also found. These 2D results maybe applied for analysis of 4D spherical collapse. The role of new, dilaton dependent terms in trace anomaly for 2D black holes and Hawking radiation is investigated in some specific models of dilatonic gravity which represent modification of CGHS model. The conformal sector for 4D dilatonic gravity is constructed. Quantum back-reaction of dilaton coupled matter is briefly discussed (it may lead to the inflationary Universe with non-trivial dilaton).
