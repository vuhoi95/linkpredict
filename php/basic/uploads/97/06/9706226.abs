Title: F-theory, SO(32) and Toric Geometry
Authors: Philip Candelas and Harald Skarke
Abstract: We show that the F-theory dual of the heterotic string with unbroken Spin(32)/Z_2 symmetry in eight dimensions can be described in terms of the same polyhedron that can also encode unbroken E_8\times E_8 symmetry. By considering particular compactifications with this K3 surface as a fiber, we can reproduce the recently found `record gauge group' in six dimensions and obtain a new `record gauge group' in four dimensions. Our observations relate to the toric diagram for the intersection of components of degenerate fibers and our definition of these objects, which we call `tops', is more general than an earlier definition by Candelas and Font.
