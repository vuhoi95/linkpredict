Title: Complex BPS domain walls and phase transition in mass in supersymmetric  QCD
Authors: A. Smilga and A. Veselov
Abstract: We study the domain walls connecting different chirally asymmetric vacua in supersymmetric QCD. We show that BPS - saturated solutions exist only in the limited range of mass. When m exceeds some critical value, the domain wall either ceases to be BPS - saturated or disappears altogether. In any case, the properties of the system are qualitatively changed.
