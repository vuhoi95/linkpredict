Title: The geometry of spinors and the multicomponent BKP and DKP hierarchies
Authors: Victor Kac and Johan van de Leur
Abstract: We develop a formalism of multicomponent BKP hierarchies using elementary geometry of spinors. The multicomponent KP and the modified KP hierarchy (hence all their reductions like KdV, NLS, AKNS or DS) are reductions of the multicomponent BKP.
