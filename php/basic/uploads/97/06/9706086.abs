Title: The Monodromy Matrices of the XXZ Model in the Infinite Volume Limit
Authors: Tetsuji Miwa and Robert Weston
Abstract: We consider the XXZ model in the infinite volume limit with spin half quantum space and higher spin auxiliary space. Using perturbation theory arguments, we relate the half infinite transfer matrices of this class of models to certain $U_q(\hat{sl_2})$ intertwiners introduced by Nakayashiki. We construct the monodromy matrices, and show that the one with spin one auxiliary space gives rise to the L operator.
