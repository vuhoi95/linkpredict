Title: The Conformal Properties of Liouville Field Theory on Z_N-Riemann  Surfaces
Authors: S. A. Apikyan and C. J. Efthimiou
Abstract: The Liouville field theory on Z_N-Riemann surfaces is studied and it is shown that it decomposes into a Liouville field theory on the sphere and N-1 free boson theories. Also, the partition function of the Liouville field theory on the Z_N-Riemann surfaces is expressed as a product of the correlation function for the Liouville vertex operators on the sphere and a number of twisted fields.
