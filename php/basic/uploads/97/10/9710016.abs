Title: The k-fermions as objects interpolating between fermions and bosons
Authors: M. Daoud and Y. Hassouni and M. Kibler
Abstract: Operators, refered to as k-fermion operators, that interpolate between boson and fermion operators are introduced through the consideration of two noncommuting quon algebras. The deformation parameters for these quon algebras are roots of unity connected to an integer k. The case k=2 corresponds to fermions and the limiting case k going to infinity to bosons. Generalized coherent states and supercoherent states are investigated. The Dirac quantum phase operator and the Fairlie-Fletcher-Zachos algebra are also considered.
