Title: Limiting solutions of sequences of globally regular and black hole  solutions in SU(N)-EYMD theories
Authors: Abha Sood and Burkhard Kleihaus and Jutta Kunz
Abstract: Static spherically symmetric solutions in SU(N)-EYM and EYMD theories are classified by the node numbers of their non-trivial gauge field functions. With increasing node numbers, the solutions form sequences, tending to limiting solutions. The limiting solutions are based on subalgebras of $su(N)$, consisting of a neutral non-abelian part and a charged abelian part, belonging to the Cartan subalgebra
