Abstract: Various exact solutions of two-particle eigenvalue problems for nonrelativistic contact four-fermion current-current interaction are obtained. Specifics of Goldstone mode is investigated. The connection between a renormalization procedure and construction of self-adjoint extensions is revealed.
