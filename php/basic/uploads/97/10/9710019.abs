Title: Mapping of the $B_N$-type Calogero-Sutherland-Moser system to decoupled  Harmonic Oscillators
Authors: N. Gurappa and Prasanta. K. Panigrahi
Abstract: The $B_N$-type Calogero-Sutherland-Moser system in one-dimension is shown to be equivalent to a set of decoupled oscillators by a similarity transformation. This result is used to show the connection of the $A_N$ and $B_N$ type models and explain the degeneracy structure of the later. We identify the commuting constants of motion and the generators of a linear $W_\infty$ algebra associated with the $B_N$ system.
