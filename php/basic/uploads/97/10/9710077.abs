Abstract: The effect of coupling non-compact $U(1)$ gauge fields to four dimensional simplicial quantum gravity is studied using strong coupling expansions and Monte Carlo simulations. For one gauge field the back-reaction of the matter on the geometry is weak. This changes, however, as more matter fields are introduced. For more than two gauge fields the degeneracy of random manifolds into branched polymers does not occur, and the branched polymer phase seems to be replaced by a new phase with a negative string susceptibility exponent $\gamma$ and fractal dimension $d_H \approx 4$.
