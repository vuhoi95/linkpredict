Title: Fibre Bundles and Generalised Dimensional Reduction
Authors: I. V. Lavrinenko and H. Lu and C. N. Pope
Abstract: We study some geometrical and topological aspects of the generalised dimensional reduction of supergravities in D=11 and D=10 dimensions, which give rise to massive theories in lower dimensions. In these reductions, a global symmetry is used in order to allow some of the fields to have a non-trivial dependence on the compactifying coordinates. Global consistency in the internal space imposes topological restrictions on the parameters of the compactification as well as the structure of the space itself. Examples that we consider include the generalised reduction of the type IIA and type IIB theories on a circle, and also the massive ten-dimensional theory obtained by the generalised reduction of D=11 supergravity.
