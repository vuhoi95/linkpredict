Title: Static Regular and Black Hole Solutions with Axial Symmetry in EYM and  EYMD theory
Authors: B. Kleihaus and J. Kunz
Abstract: We discuss the recently discovered new class of globally regular and black hole solutions in Einstein-Yang-Mills and Einstein-Yang-Mills-dilaton theory. These asymptotically flat solutions are static and possess only axial symmetry. The black hole solutions possess a regular event horizon.
