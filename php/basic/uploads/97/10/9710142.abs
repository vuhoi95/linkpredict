Abstract: Using the harmonic superspace background field formulation for general D=4, N=2 super Yang-Mills theories, with matter hypermultiplets in arbitrary representations of the gauge group, we present the first rigorous proof of the N=2 non-renormalization theorem; specifically, the absence of ultraviolet divergences beyond the one-loop level. Another simple consequence of the background field formulation is the absence of the leading non-holomorphic correction to the low-energy effective action at two loops.
