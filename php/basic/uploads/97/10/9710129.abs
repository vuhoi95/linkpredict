Title: Supersymmetry of M-Branes at Angles
Authors: Nobuyoshi Ohta and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: We determine the possible fractions of supersymmetry preserved by two intersecting M-5-branes. These include the fractions 3/32 and 5/32 which have not occurred previously in intersecting brane configurations. Both occur in non-orthogonal pointlike intersections of M-5-branes but 5/32 supersymmetry is possible only for specific fixed angles.
