Title: Nambu-Jona-Lasinio approach to realization of confining medium
Authors: M. Faber and A. N. Ivanov and N. I. Troitskaya
Abstract: The mechanism of a confining medium is investigated within the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) approach. It is shown that a confining medium can be realized in the bosonized phase of the NJL model due to vacuum fluctuations of both fermion and Higgs (scalar fermion-antifermion collective excitation) fields. In such an approach there is no need to introduce Dirac strings.
