Title: Diffeomorphism Invariance of Geometric Descriptions of Palatini and  Ashtekar Gravity
Authors: Yan Luo and Ming-Xue Shao and Zhong-Yuan Zhu
Abstract: In this paper, we explicitly prove the presymplectic forms of the Palatini and Ashtekar gravity to be zero along gauge orbits of the Lorentz and diffeomorphism groups, which ensures the diffeomorphism invariance of these theories.
