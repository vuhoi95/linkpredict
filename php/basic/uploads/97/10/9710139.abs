Title: The Meaning of Maximal Symmetry in Presence of Torsion
Authors: Debashis Gangopadhyay and Soumitra Sengupta
Abstract: We show that the usual physical meaning of maximal symmetry can be made to remain unaltered even if torsion is present. All that is required is that the torsion fields satisfy some mutually consistent constraints. We also give an explicit realisation of such a scenario by determining the torsion fields, the metric and the associated Killing vectors.
