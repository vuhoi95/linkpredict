Title: SUSY field theories, integrable systems and their stringy/brane origin  -- II
Authors: A. Gorsky and S. Gukov and A. Mironov
Abstract: Five and six dimensional SUSY gauge theories, with one or two compactified directions, are discussed. The 5d theories with the matter hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation are associated with the twisted $XXZ$ spin chain, while the group product case with the bi-fundamental matter corresponds to the higher rank spin chains. The Riemann surfaces for $6d$ theories with fundamental matter and two compact directions are proposed to correspond to the $XYZ$ spin chain based on the Sklyanin algebra. We also discuss the obtained results within the brane and geometrical engeneering frameworks and explain the relation to the toric diagrams.
