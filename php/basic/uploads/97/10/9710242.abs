Title: Algebraic algorithm for next-to-leading order calculations in the  large-s/small-x regime
Authors: A. V. Stepanova and F. V. Tkachov
Abstract: We present an algebraic algorithm for analytical calculation of arbitrary dimensionally regulated massless two-loop forward-scattering diagrams that constitute the most cumbersome part of next-to-leading order calculations in the large-s/small-x regime.
