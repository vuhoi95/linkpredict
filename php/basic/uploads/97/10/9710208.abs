Title: On the Four-Dimensional Effective Action of Strongly Coupled Heterotic  String Theory
Authors: Andre Lukas and Burt A. Ovrut and Daniel Waldram
Abstract: The low-energy D=4, N=1 effective action of the strongly coupled heterotic string is explicitly computed by compactifying Horava-Witten theory on the deformed Calabi-Yau three-fold solution due to Witten. It is shown that, to order kappa^{2/3}, the Kahler potential is identical to that of the weakly coupled theory. Furthermore, the gauge kinetic functions are directly computed to order kappa^{4/3} and shown to receive a non-vanishing correction. Also, we compute gauge matter terms in the Kahler potential to the order kappa^{4/3} and find a nontrivial correction to the dilaton term. Part of those corrections arise from background fields that depend on the orbifold coordinate and are excited by four-dimensional gauge field source terms.
