Title: The Algebraic Structure of the $gl(n|m)$ Color Calogero-Sutherland  Models
Authors: Guo-xing Ju and Shi-kun Wang and Ke Wu
Abstract: We extend the study on the algebraic structure of the $su(n)$ color Calogero-Sutherland models to the case of $gl(n|m)$ color CS model and show that the generators of the super-Yangian $Y(gl(n|m))$ can be obtained from two $gl(n|m)$ loop algebras. Also, a super $W_{\infty}$ algebra for the SUSY CS model is constructed.
