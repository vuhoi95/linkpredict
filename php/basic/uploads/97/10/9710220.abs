Title: Transport-theoretic Extensions of Quantum Field Theories
Authors: Marijan Ribaric and Luka Sustersic
Abstract: We propose a new, transport-theoretic (tt) class of relativistic extensions of quantum field theories of fundamental interactions. Its concepts are inspired by Feynman's atomistic idea about the physical world and by the extension of fluid dynamics to shorter distances through the Boltzmann transport equation. The extending tt Lagrangians imply the original Lagrangians as path-integralwise approximations. By constructing a tt Lagrangian that extends a general gauge-invariant Lagrangian, we show that a tt extension of the standard model is feasible. We define a tt Lagrangian in terms of tt fields of the spacetime variable and an additional, four-vector variable. We explain the fields of quantum field theories as certain covariant, local averages of tt fields. Only two tt fields may be needed for modeling fundamental interactions: (i) a four-vector one unifying all fundamental forces, and (ii) a two-component-spinor one unifying all fundamental matter particles. We comment on the new physics expected within the tt framework put forward, and point out some open questions.
