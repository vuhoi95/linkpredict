Title: Supersymmetry Breaking with Periodic Potentials
Authors: G. Dunne and J. Mannix
Abstract: We discuss supersymmetry breaking in some supersymmetric quantum mechanical models with periodic potentials. The sensitivity to the parameters appearing in the superpotential is more acute than in conventional nonperiodic models. We present some simple elliptic models to illustrate these points.
