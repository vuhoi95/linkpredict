Title: Equivalence of the Calogero-Sutherland Model to Free Harmonic  Oscillators
Authors: N. Gurappa and Prasanta. K. Panigrahi
Abstract: A similarity transformation is constructed through which a system of particles interacting with inverse-square two-body and harmonic potentials in one dimension, can be mapped identically, to a set of free harmonic oscillators. This equivalence provides a straightforward method to find the complete set of eigenfunctions, the exact constants of motion and a linear $W_{1+\infty}$ algebra associated with this model. It is also demonstrated that a large class of models with long-range interactions, both in one and higher dimensions can be made equivalent to decoupled oscillators.
