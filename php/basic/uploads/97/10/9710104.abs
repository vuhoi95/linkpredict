Title: The hypothesis of path integral duality II: corrections to quantum field  theoretic results
Authors: K. Srinivasan and L. Sriramkumar and T. Padmanabhan
Abstract: In the path integral expression for a Feynman propagator of a spinless particle of mass $m$, the path integral amplitude for a path of proper length ${\cal R}(x,x'| g_{\mu\nu})$ connecting events $x$ and $x'$ in a spacetime described by the metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$ is $\exp-[m {\cal R}(x,x'| g_{\mu\nu})]$. In a recent paper, assuming the path integral amplitude to be invariant under the duality transformation ${\cal R} \to (L_P^2/{\cal R})$, Padmanabhan has evaluated the modified Feynman propagator in an arbitrary curved spacetime. He finds that the essential feature of this `principle of path integral duality' is that the Euclidean proper distance $(\Delta x)^2$ between two infinitesimally separated spacetime events is replaced by $[(\Delta x)^2 + 4L_P^2 ]$. In other words, under the duality principle the spacetime behaves as though it has a `zero-point length' $L_P$, a feature that is expected to arise in a quantum theory of gravity. In the Schwinger's proper time description of the Feynman propagator, the weightage factor for a path with a proper time $s$ is $\exp-(m^2s)$. Invoking Padmanabhan's `principle of path integral duality' corresponds to modifying the weightage factor $\exp-(m^2s)$ to $\exp-[m^2s + (L_P^2/s)]$. In this paper, we use this modified weightage factor in Schwinger's proper time formalism to evaluate the quantum gravitational corrections to some of the standard quantum field theoretic results in flat and curved spacetimes. We find that the extra factor $\exp-(L_P^2/s)$ acts as a regulator at the Planck scale thereby `removing' the divergences that otherwise appear in the theory. Finally, we discuss the wider implications of our analysis.
