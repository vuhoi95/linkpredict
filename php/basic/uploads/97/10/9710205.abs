Title: Abelian Projections and Monopoles
Authors: M. N. Chernodub and M. I. Polikarpov
Abstract: The monopole confinement mechanism in the abelian projection of lattice gluodynamics is reviewed. The main topics are: the abelian projection on the lattice and in the continuum, a numerical study of the abelian monopoles in the lattice gauge theory. Additionally, we briefly review the notation of differential forms, duality, and the BKT transformation in the lattice gauge theories.
