Abstract: A particle in quantum mechanics on manifolds couples to the induced topological gauge field that characterises the possible inequivalent quantizations. For instance, the gauge potential induced on $S^2$ is that of a magnetic monopole located at the center of $S^2$. We find that the gauge potential induced on $S^3$ ($S^{2n+1}$) is that of a meron (generalized meron) also sitting at the center of $S^3$ ($S^{2n+1}$).
