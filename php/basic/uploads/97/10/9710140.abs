Title: Integrable dissipative structures in the gauge theory of gravity
Authors: L. Martina and O. K. Pashaev and G. Soliani
Abstract: The Jackiw-Teitelboim gauge formulation of the 1+1 dimensional gravity allows us to relate different gauge fixing conditions with integrable hierarchies of evolution equations. We show that the equations for the Zweibein fields can be written as a pair of time reversed evolution equations of the reaction-diffusion type, admitting dissipative solutions. The spectral parameter for the related Lax pair appears as the constant valued spin connection associated with the $SO(1,1)$ gauge symmetry. Spontaneous breaking of the non-compact symmetry and the irreversible evolution are discussed.
