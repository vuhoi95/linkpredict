Title: The nonminimal scalar multiplet: duality, sigma-model, beta-function
Authors: Silvia Penati and Andrea Refolli and Antoine Van Proeyen and Daniela Zanon
Abstract: We compute in superspace the one-loop beta-function for the nonlinear sigma-model defined in terms of the nonminimal scalar multiplet. The recently proposed quantization of this complex linear superfield, viewed as the field strength of an unconstrained gauge spinor superfield, allows to handle efficiently the infinite tower of ghosts via the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism. We find that the classical duality of the nonminimal scalar and chiral multiplets is maintained at the quantum one-loop level.
