Title: Neveu-Schwarz Five-Branes And Matrix String Theory On K3
Authors: Duiliu-Emanuel Diaconescu and Jaume Gomis
Abstract: The Matrix theory description of Type IIA string theory on a compact K3 surface as the theory of Neveu-Schwarz five-branes on $\tilde{K3}\times S^1$ is analyzed. The full multiplet of space-time BPS states is identified in the five-brane world-volume as fluxes.
