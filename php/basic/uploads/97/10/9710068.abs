Title: Confinement and scaling of the vortex vacuum of SU(2) lattice gauge  theory
Authors: Kurt Langfeld and Hugo Reinhardt and Oliver Tennert
Abstract: The magnetic vortices which arise in SU(2) lattice gauge theory in center projection are visualized for a given time slice. We establish that the number of vortices piercing a given 2-dimensional sheet is a renormalization group invariant and therefore physical quantity. We find that roughly 2 vortices pierce an area of 1 fm^2.
