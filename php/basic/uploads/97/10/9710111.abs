Title: Quasi exactly solvable matrix models in sl(n)
Authors: Yves Brihaye and Piotr Kosinski
Abstract: We reconsider the quasi exactly solvable matrix models constructed recently by R. Zhdanov. The 2$\times$2 matrix operators representing the algebra sl(2) are generalized to matrices of arbitrary dimension and a similar construction is achieved for the algebra sl(n).
