Title: The Second Virial Coefficient of Spin-1/2 Interacting Anyon System
Authors: Sahng-Kyoon Yoo and D. K. Park
Abstract: Evaluating the propagator by the usual time-sliced manner, we use it to compute the second virial coefficient of an anyon gas interacting through the repulsive potential of the form $g/r^2 (g > 0)$. All the cusps for the unpolarized spin-1/2 as well as spinless cases disappear in the $\omega \to 0$ limit, where $\omega$ is a frequency of harmonic oscillator which is introduced as a regularization method. As $g$ approaches to zero, the result reduces to the noninteracting hard-core limit.
