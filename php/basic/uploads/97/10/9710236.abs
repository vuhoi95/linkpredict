Title: Modified N=2 supersymmetry and Fayet-Iliopoulos terms
Authors: E. A. Ivanov and B. M. Zupnik
Abstract: We study peculiarities of realization of N=2 supersymmetry in N=2 abelian gauge theory with two sorts of FI terms, electric and magnetic ones, within manifestly supersymmetric formulations via the Mezincescu and harmonic-analytic prepotentials. We obtain a `magnetic', duality- transformed superfield form of the N=2 Maxwell effective holomorphic action with standard electric $FI$ term and demonstrate that in such a system off-shell N=2 supersymmetry is inevitably realized in an unusual Goldstone mode corresponding to the {\it partial} spontaneous breaking down to N=1. On shell, the standard total breaking occurs. In a system with the two sorts of FI terms, off-shell N=2 supersymmetry is realized in the partial breaking mode both in the electric and magnetic representations. This regime is retained on shell due to the Antoniadis- Partouche-Taylor mechanism. We show that the off-shell algebra of N=2 supersymmetry in the partial breaking realization is modified on gauge-variant objects like potentials and prepotentials. The closure of spinor charges involves some special gauge transformations before any gauge-fixing.
