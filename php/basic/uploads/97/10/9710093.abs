Title: Gauge Independence of the S-Matrix in the Causal Approach
Authors: Andreas Aste and Michael D"utsch and G"unter Scharf
Abstract: The gauge dependence of the time-ordered products for Yang-Mills theories is analysed in perturbation theory by means of the causal method of Epstein and Glaser together with perturbative gauge invariance. This approach allows a simple inductive proof of the gauge independence of the physical S-matrix.
