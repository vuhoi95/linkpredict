Title: Correlators of the Global Symmetry Currents of 4D and 6D Superconformal  Theories
Authors: Yeuk-Kwan E. Cheung and Ori J. Ganor and Morten Krogh
Abstract: We study the two-point correlators of the currents of the $E_8$ global symmetry in the $N=(1,0)$ superconformal six-dimensional theory as well as in the 4D superconformal theories upon toroidal compactification. From the high-energy behavior of the correlator we deduce that in 4D 10 copies of the superconformal theory with $E_8$ global symmetry can be coupled to an N=2 $E_8$ gauge theory. We present three alternative derivations for the expression for the correlators. One from field-theory, one from M-theory and one from F-theory.
