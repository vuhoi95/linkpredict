Title: Supersymmetry, Shape Invariance and Solvability of $A_{N-1}$ and  $BC_{N}$ Calogero-Sutherland Model
Authors: Pijush K. Ghosh and Avinash Khare and M. Sivakumar
Abstract: Using the ideas of supersymmetry and shape invariance we re-derive the spectrum of the $A_{N-1}$ and $BC_N$ Calogero-Sutherland model. We briefly discuss as to how to obtain the corresponding eigenfunctions. We also discuss the difficulties involved in extending this approach to the trigonometric models.
