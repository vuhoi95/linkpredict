Title: On the instability of effective potential for non-abelian toroidal  D-brane
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: We calculate the one-loop effective potential for the toroidal non-abelian D-brane in the constant magnetic SU(2) gauge field. The study of its properties shows that the potential is unbounded below. This fact indicates the instability of the non-abelian D-brane in the background under consideration like the instability of chromomagnetic vacuum in SU(2) gauge theory.
