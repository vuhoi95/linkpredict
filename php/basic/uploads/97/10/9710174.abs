Title: Multigraviton Scattering in the Matrix Model
Authors: M. Dine and A. Rajaraman
Abstract: We consider scattering processes in the matrix model with three incoming and three outgoing gravitons. We find a discrepancy between the amplitude calculated from the matrix model and the supergravity prediction. Possible sources for this discrepancy are discussed.
