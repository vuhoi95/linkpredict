Title: Quantization of Two-Dimensional Gravity with Dynamical Torsion
Authors: P. M. Lavrov and P. Yu. Moshin
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional gravity with dynamical torsion in the Batalin - Vilkovisky and Batalin - Lavrov - Tyutin formalisms of gauge theories quantization as well as in the background field method.
