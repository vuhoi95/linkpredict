Title: The Threebrane Soliton of the M-Fivebrane
Authors: P. S. Howe and N. D. Lambert and P. C. West
Abstract: We discuss the supersymmetry algebra of the M theory fivebrane and obtain a new threebrane soliton preserving half of the six-dimensional supersymmetry. This solution is dimensionally reduced to various D-p-branes.
