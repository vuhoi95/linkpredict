Title: On the Evaluation of Compton Scattering Amplitudes in String Theory
Authors: A. Pasquinucci and M. Petrini
Abstract: We consider the Compton amplitude for the scattering of a photon and a (massless) ``electron/positron'' at one loop (i.e. genus one) in a four-dimensional fermionic heterotic string model. Starting from the bosonization of the world-sheet fermions needed to explicitly construct the spin-fields representing the space-time fermions, we present all the steps of the computation which leads to the explicit form of the amplitude as an integral of modular forms over the moduli space.
