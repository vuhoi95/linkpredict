Title: Yangian Symmetry in Integrable Quantum Gravity
Authors: D. Korotkin and H. Samtleben
Abstract: Dimensional reduction of various gravity and supergravity models leads to effectively two-dimensional field theories described by gravity coupled G/H coset space sigma-models. The transition matrices of the associated linear system provide a complete set of conserved charges. Their Poisson algebra is a semi-classical Yangian double modified by a twist which is a remnant of the underlying coset structure. The classical Geroch group is generated by the Lie-Poisson action of these charges. Canonical quantization of the structure leads to a twisted Yangian double with fixed central extension at a critical level.
