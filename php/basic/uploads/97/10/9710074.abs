Title: Static Colored SU(2) Sources in (1+1)-Dimensions - An Analytic Solution  in the Electric Representation
Authors: Jiannis Pachos and Antonios Tsapalis
Abstract: Within the Schroedinger Electric Representation we analytically calculate the complete wave functional obeying Gauss' law with static SU(2) sources in (1+1)-dimensions. The effective potential is found to be linear in the distance between the sources as expected.
