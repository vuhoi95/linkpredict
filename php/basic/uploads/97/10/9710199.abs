Title: An Iterative Solution of the Three-colour Problem on a Random Lattice
Authors: B. Eynard and C. Kristjansen
Abstract: We study the generalisation of Baxter's three-colour problem to a random lattice. Rephrasing the problem as a matrix model problem we discuss the analyticity structure and the critical behaviour of the resulting matrix model. Based on a set of loop equations we develop an algorithm which enables us to solve the three-colour problem recursively
