Title: Perturbative Anomalies of the M-5-brane
Authors: L. Bonora and C. S. Chu and M. Rinaldi
Abstract: We discuss several mechanisms to cancel the anomalies of a 5-brane embedded in M-theory. Two of them work, provided we impose suitable conditions either on the 11-dimensional manifold of M-theory or on the 4-form field strength of M-theory.
