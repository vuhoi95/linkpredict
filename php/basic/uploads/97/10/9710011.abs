Abstract: 3D electroweak sphalerons on the lattice are used as test configurations for definitions of various topological defects. In the maximally Abelian gauge they are shown to contain a symmetric array of Abelian monopoles and anti-monopoles connected by two kinds of Abelian vortex strings. Gauge-invariant lattice definitions of the Nambu monopole and the Z-vortex string are formulated which correspond to Abelian projection from the unitary gauge. The sphalerons contain in their core just one (non-Abelian) Nambu monopole-anti-monopole pair (connected by a Z-string) in an unstable saddle point bound state. This provides an example for the monopole-pair unbinding mechanism expected to work at the electroweak phase transition. The definitions of defects developed here will be used in future studies of topological aspects of this transition.
