Abstract: On a nonrelativistic contact four-fermion model we have shown that the simple Lambda-cut-off prescription together with definite fine-tuning of the Lambda dependency of "bare"quantities lead to self-adjoint semi-bounded Hamiltonian in one-, two- and three-particle sectors. The fixed self-adjoint extension and exact solutions in two-particle sector completely define three-particle problem. The renormalized Faddeev equations for the bound states with Fredholm properties are obtained and analyzed.
