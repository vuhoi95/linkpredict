Title: Correlation functions for a strongly correlated boson system
Authors: N. M. Bogoliubov and A. G. Izergin and N. A. Kitanine
Abstract: The correlation functions for a strongly correlated exactly solvable one-dimensional boson system on a finite chain as well as in the thermodynamic limit are calculated explicitly. This system which we call the phase model is the strong coupling limit of the integrable q-boson hopping model. The results are presented as determinants.
