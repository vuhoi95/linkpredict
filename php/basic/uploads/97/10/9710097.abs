Title: Brane-Waves and Strings
Authors: Sangmin Lee and Amanda Peet and Larus Thorlacius
Abstract: Recently, solutions of the Born-Infeld theory representing strings emanating from a Dirichlet p-brane have been constructed. We discuss the embedding of these Born-Infeld solutions into the non-abelian theory appropriate to multiple overlapping p-branes. We also prove supersymmetry of the solutions explicitly in the full nonlinear theory. We then study transverse fluctuations, both from the worldbrane point of view and by analyzing a test-string in the supergravity background of a Dp-brane. We find agreement between the two approaches for the cases p=3,4.
