Title: Matching the BPS Spectra of Heterotic - Type I - Type I' Strings
Authors: D. Matalliotakis and H. P. Nilles and S. Theisen
Abstract: We give a detailed discussion of the matching of the BPS states of heterotic, type I and type I' theories in d=9 for general backgrounds. This allows us to explicitly identify these (composite) brane states in the type I' theory that lead to gauge symmetry enhancement at critical points in moduli space. An example is the enhancement of $SO(16)\times SO(16)$ to $E_8\times E_8$.
