Title: Gauge principles for multi-superparticles
Authors: I. Bars and C. Deliduman
Abstract: We formulate new gauge principles for n supersymmetric particles in a worldline formalism with N supersymmetries. The models provide realizations of the more general supersymmetries that are encountered in sectors of S-theory or Matrix theory, with a superalgebra that involves products of momenta. Due to local gauge and kappa symmetries the n superparticle momenta and N supercharges are constrained. The constraints have solutions only in a space with n timelike dimensions and SO(d+n-2,n) spacetime symmetry. The cases SO(9,1), SO(10,2) and SO(10,3), with one, two and three timelike dimensions respectively, are of special interest. In each case, due to the constraints, the classical motion and quantum theory of each superparticle are equivalent to the physics with a single time-like dimension in an effective 10D superspace with SO(9,1) Lorentz symmetry.
