Title: Loop Corrections for 2D Hawking Radiation
Authors: A. Mikovic and V. Radovanovic
Abstract: We describe how the reduced phase space quantization of the CGHS model of 2d black hole formation allows one to calculate the backreaction up to any finite order in matter loops. We then analyze the backreaction in the Hawking radiation up to two loops. At one-loop order the Hawking temperature does not change, while at two-loop order the temperature increases three times with respect to the classical value. We argue that such a behavior is consistent with the behaviour of the operator quantization Hawking flux for times which are not too late. For very late times the two-loop flux goes to zero which indicates that the backreaction can stop the black hole evaporation.
