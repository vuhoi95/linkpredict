Title: Dirac Quantisation Conditions and Kaluza-Klein Reduction
Authors: M. S. Bremer and H. Lu and C. N. Pope and K. S. Stelle
Abstract: We present the form of the Dirac quantisation condition for the p-form charges carried by p-brane solutions of supergravity theories. This condition agrees precisely with the conditions obtained in lower dimensions, as is necessary for consistency with Kaluza-klein dimensional reduction. These considerations also determine the charge lattice of BPS soliton states, which proves to be a universal modulus-independent lattice when the charges are defined to be the canonical charges corresponding to the quantum supergravity symmetry groups.
