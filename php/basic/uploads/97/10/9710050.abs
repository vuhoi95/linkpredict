Title: On the Structure of Quantum Gauge Theories with External Fields
Authors: S. Falkenberg and B. Geyer and P. Lavrov and P. Moshin
Abstract: We consider generating functionals of Green's functions with external fields in the framework of BV and BLT quantization schemes for general gauge theories. The corresponding Ward identities are obtained, and the gauge dependence is studied.
