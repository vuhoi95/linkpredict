Title: N=1 Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics on a Curved Space
Authors: M. Nakamura and N. Okamoto and H. Minowa
Abstract: The quantum mechanics of an N=1 supersymmetric dynamical system constrained to a hypersurface embedded in the higher dimensional Euclidean space is investigated by using the projection-operator method (POM) of constrained systems. It is shown that the Hamiltonian obtained by the successive operations of projection operators contains the additional terms, which are completely missed when imposing constraints before the quantization. We derive the conditions the additional terms should satisfy when the N=1 supersymmetry holds in the resulting system, and present the geometrical interpretations of these additional terms.
