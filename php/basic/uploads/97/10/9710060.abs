Title: Duality Symmetry and Soldering in Different Dimensions
Authors: R. Banerjee and C. Wotzasek
Abstract: We develop a systematic method of obtaining duality symmetric actions in different dimensions. This technique is applied for the quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator, the scalar field theory in two dimensions and the Maxwell theory in four dimensions. In all cases there are two such distinct actions. Furthermore, by soldering these distinct actions in any dimension a master action is obtained which is duality invariant under a much bigger set of symmetries than is usually envisaged. The concept of swapping duality is introduced and its implications are discussed. The effects of coupling to gravity are also elaborated. Finally, the extension of the analysis for arbitrary dimensions is indicated.
