Title: Gaugino condensate and Veneziano-Yankielowicz effective Lagrangian
Authors: Myck Schwetz and Maxim Zabzine
Abstract: We study the sypersymmetric pure Yang-Mills theory with semisimple Lie groups. We show that the general form of the gluino condensate is determined solely by the symmetries of the theory and it is in disagreement with the recently proposed existence of a conformal phase in SYM theory. We discuss the peculiarities of the Veneziano-Yankielowicz effective Lagrangian approach and explain how it is related to the calculation of the gluino condensate
