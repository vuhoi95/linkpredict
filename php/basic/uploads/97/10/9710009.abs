Title: A new explicit expression for the Korteweg-De Vries hierarchy
Authors: Ivan G. Avramidi and Rainer Schimming
Abstract: We derive an improved fully explicit expression for the right-hand sides of the matrix KdV hierarchy using the relation to the heat kernel of the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator. Our method of "matrix elements" produces, moreover, an explicit expression for the powers of a Schr\"odinger-like differential operator of any order.
