Title: Kontsevich Integral for Vassiliev Invariants from Chern-Simons  Perturbation Theory in the Light-Cone Gauge
Authors: J. M. F. Labastida and Esther Perez
Abstract: We analyse the structure of the perturbative series expansion of Chern-Simons gauge theory in the light-cone gauge. After introducing a regularization prescription that entails the consideration of framed knots, we present the general form of the vacuum expectation value of a Wilson loop. The resulting expression turns out to give the same framing dependence as the one obtained using non-perturbative methods and perturbative methods in covariant gauges. It also contains the Kontsevich integral for Vassiliev invariants of framed knots.
