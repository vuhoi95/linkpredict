Title: Higher-dimensional Generalisations of the Euler Top Equations
Authors: David B. Fairlie and Tatsuya Ueno
Abstract: Generalisations of the familiar Euler top equations in three dimensions are proposed which admit a sufficiently large number of conservation laws to permit integrability by quadratures. The usual top is a classical analogue of the Nahm equations. One of the examples discussed here is a seven-dimensional Euler top, which arises as a classical counterpart to the eight-dimensional self-dual equations which are currently believed to play a role in new developments in string theory.
