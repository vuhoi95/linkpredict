Title: Uhlenbeck compactness and transversality for the moduli space of PU(2)  monopoles
Authors: Paul M. N. Feehan and Thomas G. Leness
Abstract: This research announcement gives a brief report of the main results in our paper "PU(2) monopoles, I: Regularity, Uhlenbeck compactness, and transversality" (Journal of Differential Geometry, to appear). We describe the existence of perturbations for the PU(2) monopole equations, yielding both useful transversality properties and an Uhlenbeck compactification for this perturbed moduli space.
