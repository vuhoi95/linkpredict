Title: Proof of the Gauge Independence of the Conformal Anomaly of Bosonic  String in the Sense of Kraemmer and Rebhan
Authors: Mitsuo Abe and Noboru Nakanishi
Abstract: Kraemmer and Rebhan claimed the gauge independence of the conformal anomaly of bosonic string for various gauge fixings in the framework of the perturbation theory of two-dimensional quantum gravity. It is pointed out that their proof is wrong. The gauge independence is proved for the gauge-fixings which reduce to the linearized de Donder gauge in the flat limit of the background metric. Similar remarks are made also for the Rebhan-Kraemmer current anomaly.
