Title: The Geometry of Deformation Quantization and Self-Dual Gravity
Authors: Hugo Garcia-Compean and Jerzy F. Plebanski and Maciej Przanowski
Abstract: A geometric formulation of the Moyal deformation for the Self-dual Yang-Mills theory and the Chiral Model approach to Self-dual gravity is given. We find in Fedosov's geometrical construction of deformation quantization the natural geometrical framework associated to the Moyal deformation of Self-dual gravity.
