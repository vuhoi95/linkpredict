Title: Gravitational SD Perturbiner
Authors: A. Rosly and K. Selivanov
Abstract: We present here an explicit self-dual classical solution of the type of perturbiner in gravity. This solution is a generating function for tree gravitational form-factors with all on-shell gravitons in the same helicity state.
