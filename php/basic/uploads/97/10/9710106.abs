Title: Quantum Correction to the Entropy of the (2+1)-Dimensional Black Hole
Authors: A. A. Bytsenko and L. Vanzo and S. Zerbini
Abstract: The thermodynamic properties of the (2+1)-dimensional non-rotating black hole of Ba\~nados, Teitelboim and Zanelli are discussed. The first quantum correction to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is evaluated within the on-shell Euclidean formalism, making use of the related Chern-Simons representation of the 3-dimensional gravity. Horizon and ultraviolet divergences in the quantum correction are dealt with a renormalization of the Newton constant. It is argued that the quantum correction due to the gravitational field shrinks the effective radius of a hole and becomes more and more important as soon as the evaporation process goes on, while the area law is not violated.
