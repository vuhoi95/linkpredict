Title: Covariant actions for N=1, D=6 Supergravity theories with chiral bosons
Authors: G. Dall'Agata and K. Lechner and M. Tonin
Abstract: We show that the recently found covariant formulation for chiral $p$--forms in $2(p+1)$ dimensions with $p$ even, can be naturally extended to supersymmetric theories. We present the general method for writing covariant actions for chiral bosons and construct, in particular, in six dimensions covariant actions for one tensor supermultiplet, for pure supergravity and for supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of tensor supermultiplets.
