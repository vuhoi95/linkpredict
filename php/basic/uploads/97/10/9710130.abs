Title: Self-Adjointness and Polarization of the Fermionic Vacuum in the  Background of Nontrivial Topology
Authors: Yu. A. Sitenko and D. G. Rakityansky
Abstract: Singular configuration of an external static magnetic field in the form of a string polarizes vacuum in the secondly quantized theory on a plane which is orthogonal to the string axis. We consider the most general boundary conditions at the punctured singular point, which are compatible with the self-adjointness of the two-dimensional Dirac Hamiltonian. The dependence of the induced vacuum quantum numbers on the self-adjoint extension parameter and the flux of the string is determined.
