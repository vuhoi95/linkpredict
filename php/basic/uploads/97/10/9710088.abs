Title: Induced Chern-Simons terms
Authors: Jim McCarthy and Andy Wilkins
Abstract: We examine the claim that the effective action of four-dimensional SU(2)_L gauge theory at high and low temperature contains a three-dimensional Chern-Simons term with coefficient being the chemical potential for baryon number. We perform calculations in a two-dimensional toy model and find that the existence of the term is rather subtle.
