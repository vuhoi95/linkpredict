Title: A new method to measure the chiral condensate in lattice QCD using  Wilson fermions
Authors: Khalil M. Bitar and Urs M. Heller and Rajamani Narayanan
Abstract: Parity and flavor symmetry is not broken in QCD. Using this fact, we propose a new method to measure the chiral condensate in lattice QCD using Wilson fermions with an operator that breaks parity and flavor in addition to the chiral symmetry.
