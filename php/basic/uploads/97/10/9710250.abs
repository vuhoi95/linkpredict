Abstract: Manifestly N=2 supersymmetric Feynman rules are found for different off-shell realizations of the massless hypermultiplet in projective superspace. When we reduce the Feynman rules to an N=1 superspace we obtain the correct component propagators. The Feynman rules are shown to be compatible with a ``duality'' that acts only on the auxiliary fields, as well as with the usual duality relating the hypermultiplet to the tensor multiplet.
