Title: Instanton Effects in Hadron Spectroscopy in SU(2) (Lattice) Gauge Theory
Authors: Thomas DeGrand and Anna Hasenfratz and Tamas G. Kovacs
Abstract: We describe quenched spectroscopy in SU(2) gauge theory using smoothed gauge field configurations. We investigate the properties of quarks moving in instanton background field configurations, where the sizes and locations of the instantons are taken from simulations of the full gauge theory. By themselves, these multi-instanton configurations do not confine quarks, but they induce chiral symmetry breaking.
