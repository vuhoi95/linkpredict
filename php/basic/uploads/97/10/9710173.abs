Title: Applying the linear delta expansion to `i phi^3'
Authors: M. P. Blencowe and H. F. Jones and A. P. Korte
Abstract: The linear $\delta$ expansion (LDE) is applied to the Hamiltonian $H=(p^2 +m^2 x^2)/2 + igx^3$, which arises in the study of Lee-Yang zeros in statistical mechanics. Despite being non-Hermitian, this Hamiltonian appears to possess a real, positive spectrum. In the LDE, as in perturbation theory, the eigenvalues are naturally real, so a proof of this property devolves on the convergence of the expansion. A proof of convergence of a modified version of the LDE is provided for the $ix^3$ potential in zero dimensions. The methods developed in zero dimensions are then extended to quantum mechanics, where we provide numerical evidence for convergence.
