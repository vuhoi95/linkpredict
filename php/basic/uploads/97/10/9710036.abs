Title: Radiation from a charged particle and radiation reaction -- revisited
Authors: Abhinav Gupta and T. Padmanabhan
Abstract: We study the electromagnetic fields of an arbitrarily moving charged particle and the radiation reaction on the charged particle using a novel approach. We first show that the fields of an arbitrarily moving charged particle in an inertial frame can be related in a simple manner to the fields of a uniformly accelerated charged particle in its rest frame. Since the latter field is static and easily obtainable, it is possible to derive the fields of an arbitrarily moving charged particle by a coordinate transformation. More importantly, this formalism allows us to calculate the self-force on a charged particle in a remarkably simple manner. We show that the original expression for this force, obtained by Dirac, can be rederived with much less computation and in an intuitively simple manner using our formalism.
