Title: Extended Electrodynamics: III. Free Photons and (3+1)-Soliton- like  Vacuum Solutions
Authors: S. Donev and M. Tashkova
Abstract: This paper aims to give explicitly all non-linear vacuum solutions to our non-linear field equations, and to define in a coordinate free manner the important subclass of non-linear solutions, which we call almost photon-like. By means of a correct introduction of the local and integral intrinsic angular momentums of these solutions, we saparate the photon-like solutions through the requirement their integral intrinsic angular momentums to be equal to the Planck's constant. Finally, we consider such solutions, moving radially to or from a given center, using standard spherical coordinates.
