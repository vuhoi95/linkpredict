Title: Collective Dynamics of Solitons and Inequivalent Quantizations
Authors: Juan Pedro Garrahan and Martin Kruczenski
Abstract: The collective dynamics of solitons with a coset space G/H as moduli space is studied. It is shown that the collective band for a vibrational state is given by the inequivalent coset space quantization corresponding to the representation of H carried by the vibration.
