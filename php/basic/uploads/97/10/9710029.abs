Title: Matrix String Theory from Brane Configuration
Authors: Kei Ito and Nobuhito Maru
Abstract: Configurations of fivebranes, twobranes and fourbranes in type IIA string theory, which give (1+1) dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories in the low energy limit, are constructed. It is shown that these brane configurations are equivalent to a certain class of matrix string theories. This opens up an avenue for the investigation of matrix string dynamics via the geometry of the brane configurations in type IIA string theory.
