Title: Creation of Fundamental String in M(atrix) Theory
Authors: Nobuyoshi Ohta and Takashi Shimizu and Jian-Ge Zhou
Abstract: The potential between two D4-branes at angles with partially unbroken supersymmetry is computed, and is used to discuss the creation of a fundamental string when two such D4-branes cross each other in M(atrix) theory. The effective Lagrangian is shown to be anomalous at 1-loop approximation, but it can be modified by bare Chern-Simons terms to preserve the invariance under the large gauge transformation. The resulting effective potential agrees with that obtained from the string calculations. The result shows that a fundamental string is created in order to cancel the repulsive force between two D4-branes at proper angles.
