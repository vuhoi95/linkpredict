Title: Loop Corrections and Bosonization Formulae
Authors: C. D. Fosco and C. Núñez and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We study the functional integrals that appear in a path integral bosonization procedure for more than two spacetime dimensions. Since they are not in general exactly solvable, their evaluation by a suitable loop expansion would be a natural procedure, even if the exact fermionic determinant were known. The outcome of our study is that we can consistently ignore loop corrections in the functional integral defining the bosonized action, if the same is done for the functional integral corresponding to the bosonic representation of the generating functional. If contributions up to some order $l$ in the number of loops are included in both integrals, all but the lowest terms cancel out in the final result for the generating functional.
