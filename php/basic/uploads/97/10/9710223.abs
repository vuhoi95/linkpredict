Title: M-Fivebrane from the Open Supermembrane
Authors: C. S. Chu and E. Sezgin
Abstract: Covariant field equations of M-fivebrane in eleven dimensional curved superspace are obtained from the requirement of kappa-symmetry of an open supermembrane ending on a fivebrane. The worldvolume of the latter is a (6|16) dimensional supermanifold embedded in the (11|32) dimensional target superspace. The kappa-symmetry of the system imposes a constraint on this embedding, and a constraint on a modified super 3-form field strength on the fivebrane worldvolume. These constraints govern the dynamics of the M-fivebrane.
