Title: An Exact QED_{3+1} Effective Action
Authors: Gerald Dunne and Theodore M. Hall
Abstract: We compute the exact QED_{3+1} effective action for fermions in the presence of a family of static but spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field profiles. An asymptotic expansion of this exact effective action yields an all-orders derivative expansion, the first terms of which agree with independent derivative expansion computations. These results generalize analogous earlier results by Cangemi et al in QED_{2+1}.
