Abstract: A system of equations of the reaction-diffusion type is studied in the framework of both the direct and the inverse prolongation structure. We find that this system allows an incomplete prolongation Lie algebra, which is used to find the spectral problem and a whole class of nonlinear field equations containing the original ones as a special case.
