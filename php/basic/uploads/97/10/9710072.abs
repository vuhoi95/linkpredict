Title: Twistor Spaces for QKT Manifolds
Authors: P. S. Howe and A. Opfermann and G. Papadopoulos
Abstract: We find that the target space of two-dimensional (4,0) supersymmetric sigma models with torsion coupled to (4,0) supergravity is a QKT manifold, that is, a quaternionic K\"ahler manifold with torsion. We give four examples of geodesically complete QKT manifolds one of which is a generalisation of the LeBrun geometry. We then construct the twistor space associated with a QKT manifold and show that under certain conditions it is a K\"ahler manifold with a complex contact structure. We also show that, for every 4k-dimensional QKT manifold, there is an associated 4(k+1)-dimensional hyper-K\"ahler one.
