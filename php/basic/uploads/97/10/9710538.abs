Title: High Temperature Dimensional Reduction and Parity Violation
Authors: K. Kajantie and M. Laine and K. Rummukainen and M. Shaposhnikov
Abstract: The effective super-renormalizable 3-dimensional Lagrangian, describing the high temperature limit of chiral gauge theories, has more symmetry than the original 4d Lagrangian: parity violation is absent. Parity violation appears in the 3d theory only through higher-dimensional operators. We compute the coefficients of dominant P-odd operators in the Standard Electroweak theory and discuss their implications. We also clarify the parametric accuracy obtained with dimensional reduction.
