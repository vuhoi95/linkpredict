Title: Quantum Field Theory, Bosonization and Duality on the Half Line
Authors: Antonio Liguori and Mihail Mintchev
Abstract: We develop a bosonization procedure on the half line. Different boundary conditions, formulated in terms of the vector and axial fermion currents, are implemented by using in general the mixed boundary condition on the bosonic field. The interplay between symmetries and boundary conditions is investigated in this context, with a particular emphasis on duality. As an application, we explicitly construct operator solutions of the massless Thirring model on the half line, respecting different boundary conditions.
