Title: Why Matrix Theory is Hard
Authors: Michael R. Douglas and Hirosi Ooguri
Abstract: Recently Sen and Seiberg gave a prescription for constructing the matrix theory in any superstring background. We use their prescription to test the finite N matrix theory conjecture on an ALE space. Based on our earlier work with Shenker, we find a sharper discrepancy between matrix theory computation and supergravity prediction. We discuss subtleties in the light-front quantization which may lead to a resolution to the discrepancy.
