Title: On the Picard-Fuchs Equations for Massive N=2 Seiberg-Witten Theories
Authors: Jose M. Isidro and Avijit Mukherjee and Joao P. Nunes and Howard J. Schnitzer
Abstract: A new method to obtain the Picard-Fuchs equations of effective, N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories with massive matter hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation is presented. It generalises a previously described method to derive the Picard-Fuchs equations of both pure super Yang-Mills and supersymmetric gauge theories with massless matter hypermultiplets. The techniques developed are well suited to symbolic computer calculations.
