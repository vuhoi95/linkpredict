Title: Fusion rules and singular vectors of the osp(1|2) current algebra
Authors: I. P. Ennes and A. V. Ramallo
Abstract: The fusion of Verma modules of the osp(1|2) current algebra is studied. In the framework of an isotopic formalism, the singular vector decoupling conditions are analyzed. The fusion rules corresponding to the admissible representations of the osp(1|2) algebra are determined. A relation between the characters of these last representations and those corresponding to the minimal superconformal models is found. A series of equations that relate the descendants of the highest weight vectors resulting from a fusion of Verma modules are obtained. Solving these equations the singular vectors of the theory can be determined.
