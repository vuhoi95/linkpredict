Title: Slowly Rotating Non-Abelian Black Holes
Authors: Mikhail S. Volkov and Norbert Straumann
Abstract: It is shown that the well-known non-Abelian static SU(2) black hole solutions have rotating generalizations, provided that the hypothesis of linearization stability is accepted. Surprisingly, this rotating branch has an asymptotically Abelian gauge field with an electric charge that cannot vanish, although the non-rotating limit is uncharged. We argue that this may be related to our second finding, namely that there are no globally regular slowly rotating excitations of the particle-like Bartnik-McKinnon solutions.
