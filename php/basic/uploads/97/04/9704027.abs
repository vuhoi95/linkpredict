Title: On the Uniqueness of the effective Lagrangian for N= 2 SQCD
Authors: M. Magro and L. O'Raifeartaigh and I. Sachs
Abstract: The low energy effective Lagrangian for N= 2 SU(2) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory coupled to N_F<4 massless matter fields is derived from the BPS mass formula using asymptotic freedom and assuming that the number of strong coupling singularities is finite.
