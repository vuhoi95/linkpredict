Title: Geon Statistics and UIR's of the Mapping Class Group
Authors: Rafael D. Sorkin and Sumati Surya
Abstract: Quantum Gravity admits topological excitations of microscopic scale which can manifest themselves as particles --- topological geons. Non-trivial spatial topology also brings into the theory free parameters analogous to the $\theta$-angle of QCD. We show that these parameters can be interpreted in terms of geon properties. We also find that, for certain values of the parameters, the geons exhibit new patterns of particle identity together with new types of statistics. Geon indistinguishability in such a case is expressed by a proper subgroup of the permutation group and geon statistics by a (possibly projective) representation of the subgroup.
