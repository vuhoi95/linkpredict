Title: Zero Curvature Formalism for Supersymmetric Integrable Hierarchies in  Superspace
Authors: H. Aratyn and A. Das and C. Rasinariu
Abstract: We generalize the Drinfeld-Sokolov formalism of bosonic integrable hierarchies to superspace, in a way which systematically leads to the zero curvature formulation for the supersymmetric integrable systems starting from the Lax equation in superspace. We use the method of symmetric space as well as the non-Abelian gauge technique to obtain the supersymmetric integrable hierarchies of the AKNS type from the zero curvature condition in superspace with the graded algebras, sl(n+1,n), providing the Hermitian symmetric space structure.
