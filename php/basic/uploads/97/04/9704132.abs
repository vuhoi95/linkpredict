Title: Lagrangian formulation of irreducible massive fields of arbitrary spin  in 2+1 dimensions
Authors: Igor Tyutin and Mikhail Vasiliev
Abstract: Lagrangian formulation of free massive fields corresponding to irreducible representations of the Poincare group of arbitrary integer and half-integer spins in three-dimensional space-time is presented. A relationship of the theory under consideration with the self-duality equations in four dimensions is discussed.
