Title: Chiral Symmetry Breaking in QED in a Magnetic Field at Finite  Temperature
Authors: V. P. Gusynin and I. A. Shovkovy
Abstract: The catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking in the massless weakly coupled QED in a magnetic field at finite temperature is studied. The temperature of the symmetry restoration is estimated analytically as $T_c\simeq m_{dyn}$, where $m_{dyn}$ is the dynamical mass of a fermion at zero temperature.
