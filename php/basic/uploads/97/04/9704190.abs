Title: On the Opening of Branes
Authors: R. Argurio and F. Englert and L. Houart and P. Windey
Abstract: We relate, in 10 and 11 dimensional supergravities, configurations of intersecting closed branes with vanishing binding energy to configurations where one of the branes opens and has its boundaries attached to the other. These boundaries are charged with respect to fields living on the closed brane. The latter hosts electric and magnetic charges stemming from dual pairs of open branes terminating on it. We show that charge conservation, gauge invariance and supersymmetry entirely determine these charges and these fields, which can be seen as Goldstone fields of broken supersymmetry. Open brane boundary charges can annihilate, restoring the zero binding energy configuration. This suggests emission of closed branes by branes, a generalization of closed string emission by D-branes. We comment on the relation of the Goldstone fields to matrix models approaches to M-theory.
