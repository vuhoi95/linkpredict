Abstract: We discuss the quantum equivalence, to all orders of perturbation theory, between the Yang-Mills theory and its first order formulation through a second rank antisymmetric tensor field. Moreover, the introduction of an additional nonphysical vector field allows us to interpret the Yang-Mills theory as a kind of perturbation of the topological BF model.
