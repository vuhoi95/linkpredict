Title: Free Field Realizations of 2D Current Algebras, Screening Currents and  Primary Fields
Authors: J. L. Petersen and J. Rasmussen and M. Yu
Abstract: In this paper we consider Wakimoto free field realizations of simple affine Lie algebras, a subject already much studied. We present three new sets of results. (i) Based on quantizing differential operator realizations of the corresponding Lie algebras we provide general universal very simple expressions for all currents, more compact than has been established so far. (ii) We supplement the treatment of screening currents of the first kind, known in the literature, by providing a direct proof of the properties for screening currents of the second kind. Finally (iii) we work out explicit free field realizations of primary fields with general non-integer weights. We use a formalism where the (generally infinite) multiplet is replaced by a generating function primary operator. These results taken together allow setting up integral representations for correlators of primary fields corresponding to non-integrable degenerate (in particular admissible) representations.
