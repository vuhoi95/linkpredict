Title: A Simple Action for a Free Anyon
Authors: D. Dalmazi and A. de Souza Dutra
Abstract: By studying classical realizations of the sl(2,R) algebra in a two dimensional phase space $(q,\pi)$, we have derived a continuous family of new actions for free anyons in 2+1 dimensions. For the case of light-like spin vector $(S_\mu S^\mu =0)$, the action is remarkably simple. We show the appearence of the Zitterbewegung in the solutions of the equations of motion, and relate the actions to others in the literature at classical level.
