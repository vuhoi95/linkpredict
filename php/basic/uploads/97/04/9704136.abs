Title: Renormalization trasformations of the 4D BFYM theory
Authors: Alberto Accardi and Andrea Belli
Abstract: We study the most general renormalization transformations for the first-order formulation of the Yang-Mills theory. We analyze, in particular, the trivial sector of the BRST cohomology of two possible formulations of the model: the standard one and the extended one. The latter is a promising starting point for the interpretation of the Yang-Mills theory as a deformation of the topological BF theory. This work is a necessary preliminary step towards any perturbative calculation, and completes some recently obtained results.
