Title: Screening in three-dimensional QED
Authors: E. Abdalla and R. Banerjee
Abstract: We compute the quark-antiquark potential in three dimensional massive Quantum Electrodynamics. The result indicates that screening prevails for large quark masses, contrary to the classical expectations. The classical result is reproduced for small separation of the quarks.
