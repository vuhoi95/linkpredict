Title: Generalization of the Bound State Model
Authors: Masayasu Harada and Francesco Sannino and Joseph Schechter and Herbert Weigel
Abstract: In the bound state approach the heavy baryons are constructed by binding, with any orbital angular momentum, the heavy meson multiplet to the nucleon considered as a soliton in an effective meson theory. We point out that this picture misses an entire family of states, labeled by a different angular momentum quantum number, which are expected to exist according to the geometry of the three-body constituent quark model (for N_C=3). To solve this problem we propose that the bound state model be generalized to include orbitally excited heavy mesons bound to the nucleon. In this approach the missing angular momentum is ``locked-up'' in the excited heavy mesons. In the simplest dynamical realization of the picture we give conditions on a set of coupling constants for the binding of the missing heavy baryons of arbitrary spin. The simplifications made include working in the large M limit, neglecting nucleon recoil corrections, neglecting mass differences among different heavy spin multiplets and also neglecting the effects of light vector mesons.
