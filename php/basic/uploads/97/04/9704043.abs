Title: Type IIA Superstrings, Chiral Symmetry, and N=1 4D Gauge Theory  Dualities
Authors: John H. Brodie and Amihay Hanany
Abstract: We study N=1 four dimensional gauge theories as the world volume theory of D4-branes between NS 5-branes. We find constructions for a number of known field theory dualities involving $SU(N_c)\times SU(N_c')$ groups, coupled by matter fields F in the $(N_c, \bar N_c)$ representation, in terms of branes of type IIA string theory. The dual gauge group follows from simply reversing the ordering of the NS 5-branes and the D6-branes while conserving magnetic charge on the world volume of the branes. We interpret many field theory phenomena such as deformation of the superpotential $W = \Tr (F\tilde F)^{k+1}$ in terms of the position of branes. By looking to D-branes for guidance, we find new N=1 dualities involving arbitrary numbers of gauge groups. We propose a mechanism for enhanced chiral symmetry in the brane construction which, we conjecture, is associated with tensionless threebranes in six dimensions.
