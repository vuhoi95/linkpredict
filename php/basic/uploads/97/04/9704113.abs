Title: Couplings in Asymmetric Orbifolds and Grand Unified String Models
Authors: Zurab Kakushadze and Gary Shiu and S. -H. Henry Tye
Abstract: Using the bosonic supercurrent (or covariant lattice) formalism, we review how to compute scattering amplitudes in asymmetric orbifold string models. This method is particularly useful for calculating scattering of multiple asymmetrically twisted string states, where the twisted states are rewritten as ordinary momentum states. We show how to reconstruct some of the 3-family grand unified string models in this formalism, and identify the quantum numbers of the massless states in their spectra. The discrete symmetries of these models are rather intricate. The superpotentials for the 3-family E_6 model and a closely related SO(10) model are discussed in some detail. The forms of the superpotentials of the two 3-family SU(6) models (with asymptotically-free hidden sectors SU(3) and SU(2) \otimes SU(2)) are also presented.
