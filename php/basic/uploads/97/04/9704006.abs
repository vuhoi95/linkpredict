Title: Complex Analysis of a Piece of Toda Lattice
Authors: Satoru Saito and Noriko Saitoh and Hisao Konuma and Katsuhiko Yoshida
Abstract: We study a small piece of two dimensional Toda lattice as a complex dynamical system. In particular the Julia set, which appears when the piece is deformed, is shown analytically how it disappears as the system approaches to the integrable limit.
