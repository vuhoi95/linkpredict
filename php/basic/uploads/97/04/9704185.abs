Title: Chirality Changing Phase Transitions in 4d String Vacua
Authors: Shamit Kachru and Eva Silverstein
Abstract: We provide evidence that some four-dimensional N=1 string vacua with different numbers of generations are connected through phase transitions. The transitions involve going through a point in moduli space where there is a nontrivial fixed point governing the low energy field theory. In an M-theory description, the examples involve wrapped 5-branes leaving one of the ends of the world.
