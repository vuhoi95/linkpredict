Title: Normal Mode Spectrum of the Deuteron in the Skyrme Model
Authors: C. Barnes and W. K. Baskerville and N. Turok
Abstract: The normal mode spectrum of the deuteron in the Skyrme model is computed. We find a bound doublet mode below the pion mass, which can be related to the well-known $90^{\circ}$ scattering of two skyrmions. We also find a singlet `breather' mode and another doublet above the pion mass. The qualitative pattern of the spectrum is similar to that recently found for the B=4 multiskyrmion. The symmetries of all the vibrational modes are presented.
