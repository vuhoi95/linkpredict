Title: Absorption of fixed scalar in scattering off 4D N=4 black holes
Authors: H. W. Lee and Y. S. Myung and Jin Young Kim
Abstract: We perform the perturbation analysis of the black holes in the 4D, N=4 supergravity. Analysis around the black holes reveals a complicated mixing between the dilaton and other fields (metric and two U(1) Maxwell fields). It turns out that considering both s-wave (l=0) and higher momentum modes (l \neq 0), the dilaton as a fixed scalar is the only propagating mode with $P=Q, h_1=h_2=0$ and $F = -G = 2\phi$. We calculate the absorption cross-section for scattering of low frequency waves of fixed scalar and U(1) Maxwell fields off the extremal black hole.
