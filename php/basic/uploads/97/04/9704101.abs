Title: Type -B/ -O Bosonic String Sigma-Models
Authors: S. James Gates, Jr and V. G. J. Rodgers
Abstract: We provide world sheet non-supersymmetrical actions that describe the coupling of a bosonic string to the tachyon and massless states of both the type-B and type-O theories. The type-B theory is derived as a truncation and chiral doubling of the Ramond-Ramond sector in our previous model that connected the (1,0) heterotic string to a 10 D type IIB supergravity background. The type-O theory then follows from a ``fermionization'' of the type-B theory.
