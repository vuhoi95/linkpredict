Title: Superparticles in D>11
Authors: I. Rudychev and E. Sezgin
Abstract: Actions for two-superparticle system in (10,2) dimensions and three-superparticle systems in (11,3) dimensions are constructed. These actions have worldline bosonic and fermionic local symmetries, and target space global supersymmety generalizing the reparametrization, kappa-symmetry and Poincare supersymmetry of the usual superparticle. With the second particle, or the second and third particles on-shell, they describe a superparticle propagating in the background of a second superparticle in (10,2) dimensions, or two other superparticles in (11,3) dimensions. Symmetries of the action are shown to exist in presence of super Yang-Mills background as well.
