Title: Constrained twistors principle of the string theory
Authors: A. A. Kapustnikov and S. A. Ulanov
Abstract: The new principle of constrained twistor-like variables is proposed for construction of the Cartan 1-forms on the worldsheet of the D=3,4,6 bosonic strings. The corresponding equations of motion are derived. Among them there are two well-known Liouville equations for real and complex worldsheet functions W(s,\bar s). The third one in which W(s,\bar s) is replaced by the quaternionic worldsheet function is unknown and can be thought of as that of the SU(2) nonlinear sigma-model governing the classical dynamics of the bosonic string in D=6.
