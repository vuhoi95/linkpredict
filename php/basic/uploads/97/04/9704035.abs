Title: Ray-Singer Torsion for a Hyperbolic 3-Manifold and Asymptotics of  Chern-Simons-Witten Invariant
Authors: Andrei A. Bytsenko and Luciano Vanzo and Sergio Zerbini
Abstract: The Ray-Singer torsion for a compact smooth hyperbolic 3-dimensional manifold ${\cal H}^3$ is expressed in terms of Selberg zeta-functions, making use of the associated Selberg trace formulae. Applications to the evaluation of the semiclassical asymptotics of the Witten's invariant for the Chern-Simons theory with gauge group SU(2) as well as to the sum over topologies in 3-dimensional quantum gravity are presented.
