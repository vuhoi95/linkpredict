Title: Closed Inhomogeneous String Cosmologies
Authors: A. Feinstein and Ruth Lazkoz and M. A. Vazquez-Mozo
Abstract: We present a general algorithm which permits to construct solutions in string cosmology for heterotic and type-IIB superstrings in four dimensions. Using a chain of transformations applied in sequence: conformal, T-duality and SL(2,R) rotations, along with the usual generating techniques associated to Geroch transformations in Einstein frame, we obtain solutions with all relevant low-energy remnants of the string theory. To exemplify our algorithm we present an inhomogeneous string cosmology with S^3 topology of spatial sections, discuss some properties of the solution and point out some subtleties involved in the concept of homogeneity and isotropy in string cosmology.
