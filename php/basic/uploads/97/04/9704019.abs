Title: Constrained Dynamical Systems: Separation of Constraints into First and  Second Classes
Authors: N. P. Chitaia and S. A. Gogilidze and Yu. S. Surovtsev
Abstract: In the Dirac approach to the generalized Hamiltonian formalism, dynamical systems with first- and second-class constraints are investigated. The classification and separation of constraints into the first- and second-class ones are presented with the help of passing to an equivalent canonical set of constraints. The general structure of second-class constraints is clarified.
