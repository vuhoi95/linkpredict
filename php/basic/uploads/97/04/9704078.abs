Title: 3-dimensional Rules for Finite-Temperature Loops
Authors: C. Dib and O. Espinosa and I. Schmidt
Abstract: We present simple diagrammatic rules to write down Euclidean n-point functions at finite temperature directly in terms of 3-dimensional momentum integrals, without ever performing a single Matsubara sum. The rules can be understood as describing the interaction of the external particles with those of the thermal bath.
