Title: Quantum white noise with singular non-linear interaction
Authors: L. Accardi and I. V. Volovich
Abstract: A model of a system driven by quantum white noise with singular quadratic self--interaction is considered and an exact solution for the evolution operator is found. It is shown that the renormalized square of the squeezed classical white noise is equivalent to the quantum Poisson process. We describe how equations driven by nonlinear functionals of white noise can be derived in nonlinear quantum optics by using the stochastic approximation.
