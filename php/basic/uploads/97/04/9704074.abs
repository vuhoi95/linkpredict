Title: On trigonometric intertwining vectors and non-dynamical R-matrix for the  Ruijsenaars model
Authors: A. Antonov and K. Hasegawa and A. Zabrodin
Abstract: We elaborate the trigonometric version of intertwining vectors and factorized L-operators. The starting point is the corresponding elliptic construction with Belavin's R-matrix. The naive trigonometric limit is singular and a careful analysis is needed. It is shown that the construction admits several different trigonometric degenerations. As a by-product, a quantum Lax operator for the trigonometric Ruijsenaars model intertwined by a non-dynamical R-matrix is obtained. The latter differs from the standard trigonometric R-matrix of $A_n$ type. A connection with the dynamical R-matrix approach is discussed.
