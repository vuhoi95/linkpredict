Title: Semi-classical Quantization in N=4 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory and  Duality
Authors: Christophe Fraser and Timothy J. Hollowood
Abstract: At a generic point in the moduli space of vacua of an N=4 supersymmetric gauge theory with arbitrary gauge group the Higgs force does not cancel the magneto-static force between magnetic monopoles of distinct charge. As a consequence the moduli space of magnetically charged solutions is related in a simple way to those of the SU(2) theory. This leads to a rather simple test of S-duality. On certain subspaces of the moduli space of vacua the forces between distinct monopoles cancel and the test of S-duality becomes more complicated.
