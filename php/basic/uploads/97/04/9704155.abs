Title: Abelian Projection of SU(2) Gluodynamics and Monopole Condensate
Authors: M. N. Chernodub and M. I. Polikarpov and A. I. Veselov
Abstract: The general properties of the abelian projection are reviewed. We derive the explicit expression for the abelian functional integral for U(1) abelian theory which corresponds to the abelian projection of the SU(2) gluodynamics. The numerical results for the temperature dependence of the monopole condensate are presented.
