Title: Pasti-Sorokin-Tonin Actions in the Presence of Sources
Authors: R. Medina and N. Berkovits
Abstract: Pasti, Sorokin and Tonin have recently constructed manifestly Lorentz-invariant actions for self-dual field strengths and for Maxwell fields with manifest electromagnetic duality. Using the method of Deser, Gomberoff, Henneaux and Teitelboim, we generalize these actions in the presence of sources.
