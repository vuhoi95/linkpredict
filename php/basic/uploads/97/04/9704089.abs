Title: Matrix Description of M-theory on $T^4$ and $T^5$
Authors: Micha Berkooz and Moshe Rozali and Nathan Seiberg
Abstract: We study the Matrix theory description of M-theory compactified on $T^4$ and $T^5$. M-theory on $T^4$ is described by the six dimensional (2,0) fixed point field theory compactified on a five torus, $\widetilde T^5$. For M-theory on $T^5$ we suggest the existence of a new theory which is compactified on a $\widetilde T^5$. The IR description of this theory is given by the (2,0) theory with a compactified moduli space. This new theory appears to be a new kind of a non-critical string theory. Clearly, these two descriptions differ from the ``standard'' Super-Yang-Mills on the dual torus prescription.
