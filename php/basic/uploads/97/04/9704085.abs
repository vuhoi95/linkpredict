Title: Second-Class Constraints and Local Symmetries
Authors: N. P. Chitaia and S. A. Gogilidze and Yu. S. Surovtsev
Abstract: In the framework of the generalized Hamiltonian formalism by Dirac, the local symmetries of dynamical systems with first- and second-class constraints are investigated. For theories with an algebra of constraints of special form (to which a majority of the physically interesting theories belongs) the method of constructing the generator of local-symmetry transformations is obtained from the requirement of the quasi-invariance of an action. It is proved that second-class constraints do not contribute to the transformation law of the local symmetry which entirely is stipulated by all the first-class constraints. It is thereby shown that degeneracy of special form theories with the first- and second-class constraints is due to their quasi-invariance under local-symmetry transformations.
