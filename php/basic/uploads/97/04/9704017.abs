Title: A Possible IIB Superstring Matrix Model with Euler Characteristic and a  Double Scaling Limit
Authors: C. Kristjansen and P. Olesen
Abstract: We show that a recently proposed Yang-Mills matrix model with an auxiliary field, which is a candidate for a non-perturbative description of type IIB superstrings, captures the Euler characteristic of moduli space of Riemann surfaces. This happens at the saddle point for the Yang-Mills field. It turns out that the large-n limit in this matrix model corresponds to a double scaling limit in the Penner model.
