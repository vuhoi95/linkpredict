Abstract: It is shown that the 1+1-dimensional matter-coupled Jackiw-Teitelboim model and the model with an exponential potential can be converted by means of appropriate canonical transformations into a bosonic string theory propagating on a flat target space with an indefinite signature. This makes it possible to consistently quantize these models in the functional Schroedinger representation thus generalizing recent results on CGHS theory.
