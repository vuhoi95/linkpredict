Title: QCD near the Light Cone
Authors: H. W. L. Naus and H. J. Pirner and T. J. Fields and J. P. Vary
Abstract: Starting from the QCD Lagrangian, we present the QCD Hamiltonian for near light cone coordinates. We study the dynamics of the gluonic zero modes of this Hamiltonian. The strong coupling solutions serve as a basis for the complete problem. We discuss the importance of zero modes for the confinement mechanism.
