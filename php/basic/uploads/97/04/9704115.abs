Title: Quantization of dilaton cosmology in two dimensions
Authors: Won T. Kim and Myungseok Yoon
Abstract: The generalized kinetic term of a dilaton gives the classical superinflation without recourse to any potential, and the quantum version of the dilaton gravity exhibits the finite curvature and graceful exit. For $p=2$ case, the model corresponds to the RST quantization of the s-wave sector of the four-dimensional Einstein cosmology. Further, the de Sitter universe is realized for $p=8$ and the smooth transition to the Minkowski space-time is possible. Even in the accelerating contraction case of the universe for $-4<p<0$, the curvature singularity does not appear in a certain branch.
