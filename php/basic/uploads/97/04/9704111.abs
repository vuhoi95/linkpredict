Title: The Structure of Verma Modules over the N=2 Superconformal Algebra
Authors: A M Semikhatov and I Yu Tipunin
Abstract: We classify degeneration patterns of Verma modules over the N=2 superconformal algebra in two dimensions. Explicit formulae are given for singular vectors that generate maximal submodules in each of the degenerate cases. The mappings between Verma modules defined by these singular vectors are embeddings; in particular, their compositions never vanish. As a by-product, we also obtain general formulae for N=2 subsingular vectors.
