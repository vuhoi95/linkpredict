Title: On the solution of a supersymmetric model of correlated electrons
Authors: M. J. Martins and P. B. Ramos
Abstract: We consider the exact solution of a model of correlated electrons based on the superalgebra $Osp(2|2)$. The corresponding Bethe ansatz equations have an interesting form. We derive an expression for the ground state energy at half filling. We also present the eigenvalue of the transfer matrix commuting with the Hamiltonian.
