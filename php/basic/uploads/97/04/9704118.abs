Title: Deformed Chern-Simons Theories
Authors: G. Bimonte and R. Musto and A. Stern and P. Vitale
Abstract: We construct a Chern-Simons action for q-deformed gauge theory which is a simple and straightforward generalization of the usual one. Space-time continues to be an ordinary (commuting) manifold, while the gauge potentials and the field strengths become q-commuting fields. Our approach, which is explicitly carried out for the case of `minimal' deformations, has the advantage of leading naturally to a consistent Hamiltonian structure that has essentially all of the features of the undeformed case. For example, using the new Poisson brackets, the constraints form a closed algebra and generate q-deformed gauge transformations.
