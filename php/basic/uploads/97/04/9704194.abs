Title: The Two-Loop Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian in Dimensional Renormalization
Authors: Denny Fliegner and Martin Reuter and Michael G. Schmidt and Christian Schubert
Abstract: We clarify a discrepancy between two previous calculations of the two-loop QED Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian, both performed in proper-time regularization, by calculating this quantity in dimensional regularization.
