Title: Experimental limits on complete positivity from the K-K system
Authors: F. Benatti and R. Floreanini
Abstract: Available data on measured observables allow deriving estimates for some of the phenomenological parameters that characterize the time-evolution and decay of the neutral kaon system based on the hypothesis of complete positivity. The present experimental uncertainties are still too large to permit a full test of complete positivity.
