Abstract: Coupling constant renormalization is investigated in 2 dimensional sigma models related by non Abelian duality transformations. In this respect it is shown that in the one loop order of perturbation theory the duals of a one parameter family of models, interpolating between the SU(2) principal model and the O(3) sigma model, exhibit the same behaviour as the original models. For the O(3) model also the two loop equivalence is investigated, and is found to be broken just like in the already known example of the principal model.
