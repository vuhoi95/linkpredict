Title: Supersymmetry without Supersymmetry
Authors: M. J. Duff and H. Lu and C. N. Pope
Abstract: We present four-dimensional M-theory vacua with N>0 supersymmetry which, from the perspective of perturbative Type IIA string theory, have N=0. Such vacua can appear when the compactifying 7-manifold is a U(1) fibration. The missing superpartners are Dirichlet 0-branes. Someone unable to detect Ramond-Ramond charge would thus conclude that these worlds have no unbroken supersymmetry. In particular, the gravitinos (and also some of the gauge bosons) are 0-branes not seen in perturbation theory but which curiously remain massless however weak the string coupling.
