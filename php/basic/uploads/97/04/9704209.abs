Title: Antisymplectic Gauge Theories
Authors: Igor Batalin and Robert Marnelius
Abstract: A general field-antifield BV formalism for antisymplectic first class constraints is proposed. It is as general as the corresponding symplectic BFV-BRST formulation and it is demonstrated to be consistent with a previously proposed formalism for antisymplectic second class constraints through a generalized conversion to corresponding first class constraints. Thereby the basic concept of gauge symmetry is extended to apply to quite a new class of gauge theories potentially possible to exist.
