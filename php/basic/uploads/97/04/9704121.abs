Title: A Rejoinder on Quaternionic Projective Representations
Authors: Stephen L. Adler and G. G. Emch
Abstract: In a series of papers published in this Journal (J. Math. Phys.), a discussion was started on the significance of a new definition of projective representations in quaternionic Hilbert spaces. The present paper gives what we believe is a resolution of the semantic differences that had apparently tended to obscure the issues.
