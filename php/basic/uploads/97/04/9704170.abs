Title: Branes, Superpotentials and Superconformal Fixed Points
Authors: Ofer Aharony and Amihay Hanany
Abstract: We analyze various brane configurations corresponding to field theories in three, four and five dimensions. We find brane configurations which correspond to three dimensional N=2 and four dimensional N=1 supersymmetric QCD theories with quartic superpotentials, in which what appear to be ``hidden parameters'' play an important role. We discuss the construction of five dimensional N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories and superconformal fixed points using branes, which leads to new five dimensional N=1 superconformal field theories. The same five dimensional theories are also used, in a surprising way, to describe new superconformal fixed points of three dimensional N=2 supersymmetric theories, which have both ``electric'' and ``magnetic'' Coulomb branches.
