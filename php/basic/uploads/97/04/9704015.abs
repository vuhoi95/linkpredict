Title: Fusion rules for Quantum Transfer Matrices as a Dynamical System on  Grassmann Manifolds
Authors: O. Lipan and P. B. Wiegmann and A. Zabrodin
Abstract: We show that the set of transfer matrices of an arbitrary fusion type for an integrable quantum model obey these bilinear functional relations, which are identified with an integrable dynamical system on a Grassmann manifold (higher Hirota equation). The bilinear relations were previously known for a particular class of transfer matrices corresponding to rectangular Young diagrams. We extend this result for general Young diagrams. A general solution of the bilinear equations is presented.
