Title: Orbifold Resolution by D-Branes
Authors: Michael R. Douglas and Brian R. Greene and David R. Morrison
Abstract: We study topological properties of the D-brane resolution of three-dimensional orbifold singularities, C^3/Gamma, for finite abelian groups Gamma. The D-brane vacuum moduli space is shown to fill out the background spacetime with Fayet--Iliopoulos parameters controlling the size of the blow-ups. This D-brane vacuum moduli space can be classically described by a gauged linear sigma model, which is shown to be non-generic in a manner that projects out non-geometric regions in its phase diagram, as anticipated from a number of perspectives.
