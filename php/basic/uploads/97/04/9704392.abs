Title: Three-Point Spectral Functions in $Ï†^3_6$ Theory at Finite  Temperature
Authors: Hou Defu and U. Heinz
Abstract: We derive a set of relations among the thermal components of the 3-point function and its spectral representations at finite temperature in the real-time formalism. We then use these to explicitly calculate the 3-point spectral densities for $\phi^3_6$ theory and relate the result to the case of hot QCD.
