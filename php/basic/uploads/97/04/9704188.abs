Title: Small oscillations of a chiral Gross-Neveu system
Authors: P. L. Natti and A. F. R. de Toledo Piza
Abstract: We study the small oscillations regime (RPA approximation) of the time-dependent mean-field equations, obtained in a previous work, which describe the time evolution of one-body dynamical variables of a uniform Chiral Gross-Neveu system. In this approximation we obtain an analytical solution for the time evolution of the one-body dynamical variables. The two-fermion physics can be explored through this solution. The condition for the existence of bound states is examined.
