Title: Compactifications of M-theory and their Phenomenological Consequences
Authors: T. Li and J. Lopez and D. Nanopoulos
Abstract: We compactify the M-theory proposed by Horava and Witten on a Calabi-Yau manifold with boundary $S_1/Z_2$. A no-scale-like K\"ahler potential, the superpotential, and the gauge kinetic function are obtained in this 4-dimensional $E_6\times E_8$ model. We also study the general phenomenological consequences of the resulting M-theory-inspired model, which may include very light gravitinos, axions and axinos.
