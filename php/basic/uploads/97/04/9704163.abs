Title: Spontaneously Broken N=2 Supergravity Without Light Mirror Fermions
Authors: L. Girardello and M. Porrati and A. Zaffaroni
Abstract: We present a spontaneously broken N=2 supergravity model that reduces in the flat limit to a globally supersymmetric N=2 system with explicit soft supersymmetry breaking terms. These soft terms generate a mass O(100 GeV) for mirror quarks and leptons, while leaving the physical fermions light, thereby overcoming one of the major obstacles towards the construction of a realistic N=2 model of elementary interactions.
