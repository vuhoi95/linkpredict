Title: 5D Black Holes and Matrix Strings
Authors: R. Dijkgraaf and E. Verlinde and H. Verlinde
Abstract: We derive the world-volume theory, the (non)-extremal entropy and background geometry of black holes and black strings constructed out of the NS IIA fivebrane within the framework of matrix theory. The CFT description of strings propagating in the black hole geometry arises as an effective field theory.
