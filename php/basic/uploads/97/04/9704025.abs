Abstract: Path-integral approach in imaginary and complex time has been proven successful in treating the tunneling phenomena in quantum mechanics and quantum field theories. Latest developments in this field, the proper valley method in imaginary time, its application to various quantum systems, complex time formalism, asympton theory for the large order analysis of the perturbation theory, are reviewed in a self-contained manner.
