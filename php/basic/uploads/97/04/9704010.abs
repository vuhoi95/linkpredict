Authors: Takeo Inami and Hiroaki Kanno and Tatsuya Ueno
Abstract: We construct a generalization of the two-dimensional Wess-Zumino-Witten model on a $2n$-dimensional K\"ahler manifold as a group-valued non-linear sigma model with an anomaly term containing the K\"ahler form. The model is shown to have an infinite-dimensional symmetry which generates an $n$-toroidal Lie algebra. The classical equation of motion turns out to be the Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau equation, which is a $2n$-dimensional generalization of the self-dual Yang-Mills equation.
