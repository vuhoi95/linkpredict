Title: Stable Knotted Strings
Authors: Rui Dilao and Ricardo Schiappa
Abstract: We solve the Cauchy problem for the relativistic closed string in Minkowski space $M^{3+1}$, including the cases where the initial data has a knot like topology. We give the general conditions for the world sheet of a closed knotted string to be a time periodic surface. In the particular case of zero initial string velocity the period of the world sheet is proportional to half the length ($\ell$) of the initial string and a knotted string always collapses to a link for $t=\ell/4$. Relativistic closed strings are dynamically evolving or pulsating structures in spacetime, and knotted or unknotted like structures remain stable over time. The generation of arbitrary $n$-fold knots, starting with an initial simple link configuration with non zero velocity is possible.
