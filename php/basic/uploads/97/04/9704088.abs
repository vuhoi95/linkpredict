Title: Generalization of the Hamilton-Jacobi approach for higher order singular  systems
Authors: B. M. Pimentel and R. G. Teixeira
Abstract: We generalize the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation for higher order singular systems and obtain the equations of motion as total differential equations. To do this we first study the constraint structure present in such systems.
