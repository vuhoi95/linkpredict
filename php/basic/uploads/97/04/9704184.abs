Title: Mirror Fermions in Noncommutative Geometry
Authors: F. Lizzi and G. Mangano and G. Miele and G. Sparano
Abstract: In a recent paper we pointed out the presence of extra fermionic degrees of freedom in a chiral gauge theory based on Connes Noncommutative Geometry. Here we propose a mechanism which provides a high mass to these mirror states, so that they decouple from low energy physics.
