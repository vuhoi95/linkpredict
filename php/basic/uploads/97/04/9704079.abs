Title: Spikes in Quantum Regge Calculus
Authors: J. Ambjorn and J. Nielsen and J. Rolf and G. Savvidy
Abstract: We demonstrate by explicit calculation of the DeWitt-like measure in two-dimensional quantum Regge gravity that it is highly non-local and that the average values of link lengths $l, <l^n>$, do not exist for sufficient high powers of $n$. Thus the concept of length has no natural definition in this formalism and a generic manifold degenerates into spikes. This might explain the failure of quantum Regge calculus to reproduce the continuum results of two-dimensional quantum gravity. It points to severe problems for the Regge approach in higher dimensions.
