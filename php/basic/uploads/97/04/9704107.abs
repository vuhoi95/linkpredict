Title: Supersymmetric Reflection Matrices
Authors: M. Moriconi and K. Schoutens
Abstract: We briefly review the general structure of integrable particle theories in 1+1 dimensions having N=1 supersymmetry. Examples are specific perturbed superconformal field theories (of Yang-Lee type) and the N=1 supersymmetric sine-Gordon theory. We comment on the modifications that are required when the N=1 supersymmetry algebra contains non-trivial topological charges.
