Title: M(atrix) String Theory on K3
Authors: W. Fischler and A. Rajaraman
Abstract: We conjecture that M-theory compactified on an ALE space (or K3) is described by 0-branes moving on the ALE space. We give evidence for this by showing that if we compactify another circle, we recover string theory on the ALE space. This guarantees that in the large N limit, the matrix model correctly describes the force law between gravitons moving in an ALE background. We also show the appearance in M(atrix) theory of the duality of M-theory on K3 with the heterotic string on a three-torus.
