Title: A Note on Six-Dimensional Gauge Theories
Authors: Robert G. Leigh and Moshe Rozali
Abstract: We study the new ``gauge'' theories in 5+1 dimensions, and their non-commutative generalizations. We argue that the $\theta$-term and the non-commutative torus parameters appear on an equal footing in the non-critical string theories which define the gauge theories. The use of these theories as a Matrix description of M-theory on $T^5$, as well as a closely related realization as 5-branes in type IIB string theory, proves useful in studying some of their properties.
