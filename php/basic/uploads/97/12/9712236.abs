Title: Evaporation of Schwarzschild Black Holes in Matrix Theory
Authors: T. Banks and W. Fischler and I. R. Klebanov
Abstract: Recently, in collaboration with Susskind, we proposed a model of Schwarzschild black holes in Matrix theory. A large Schwarzschild black hole is described by a metastable bound state of a large number of D0-branes which are held together by a background, whose structure has so far been understood only in 8 and 11 dimensions. The Hawking radiation proceeds by emission of small clusters of D0-branes. We estimate the Hawking rate in the Matrix theory model of Schwarzschild black holes and find agreement with the semiclassical rate up to an undetermined numerical coefficient of order 1.
