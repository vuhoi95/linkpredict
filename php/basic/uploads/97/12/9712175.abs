Title: Gauge invariance for the massive axion
Authors: Pio Jose Arias and Adel Khoudeir
Abstract: A massive gauge invariant formulation for scalar ($\phi$) and antisymmetric ($C_{mnp}$) fields with a topological coupling, which provides a mass for the axion field, is considered. The dual and local equivalence with the non-gauge invariant proposal is established, but on manifolds with non-trivial topological structure both formulations are not globally equivalent.
