Title: Quantum properties of general gauge theories with composite and external  fields
Authors: S. Falkenberg and B. Geyer and P. Moshin
Abstract: The generating functionals of Green's functions with composite and external fields are considered in the framework of BV and BLT quantization methods for general gauge theories. The corresponding Ward identities are derived and the gauge dependence is investigated
