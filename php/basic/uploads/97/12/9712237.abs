Title: Back Reaction to Rotating Detector
Authors: Takayuki Suga and Riuji Mochizuki and Kenji Ikegami
Abstract: It has been a puzzle that rotating detector may respond even in the appropriate vacuum defined via canonical quantization. We solve this puzzle by taking back reaction of the detector into account. The influence of the back reaction, even in the detector's mass infinite limit, appears in the response function. It makes the detector possible to respond in the vacuum if the detector is rotating, though the detector in linear uniform motion never respond in the vacuum as expected from Poincare invariance.
