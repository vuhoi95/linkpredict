Title: Non-local Thirring model at finite-temperature
Authors: M. V. Manias and C. M. Naon and M. L. Trobo
Abstract: We extend a recently proposed non-local and non-covariant version of the Thirring model to the finite-temperature case. We obtain a completely bosonized expression for the partition function, describing the thermodynamics of the collective modes which are the underlying excitations of this system. From this result we derive closed formulae for the free-energy, specific-heat, two-point correlation functions and momentum distribution, as functionals of electron-electron coupling potentials.
