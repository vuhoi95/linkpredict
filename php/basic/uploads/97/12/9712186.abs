Title: D-branes in Gepner models
Authors: A. Recknagel and V. Schomerus
Abstract: We discuss D-branes from a conformal field theory point of view. In this approach, branes are described by boundary states providing sources for closed string modes, independently of classical notions. The boundary states must satisfy constraints which fall into two classes: The first consists of gluing conditions between left- and right-moving Virasoro or further symmetry generators, whereas the second encompasses non-linear consistency conditions from world sheet duality, which severely restrict the allowed boundary states. We exploit these conditions to give explicit formulas for boundary states in Gepner models, thereby computing excitation spectra of brane configurations. From the boundary states, brane tensions and RR charges can also be read off directly.
