Title: Non-zeta knots in the renormalization of the Wess-Zumino model?
Authors: P. M. Ferreira and J. A. Gracey
Abstract: We solve the Schwinger Dyson equations of the O(N) symmetric Wess-Zumino model at O(1/N^3) at the non-trivial fixed point of the d-dimensional beta-function and deduce a critical exponent for the wave function renormalization at this order. By developing the epsilon-expansion of the result, which agrees with known perturbation theory, we examine the distribution of transcendental coefficients and show that only the Riemann zeta series arises at this order in 1/N. Unlike the analogous calculation at the same order in the bosonic O(N) phi^4-theory non-zeta transcendentals, associated with for example the (3,4)-torus knot, cancel.
