Title: On the Matrix Description of Calabi-Yau Compactifications
Authors: S. Kachru and A. Lawrence and E. Silverstein
Abstract: We point out that the matrix description of M-theory compactified on Calabi-Yau threefolds is in many respects simpler than the matrix description of a $T^6$ compactification. This is largely because of the differences between D6 branes wrapped on Calabi-Yau threefolds and D6 branes wrapped on six-tori. In particular, if we define the matrix theory following the prescription of Sen and Seiberg, we find that the remaining degrees of freedom are decoupled from gravity.
