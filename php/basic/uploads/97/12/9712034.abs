Title: Black-Scholes equation from Gauge Theory of Arbitrage
Authors: Kirill Ilinski and Gleb Kalinin
Abstract: We apply Gauge Theory of Arbitrage (GTA) {hep-th/9710148} to derivative pricing. We show how the standard results of Black-Scholes analysis appear from GTA and derive correction to the Black-Scholes equation due to a virtual arbitrage and speculators reaction on it. The model accounts for both violation of the no-arbitrage constraint and non-Brownian price walks which resemble real financial data. The correction is nonlocal and transform the differential Black-Scholes equation to an integro-differential one.
