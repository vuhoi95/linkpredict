Title: Short Distance Contributions to Graviton-Graviton Scattering: Matrix  Theory versus Supergravity
Authors: Esko Keski-Vakkuri and Per Kraus
Abstract: We study graviton scattering in the presence of higher dimensional operators - particularly, R^4 - arising from loop effects. We find that the results do not correspond to any known terms in the effective action of Matrix Theory, thus lending support to the idea that the finite N Matrix Theory has no simple relation to supergravity with large compactification radii.
