Title: An easy way to solve two-loop vertex integrals
Authors: Alfredo T. Suzuki and Alexandre G. M. Schmidt
Abstract: Negative dimensional integration is a step further dimensional regularization ideas. In this approach, based on the principle of analytic continuation, Feynman integrals are polynomial ones and for this reason very simple to handle, contrary to the usual parametric ones. The result of the integral worked out in $D<0$ must be analytically continued again --- of course --- to real physical world, $D>0$, and this step presents no difficulties. We consider four two-loop three-point vertex diagrams with arbitrary exponents of propagators and dimension. These original results give the correct well-known particular cases where the exponents of propagators are equal to unity.
