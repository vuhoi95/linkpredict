Title: The entropy of near-extreme N=2 black holes
Authors: Klaus Behrndt and Mirjam Cvetic and Wafic A. Sabra
Abstract: We give an explicit form of the classical entropy for four-dimensional static near-BPS-saturated black holes of generic N=2 superstring vacua. The expression is obtained by determining the leading corrections in the non-extremality parameter to the corresponding BPS-saturated black hole solutions. These classical results are quantitatively compared with the microscopic leading order corrections to the microscopic result of Maldacena Strominger and Witten for N=2 BPS-saturated black holes.
