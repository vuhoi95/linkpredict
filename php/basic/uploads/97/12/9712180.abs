Title: M-theory description of BPS string in 7-brane background
Authors: Isao Kishimoto and Naoki Sasakura
Abstract: We discuss the BPS configurations of IIB strings in the 7-brane background from M-theory viewpoint. We first obtain the hyperkahler geometry background of M-theory expected from the 7-brane solutions of the type IIB supergravity. We choose the appropriate complex structures of the background geometries and embed a membrane of M-theory holomorphically to obtain a BPS string configuration. The recently discussed BPS string configurations such as 3-string junctions and string networks in the flat background are generalized to the cases with the 7-brane backgrounds. The property of the BPS string configurations in the 7-brane backgrounds is in agreement with the previously known results from the IIB string viewpoint.
