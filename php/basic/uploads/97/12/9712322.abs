Title: Twenty Open Questions in Supersymmetric Particle Physics
Authors: Keith R. Dienes and Christopher Kolda
Abstract: We give a brief overview of 20 open theoretical questions in supersymmetric particle physics. The 20 questions we have chosen range from the GeV scale to the Planck scale, and include issues pertaining to the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and its extensions, SUSY-breaking, cosmology, grand unified theories, and string theory. Throughout, our goal is to address those topics in which supersymmetry plays a fundamental role, and which are areas of active research in the field. This survey is written at an introductory level and is aimed at people who are not necessarily experts in the field.
