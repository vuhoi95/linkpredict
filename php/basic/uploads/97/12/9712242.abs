Title: Duality and cosmological compactification of superstrings with unbroken  supersymmetry
Authors: H. K. Jassal and A. Mukherjee and R. P. Saxena
Abstract: The cosmological compactification of D=10, N=1 supergravity-super-Yang-Mills theory obtained from superstring theory is studied. The constraint of unbroken N=1 supersymmetry is imposed. A duality transformation is performed on the resulting consistency conditions. The original equations as well as the transformed equations are solved numerically to obtain new configurations with a nontrivial scale factor and a dynamical dilaton. It is shown that various classes of solutions are possible, which include cosmological solutions with no initial singularity.
