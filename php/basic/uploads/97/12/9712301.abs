Abstract: A recent paper on the large-scale structure of the Universe presented evidence for a rectangular three-dimensional lattice of galaxy superclusters and voids, with lattice spacing ~120 Mpc and called for some ``hitherto unknown process'' to explain it. Here we report that a rectangular three-dimensional lattice of intersecting domain walls, with arbitrary spacing, emerges naturally as a classical solution of M-theory.
