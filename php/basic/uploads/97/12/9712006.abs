Title: Multicritical Microscopic Spectral Correlators of Hermitian and Complex  Matrices
Authors: G. Akemann and P. H. Damgaard and U. Magnea and S. M. Nishigaki
Abstract: We find the microscopic spectral densities and the spectral correlators associated with multicritical behavior for both hermitian and complex matrix ensembles, and show their universality. We conjecture that microscopic spectral densities of Dirac operators in certain theories without spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking may belong to these new universality classes.
