Title: Integrating Over Higgs Branches
Authors: G. Moore and N. Nekrasov and S. Shatashvili
Abstract: We develop some useful techinques for integrating over Higgs branches in supersymmetric theories with 4 and 8 supercharges. In particular, we define a regularized volume for hyperkahler quotients. We evaluate this volume for certain ALE and ALF spaces in terms of the hyperkahler periods. We also reduce these volumes for a large class of hyperkahler quotients to simpler integrals. These quotients include complex coadjoint orbits, instanton moduli spaces on R^4 and ALE manifolds, Hitchin spaces, and moduli spaces of parabolic Higgs bundles on Riemann surfaces. In the case of Hitchin spaces the evaluation of the volume reduces to a summation over solutions of Bethe Ansatz equations for the non-linear Schroedinger system. We discuss some applications of our results.
