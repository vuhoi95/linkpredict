Title: Supermembranes and Supermatrix Models
Authors: B. de Wit and K. Peeters and J. C. Plefka
Abstract: We briefly review recent developments in the theory of supermembranes and supermatrix models. In a second part we discuss their interaction with background fields. In particular, we present the full background field coupling for the bosonic case. This is a short summary of the talk at the workshop. A more extended version will appear elsewhere.
