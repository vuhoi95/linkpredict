Authors: L. G. Mardoyan and A. N. Sissakian and V. M. Ter-Antonyan
Abstract: In this report, in the framework of an analytical approach and with help of the generalized version of the Hurwitz transformation the five-dimensional SU(2)--monopole model is constructed from the eight-dimensional quantum oscillator. The SU(2)--monopole fields, the Clebsh-Gordan expansion stimulated by the space-gauge coupling, the hyperangle and the radial parts of the total wave function, the energy spectrum of the charge-monopole bound system and the corresponding degeneracy are calculated.
