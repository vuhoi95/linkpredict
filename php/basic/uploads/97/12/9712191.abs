Title: T-Dual Formulation of Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Gordon Chalmers and Warren Siegel
Abstract: We introduce a self-dual field strength which replaces the gauge field in spontaneously broken Yang-Mills theory, reformulating it as a Lorentz covariant non-linear sigma model. This dualized theory is in both a unitary and renormalizable gauge: The self-dual field strength has exactly the three components necessary to describe a massive vector field. In future work we shall utilize this new formulation as a calculational tool in spontaneously broken gauge theories.
