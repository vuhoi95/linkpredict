Title: Epsilon-expansion in quantum field theory in curved spacetime
Authors: I. H. Brevik and H. Ocampo and S. D. Odintsov
Abstract: We discuss epsilon-expansion in curved spacetime for asymptotically free and asymptotically non-free theories. The esistence of stable and unstable fixed points is investigated for $f \phi^4$ and SU(2) gauge theory. It is shown that epsilon-expansion maybe compatible with asymptotic freedom on special solutions of the RG equations in a special case (supersymmetric theory). Using epsilon-expansion RG technique the effective Lagrangian for covariantly constant gauge SU(2) field and effective potential for gauged NJL-model are found in 4-epsilon- dimensional curved space (in linear curvature approximation). The curvature- induced phase transitions from symmetric phase to asymmetric phase (chromomagnetic vacuum and chiral symmetry broken phase, respectively) are discussed for the above two models.
