Title: Patterns of Spontaneous Chiral Symmetry Breaking in the Large-Nc Limit  of QCD-Like Theories
Authors: M. Knecht and E. de Rafael
Abstract: It is shown that in vector-like gauge theories, such as QCD, and in the limit of a large number of colours Nc, the ordering pattern of narrow vector and axial-vector states at low energies is correlated with the size of the possible local order parameters of chiral symmetry breaking. This has implications on the underlying dynamics of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in QCD, and also on possible values of the parameter S for oblique electroweak corrections, the analogue of the QCD low energy constant L10.
