Title: Definition of Chern-Simons Terms in Thermal QED_3 Revisited
Authors: S. Deser and L. Griguolo and D. Seminara
Abstract: We present two compact derivations of the correct definition of the Chern-Simons term in the topologically non trivial context of thermal $QED_3$. One is based on a transgression descent from a D=4 background connection, the other on embedding the abelian model in SU(2). The results agree with earlier cohomology conclusions and can be also used to justify a recent simple heuristic approach. The correction to the naive Chern-Simons term, and its behavior under large gauge transformations are displayed.
