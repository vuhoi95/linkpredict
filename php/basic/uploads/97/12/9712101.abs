Title: Generation of a dipole moment by external field in Born-Infeld  non-linear electrodynamics
Authors: Dariusz Chruscinski and Jerzy Kijowski
Abstract: The mechanism for the generation of a dipole moment due to an external field is presented for the Born-Infeld charged particle. The 'polarizability coefficient' is calculated: it is proportional to the third power of the characteristic length in the Born-Infeld theory. Some physical implications are briefly discussed.
