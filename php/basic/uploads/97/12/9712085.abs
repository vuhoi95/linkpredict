Title: Transmutations between Singular and Subsingular Vectors of the N=2  Superconformal Algebras
Authors: Matthias Doerrzapf and Beatriz Gato-Rivera
Abstract: We present subsingular vectors of the N=2 superconformal algebras other than the ones which become singular in chiral Verma modules, reported recently by Gato-Rivera and Rosado. We show that two large classes of singular vectors of the Topological algebra become subsingular vectors of the Antiperiodic NS algebra under the topological untwistings. These classes consist of BRST- invariant singular vectors with relative charges $q=-2,-1$ and zero conformal weight, and no-label singular vectors with $q=0,-1$. In turn the resulting NS subsingular vectors are transformed by the spectral flows into subsingular and singular vectors of the Periodic R algebra. We write down these singular and subsingular vectors starting from the topological singular vectors at levels 1 and 2.
