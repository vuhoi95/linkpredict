Title: Branes at Orbifolds versus Hanany Witten in Six Dimensions
Authors: Ilka Brunner and Andreas Karch
Abstract: We reconstruct non-trivial 6d theories obtained by Blum and Intriligator by considering IIB or SO(32) 5 branes at ALE spaces in the language of Hanany Witten setups. Using ST duality we make the equivalence of the two approaches manifest, thereby uncovering several new T-duality relations between the group theoretic data describing the embedding of the instantonic 5 brane in the ALE and brane positions in the Hanany Witten language. We construct several new 6d theories, which can be understood as arising on 5 branes in IIB orientifolds with oppositely charged orientifold planes recently introduced by Witten.
