Title: Surfaces with Long-Range Correlations from Non-Critical Strings
Authors: M. C. Diamantini and C. A. Trugenberger
Abstract: We show that the recently proposed confining string theory describes smooth surfaces with long-range correlations for the normal components of tangent vectors. These long-range correlations arise as a consequence of a "frustrated antiferromagnetic" interaction whose two main features are non-locality and a negative stiffness.
