Title: Manifestly Covariant Actions for D=4 Self-Dual Yang-Mills and D=10  Super-Yang-Mills
Authors: N. Berkovits and C. Hull
Abstract: Using an infinite number of fields, we construct actions for D=4 self-dual Yang-Mills with manifest Lorentz invariance and for D=10 super-Yang-Mills with manifest super-Poincar\'e invariance. These actions are generalizations of the covariant action for the D=2 chiral boson which was first studied by McClain, Wu, Yu and Wotzasek.
