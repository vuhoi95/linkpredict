Title: OSp(1,2)-covariant Lagrangian quantization of irreducible massive gauge  theories
Authors: B. Geyer and P. M. Lavrov and D. MÃ¼lsch
Abstract: The osp(1,2)-covariant Lagrangian quantization of general gauge theories is formulated which applies also to massive fields. The formalism generalizes the Sp(2)-covariant BLT approach and guarantees symplectic invariance of the quantized action. The dependence of the generating functional of Green's functions on the choice of gauge in the massive case disappears in the limit m = 0. Ward identities related to osp(1,2) symmetry are derived. Massive gauge theories with closed algebra are studied as an example.
