Title: Fractional Branes and Wrapped Branes
Authors: Duiliu-Emanuel Diaconescu and Michael R. Douglas and Jaume Gomis
Abstract: We discuss the ``fractional D-branes'' which arise in orbifold resolution. We argue that they arise as subsectors of the Coulomb branch of the quiver gauge theory used to describe both string theory D-brane and Matrix theory on an orbifold, and thus must form part of the full physical Hilbert space. We make further observations confirming their interpretation as wrapped membranes.
