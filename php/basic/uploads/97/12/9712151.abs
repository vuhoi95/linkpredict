Abstract: It is well known that the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE) may be effectively represented by a Chern-Simons theory. In order to incorporate QH Skyrmions, we couple this theory to the topological spin current, and include the Hopf term. The cancellation of anomalies for chiral edge states, and the proviso that Skyrmions may be created and destroyed at the edge, fixes the coefficients of these new terms. Consequently, the charge and the spin of the Skyrmion are uniquely determined. For those two quantities we find the values $e\nu N_{Sky}$ and $\nu N_{Sky}/2$, respectively, where $e$ is electron charge, $\nu$ is the filling fraction and $N_{Sky}$ is the Skyrmion winding number. We also add terms to the action so that the classical spin fluctuations in the bulk satisfy the standard equations of a ferromagnet, with spin waves that propagate with the classical drift velocity of the electron.
