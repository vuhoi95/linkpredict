Title: Vortex Dynamics in Classical Non--Abelian Spin Models
Authors: O. A. Borisenko and M. N. Chernodub and F. V. Gubarev
Abstract: We discuss the abelian vortex dynamics in the abelian projection approach to non-abelian spin models. We show numerically that in the three-dimensional SU(2) spin model in the Maximal Abelian projection the abelian off-diagonal vortices are not responsible for the phase transition contrary to the diagonal vortices. A generalization of the abelian projection approach to SU(N) spin models is briefly discussed.
