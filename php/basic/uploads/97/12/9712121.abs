Title: Correlation lengths and E_8 mass spectrum of the dilute A_3 lattice  model
Authors: M. T. Batchelor and K. A. Seaton
Abstract: The exact perturbation approach is used to derive the elementary correlation lengths $\xi_i$ and related mass gaps $m_i$ of the two-dimensional dilute A_L lattice model in regimes 1 and 2 for L odd from the Bethe Ansatz solution. In regime 2 the A_3 model is the E_8 lattice realisation of the two-dimensional Ising model in a magnetic field at T=T_c. The calculations for the A_3 model in regime 2 start from the eight thermodynamically significant string types found in previous numerical studies. These string types are seen to be consistent in the ordered high field limit. The eight masses obtained reduce with the approach to criticality to the E_8 masses predicted by Zamolodchikov, thus providing a further direct lattice determination of the E_8 mass spectrum.
