Title: The Boltzmann Equation in Scalar Field Theory
Authors: F. T. Brandt and J. Frenkel and A. Guerra
Abstract: We derive the classical transport equation, in scalar field theory with a V(phi) interaction, from the equation of motion for the quantum field. We obtain a very simple, but iterative, expression for the effective action which generates all the n-point Green functions in the high-temperature limit. An explicit closed form is given in the static case.
