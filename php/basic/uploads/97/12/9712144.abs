Title: Finite Temperature Perturbation Theory and Large Gauge Invariance
Authors: Ashok Das and Gerald Dunne
Abstract: We examine finite temperature perturbation theory for Chern-Simons theories, in the context of an analogue 0+1-dimensional model. In particular, we show how nonextensive terms arise in the perturbative finite temperature effective action, using both the real-time and imaginary-time formalisms. We illustrate how large gauge invariance is restored at all orders, despite being broken at any given order in perturbation theory. We discuss which aspects generalize to a perturbative analysis of finite temperature Chern-Simons terms in higher dimensions.
