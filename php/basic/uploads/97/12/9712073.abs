Title: Special Conformal Symmetry of Worldvolume Actions
Authors: R. Kallosh and J. Kumar and A. Rajaraman
Abstract: Kappa-symmetric worldvolume actions of the D3-, M5- and M2-branes can be coupled consistently to their near horizon bosonic geometry background. We study the gauge-fixed action in the approximation in which only the transverse radial direction of the brane is allowed to fluctuate. The generalized special conformal symmetry of these self-interacting actions is established. This opens up a possibility to find out if the full superconformal symmetry of the free actions of these branes survives in the presence of coupling defined by the size of the anti-deSitter throat.
