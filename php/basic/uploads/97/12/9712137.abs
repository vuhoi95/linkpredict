Title: The nonminimal scalar multiplet coupled to supersymmetric Yang-Mills
Authors: Silvia Penati and Daniela Zanon
Abstract: We consider the coupling of nonminimal scalar multiplets to supersymmetric Yang-Mills in four dimensions and compute the one-loop contribution to the low-energy effective action in the abelian sector. We show that the resulting theory realizes the dual version of the corresponding one from N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills.
