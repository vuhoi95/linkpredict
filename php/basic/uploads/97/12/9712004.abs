Title: Some aspects of noncommutative geometry and physics
Authors: A. Dimakis and F. Muller-Hoissen
Abstract: An introduction is given to some selected aspects of noncommutative geometry. Simple examples in this context are provided by finite sets and lattices. As an application, it is explained how the nonlinear Toda lattice and a discrete time version of it can be understood as generalized sigma-models based on noncommutative geometries. In particular, in this way one achieves a simple understanding of the complete integrability of the Toda lattice. Furthermore, generalized metric structures on finite sets and lattices are briefly discussed.
