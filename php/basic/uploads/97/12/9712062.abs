Title: Integrating over the Coulomb branch in N=2 gauge theory
Authors: Marcos Marino and Gregory Moore
Abstract: We review the relation of certain integrals over the Coulomb phase of $d=4$, N=2 SO(3) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with Donaldson-Witten theory. We describe a new way to write an important contact term in the theory and show how the integrals generalize to higher rank gauge groups.
