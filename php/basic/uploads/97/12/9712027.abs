Title: Coherence Constraints for Operads, Categories and Algebras
Authors: Martin Markl and Steve Shnider
Abstract: Coherence phenomena appear in two different situations. In the context of category theory the term `coherence constraints' refers to a set of diagrams whose commutativity implies the commutativity of a larger class of diagrams. In the context of algebra coherence constrains are a minimal set of generators for the second syzygy, that is, a set of equations which generate the full set of identities among the defining relations of an algebraic theory. A typical example of the first type is Mac Lane's coherence theorem for monoidal categories, an example of the second type is the result of Drinfel'd saying that the pentagon identity for the `associator' of a quasi-Hopf algebra implies the validity of a set of identities with higher instances of this associator. We show that both types of coherence are governed by a homological invariant of the operad for the underlying algebraic structure. We call this invariant the (space of) coherence constraints. In many cases these constraints can be explicitly described, thus giving rise to various coherence results, both classical and new.
