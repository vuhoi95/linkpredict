Title: Gauge Fields and M-Fivebrane Dynamics
Authors: N. D. Lambert and P. C. West
Abstract: In this paper we obtain both the vector and scalar equations of motion of an M-fivebrane in the presence of threebrane solitons. The resulting equations of motion are precisely those obtained from the Seiberg-Witten low energy effective action for N=2 Yang-Mills, including all quantum corrections. This analysis extends the work of a previous paper which derived the scalar equations of motion but not in detail the vector equations. We also discuss some features of an infinite number of higher derivative terms predicted by M theory.
