Title: Instanton Calculus and SUSY Gauge Theories on ALE Manifolds
Authors: D. Bellisai and G. Travaglini
Abstract: We study instanton effects along the Coulomb branch of an N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU(2) on Asymptotically Locally Euclidean (ALE) spaces. We focus our attention on an Eguchi-Hanson gravitational background and on gauge field configurations of lowest Chern class.
