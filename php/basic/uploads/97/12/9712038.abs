Title: Two loop results from the derivative expansion of the blocked action
Authors: Alfio Bonanno and Dario Zappala'
Abstract: A derivative expansion of the Wegner-Houghton equation is derived for a scalar theory. The corresponding full non-perturbative renormalization group equations for the potential and the wave-function renormalization function are presented. We also show that the two loop perturbative anomalous dimension for the O(N) theory can be obtained by means of a polynomial truncation in the field dependence in our equations.
