Title: BPS Solutions in D=5 Dilaton-Axion Gravity
Authors: Oleg Kechkin and Maria Yurova
Abstract: We show that the D=5 dilaton-axion gravity compactified on a 2-torus possesses the SL(4,R)/SO(4) matrix formulation. It is used for construction of the SO(2,2)-invariant BPS solution depended on the one harmonic function.
