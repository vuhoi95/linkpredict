Title: Conformal Maxwell theory as a singleton field theory on AdS_5, IIB  three-branes and duality
Authors: S. Ferrara and C. Fronsdal
Abstract: We examine the boundary conditions associated with extended supersymmetric Maxwell theory in 5-dimensional anti-De Sitter space. Excitations on the boundary are identical to those of ordinary 4-dimensional conformal invariant super electrodynammics. Extrapolations of these excitations give rise to a 5-dimensional topological gauge theory of the singleton type. The possibility of a connection of this phenomenon to the world volume theory of 3-branes in IIB string theory is discussed.
