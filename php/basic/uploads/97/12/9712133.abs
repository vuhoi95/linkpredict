Title: Asymptotic Search for Ground States of SU(2) Matrix Theory
Authors: M. B. Halpern and C. Schwartz
Abstract: We introduce a complete set of gauge-invariant variables and a generalized Born-Oppenheimer formulation to search for normalizable zero-energy asymptotic solutions of the Schrodinger equation of SU(2) matrix theory. The asymptotic method gives only ground state candidates, which must be further tested for global stability. Our results include a set of such ground state candidates, including one state which is a singlet under spin(9).
