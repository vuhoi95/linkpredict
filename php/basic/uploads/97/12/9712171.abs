Title: Standard Model with Duality: Theoretical Basis
Authors: HM Chan and ST Tsou
Abstract: The Dualized Standard Model which has a number of very interesting physical consequences is itself based on the concept of a nonabelian generalization to electric-magnetic duality. This paper explains first the reasons why the ordinary (Hodge) * does not give duality for the nonabelian theory and then reviews the steps by which these difficulties are surmounted, leading to a generalized duality transform formulated in loop space. The significance of this in relation to the Dualized Standard Model is explained, and possibly also to some other areas.
