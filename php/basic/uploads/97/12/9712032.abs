Title: Theta Dependence of Meson Masses in the Small Mass Limit of the Massive  Schwinger Model
Authors: M. Burkardt and K. Harada
Abstract: We present a continuum formulation for $\theta$-vacua in the massive Schwinger model on the light-front, where $\theta$ enters as a background electric field. The effective coupling of the external field is partially screened due to vacuum polarization processes. For small fermion masses and small $\theta$ we calculate the mass of the meson and find agreement with results from bosonization.
