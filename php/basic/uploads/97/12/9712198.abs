Title: Nonlocal low-energy effective action for gravity with torsion
Authors: Antonio Dobado and Antonio L. Maroto
Abstract: In this work we calculate the low-energy effective action for gravity with torsion, obtained after the integration of scalar and fermionic matter fields, using the local momentum representation based on the Riemann normal coordinates expansion. By considering this expansion around different space-time points, we also compute the nonlocal terms together with the more usual divergent ones. Finally we discuss the applicability of our results to the calculation of particle production probabilities.
