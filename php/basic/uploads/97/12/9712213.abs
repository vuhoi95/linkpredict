Title: Gauge Theory Description of D-brane Black Holes: Emergence of the  Effective SCFT and Hawking Radiation
Authors: S. F. Hassan and Spenta R. Wadia
Abstract: We study the hypermultiplet moduli space of an N=4, U(Q_1)xU(Q_5) gauge theory in 1+1 dimensions to extract the effective SCFT description of near extremal 5-dimensional black holes modelled by a collection of D1- and D5-branes. On the moduli space, excitations with fractional momenta arise due to a residual discrete gauge invariance. It is argued that, in the infra-red, the lowest energy excitations are described by an effective c=6, N=4 SCFT on T^4, also valid in the large black hole regime. The ``effective string tension'' is obtained using T-duality covariance. While at the microscopic level, minimal scalars do not couple to (1,5) strings, in the effective theory a coupling is induced by (1,1) and (5,5) strings, leading to Hawking radiation. These considerations imply that, at least for such black holes, the calculation of the Hawking decay rate for minimal scalars has a sound foundation in string theory and statistical mechanics and, hence, there is no information loss.
