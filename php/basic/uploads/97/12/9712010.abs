Title: Collectivity Embedded in Complex Spectra of Finite Interacting Fermi  Systems: Nuclear Example
Authors: S. Drozdz and S. Nishizaki and J. Speth and M. Wojcik
Abstract: The mechanism of collectivity coexisting with chaos in a finite system of strongly interacting fermions is investigated. The complex spectra are represented in the basis of two-particle two-hole states describing the nuclear double-charge exchange modes in $^{48}$Ca. An example of $J^{\pi}=0^-$ excitations shows that the residual interaction, which generically implies chaotic behavior, under certain specific and well identified conditions may create strong transitions, even much stronger than those corresponding to a pure mean-field picture. Such an effect results from correlations among the off-diagonal matrix elements, is connected with locally reduced density of states and a local minimum in the information entropy.
