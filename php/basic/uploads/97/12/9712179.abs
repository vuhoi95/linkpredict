Title: Interaction of F- and D-strings in the Matrix Model
Authors: N. D. Hari Dass and B. Sathiapalan
Abstract: We study a configuration of a parallel F- (fundamental) and D- string in IIB string theory by considering its T-dual configuration in the matrix model description of M-theory. We show that certain non-perturbative features of string theory such as $O(e^{-\frac{1}{g_{s}}})$ effects due to soliton loops, the existence of bound state (1,1) strings and manifest S-duality, can be seen in matrix models. We discuss certain subtleties that arise in the large-N limit when membranes are wrapped around compact dimensions.
