Title: Anomalies and Locality in Field Theories and M theory
Authors: L. Bonora and C. S. Chu and M. Rinaldi
Abstract: We review some basic notions on anomalies in field theories and superstring theories, with particular emphasis on the concept of locality. The aim is to prepare the ground for a discussion on anomalies in theories with branes. In this light we review the problem of chiral anomaly cancellation in M-theory with a 5-brane.
