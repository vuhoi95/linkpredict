Title: D0-Branes as Instantons in D=4 Super Yang-Mills Theories
Authors: J. L. F. Barbon and A. Pasquinucci
Abstract: We discuss the role of D0-branes as instantons in the construction of SU(N) Super Yang-Mills and Super QCD theories in four space-time dimensions with D4-, D6- and NS-branes. [To appear in the proceedings of the conference "Quantum Aspects of Gauge Theories, Supersymmetry and Unification", held at Neuchatel University, Neuchatel, Switzerland, 18--23 September 1997.]
