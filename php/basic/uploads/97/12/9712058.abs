Title: The Spectral Dimension of Non-generic Branched Polymer Ensembles
Authors: Joao D. Correia and John F. Wheater
Abstract: We show that the spectral dimension on non-generic branched polymer models with susceptibility exponent $\gamma$ is given by $2/(1+\gamma)$. For those models with negative $\gamma$ we find that the spectral dimension is 2.
