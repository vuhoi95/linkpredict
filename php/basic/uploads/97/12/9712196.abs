Title: Black-holes, Duality and Supersymmetry
Authors: E. Alvarez and P. Meessen and T. Ortin
Abstract: In order to study the discrepancy between the supersymmetry bound and the extremality bound for rotating black holes, the effect of duality transformations on the class of stationary and axially symmetric string backgrounds, called the TNbh, is considerd. It is shown that the Bogomolnyi bound is invariant under those duality transformations that transform the TNbh into itself, meaning that duality does not constrain the angular momentum in such a way as to reconcile the aforementioned bounds. A physical reason for the existence of the discrepancy is given in terms of superradiance.
