Title: Review of Matrix Theory
Authors: Daniela Bigatti and Leonard Susskind
Abstract: In this article we present a self contained review of the principles of Matrix Theory including the basics of light cone quantization, the formulation of 11 dimensional M-Theory in terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics, the origin of membranes and the rules of compactification on 1,2 and 3 tori. We emphasize the unusual origins of space time and gravitation which are very different than in conventional approaches to quantum gravity. Finally we discuss application of Matrix Theory to the quantum mechanics of Schwarzschild black holes. This work is based on lectures given by the second author at the Cargese ASI 1997 and at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.
