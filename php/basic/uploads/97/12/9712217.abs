Title: A Nambu-Jona-Lasinio like model from QCD at low energies
Authors: José Luis Cortés and Jorge Gamboa and Luis Velázquez
Abstract: A generalization to any dimension of the fermion field transformation which allows to derive the solution of the massless Schwinger model in the path integral framework is identified. New arguments based on this transformation for a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) like model as the low energy limit of a gauge theory in dimension greater than two are presented. Our result supports the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking picture conjectured by Nambu many years ago and the link between QCD, NJL and chiral models.
