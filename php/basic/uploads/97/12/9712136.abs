Title: Newtonian M(atrix) Cosmology
Authors: E. Alvarez and P. Meessen
Abstract: A Newtonian matrix cosmology, correspoding to the BFSS model of eleven-dimensional M-theory in the IMF as a (0+1) M(atrix) model is constructed. Interesting new results are obtained, such as the existence of (much sought for in the past) static solutions. The possible interpretation of the off-diagonal entries as a background geometry is also briefly discussed.
