Title: On the complex structure in the Gupta-Bleuler quantization method
Authors: S. Bellucci and A. Galajinsky
Abstract: We examine the general conditions for the existence of the complex structure intrinsic in the Gupta-Bleuler quantization method for the specific case of mixed first and second class fermionic constraints in an arbitrary space-time dimension. The cases d=3 and 10 are shown to be of prime importance. The explicit solution for d=10 is presented.
