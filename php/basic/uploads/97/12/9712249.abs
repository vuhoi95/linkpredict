Title: Vertex Operator Representation of the Soliton Tau Functions in the  $A_n^{(1)}$ Toda Models by Dressing Transformations
Authors: H. Belich and G. Cuba and R. Paunov
Abstract: We study the relation between the group-algebraic approach and the dressing symmetry one to the soliton solutions of the $A_n^{(1)}$ Toda field theory in 1+1 dimensions. Originally solitons in the affine Toda models has been found by Olive, Turok and Underwood. Single solitons are created by exponentials of elements which ad-diagonalize the principal Heisenberg subalgebra. Alternatively Babelon and Bernard exploited the dressing symmetry to reproduce the known expressions for the fundamental tau functions in the sine-Gordon model. In this paper we show the equivalence between these two methods to construct solitons in the $A_n^{(n)}$ Toda models.
