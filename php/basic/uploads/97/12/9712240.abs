Authors: F. Darabi and M. A. Jafarizadeh and A. Rezaei-Aghdam
Abstract: We study a model of free massless scalar fields on a two dimensional cylinder with metric that admits a change of signature between Lorentzian and Euclidean type (ET), across the two timelike hypersurfaces (with respect to Lorentzian region). Considering a long strip-shaped region of the cylinder, denoted by an angle \theta, as the signature changed region it is shown that the energy spectrum depends on the angle \theta and in a sense differs from ordinary one for low energies. Morever diffeomorphism algebra of corresponding infinite conserved charges is different from '' Virasoro'' algebra and approaches to it at higher energies. The central term is also modified but does not approach to the ordinary one at higher energies.
