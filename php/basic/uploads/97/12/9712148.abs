Title: Nonperturbative dynamics for abstract (p,q) string networks
Authors: Fotini Markopoulou and Lee Smolin
Abstract: We describe abstract (p,q) string networks which are the string networks of Sen without the information about their embedding in a background spacetime. The non-perturbative dynamical formulation invented for spin networks, in terms of causal evolution of dual triangulations, is applied to them. The formal transition amplitudes are sums over discrete causal histories that evolve (p,q) string networks. The dynamics depend on two free SL(2,Z) invariant functions which describe the amplitudes for the local evolution moves.
