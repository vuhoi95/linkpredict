Title: Reply to Comment on "Duality of x and psi in Quantum Mechanics"
Authors: A. E. Faraggi and M. Matone
Abstract: The content of the comment [hep-th/9712219] is the derivation of Eq.(13) in Phys. Rev. Lett. 78 (1997) 163 by direct differential calculus: which is precisely the same method we used to derive it (it is in fact difficult to imagine any other possible derivation).
