Title: Generation of multipole moments by external field in Born-Infeld  non-linear electrodynamics
Authors: Dariusz Chruscinski and Jerzy Kijowski
Abstract: The mechanism for the generation of multipole moments due to an external field is presented for the Born-Infeld charged particle. The 'polarizability coefficient' for arbitrary l-pole moment is calculated. The l-th coefficient is proportional to the (2l+1)-th power of the characteristic length in the Born-Infeld theory. Physical implications are discussed.
