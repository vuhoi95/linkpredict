Authors: Guo-xing Ju and Shi-kun Wang and Ke Wu and Chi Xiong
Abstract: We analysis the symmetries of the reflection equation for open $XYZ$ model and find their solutions $K^{\pm}$ case by case. In the general open boundary conditions, the Lax pair for open one-dimensional $XYZ$ spin-chain is given.
