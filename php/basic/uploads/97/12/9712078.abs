Title: BPS Saturation from Null Reduction
Authors: Reinhold W. Gebert and Shun'ya Mizoguchi
Abstract: We show that any $d$-dimensional strictly stationary, asymptotically Minkowskian solution $(d\ge 4)$ of a null reduction of $d+1$-dimensional pure gravity must saturate the BPS bound provided that the KK vector field can be identified appropriately. We also argue that it is consistent with the field equations.
