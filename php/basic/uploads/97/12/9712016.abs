Title: Dynamical systems related to the Cremmer-Gervais R-matrix
Authors: M. Chaichian and P. Kulish and E. V. Damaskinsky
Abstract: The generalized Cremmer-Gervais R-matrix being a twist of the standard R-matrix of $SL_q(3)$, depends on two extra parameters. Properties of this R-matrix are discussed and two dynamical systems, the quantum group covariant $q$-oscillator and an integrable spin chain with a non-hermitian Hamiltonian, are constructed.
