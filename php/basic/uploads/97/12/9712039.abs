Title: Beta Function, C--Theorem and WDVV Equations in 4D N=2 SYM
Authors: G. Bertoldi and M. Matone
Abstract: We show that the exact $beta$--function of 4D N=2 SYM plays the role of the metric whose inverse satisfies the WDVV--like equations $\F_{ikl}\beta^{lm} \F_{mnj}=\F_{jkl}\beta^{lm}\F_{mni}$. The conjecture that the WDVV--like equations are equivalent to the identity involving the $u$--modulus and the prepotential $\F$, seen as a superconformal anomaly, sheds light on the recently considered c-theorem for the N=2 SYM field theories.
