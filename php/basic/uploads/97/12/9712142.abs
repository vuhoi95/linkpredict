Title: Entropy of bound states in the matrix description of M5-branes
Authors: Klaus Behrndt and Ilka Brunner
Abstract: Like the M-theory itself also the worldvolume theory of the M5-brane contains brane excitations, which can be extracted from the supersymmetry algebra. Bound states (intersecting branes) of the worldvolume can be translated into bound states of {11-d} SUGRA. In this paper, we discuss the matrix description for these bound states and their entropy (=degeneracy). In order to decouple the worldvolume field theory from the bulk gravity we have especially to assume that all charges are large, which gives a nice agreement with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of black holes.
