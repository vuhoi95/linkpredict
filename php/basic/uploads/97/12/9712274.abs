Title: epsilon'/epsilon violates Bell's inequality
Authors: F. Benatti and R. Floreanini
Abstract: We formulate a set of Bell's inequalities for the system of two correlated neutral kaons coming from the decay of a phi-meson, without assuming CP and CPT invariance. We show that a non-vanishing value of the phenomenological parameter epsilon' would violate such inequalities, ruling out Bell's locality.
