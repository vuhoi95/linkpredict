Title: Monstrous Heterotic Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Michael B. Green and David Kutasov
Abstract: A compactification of the heterotic string is considered which describes a particle propagating in the symmetric space M = SO(9,1;Z)\SO(9,1;R)/SO(9;R) in interaction with excited states whose dynamics is (1+1)-dimensional. The model appears to describe D-particle dynamics in type IIA string theory on M.
