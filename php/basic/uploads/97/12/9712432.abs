Title: Quark Mass Matrices in Superstring Models
Authors: T. Kobayashi and Z. Z. Xing
Abstract: Four simple but realistic patterns of quark mass matrices are derived from orbifold models of superstring theory in the absence of gauge symmetries. Two of them correspond to the Ramond-Roberts-Ross types, which have five texture zeros in up and down quark sectors. The other two, with four texture zeros, preserve the structural parallelism between up and down sectors. The phenomenological consequences of these mass matrices on flavor mixings and CP violation are analyzed at the weak scale. With the same input values of quark mass ratios, we find that only one or two of the four patterns can be in good agreement with current experimental data.
