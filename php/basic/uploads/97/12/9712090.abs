Title: Symmetry Algebras of Large-N Matrix Models for Open Strings
Authors: C. -W. H. Lee and S. G. Rajeev
Abstract: We have discovered that the gauge invariant observables of matrix models invariant under U($N$) form a Lie algebra, in the planar large-N limit. These models include Quantum Chromodynamics and the M(atrix)-Theory of strings. We study here the gauge invariant states corresponding to open strings (`mesons'). We find that the algebra is an extension of a remarkable new Lie algebra ${\cal V}_{\Lambda}$ by a product of more well-known algebras such as $gl_{\infty}$ and the Cuntz algebra. ${\cal V}_{\Lambda}$ appears to be a generalization of the Lie algebra of vector fields on the circle to non-commutative geometry. We also use a representation of our Lie algebra to establish an isomorphism between certain matrix models (those that preserve `gluon number') and open quantum spin chains. Using known results on quantum spin chains, we are able to identify some exactly solvable matrix models. Finally, the Hamiltonian of a dimensionally reduced QCD model is expressed explicitly as an element of our Lie algebra.
