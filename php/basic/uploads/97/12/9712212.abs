Title: Experimental signatures of supersymmetric dark-matter Q-balls
Authors: Alexander Kusenko and Vadim Kuzmin and Mikhail Shaposhnikov and P. G. Tinyakov
Abstract: Theories with low-energy supersymmetry predict the existence of stable non-topological solitons, Q-balls, that can contribute to dark matter. We discuss the experimental signatures, methods of detection, and the present limits on such dark matter candidates.
