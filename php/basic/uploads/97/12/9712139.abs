Title: Gauge-Invariant Operators for Singular Knots in Chern-Simons Gauge  Theory
Authors: J. M. F. Labastida and Esther Perez
Abstract: We construct gauge invariant operators for singular knots in the context of Chern-Simons gauge theory. These new operators provide polynomial invariants and Vassiliev invariants for singular knots. As an application we present the form of the Kontsevich integral for the case of singular knots.
