Title: Comment on "Duality of x and psi in quantum mechanics" by Faraggi and  Matone
Authors: J. L. Lucio and M. Ruiz-Altaba
Abstract: The dual Schrodinger equation for x in terms of psi derived by Faraggi and Matone [hep-th/9606063] with techniques inspired by field theory duality can be derived almost trivially from differential calculus.
