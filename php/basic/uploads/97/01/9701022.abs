Title: What is the Regularized Casimir Vacuum Energy Density?
Authors: Xinwei Kong and Finn Ravndal
Abstract: The regularized total Casimir energy in spacetimes with boundaries is not in general equal to the integral of the regularized energy density. This paradoxical phenomenon is most transparently analyzed in the simple example of a massless scalar field in 1+1 dimensions confined to a line element of length $L$ and obeying Dirichlet boundary conditions.
