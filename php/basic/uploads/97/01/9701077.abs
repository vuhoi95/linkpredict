Title: Black Strings and Classical Hair
Authors: Gary T. Horowitz and Haisong Yang
Abstract: We examine the geometry near the event horizon of a family of black string solutions with traveling waves. It has previously been shown that the metric is continuous there. Contrary to expectations, we find that the geometry is not smooth, and the horizon becomes singular whenever a wave is present. Both five dimensional and six dimensional black strings are considered with similar results.
