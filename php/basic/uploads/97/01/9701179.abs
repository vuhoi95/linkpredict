Title: A nonperturbative form of the spectral action principle in  noncommutative geometry

Abstract: Using the formalism of superconnections, we show the existence of a bosonic action functional for the standard K-cycle in noncommutative geometry, giving rise, through the spectral action principle, only to the Einstein gravity and Standard Model Yang-Mills-Higgs terms. It provides an effective nonminimal coupling in the bosonic sector of the Lagrangian.
