Title: QCD2-Screening, Confinement and Novel non-abelian Solutions
Authors: Yitzhak Frishman and Jacob Sonnenschein
Abstract: We analyze the question of screening versus confinement in bosonized massless QCD in two dimensions. We deduce the screening behavior of massless $SU(N_c)$ QCD with flavored fundamental fermions and fermions in the adjoint representation. This is done by computing the potential between external quarks as well as by bosonizing also the external sources and analyzing the states of the combined system. We write down novel "non-abelian Schwinger like" solutions of the equations of motion, compute their masses and argue that an exchange of massive modes of this type is associated with the screening mechanism.
