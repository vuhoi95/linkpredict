Title: The Wilson Effective KÃ¤hler Potential For Supersymmetric Nonlinear  Sigma Models
Authors: T. E. Clark and S. T. Love
Abstract: Renormalization group methods are used to determine the evolution of the low energy Wilson effective action for supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models in four dimensions. For the case of supersymmetric $CP^{(N-1)}$ models, the K\"ahler potential is determined exactly and is shown to exhibit a nontrivial ultraviolet fixed point in addition to a trivial infrared fixed point. The strong coupling behavior of the theory suggests the possible existence of additional relevant operators or nonperturbative degrees of freedom.
