Title: The Two-Dimensional O(2) Model on a Random Planar Lattice at Strong  Coupling
Authors: A. Matytsin and P. Zaugg
Abstract: The large spacing phase of the infinite random matrix chain, which represents the strongly coupled two-dimensional O(2) model on a random planar lattice, is explored. A class of solutions valid for large lattice spacings is constructed. It is proved that these solutions exhibit the critical exponents characteristic of pure two-dimensional gravity. The character expansion for the chain model is developed and an order parameter governing the Kosterlitz--Thouless phase transition is identified.
