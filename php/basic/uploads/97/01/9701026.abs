Title: Relations between correlators in gauge field theory
Authors: V. I. Shevchenko and Yu. A. Simonov
Abstract: Exact relations between gauge-invariant vacuum correlators in QCD are derived. Derivatives of the correlators are expressed in terms of higher orders correlators. The behaviour of the correlators at large and small distances due to these relations is discussed.
