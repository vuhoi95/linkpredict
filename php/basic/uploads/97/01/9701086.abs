Title: The SU(2) instanton and the adiabatic evolution of two Kramers doublets
Authors: M. T. Johnsson and I. J. R. Aitchison
Abstract: The adiabatic evolution of two doubly-degenerate (Kramers) levels is considered. The general five-parameter Hamiltonian describing the system is obtained and shown to be equivalent to one used in the $\Gamma_8 \otimes(\tau_2\oplus\epsilon)$ Jahn-Teller system. It is shown explicitly that the resulting SU(2) non-Abelian geometric vector potential is that of the (SO(5) symmetric) SU(2) instanton. Various forms of the potentials are discussed.
