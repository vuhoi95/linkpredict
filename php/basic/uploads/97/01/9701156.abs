Title: Fluctuation effects of gauge fields in the slave-boson t-J model
Authors: I. Ichinose and T. Matsui and K. Sakakibara
Abstract: We present a quantitative study of the charge-spin separation(CSS) phenomenon in a U(1) gauge theory of the t-J model of high-Tc superconductures. We calculate the critical temperature of confinement-deconfinement phase transition below which the CSS takes place.
