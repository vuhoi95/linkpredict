Title: Darboux Transformation for the Manin-Radul Supersymmetric KdV equation
Authors: Q. P. Liu and M. Manas
Abstract: In this paper we present a vectorial Darboux transformation, in terms of ordinary determinants, for the supersymmetric extension of the Korteweg-de Vries equation proposed by Manin and Radul. It is shown how this transformation reduces to the Korteweg-de Vries equation. Soliton type solutions are constructed by dressing the vacuum and we present some relevant plots.
