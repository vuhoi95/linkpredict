Title: On ``Effective potential for a covariantly constant gauge field in  curved spacetime''
Authors: Frank Antonsen and Karsten Bormann
Abstract: We extend recent work by Elizalde et al. to incorporate curvatures which are not small and backgrounds which are not just $S^2\times R^2, S^1\times S^1 \times R^2$. Some possible problems in their paper is also pointed out.
