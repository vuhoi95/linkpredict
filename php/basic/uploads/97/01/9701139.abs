Title: M(atrix) Theory on an Orbifold and Twisted Membrane
Authors: Nakwoo Kim and Soo-Jong Rey
Abstract: M(atrix) theory on an orbifold and classical two-branes therein are studied with particular emphasis to heterotic M(atrix) theory on $S_1/Z_2$ relevant to strongly coupled heterotic and dual Type IA string theories. By analyzing orbifold condition on Chan-Paton factors, we show that three choice of gauge group are possible for heterotic M(atrix) theory: SO(2N), SO(2N+1) or USp(2N). By examining area-preserving diffeomorphism that underlies the M(atrix) theory, we find that each choices of gauge group restricts possible topologies of two-branes. The result suggests that only the choice of SO(2N) or SO(2N+1) groups allows open two-branes, hence, relevant to heterotic M(atrix) theory. We show that requirement of both local vacuum energy cancellation and of worldsheet anomaly cancellation of resulting heterotic string identifies supersymmetric twisted sector spectra with sixteen fundamental representation spinors from each of the two fixed points. Twisted open and closed two-brane configurations are obtained in the large N limit.
