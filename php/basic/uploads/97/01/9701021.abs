Title: Is the classical Bukhvostov-Lipatov model integrable? A Painlev√©  analysis
Authors: Marco Ameduri and Costas J. Efthimiou
Abstract: In this work we apply the Weiss, Tabor and Carnevale integrability criterion (Painlev\'e analysis) to the classical version of the two dimensional Bukhvostov-Lipatov model. We are led to the conclusion that the model is not integrable classically, except at a trivial point where the theory can be described in terms of two uncoupled sine-Gordon models.
