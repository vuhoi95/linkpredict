Title: Properties of D-Branes in Matrix Model of IIB Superstring
Authors: I. Chepelev and Y. Makeenko and K. Zarembo
Abstract: We discuss properties of D-brane configurations in the matrix model of type IIB superstring recently proposed by Ishibashi, Kawai, Kitazawa and Tsuchiya. We calculate central charges in supersymmetry algebra at infinite N and associate them with one- and five-branes present in IIB superstring theory. We consider classical solutions associated with static three- and five-branes and calculate their interactions at one loop in the matrix model. We discuss some aspects of the matrix-model formulation of IIB superstring.
