Title: Path-integral fermion-boson decoupling at finite temperature
Authors: M. V. Manías and C. M. Naón and M. L. Trobo
Abstract: We show how to extend the standard functional approach to bosonisation, based on a decoupling change of path-integral variables, to the case in which a finite temperature is considered. As examples, in order to both illustrate and check the procedure, we derive the thermodynamical partition functions for the Thirring and Schwinger models.
