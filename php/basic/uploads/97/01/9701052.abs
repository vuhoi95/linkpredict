Title: Supersymmetric Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory
Authors: F. Ruiz Ruiz and P. van Nieuwenhuizen
Abstract: We prove that three-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory is finite to all loops. This leaves open the possibility that different regularization methods give different finite effective actions. We show that for this model dimensional regularization and regularization by dimensional reduction yield the same effective action.
