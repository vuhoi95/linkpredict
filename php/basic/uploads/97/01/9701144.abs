Title: On the Space-Time Uncertainty Relations of Liouville Strings and D  Branes
Authors: G. Amelino-Camelia and J. Ellis and N. E. Mavromatos and D. V. Nanopoulos
Abstract: Within a Liouville approach to non-critical string theory, we argue for a non-trivial commutation relation between space and time observables, leading to a non-zero space-time uncertainty relation $\delta x \delta t > 0$, which vanishes in the limit of weak string coupling.
