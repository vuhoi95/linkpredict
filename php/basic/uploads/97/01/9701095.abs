Title: Non-Extreme Black Holes from Intersecting M-Branes
Authors: Nobuyoshi Ohta and Takashi Shimizu
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of extending non-extreme black hole solutions made of intersecting M-branes to those with two non-extreme deformation parameters, similar to Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m solutions. General analysis of possible solutions is carried out to reduce the problem of solving field equations to a simple algebraic one for static spherically-symmetric case in $D$ dimensions. The results are used to show that the extension to two-parameter solutions is possible for $D=4,5$ dimensions but not for higher dimensions, and that the area of horizon always vanishes in the extreme limit for black hole solutions for $D \geq 6$ except for two very special cases which are identified. Various solutions are also summarized.
