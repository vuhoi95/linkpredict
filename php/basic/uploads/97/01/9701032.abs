Title: Effective Lagrangian and static black holes in 2D dilatonic gravity  inspired by quantum effects
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: We study the effective action in 2D dilaton-Maxwell quantum gravity. Working with the one-loop renormalizable subset of such theories, we construct the improved effective Lagrangian which contains curvature under logarithm. This effective Lagrangian leads to new classical dilatonic gravity inspired by quantum effects. The static black holes (BH) solutions which may play the role of a remnant after the Hawking radiation for such theory are carefully investigated. The effective Lagrangian for Gross-Neveu-dilaton gravity is also constructed (in 1/N expansion).
