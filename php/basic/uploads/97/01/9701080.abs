Title: Hamiltonian embedding of the massive Yang-Mills theory and the  generalized St√ºckelberg formalism
Authors: R. Banerjee and J. Barcelos-Neto
Abstract: Using the general notions of Batalin, Fradkin, Fradkina and Tyutin to convert second class systems into first class ones, we present a gauge invariant formulation of the massive Yang-Mills theory by embedding it in an extended phase space. The infinite set of correction terms necessary for obtaining the involutive constraints and Hamiltonian is explicitly computed and expressed in a closed form. It is also shown that the extra fields introduced in the correction terms are exactly identified with the auxiliary scalars used in the generalized St\"uckelberg formalism for converting a gauge noninvariant Lagrangian into a gauge invariant form.
