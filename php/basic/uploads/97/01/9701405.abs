Title: Bound on nonlocal scale from g-2 of muon in a nonlocal WS model
Authors: Gaitri Saini and Satish D. Joglekar
Abstract: We consider the nonlocal version of the Weinberg Salam model (following Kleppe et al.) with a finite parameter $\Lambda$ signifying a fundamental length scale.We calculate the extra contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon coming from the nonlocal structure in this model.We find that the nonlocal contribution can be comparable to weak contributions and goes to increase theoretical estimates. We use this calculation to determine the limit on the scale of nonlocality.We obtain the result $1/\Lambda \lessim 3 \times 10^{-16} $cm,which could be improved when present experimental errors narrow down.
