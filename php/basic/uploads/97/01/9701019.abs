Title: The Solution of the N=2 Supersymmetric f-Toda Chain with Fixed Ends
Authors: A. N. Leznov and A. Sorin
Abstract: The integrability of the recently introduced N=2 supersymmetric f-Toda chain, under appropriate boundary conditions, is proven. The recurrent formulae for its general solutions are derived. As an example, the solution for the simplest case of boundary conditions is presented in explicit form.
