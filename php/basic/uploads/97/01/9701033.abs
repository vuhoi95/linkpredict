Title: Exact wave functions and geometric phases of a generalized driven  oscillator
Authors: Min-Ho Lee and Hyeong-Chan Kim and Jeong-Young Ji
Abstract: The generalized invariant and its eigenstates of a general quadratic oscillator are found. The Schr\"odinger wave functions for the eigenstates are also found in analytically closed forms. The conditions for the existence of the cyclic initial state (CIS) are studied and the corresponding nonadiabatic Berry phase is calculated explicitly.
