Title: UV-regularization of field discontinuities
Authors: K. Sveshnikov and P. Silaev and I. Cherednikov
Abstract: A nonperturbative regularization of UV-divergencies, caused by finite discontinuities in the field configuration, is discussed in the context of 1+1-dimensional kink models. The relationship between this procedure and the appearance of "quantum copies" of classical kink solutions is studied in detail and confirmed by conventional methods of soliton quantization.
