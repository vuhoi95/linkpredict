Title: O(N) models within the local potential approximation
Authors: Jordi Comellas and Alex Travesset
Abstract: Using Wegner-Houghton equation, within the Local Potential Approximation, we study critical properties of O(N) vector models. Fixed Points, together with their critical exponents and eigenoperators, are obtained for a large set of values of N, including N=0 and N\to\infty. Polchinski equation is also treated. The peculiarities of the large N limit, where a line of Fixed Points at d=2+2/n is present, are studied in detail. A derivation of the equation is presented together with its projection to zero modes.
