Title: Duality on Higher Order U(1) Bundles
Authors: M. I. Caicedo and I. Martin and A. Restuccia
Abstract: A new global approach in the study of duality transformations is introduced. The geometrical structure of complex line bundles is generalized to higher order U(1) bundles which are classified by quantized charges and duality maps are formulated over these structures. Quantum equivalence is shown between dual theories. A global constraint is proven to be needed to achieve well defined bundles. These global structures are used to refine the proof of the duality equivalence between d=11 supermembrane and d=10 IIA Dirichlet supermembrane, giving a complete topological interpretation to their quantized charges.
