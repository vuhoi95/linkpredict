Title: Hidden Symmetries of the Principal Chiral Model and a Nonstandard Loop  Algebra
Authors: C. Devchand and Jeremy Schiff
Abstract: We examine the precise structure of the loop algebra of `dressing' symmetries of the Principal Chiral Model, and discuss a new infinite set of abelian symmetries of the field equations which preserve a symplectic form on the space of solutions.
