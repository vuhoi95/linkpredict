Title: Transformation of second-class into first-class constraints in  supersymmetric theories
Authors: J. Barcelos-Neto and W. Oliveira
Abstract: We use the method due to Batalin, Fradkin, Fradkina, and Tyutin (BFFT) in order to convert second-class into first-class constraints for some quantum mechanics supersymmetric theories. The main point to be considered is that the extended theory, where new auxiliary variables are introduced, has to be supersymmetric too. This leads to some additional restrictions with respect the conventional use of the BFFT formalism.
