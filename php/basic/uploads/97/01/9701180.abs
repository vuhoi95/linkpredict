Title: Quantum Field Theory in a Symmetric Curved Space from a Second  Quantization on a Group
Authors: M. Calixto and V. Aldaya and M. Navarro
Abstract: In this article we propose a `second quantization' scheme especially suitable to deal with non-trivial, highly symmetric phase spaces, implemented within a more general Group Approach to Quantization, which recovers the standard Quantum Field Theory (QFT) for ordinary relativistic linear fields. We emphasize, among its main virtues, greater suitability in characterizing vacuum states in a QFT on a highly symmetric curved space-time and the absence of the usual requirement of global hyperbolicity. This can be achieved in the special case of the Anti-de Sitter universe, on which we explicitly construct a QFT.
