Title: Crum Transformations and Wronskian Type Solutions for Supersymmetric KdV  equation
Authors: Q. P. Liu and M. Manas
Abstract: Darboux transformation is reconsidered for the supersymmetric KdV system. By iterating the Darboux transformation, a supersymmetric extension of the Crum transformation is obtained for the Manin-Radul SKdV equation, in doing so one gets Wronskian superdeterminant representations for the solutions. Particular examples provide us explicit supersymmetric extensions, super solitons, of the standard soliton of the KdV equation. The KdV soliton appears as the body of the super soliton.
