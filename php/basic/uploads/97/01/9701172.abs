Title: Chiral Symmetry Breaking in a Uniform External Magnetic Field
Authors: D. -S. Lee and C. N. Leung and Y. J. Ng
Abstract: Using the nonperturbative Schwinger-Dyson equation, we show that chiral symmetry is dynamically broken in QED at weak couplings when an external magnetic field is present, and that chiral symmetry is restored at temperatures above $T_c \simeq \alpha\pi^2/\sqrt{2 \pi |eH|}$, where $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant and $H$ is the magnetic field strength.
