Title: Non-local generalization of the axial anomaly and $x$-dependence of the  anomalous gluon contribution
Authors: D. MÃ¼ller and O. V. Teryaev
Abstract: The generalization of the axial anomaly is considered. It is shown that bilocal axial quark operators on the light cone possess, beside the point-like anomaly, also a light-like anomaly. The consequences for the definition of anomaly-free quark distribution functions and the effect of both gluon coefficient function and splitting kernels in polarized deep inelastic scattering are discussed.
