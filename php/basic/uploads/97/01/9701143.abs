Title: Axion production from gravitons off interacting 0-branes
Authors: Faheem Hussain and Roberto Iengo and Carmen Núñez
Abstract: We study axion-graviton scattering from a system of two D$0$-branes in a Type II superstring theory, a process which does not occur on a single brane. The two D$0$-branes interact via the exchange of closed string states which form a cylinder joining them. By compactifying on the $Z_3$ orbifold we find a non vanishing amplitude coming from the odd spin structure sector, thus from the exchanged RR states. We compute, in particular, the leading term of the amplitude at large distance from the branes, which corresponds to taking a field theory limit. This seems to suggest that the process takes place through the coupling of an axion to the RR states exchanged between the 0-branes.
