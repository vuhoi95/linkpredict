Title: M and F-Theory Instantons, N=1 Supersymmetry and Fractional Topological  Charges
Authors: Cesar Gomez and Rafael Hernandez
Abstract: We analize instanton generated superpotentials for three dimensional N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories obtained by compactifying on S^1 N=1 four dimensional theories. In the N_f=1 case, we find that the vacua in the decompactification limit is given by the singular points of the Coulomb branch of the N=2 four dimensional theory (we also consider the massive case). The decompactification limit of the superpotential for pure gauge theories without chiral matter is interpreted in terms of `t Hooft's fractional instanton amplitudes.
