Title: Multi-parameter deformed and nonstandard $Y(gl_M)$ Yangian symmetry in a  novel class of spin Calogero-Sutherland models
Authors: B. Basu-Mallick and Anjan Kundu
Abstract: It is well known through a recent work of Bernard, Gaudin, Haldane and Pasquier (BGHP) that the usual spin Calogero-Sutherland (CS) model, containing particles with $M$ internal degrees of freedom, respects the $Y(gl_M)$ Yangian symmetry. By following and suitably modifying the approach of BGHP, in this article we construct a novel class of spin CS models which exhibit multi-parameter deformed or `nonstandard' variants of $Y(gl_M)$ Yangian symmetry. An interesting feature of such CS Hamiltonians is that they contain many-body spin dependent interactions, which can be calculated directly from the associated rational solutions of Yang-Baxter equation. Moreover, these spin dependent interactions often lead to `anyon like' representations of permutation algebra on the combined internal space of all particles. We also find out the general forms of conserved quantities as well as Lax pairs for the above mentioned class of spin CS models, and describe the method of constructing their exact wave functions.
