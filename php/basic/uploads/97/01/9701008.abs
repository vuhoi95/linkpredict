Title: Factorization of differential operators, quasideterminants, and  nonabelian Toda field equations
Authors: Pavel Etingof and Israel Gelfand and Vladimir Retakh
Abstract: We integrate nonabelian Toda field equations for root systems of types A, B, C, for functions with values in any associative algebra. The solution is expressed via quasideterminants. In the appendix we review some results concerning nonabelian soliton equations.
