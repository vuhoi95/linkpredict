Title: Negative modes in the four-dimensional stringy wormholes
Authors: Jin Young Kim and H. W. Lee and Y. S. Myung
Abstract: We study the Giddings-Strominger wormholes in string theories. We found negative modes among O(4)-symmetric fluctuations about the non-singular wormhole background. Hence the stringy wormhole contribution to the euclidean functional integral is purely imaginary. This means that the stringy wormhole is a bounce (not an instanton) and describes the nucleation and growth of wormholes in the Minkowski spacetime.
