Title: Time and Temperature Dependent Correlation Functions of 1D Models of  Quantum Statistical Mechanics
Authors: Vladimir Korepin and Nikita Slavnov
Abstract: We consider gapless models of statistical mechanics. At zero temperatures correlation functions decay asymptotically as powers of distance in these models. Temperature correlations decay exponentially. We used an example of solvable model to find the formula, which describes long distance and large time asymptotic of correlation function of local fields. The formula describes correlation at any temperature and arbitrary coupling constant.
