Title: World-Volume Action of the M Theory Five-Brane
Authors: Mina Aganagic and Jaemo Park and Costin Popescu and John H. Schwarz
Abstract: This paper presents a 6d world-volume action that describes the dynamics of the M theory five-brane in a flat 11d space-time background. The world-volume action has global 11d super-Poincare invariance, as well as 6d general coordinate invariance and kappa symmetry, which are realized as local symmetries. The paper mostly considers a formulation in which general coordinate invariance is not manifest in one direction. However, it also describes briefly an alternative formulation, due to Pasti, Sorokin, and Tonin, in which general coordinate invariance is manifest. The latter approach requires auxiliary fields and new gauge invariances.
