Title: Interacting Quantum Fields in Curved Space: Renormalizability of  $\varphi^4$
Authors: R. Brunetti and K. Fredenhagen
Abstract: We present a perturbative construction of the $\varphi^4$ model on a smooth globally hyperbolic space-time. Our method relies on a adaptation of the Epstein and Glaser method of renormalization to curved space-times using techniques from microlocal analysis.
