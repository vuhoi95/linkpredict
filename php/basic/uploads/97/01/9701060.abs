Title: Zeta-function regularization, the multiplicative anomaly and the  Wodzicki residue
Authors: E. Elizalde and L. Vanzo and S. Zerbini
Abstract: The multiplicative anomaly associated with the zeta-function regularized determinant is computed for the Laplace-type operators $L_1=-\lap+V_1$ and $L_2=-\lap+V_2$, with $V_1$, $V_2$ constant, in a D-dimensional compact smooth manifold $ M_D$, making use of several results due to Wodzicki and by direct calculations in some explicit examples. It is found that the multiplicative anomaly is vanishing for $D$ odd and for D=2. An application to the one-loop effective potential of the O(2) self-interacting scalar model is outlined.
