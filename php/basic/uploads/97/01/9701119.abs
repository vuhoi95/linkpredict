Title: On Zero-Mass Ground States in Super-Membrane Matrix Models
Authors: J. Froehlich and J. Hoppe
Abstract: We recall a formulation of super-membrane theory in terms of certain matrix models. These models are known to have a mass spectrum given by the positive half-axis. We show that, for the simplest such matrix model, a normalizable zero-mass ground state does not exist.
