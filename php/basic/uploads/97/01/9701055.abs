Title: Strong Coupling Expansions of SU(N) Seiberg-Witten Theory
Authors: Eric D'Hoker and D. H. Phong
Abstract: We set up a systematic expansion of the prepotential for ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories with SU(N) gauge group in the region of strong coupling where a maximal number of mutually local fields become massless. In particular, we derive the first non-trivial non-perturbative correction, which is the first term in the strong coupling expansion providing a coupling between the different U(1) factors, and which governs for example the strength of gaugino Yukawa couplings.
