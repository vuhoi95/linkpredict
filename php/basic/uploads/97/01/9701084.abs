Title: Parastatistics as Examples of the Extended Haldane Statistics
Authors: Stjepan Meljanac and Marijan Milekovic
Abstract: We show that for every algebra of creation and annihilation operators with a Fock-like representation,one can define extended Haldane statistical parameters in a unique way. Specially for parastatistics, we calculate extended Haldane parameters and discuss the corresponding partition functions.
