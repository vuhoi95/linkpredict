Title: Introduction to S-Duality in N=2 Supersymmetric Gauge Theory. (A  pedagogical review of the work of Seiberg and Witten)
Authors: L. Alvarez-Gaume and S. F. Hassan
Abstract: In these notes we attempt to give a pedagogical introduction to the work of Seiberg and Witten on S-duality and the exact results of N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories with and without matter. The first half is devoted to a review of monopoles in gauge theories and the construction of supersymmetric gauge theories. In the second half, we describe the work of Seiberg and Witten.
