Title: Twisted Quantum Lax Equations
Authors: Branislav Jurco and Peter Schupp
Abstract: We give the construction of twisted quantum Lax equations associated with quantum groups. We solve these equations using factorization properties of the corresponding quantum groups. Our construction generalizes in many respects the Adler-Kostant-Symes construction for Lie groups and the construction of M. A. Semenov Tian-Shansky for the Lie-Poisson case.
