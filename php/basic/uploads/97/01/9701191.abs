Title: Self-Dual N=1 SUSY Gauge Theories
Authors: Csaba Csaki and Martin Schmaltz and Witold Skiba and John Terning
Abstract: We present a large set of new self-dual N=1 SUSY gauge theories. Examples include SU(N) theories with tensors and SO(N) theories with spinors. Using these dualities as starting points, new non-trivial duals can be derived by higgsing the gauge group or by integrating out matter. General lessons that can be learned from these duals are: ``accidental" infrared symmetries play an important role in duality, many theories have more than one ``dual", and there seems to be no simple organizing pattern which relates duals of theories with different number of flavors.
