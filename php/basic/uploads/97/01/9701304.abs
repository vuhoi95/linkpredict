Title: Erice Lectures on Inflationary Reheating
Authors: D. Boyanovsky and H. J. de Vega and R. Holman
Abstract: At the end of the inflationary stage of the early universe, profuse particle production leads to the reheating of the universe. Such explosive particle production is due to parametric amplification of quantum fluctuations for the unbroken symmetry case (appropriate for chaotic inflation), or spinodal instabilities in the broken symmetry phase(which is the case in new inflation). The self-consistent methods presented in these lectures are the only approaches, so far, that lead to reliable quantitative results on the reheating mechanism in the inflationary universe. They fully use the field theoretical Schwinger-Keldysh out of equilibrium method in a non-perturbative way. These approaches take into account the non-linear interaction between the quantum modes and exactly conserve energy (covariantly). Simplified analysis that do not include the full backreaction and do not conserve energy, result in unbound particle production and lead to quantitatively erroneous results. For spontaneously broken theories the issue of whether the symmetry may be restored or not by the quantum fluctuations is analyzed. The precise criterion for symmetry restoration is presented. The field dynamics is symmetric when the energy density in the initial state is larger than the top of the tree level potential. When the initial energy density is below the top of the tree level potential, the symmetry is broken.
