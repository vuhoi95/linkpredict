Title: Systematic approach to cyclic orbifolds
Authors: L. Borisov and M. B. Halpern and C. Schweigert
Abstract: We introduce an orbifold induction procedure which provides a systematic construction of cyclic orbifolds, including their twisted sectors. The procedure gives counterparts in the orbifold theory of all the current-algebraic constructions of conformal field theory and enables us to find the orbifold characters and their modular transformation properties.
