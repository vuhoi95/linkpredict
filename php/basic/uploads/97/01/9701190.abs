Title: Boundary states for moving D-branes
Authors: Marco Billo and Daniel Cangemi and Paolo Di Vecchia
Abstract: We determine the boundary state for both the NS-NS and R-R sectors of superstring theory. We show how they are modified under a boost. The boosted boundary state is then used for computing the interaction of two D-branes moving with constant velocity reproducing with a completely different method a recent calculation by Bachas.
