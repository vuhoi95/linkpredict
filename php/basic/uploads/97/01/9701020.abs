Abstract: A special family of partitions occurs in two apparently unrelated contexts: the evaluation of 1-dimensional configuration sums of certain RSOS models, and the modular representation theory of symmetric groups or their Hecke algebras $H_m$. We provide an explanation of this coincidence by showing how the irreducible $H_m$-modules which remain irreducible under restriction to $H_{m-1}$ (Jantzen-Seitz modules) can be determined from the decomposition of a tensor product of representations of affine $\sl_n$.
