Title: What If Dirac Pionini Existed in a Purely Chiral Superfield Formulation?
Authors: S. James Gates, Jr. and Lubna Rana
Abstract: By an explicit construction, it is shown that the geometry of the SU(3) pion multiplet with respect to the group manifold SU_L(3) x SU_R(3) maybe deformed to admit a second pseudoscalar multiplet that is analogous to the Z_0 in unified theories of the electroweak interactions. This observation is found to play a key role in the construction of the N = 1 supersymmetric models with pions and Dirac-like spin-1/2 superpartners ("pionini").
