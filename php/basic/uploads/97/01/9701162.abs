Title: Vector Bundles And F Theory
Authors: Robert Friedman and John Morgan and Edward Witten
Abstract: To understand in detail duality between heterotic string and F theory compactifications, it is important to understand the construction of holomorphic G bundles over elliptic Calabi-Yau manifolds, for various groups G. In this paper, we develop techniques to describe the bundles, and make several detailed comparisons between the heterotic string and F theory.
