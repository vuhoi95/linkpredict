Title: Tunneling and orthogonality catastrophe in the topological mechanism of  superconductivity
Authors: A. G. Abanov and P. B. Wiegmann
Abstract: We compute the angular dependence of the order parameter and tunneling amplitude in a model exhibiting topological superconductivity and sketch its derivation as a model of a doped Mott insulator. We show that ground states differing by an odd number of particles are orthogonal and the order parameter is in the d-representation, although the gap in the electronic spectrum has no nodes. We also develop an operator algebra, that allowes one to compute off-diagonal correlation functions.
