Title: T-Duality without Quantum Corrections
Authors: E. Alvarez and J. Borlaf and J. H. Le√≥n
Abstract: It is a well known fact that the classical (``Buscher'') transformations of T-duality do receive, in general, quantum corrections. It is interesting to check whether classical T-duality can be exact as a quantum symmetry. The natural starting point is a $\sigma$-model with N=4 world sheet supersymmetry. Remarkably, we find that (owing to the fact that N=4 models with torsion are not off-shell finite as quantum theories),the T-duality transformations for these models get in general quantum corrections, with the only known exception of warped products of flat submanifolds or orbifolds thereof with other geometries.
