Abstract: We apply newly improved Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin Hamiltonian method to the chiral Schwinger Model in the case of the regularization ambiguity $a>1$. We show that one can systematically construct the first class constraints by the BFT Hamiltonian method, and also show that the well-known Dirac brackets of the original phase space variables are exactly the Poisson brackets of the corresponding modified fields in the extended phase space. Furthermore, we show that the first class Hamiltonian is simply obtained by replacing the original fields in the canonical Hamiltonian by these modified fields. Performing the momentum integrations, we obtain the corresponding first class Lagrangian in the configuration space.
