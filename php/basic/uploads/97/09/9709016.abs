Authors: X. M. Ding and B. Y. Hou and B. Yuan Hou and L. Zhao
Abstract: We construct a realization of the Yangian double DY_\hbar(gl_N) and DY_\hbar(sl_N) of an arbitrary level k in terms of free boson fields with a continuous parameter. In the \hbar \to 0 limit this realization becomes the Wakimoto realization of kac-Moody algebra gl_N and sl_N, respectively. The vertex operators and the screening currents are also constructed with the same spirits; the screening currents commute with DY_\hbar(sl_N) modulo total difference.
