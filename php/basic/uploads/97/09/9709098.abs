Title: D-brane interaction in the type IIB Matrix Model
Authors: Bhabani Prasad Mandal and Subir Mukhopadhyay
Abstract: We calculate the potential between bound states of D-branes of different dimension in IIB matrix model upto one loop order and find nice agreement with the open string calculations in short and large distance limit. We also consider the scattering of bound states of D-branes, calculate the scattering phase shift and analyze the effective potential in different limits.
