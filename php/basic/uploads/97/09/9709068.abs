Title: Darboux coordinates for (first order) tetrad gravity
Authors: Maximo Banados and Mauricio Contreras
Abstract: The Hamiltonian form of the Hilbert action in the first order tetrad formalism is examined. We perform a non-linear field redefinition of the canonical variables isolating the part of the spin connection which is canonically conjugate to the tetrad. The geometrical meaning of the constraints written in these new variables is examined.
