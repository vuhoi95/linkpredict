Title: The Conformal Anomaly in General Rank 1 Symmetric Spaces and Associated  Operator Product
Authors: A. A. Bytsenko and A. E. Goncalves and F. L. Williams
Abstract: We compute the one-loop effective action and the conformal anomaly associated with the product $\bigotimes_p{\cal L}_p$ of the Laplace type operators ${\cal L}_p, p=1,2$, acting in irreducible rank 1 symmetric spaces of non-compact type. The explicit form of the zeta functions and the conformal anomaly of the stress-energy momentum tensor is derived.
