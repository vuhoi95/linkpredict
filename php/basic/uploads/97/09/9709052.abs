Title: Variational treatment of quenched QED using the worldline technique
Authors: A. W. Schreiber and C. Alexandrou and R. Rosenfelder
Abstract: There has been growing interest in studying the behaviour of QED in its strong coupling limit. The reason for this is not only that it serves as a simple prototype gauge theory for testing nonperturbative calculational techniques which one then goes on to apply to QCD, but also because the theory exhibits interesting behaviour in its own right. In particular, it now appears to be quite well established that QED breaks chiral symmetry dynamically as long as the coupling is sufficiently large. In this contribution we describe the progress made in applying the polaron variational approach to quenched QED within the context of the worldline formulation of field theory. Although it is too early for quantitative results, qualitatively the approach seems promising: The method is formulated covariantly in Minkowski space-time, the Ward-Takahashi identities are satisfied, the connection between the bare- and pole-masses of the electron is gauge independent, the known exact result for the infrared dependence of the on-shell renormalized propagator is reproduced and corrections to the variational approximation can be calculated systematically.
