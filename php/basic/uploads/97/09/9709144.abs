Title: Two-loop self-energy diagrams worked out with NDIM
Authors: Alfredo T. Suzuki and Alexandre G. M. Schmidt
Abstract: In this work we calculate two two-loop massless Feynman integrals pertaining to self-energy diagrams using NDIM (Negative Dimensional Integration Method). We show that the answer we get is 36-fold degenerate. We then consider special cases of exponents for propagators and the outcoming results compared with known ones obtained via traditional methods.
