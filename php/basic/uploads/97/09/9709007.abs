Title: Singular Structure in 4D Simplicial Gravity
Authors: S. Catterall and R. Renken and J. Kogut
Abstract: We show that the phase transition previously observed in dynamical triangulation models of quantum gravity can be understood as being due to the creation of a singular link. The transition between singular and non-singular geometries as the gravitational coupling is varied appears to be first order.
