Title: q-deformed algebras $U_q(so_n)$ and their representations
Authors: A. M. Gavrilik and N. Z. Iorgov
Abstract: For the nonstandard $q$-deformed algebras $U_q(so_n)$, defined recently in terms of trilinear relations for generating elements, most general finite dimensional irreducible representations directly corresponding to those of nondeformed algebras $so(n)$ (i.e., characterized by the same sets of only integers or only half-integers as in highest weights of the latter) are given explicitly in a $q$-analogue of Gel'fand-Tsetlin basis. Detailed proof, for $q$ not equal to a root of unity, that representation operators indeed satisfy relevant (trilinear) relations and define finite dimensional irreducible representations is presented. The results show perfect suitability of the Gel'fand-Tsetlin formalism concerning (nonstandard) $q$-deformation of $so(n)$.
