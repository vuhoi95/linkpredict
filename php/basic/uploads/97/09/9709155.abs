Title: Fixed point analysis of a scalar theory with an external field
Authors: A. Bonanno and D. Zappala'
Abstract: A momentum dependent projection of the Wegner-Hougton equation is derived for a scalar theory coupled to an external field. This formalism is useful to discuss the phase diagram of the theory. In particular we study some properties of the Gaussian fixed point.
