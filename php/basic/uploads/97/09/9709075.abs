Title: Chiral solitons from dimensional reduction of Chern-Simons gauged  non-linear Schr√∂dinger model of FQHE: classical and quantum aspects
Authors: L. Griguolo and D. Seminara
Abstract: The soliton structure of a gauge theory recently proposed to describe chiral excitations in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect is investigated. A new type of non-linear derivative Schr\"odinger equation emerges as an effective description of the system that supports novel chiral solitons. We discuss the classical properties of solutions with vanishing and non-vanishing boundary conditions (dark solitons) and we explain their relation to integrable systems. The quantum analysis is also addressed in the framework of a semiclassical approximation improved by Renormalization Group arguments.
