Title: QED processes beyond the Aharonov-Bohm effect
Authors: J. Audretsch and V. D. Skarzhinsky
Abstract: We consider QED - processes in the presence of an infinitely thin and infinitely long straight string with a magnetic flux inside it. The bremsstrahlung from an electron passing by the magnetic string and the electron-positron pair production by a single photon are reviewed. Based on the exact electron and positron solutions of the Dirac equation in the external Aharonov-Bohm potential we present matrix elements for these processes. The dependence of the resulting cross sections on energies, directions and polarizations of the involved particles is discussed for low energies.
