Title: One-loop effective multi-gluon Lagrangian in arbitrary dimensions
Authors: E Rodulfo and R Delbourgo
Abstract: We exhibit the one-loop multi-gluon effective Lagrangian in any dimension for a field theory with a quasilocal background, using the background-field formalism. Specific results, including counter terms (up to 12 spacetime dimensions), have been derived, applied to the Yang-Mills theory and found to be in agreement with other string-inspired approaches.
