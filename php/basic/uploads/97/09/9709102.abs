Title: The Hubbard quantum wire
Authors: You-Quan Li and Christian Gruber
Abstract: By introducing a boundary condition for the quantum wire, the Hubbard model is solved exactly by means of Bethe ansatz. The wave function for the bounded state is clearly defined, and the secular equation for the spectrum is exactly obtained. The ground state and low-lying excited states are studied in the thermodynamic limit. The ground-state energy in the strong coupling limit is obtained explicitly, and compared with the results of periodic boundary condition.
