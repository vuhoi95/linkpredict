Title: Electric-magnetic Duality in Noncommutative Geometry
Authors: Fedele Lizzi and Richard J. Szabo
Abstract: The structure of S-duality in U(1) gauge theory on a 4-manifold M is examined using the formalism of noncommutative geometry. A noncommutative space is constructed from the algebra of Wilson-'t Hooft line operators which encodes both the ordinary geometry of M and its infinite-dimensional loop space geometry. S-duality is shown to act as an inner automorphism of the algebra and arises as a consequence of the existence of two independent Dirac operators associated with the spaces of self-dual and anti-selfdual 2-forms on M. The relations with the noncommutative geometry of string theory and T-duality are also discussed.
