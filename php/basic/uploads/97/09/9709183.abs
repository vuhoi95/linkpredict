Title: Sine-Gordon Solitons and Black Holes
Authors: J. Gegenberg and G. Kunstatter
Abstract: In the talk, the relationship between black holes in Jackiw-Teitelboim(JT) dilaton gravity and solitons in sine-Gordon field theory is described. The well-known connection between solutions of the sine-Gordon equation and constant curvature metrics is reviewed and expanded. In particular, it is shown that solutions to the dilaton field equations for a given metric in JT theory also solve the sine-Gordon equation linearized about the corresponding soliton. Next, it is shown that from the B${\ddot a}$cklund transformations relating different soliton solutions, it is possible to construct a flat SL(2,R) connection which forms the basis for the gauge theory formulation of JT dilaton gravity. Finally, the supersymmetric generalization of sine-Gordon theory is reviewed, leading to a new approach to the problem of the origin of low dimensional black hole entropy.
