Title: Skyrmions and domain walls in (2+1) dimensions
Authors: A. Kudryavtsev and B. Piette and W. J. Zakrzewski
Abstract: We study classical solutions of the vector O(3) sigma model in (2+1) dimensions, spontaneously broken to O(2)xZ2. The model possesses Skyrmion-type solutions as well as stable domain walls which connect different vacua. We show that different types of waves can propagate on the wall, including waves carrying a topological charge. The domain wall can also absorb Skyrmions and, under appropriate initial conditions, it is possible to emit a Skyrmion from the wall.
