Title: Unstable Systems in Relativistic Quantum Field Theory
Authors: L. Maiani and M. Testa
Abstract: We show how the state of an unstable particle can be defined in terms of stable asymptotic states. This general definition is used to discuss and to solve some old problems connected with the short-time and large-time behaviour of the non-decay amplitude.
