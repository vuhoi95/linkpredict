Title: Global monopoles in dilaton gravity
Authors: Owen Dando and Ruth Gregory
Abstract: We analyse the gravitational field of a global monopole within the context of low energy string gravity, allowing for an arbitrary coupling of the monopole fields to the dilaton. Both massive and massless dilatons are considered. We find that, for a massless dilaton, the spacetime is generically singular, whereas when the dilaton is massive, the monopole generically induces a long range dilaton cloud. We compare and contrast these results with the literature.
