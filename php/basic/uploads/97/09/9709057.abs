Title: The Second Virial Coefficient of Spin-1/2 Anyon Systems
Authors: Sahng-kyoon Yoo and D. K. Park
Abstract: We calculate the second virial coefficient of spin-1/2 anyon gas in the various values of the self-adjoint extension parameter by incorporating the self-adjoint extension method into the Green's function formalism. Especially, the completely different cusp- and discontinuity-structures from the result of previous literature are obtained when the self-adjoint extension parameter goes to infinity. This is originated from the different condition for the occurrence of irregular states.
