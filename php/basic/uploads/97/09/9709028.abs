Title: Relativistic spin networks and quantum gravity
Authors: John W. Barrett and Louis Crane
Abstract: Relativistic spin networks are defined by considering the spin covering of the group SO(4), SU(2) times SU(2). Relativistic quantum spins are related to the geometry of the 2-dimensional faces of a 4-simplex. This extends the idea of Ponzano and Regge that SU(2) spins are related to the geometry of the edges of a 3-simplex. This leads us to suggest that there may be a 4-dimensional state sum model for quantum gravity based on relativistic spin networks which parallels the construction of 3-dimensional quantum gravity from ordinary spin networks.
