Title: Negative Dimensional Integration for Massive Four Point Functions--II:  New Solutions
Authors: Alfredo T. Suzuki and Alexandre G. M. Schmidt
Abstract: In this sequel calculation of the one-loop Feynman integral pertaining to a massive box diagram contributing to the photon-photon scattering amplitude in quantum electrodynamics, we present the six solutions as yet unknown in the literature. These six new solutions arise quite naturally in the context of negative dimensional integration approach, revealing a promising technique to handle Feynman integrals.
