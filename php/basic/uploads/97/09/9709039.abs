Title: On Fusion Algebras and Modular Matrices
Authors: T. Gannon and M. A. Walton
Abstract: We consider the fusion algebras arising in e.g. Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theories, affine Kac-Moody algebras at positive integer level, and quantum groups at roots of unity. Using properties of the modular matrix $S$, we find small sets of primary fields (equivalently, sets of highest weights) which can be identified with the variables of a polynomial realization of the $A_r$ fusion algebra at level $k$. We prove that for many choices of rank $r$ and level $k$, the number of these variables is the minimum possible, and we conjecture that it is in fact minimal for most $r$ and $k$. We also find new, systematic sources of zeros in the modular matrix $S$. In addition, we obtain a formula relating the entries of $S$ at fixed points, to entries of $S$ at smaller ranks and levels. Finally, we identify the number fields generated over the rationals by the entries of $S$, and by the fusion (Verlinde) eigenvalues.
