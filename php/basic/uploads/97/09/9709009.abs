Title: Can (noncommutative) geometry accommodate leptoquarks?
Authors: Mario Paschke and Florian Scheck and Andrzej Sitarz
Abstract: We investigate the geometric interpretation of the Standard Model based on noncommutative geometry. Neglecting the $S_0$-reality symmetry one may introduce leptoquarks into the model. We give a detailed discussion of the consequences (both for the Connes-Lott and the spectral action) and compare the results with physical bounds. Our result is that in either case one contradicts the experimental results.
