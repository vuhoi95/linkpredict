Title: Z(2) vortices and the string tension in SU(2) gauge theory
Authors: Tamas G. Kovacs and E. T. Tomboulis
Abstract: We exhibit the appropriate variables allowing the plus-minus (Z(2)) `reduction' of the Wilson loop operator which provides a direct measure of the thin, thick and `mixed' Z(2) topological, gauge-invariant vortices in SU(2) LGT. Simulations with the Wilson action, as well as a perfect action smoothing procedure, show the string tension to be reproduced from the contributions of these excitations.
