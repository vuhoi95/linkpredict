Title: Analyzing Chiral Symmetry Breaking in Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
Authors: Thomas Appelquist and Andreas Nyffeler and Stephen B. Selipsky
Abstract: We compare gap equation predictions for the spontaneous breaking of global symmetries in supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory to nonperturbative results from holomorphic effective action techniques. In the theory without matter fields, both approaches describe the formation of a gluino condensate. With $N_f$ flavors of quark and squark fields, and with $N_f$ below a certain critical value, the coupled gap equations have a solution for quark and gluino condensate formation, corresponding to breaking of global symmetries and of supersymmetry. This appears to disagree with the newer nonperturbative techniques, but the reliability of gap equations in this context and whether the solution represents the ground state remain unclear.
