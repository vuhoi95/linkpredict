Title: Finite Energy Solutions in Three-Dimensional Heterotic String Theory
Authors: Michele Bourdeau and Gabriel Lopes Cardoso
Abstract: We show that a large class of supersymmetric solutions to the low-energy effective field theory of heterotic string theory compactified on a seven torus can have finite energy, which we compute. The mechanism by which these solutions are turned into finite energy solutions is similar to the one occurring in the context of four-dimensional stringy cosmic string solutions. We also describe the solutions in terms of intersecting eleven-dimensional M-branes, M-waves and M-monopoles.
