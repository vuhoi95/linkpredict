Title: Nahm's equations and root systems
Authors: Tomasz Brzezinski and Houari Merabet
Abstract: A method of deriving solutions to Nahm's equations based on root structure of simple Lie algebras is given. As an illustration of this method the recently found solutions to Nahm's equations with tetrahedral and octahedral symmetries are shown to correspond to $A_2$ and $A_3$ root systems.
