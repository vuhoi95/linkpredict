Title: A Skyrme lattice with hexagonal symmetry
Authors: Richard Battye and Paul Sutcliffe
Abstract: Recently it has been found that the structure of Skyrmions has a close analogy to that of fullerene shells in carbon chemistry. In this letter we show that this analogy continues further, by presenting a Skyrme field that describes a lattice of Skyrmions with hexagonal symmetry. This configuration, a novel `domain wall' in the Skyrme model, has low energy per baryon (about 6% above the Faddeev-Bogomolny bound) and in many ways is analogous to graphite. By comparison to the energy per baryon of other known Skyrmions and also the Skyrme crystal, we discuss the possibility of finding Skyrmion shells of higher charge.
