Title: On the Equivalence between 2D Induced Gravity and a WZNW system
Authors: M. Blagojević and D. Popović and B. Sazdović
Abstract: A general method of constructing canonical gauge invariant actions is used to establish the equivalence between 2D induced gravity and a WZNW system, defined by a difference of two simple WZNW actions fo the SL(2,R) group. The diffeomorphism invariance of the induced gravity is generated by the SL(2,R) Kac-Moody structure of the WZNW system.
