Title: Renormalization Group with Condensate
Authors: Jean Alexandre and Vincenzo Branchina and Janos Polonyi
Abstract: The renormalization group is applied to the phi4 model in the symmetry broken phase in order to identify different scaling regimes. The new scaling laws reflect nonuniversal behavior at the phase transition. The extension of the analysis to finite temperature is briefly outlined. It is mentioned that the coupling constants can be found in the mixed phase by taking into account the saddle points of the blocking procedure.
