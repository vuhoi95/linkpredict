Title: Duality in Quantum Field Theory (and String Theory)
Authors: Luis Alvarez-Gaume and Frederic Zamora
Abstract: These lectures give an introduction to duality in Quantum Field Theory. We discuss the phases of gauge theories and the implications of the electric-magnetic duality transformation to describe the mechanism of confinement. We review the exact results of N=1 supersymmetric QCD and the Seiberg-Witten solution of N=2 super Yang-Mills. Some of its extensions to String Theory are also briefly discussed.
