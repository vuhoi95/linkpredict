Title: Fractional-Spin Integrals of Motion for the Boundary Sine-Gordon Model  at the Free Fermion Point
Authors: Luca Mezincescu and Rafael I. Nepomechie
Abstract: We construct integrals of motion (IM) for the sine-Gordon model with boundary at the free Fermion point which correctly determine the boundary S matrix. The algebra of these IM (``boundary quantum group'' at q=1) is a one-parameter family of infinite-dimensional subalgebras of twisted affine sl(2). We also propose the structure of the fractional-spin IM away from the free Fermion point.
