Title: Supersymmetric Q-balls as dark matter
Authors: Alexander Kusenko and Mikhail Shaposhnikov
Abstract: Supersymmetric extensions of the standard model generically contain stable non-topological solitons, Q-balls, which carry baryon or lepton number. We show that large Q-balls can be copiously produced in the early universe, can survive until the present time, and can contribute to dark matter.
