Title: Random Bond Potts Model: the Test of the Replica Symmetry Breaking
Authors: Viktor Dotsenko and Vladimir Dotsenko and Marco Picco
Abstract: Averaged spin-spin correlation function squared $\overline{<\sigma(0)\sigma(R)>^{2}}$ is calculated for the ferromagnetic random bond Potts model. The technique being used is the renormalization group plus conformal field theory. The results are of the $\epsilon$ - expansion type fixed point calculation, $\epsilon$ being the deviation of the central charge (or the number of components) of the Potts model from the Ising model value. Calculations are done both for the replica symmetric and the replica symmetry broken fixed points. The results obtained allow for the numerical simulation tests to decide between the two different criticalities of the random bond Potts model.
