Title: Non-Abelian Black Holes in Brans-Dicke Theory
Authors: Takashi Tamaki and Takashi Torii and Kei-ichi Maeda
Abstract: We find a black hole solution with non-Abelian field in Brans-Dicke theory. It is an extension of non-Abelian black hole in general relativity. We discuss two non-Abelian fields: "SU(2)" Yang-Mills field with a mass (Proca field) and the SU(2)$\times$SU(2) Skyrme field. In both cases, as in general relativity, there are two branches of solutions, i.e., two black hole solutions with the same horizon radius. Masses of both black holes are always smaller than those in general relativity. A cusp structure in the mass-horizon radius ($M_{g}$-$r_{h}$) diagram, which is a typical symptom of stability change in catastrophe theory, does not appear in the Brans-Dicke frame but is found in the Einstein conformal frame. This suggests that catastrophe theory may be simply applied for a stability analysis as it is if we use the variables in the Einstein frame. We also discuss the effects of the Brans-Dicke scalar field on black hole structure.
