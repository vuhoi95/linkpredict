Title: Supergravity Radiative Effects on Soft Terms and the $Î¼$ Term
Authors: Kiwoon Choi and Jae Sik Lee and Carlos Munoz
Abstract: We compute quadratically divergent supergravity one-loop effects on soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters and the $\mu$ term in generic hidden sector supergravity models. These effects can significantly modify the matching condition for soft parameters at the Planck scale and also provide several new sources of the $\mu$ term which are naturally of order the weak scale. We also discuss some phenomenological implications of these effects, particularly the violation of the scalar mass universality which may lead to dangerous FCNC phenomena, and apply the results to superstring effective supergravity models.
