Abstract: Gravitationally coupled scalar fields, originally introduced by Jordan, Brans and Dicke to account for a non constant gravitational coupling, are a prediction of many non-Einsteinian theories of gravity not excluding perturbative formulations of String Theory. In this paper, we compute the cross sections for scattering and absorption of scalar and tensor gravitational waves by a resonant-mass detector in the framework of the Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory. The results are then specialized to the case of a detector of spherical shape and shown to reproduce those obtained in General Relativity in a certain limit. Eventually we discuss the potential detectability of scalar waves emitted in a spherically symmetric gravitational collapse.
