Title: An SL(2, Z) Multiplet of Black Holes in $D = 4$ Type II Superstring  Theory

Abstract: It is well-known that the conjectured SL(2, Z) invariance of type IIB string theory in ten dimensions also persists in lower dimensions when the theory is compactified on tori. By making use of this recent observation, we construct an infinite family of magnetically charged black hole solutions of type II superstring theory in four space-time dimensions. These solutions are characterized by two relatively prime integers corresponding to the magnetic charges associated with the two gauge fields (from NS-NS and R-R sectors) of the theory and form an SL(2, Z) multiplet. In the extremal limit these solutions are stable as they are prevented from decaying into black holes of lower masses by a `mass gap' equation.
