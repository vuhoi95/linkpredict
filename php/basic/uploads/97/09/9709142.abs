Title: Chiral supersymmetric pp-wave solutions of IIA supergravity
Authors: Cl. Gabriel and M. Rooman and Ph. Spindel
Abstract: We describe solutions of type IIA (N=2, D=10) supergravity built under the assumption of the existence of at least one residual chiral supersymmetry. Their geometry is of pp-wave type. Explicit parametrization of the metric and matter field components, in terms of Killing spinors and arbitrary functions, is provided.
