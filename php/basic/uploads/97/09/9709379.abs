Title: Predictions from conformal algebra for the deeply virtual Compton  scattering
Authors: A. V. Belitsky and D. Mueller
Abstract: Basing on the constraint equalities which arise from the algebra of the collinear conformal group and the conformal operator product expansion, we predict the solutions of the leading order evolution equations for the non-forward distributions, including transversity, in terms of the conformal moments; next-to-leading order flavour singlet coefficient functions for the polarized and unpolarized deeply virtual Compton scattering; as well as the contribution from renormalon chains to the eigenfunctions of the exclusive non-singlet evolution kernel.
