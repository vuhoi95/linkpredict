Title: The Continuum Version of φ^4_{1+1}-theory in Light-Front Quantization
Authors: Pierre Grangé and Peter Ullrich and Ernst Werner
Abstract: A genuine continuum treatment of the massive \phi^4_{1+1}-theory in light-cone quantization is proposed. Fields are treated as operator valued distributions thereby leading to a mathematically well defined handling of ultraviolet and light cone induced infrared divergences and of their renormalization. Although non-perturbative the continuum light cone approach is no more complex than usual perturbation theory in lowest order. Relative to discretized light cone quantization, the critical coupling increases by 30% to a value r = 1.5. Conventional perturbation theory at the corresponding order yields r_1=1, whereas the RG improved fourth order result is r_4 = 1.8 +-0.05.
