Abstract: It is shown that, in QED$_{3}$, the Pauli-Villars regularization involving a pair of auxiliary fermion fields with masses of opposite sign leads to results that are consistent with those obtained using all other parity-preserving schemes of regularization. At the same time, ambiguity problems remain unsolved in non-Abelian models (QCD$_{3}$).
