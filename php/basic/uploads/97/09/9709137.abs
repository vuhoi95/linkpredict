Title: Degenerate Domain Wall Solutions in Supersymmetric Theories
Authors: M. A. Shifman and M. B. Voloshin
Abstract: A family of degenerate domain wall configurations, partially preserving supersymmetry, is discussed in a generalized Wess-Zumino model with two scalar superfields. We establish some general features inherent to the models with continuously degenerate domain walls. For instance, for purely real trajectories additional "integrals of motion" exist. The solution for the profile of the scalar fields for any wall belonging to the family is found in quadratures for arbitrary ratio of the coupling constants. For a special value of this ratio the solution family is obtained explicitly in terms of elementary functions. We also discuss the threshold amplitudes for multiparticle production generated by these solutions. New unexpected nullifications of the threshold amplitudes are found.
