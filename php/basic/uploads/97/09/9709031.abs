Title: Potential Topography and Mass Generation
Authors: Maxime Kudinov and Enrique Moreno and Peter Orland
Abstract: We describe an approach to understanding exponential decay of correlation functions in asymptotically free theories. This approach is systematic; it does not start from any conjectured mechanism or picture. We begin by studying the metric on the space of configurations and the behavior of the potential-energy function on this space. We describe how these ideas fit in the framework of QCD, as discussed earlier by one of us (P.O.). We then consider the 1+1-dimensional O(2) and O(3) nonlinear sigma models and show that no gap exists in the former at weak coupling. In the O(3) model a new kind of strong/weak-coupling duality is realized. We briefly outline our proposals for understanding the spectrum.
