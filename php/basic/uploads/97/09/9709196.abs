Title: Gravitational Analogues of Non-linear Born Electrodynamics
Authors: James A. Feigenbaum and Peter G. O. Freund and Mircea Pigli
Abstract: Gravitational analogues of the nonlinear electrodynamics of Born and of Born and Infeld are introduced and applied to the black hole problem. This work is mainly devoted to the 2-dimensional case in which the relevant lagrangians are nonpolynomial in the scalar curvature.
