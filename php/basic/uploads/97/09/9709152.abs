Title: Quantum Cohomology and Free Field Representation
Authors: Tohru Eguchi and Masao Jinzenji and Chuan-Sheng Xiong
Abstract: In our previous article we have proposed that the Virasoro algebra controls the quantum cohomology of Fano varieties at all genera. In this paper we construct a free field description of Virasoro operators and quantum cohomology. We shall show that to each even (odd) homology class of a K\"{a}hler manifold we have a free bosonic (fermionic) field and Virasoro operators are given by a simple bilinear form of these fields. We shall show that the Virasoro condition correctly reproduces the Gromov-Witten invariants also in the case of manifolds with non-vanishing non-analytic classes ($h^{p,q}\not=0,p\not=q$) and suggest that the Virasoro condition holds universally for all compact smooth K\"{a}hler manifolds.
