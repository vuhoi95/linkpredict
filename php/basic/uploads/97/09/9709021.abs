Title: Supersymmetric Construction of Exactly Solvable Potentials and  Non-Linear Algebras
Authors: Georg Junker and Pinaki Roy
Abstract: Using algebraic tools of supersymmetric quantum mechanics we construct classes of conditionally exactly solvable potentials being the supersymmetric partners of the linear or radial harmonic oscillator. With the help of the raising and lowering operators of these harmonic oscillators and the SUSY operators we construct ladder operators for these new conditionally solvable systems. It is found that these ladder operators together with the Hamilton operator form a non-linear algebra which is of quadratic and cubic type for the SUSY partners of the linear and radial harmonic oscillator, respectively.
