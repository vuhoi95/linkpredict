Title: Matrix Description of (1,0) Theories in Six Dimensions
Authors: Ofer Aharony and Micha Berkooz and Shamit Kachru and Eva Silverstein
Abstract: We propose descriptions of interacting (1,0) supersymmetric theories without gravity in six dimensions in the infinite momentum frame. They are based on the large N limit of quantum mechanics or 1+1 dimensional field theories with SO(N) gauge group and four supercharges. We argue that this formulation allows for a concrete description of the chirality-changing phase transitions which connect (1,0) theories with different numbers of tensor multiplets.
