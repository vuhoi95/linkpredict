Title: A lattice determination of QCD field strength correlators
Authors: Gunnar S. Bali and Nora Brambilla and Antonio Vairo
Abstract: We study field strength correlators in presence of a static quark-antiquark pair by use of lattice methods. The lattice data have been acquired recently in the context of a determination of relativistic corrections to the static interquark potential. We extract independent estimates of the form factors of two point correlation functions and investigate the effect of higher order correlators. Our results confirm the dominance of the two point correlators in the regions of intermediate and large quark separations, and are compatible with correlation length values obtained from different approaches.
