Title: Spontaneous Compactification to Robertson-Walker Universe Due To  Dynamical Torsion
Authors: Viktoria Malyshenko and Domingo Marin Ricoy
Abstract: We investigate multidimensional gravity with the Gauss-Bonnet term and with torsion on the space of extra dimensions chosen to be the group manifold of a simple Lie group. We take the Robertson-Walker ansatz for the 4-dimensional space-time and study the potential of a dilaton and torsion fields. It is shown that for certain values of the parameters of the initial theory the potential has classically stable minima, corresponding to the spontaneous compactification of the extra dimensions. However, these minima have zero torsion.
