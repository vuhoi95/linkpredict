Title: First Massive State of the Superstring in Superspace
Authors: N. Berkovits and M. M. Leite
Abstract: Using the manifestly spacetime supersymmetric description of the four-dimensional open superstring, we construct the vertex operator in superspace for the first massive state. This construction provides an N=1 D=4 superspace representation of the massive spin-2 multiplet.
