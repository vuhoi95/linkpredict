Title: Fusion rules for admissible representations of affine algebras: the case  of $A_2^{(1)}$
Authors: P. Furlan and A. Ch. Ganchev and V. B. Petkova
Abstract: We derive the fusion rules for a basic series of admissible representations of $\hat{sl}(3)$ at fractional level $3/p-3$. The formulae admit an interpretation in terms of the affine Weyl group introduced by Kac and Wakimoto. It replaces the ordinary affine Weyl group in the analogous formula for the fusion rules multiplicities of integrable representations. Elements of the representation theory of a hidden finite dimensional graded algebra behind the admissible representations are briefly discussed.
