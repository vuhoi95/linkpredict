Title: Relativistic Particle in the Liouville Field
Authors: George Jorjadze and Wlodzimierz Piechocki
Abstract: A model of a relativistic particle moving in the Liouville field is investigated. Symmetry group of the system is $SL(2,R)/Z_2$. The corresponding dynamical integrals describe full set of classical trajectories. Dynamical integrals are used for the gauge-invariant Hamiltonian reduction. The new scheme is proposed for quantization of the reduced system. Obtained quantum system reproduces classical symmetry. Physical aspects of the model are discussed.
