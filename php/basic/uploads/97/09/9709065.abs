Title: Realization of D4-Branes at Angles in Super Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Nobuyoshi Ohta and Jian-Ge Zhou
Abstract: An explicit solution in super Yang-Mills theory, which after T-duality describes two sets of D4-branes at angles, is constructed. The gauge configuration possesses 3/16 unbroken supersymmetry for the equal magnitudes of field strengths, and can be considered as the counterpart of the solution of D=11 supergravity with the same amount of supersymmetry in the solutions given by Gauntlett et al. The energy of the Born-Infeld action of the gauge configuration gives further evidence for the geometrical interpretation as two sets of D4-branes at angles. The energy of super Yang-Mills theory is shown to coincide with that of M(atrix) theory. This fact shows that the configuration with 3/16 supersymmetry can be realized in M(atrix) theory, which describes two sets of longitudinal M5-branes (with common string direction) at angles.
