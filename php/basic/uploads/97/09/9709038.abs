Title: Abelian monopoles in lattice gluodynamics as physical objects
Authors: B. L. G. Bakker and M. N. Chernodub and M. I. Polikarpov
Abstract: By numerical calculations we show that the abelian monopole currents are locally correlated with the density of SU(2) lattice action. This fact is established for the maximal abelian projection. Thus, in the maximal abelian projection the monopoles are physical objects, they carry SU(2) action. Calculations on the asymmetric lattice show that the correlation between monopole currents and the density of SU(2) lattice action also exists in the deconfinement phase of gluodynamics.
