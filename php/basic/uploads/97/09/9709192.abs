Title: Lectures in Topological Quantum Field Theory
Authors: J. M. F. Labastida and Carlos Lozano
Abstract: In these lectures we present a general introduction to topological quantum field theories. These theories are discussed in the framework of the Mathai-Quillen formalism and in the context of twisted N=2 supersymmetric theories. We discuss in detail the recent developments in Donaldson-Witten theory obtained from the application of results based on duality for N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. This involves a description of the computation of Donaldson invariants in terms of Seiberg-Witten invariants. Generalizations of Donaldson-Witten theory are reviewed, and the structure of the vacuum expectation values of their observables is analyzed in the context of duality for the simplest case.
