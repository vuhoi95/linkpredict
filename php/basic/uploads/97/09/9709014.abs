Title: The Overlap Formalism and Topological Susceptibility on the Lattice
Authors: Rajamani Narayanan and Robert L. Singleton Jr
Abstract: Recent lattice measurements of the topological susceptibility of SU(2) gauge theory using improved cooling and inverse-blocking are in disagreement. We use the overlap method, which probes the fermionic sector of the theory directly, to help resolve this discrepancy.
