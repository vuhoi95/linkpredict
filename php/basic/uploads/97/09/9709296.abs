Title: Fixed points and vacuum energy of dynamically broken gauge theories
Authors: A. A. Natale and P. S. Rodrigues da Silva
Abstract: We show that if a gauge theory with dynamical symmetry breaking has non-trivial fixed points, they will correspond to extrema of the vacuum energy. This relationship provides a different method to determine fixed points.
