Title: Remarks on the realization of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem in lattice  gauge theory
Authors: C. R. Gattringer and I. Hip and C. B. Lang
Abstract: We discuss the interplay between topologically non-trivial gauge field configurations and the spectrum of the Wilson-Dirac operator in lattice gauge theory. Our analysis is based on analytic arguments and numerical results from a lattice simulation of QED_2.
