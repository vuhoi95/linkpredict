Title: Bremsstrahlung of relativistic electrons in the Aharonov-Bohm potential
Authors: J. Audretsch and Ulf. Jasper and V. D. Skarzhinsky
Abstract: We investigate the scattering of an electron by an infinitely thin and infinitely long straight magnetic flux tube in the framework of QED. We discuss the solutions of the Dirac and Maxwell fields in the related external pure AB potential and evaluate matrix elements and differential probabilities for the bremsstrahlung process. The dependence of the resulting cross section on the energy, direction and polarization of the involved particles is analyzed. In the low energy regime a surprising angular asymmetry is found which results from the interaction of the electron's magnetic moment with the magnetic field.
