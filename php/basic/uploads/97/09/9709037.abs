Title: Regularised Supermembrane Theory and Static Configurations of M-Theory
Authors: F. Ardalan and A. H. Fatollahi and K. Kaviani and S. Parvizi
Abstract: We suggest that the static configurations of M-theory may be described by the matrix regularisation of the supermembrane theory in static regime. We compute the long range interaction between a M2-brane and an anti-M2-brane in agreement with the 11 dimensional supergravity result.
