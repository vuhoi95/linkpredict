Title: The Gross-Neveu Model with Chemical Potential; An Effective Theory for  Solitonic-Metallic Phase Transition in Polyacetylene?
Authors: Hisakazu Minakata and Alan Chodos
Abstract: The Gross-Neveu model with chemical potential is investigated as a low-energy effective theory of polyacetylene. In particular, we focus on the abrupt change in the features of electric conductivity such as sharp rise in the Pauli paramagnetism at dopant concentration of about 6%. We will try to explain it by the finite density phase transition in the Gross-Neveu model. The thermodynamic Bethe ansatz is combined with the large-N expansion to construct thermodynamics of the Gross-Neveu model. A first-order phase transition is found in leading order in the 1/N expansion and it appears to be stable against the 1/N correction. The next to leading order correction to the critical dopant concentration is explicitly calculated.
