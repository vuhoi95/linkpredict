Title: Schwarzschild Black Holes in Various Dimensions from Matrix Theory
Authors: Igor R. Klebanov and Leonard Susskind
Abstract: In a recent paper it was shown that the properties of Schwarzschild black holes in 8 dimensions are correctly described up to factors of order unity by Matrix theory compactified on T^3. Here we consider compactifications on tori of general dimension d. Although in general little is known about the relevant d+1 dimensional theories on the dual tori, there are hints from their application to near-extreme parallel Dirichlet d-branes. Using these hints we get the correct mass-entropy scaling for Schwarzschild black holes in (11-d) dimensions.
