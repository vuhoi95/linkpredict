Title: Notes on Matrix and Micro Strings
Authors: R. Dijkgraaf and E. Verlinde and H. Verlinde
Abstract: We review some recent developments in the study of M-theory compactifications via Matrix theory. In particular we highlight the appearance of IIA strings and their interactions, and explain the unifying role of the M-theory five-brane for describing the spectrum of the T^5 compactification and its duality symmetries. The 5+1-dimensional micro-string theory that lives on the fivebrane world-volume takes a central place in this presentation.
