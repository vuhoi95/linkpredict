Title: Degeneracy Structure of the Calogero-Sutherland Model: an Algebraic  Approach
Authors: N. Gurappa and Prasanta K. Panigrahi and V. Srinivasan
Abstract: The degeneracy structure of the eigenspace of the N-particle Calogero-Sutherland model is studied from an algebraic point of view. Suitable operators satisfying SU(2) algebras and acting on the degenerate eigenspace are explicitly constructed for the two particle case and then appropriately generalized to the N-particle model. The raising and lowering operators of these algebras connect the states, in a subset of the degenerate eigenspace, with each other.
