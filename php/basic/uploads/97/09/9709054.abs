Title: Mixed Boundary Conditions and Brane-String Bound States
Authors: H. Arfaei and M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari
Abstract: In this article we consider open strings with mixed boundary conditions (a combination of Neumann and Dirichlet conditions at each end). We discuss how their end points show a $D_p$-brane with NS-NS charge, i.e. a bound state of a D-brane with a fundamental strings. We show that these branes are BPS saturated. In the case of one-branes, we show that their mass densities are in agreement with IIb SUGRA which is Sl(2,Z) invariant. Using Chan-Paton factors, we extend our results to the case of bound states of $n$ D-strings and $m$ F-strings. These string theoretic results are also checked in the effective field theory limit.
