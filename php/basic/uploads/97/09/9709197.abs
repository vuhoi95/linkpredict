Title: The TBA, the Gross-Neveu Model, and Polyacetylene
Authors: Alan Chodos and Hisakzau Minakata
Abstract: We summarize recent work showing how the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz may be used to study the finite-density first-order phase transition in the Gross-Neveu model. The application to trans-polyacetylene is discussed, and the significance of the results is addressed.
