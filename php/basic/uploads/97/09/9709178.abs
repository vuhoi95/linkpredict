Title: Supersymmetry and gauge theory on Calabi-Yau 3-folds
Authors: J. M. Figueroa-O'Farrill and A. Imaanpur and J. McCarthy
Abstract: We consider the dimensional reduction of supersymmetric Yang-Mills on a Calabi-Yau 3-fold. We show by construction how the resulting cohomological theory is related to the balanced field theory of the Kaehler Yang-Mills equations introduced by Donaldson and Uhlenbeck-Yau.
