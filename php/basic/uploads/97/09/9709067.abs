Title: Constraining differential renormalization in abelian gauge theories
Authors: F. del Aguila and A. Culatti and R. Munoz-Tapia and M. Perez-Victoria
Abstract: We present a procedure of differential renormalization at the one loop level which avoids introducing unnecessary renormalization constants and automatically preserves abelian gauge invariance. The amplitudes are expressed in terms of a basis of singular functions. The local terms appearing in the renormalization of these functions are determined by requiring consistency with the propagator equation. Previous results in abelian theories, with and without supersymmetry, are discussed in this context.
