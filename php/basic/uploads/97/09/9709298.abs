Title: Effective Field Theory Approach to Ferromagnets and Antiferromagnets in  Crystaline Solids
Authors: J. M. Roman and J. Soto
Abstract: We present a systematic construction of effective lagrangians for the low energy and momentum region of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin waves in crystalline solids. We fully exploit the spontaneous symmetry breaking pattern $SU(2)\to U(1)$, the fact that spin waves are its associated Goldstone modes, the crystallographic space group and time reversal symmetries. We show how to include explicit SU(2) breaking terms due to spin-orbit and magnetic dipole interactions. The coupling to electromagnetic fields is also discussed in detail. For definiteness we work with the space group $R\bar 3 c$ and present our results to next to leading order.
