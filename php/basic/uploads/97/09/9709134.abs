Title: Electron-positron pair production in the Aharonov-Bohm potential
Authors: V. D. Skarzhinsky and J. Audretsch and Ulf. Jasper
Abstract: In the framework of QED we evaluate the cross section for electron-positron pair production by a single photon in the presence of the external Aharonov-Bohm potential in first order of perturbation theory. We analyse energy, angular and polarization distributions at different energy regimes: near the threshold and at high photon energies.
