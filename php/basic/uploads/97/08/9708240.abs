Title: A possible resolution of the U(1) and strong CP problems within  gluodynamics
Authors: Igor Halperin and Ariel Zhitnitsky
Abstract: This paper has been withdrawn by the authors, due an incorrect treatment of the effective Lagrangian, which led to the wrong conclusion on the disappearance of physical theta dependence in gluodynamics. See hep-ph/9711398 for a correct procedure.
