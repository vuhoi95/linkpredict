Title: Conformally Covariant Differential Operators: Symmetric Tensor Fields
Authors: J. Erdmenger and H. Osborn
Abstract: We extend previous work on conformally covariant differential operators to consider the case of second order operators acting on symmetric traceless tensor fields. The corresponding flat space Green function is explicitly constructed and shown to be in accord with the requirements of conformal invariance.
