Title: Path Integral for Relativistic Equations of Motion
Authors: Pierre Gosselin and Janos Polonyi
Abstract: A non-Grassmanian path integral representation is given for the solution of the Klein-Gordon and the Dirac equations. The trajectories of the path integral are rendered differentiable by the relativistic corrections. The nonrelativistic limit is briefly discussed from the point of view of the renormalization group.
