Title: Cosmology of the type IIB superstring
Authors: E. J. Copeland and James E. Lidsey and David Wands
Abstract: The continuous and discrete symmetries of a dimensionally reduced type IIB superstring action are employed to generate four-dimensional cosmological solutions with non-trivial Neveu-Schwarz/Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond-Ramond form-fields from the dilaton-moduli-vacuum solutions.
