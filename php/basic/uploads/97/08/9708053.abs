Title: Topology at the Planck Length
Authors: J. Madore and L. A. Saeger
Abstract: A basic arbitrariness in the determination of the topology of a manifold at the Planck length is discussed. An explicit example is given of a `smooth' change in topology from the 2-sphere to the 2-torus through a sequence of noncommuting geometries. Applications are considered to the theory of D-branes within the context of the proposed $M$(atrix) theory.
