Title: On Duality in the Born-Infeld Theory
Authors: Adel Khoudeir and Yoan Parra
Abstract: The $SL(2,R)$ duality symmetric action for the Born-Infeld theory in terms of two potentials, coupled with non-trivial backgroud fields in four dimensions is established. This construction is carried out in detail by analysing the hamiltonian structure of the Born-Infeld theory. The equivalence with the usual Born-Infeld theory is shown.
