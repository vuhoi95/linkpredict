Title: Complete phase diagram for the integrable chain with alternating spins  in the sectors with competing interactions
Authors: B. -D. Doerfel and St. Meissner
Abstract: We investigate the anisotropic integrable spin chain consisting of spins $s={1/2}$ and $s=1$ by means of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz for the anisotropy $\gamma>\pi/3$, where the analysis of the Takahashi conditions leads to a more complicated string picture. We give the phase diagram with respect to the two real coupling constants $\bar{c}$ and $\tilde{c}$, which contains a new region where the ground state is formed by strings with infinite Fermi zones. In this region the velocities of sound for the two physical excitations have been calculated from the dressed energies. This leads to an additional line of conformal invariance not known before.
