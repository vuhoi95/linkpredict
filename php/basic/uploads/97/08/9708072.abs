Title: Quantisation of Conformal Fields in Three-dimensional Anti-de Sitter  Black Hole Spacetime
Authors: Hongsu Kim and Jae-Sok Oh and Changrim Ahn
Abstract: Utilizing the conformal-flatness nature of 3-dim. Anti-de Sitter (AdS_3) black hole solution of Banados, Teitelboim and Zanelli, the quantisation of conformally-coupled scalar and spinor fields in this background spacetime is explicitly carried out. In particular, mode expansion forms and propagators of the fields are obtained in closed forms. The vacuum in this conformally-coupled field theories in AdS_3 black hole spacetime, which is conformally-flat, is the conformal vacuum which is unique and has global meaning. This point particularly suggests that now the particle production by AdS_3 black hole spacetime should be absent. General argument establishing the absence of real particle creation by AdS_3 black hole spacetime for this case of conformal triviality is provided. Then next, using the explicit mode expansion forms for conformally-coupled scalar and spinor fields, the bosonic and fermionic superradiances are examined and found to be absent confirming the expectation.
