Title: Geodesics, gravitons and the gauge fixing problem
Authors: Diego A. R. Dalvit and Francisco D. Mazzitelli
Abstract: When graviton loops are taken into account, the background metric obtained as a solution to the one-loop corrected Einstein equations turns out to be gauge fixing dependent. Therefore it is of no physical relevance. Instead we consider a physical observable, namely the trajectory of a test particle in the presence of gravitons. We derive a quantum corrected geodesic equation that includes backreaction effects and is explicitly independent of any gauge fixing parameter.
