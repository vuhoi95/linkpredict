Title: Symplectic forms in the theory of solitons
Authors: I. M. Krichever and D. H. Phong
Abstract: We develop a Hamiltonian theory for 2D soliton equations. In particular, we identify the spaces of doubly periodic operators on which a full hierarchy of commuting flows can be introduced, and show that these flows are Hamiltonian with respect to a universal symplectic form $\omega={1\over 2}\r_{\infty} <\Psi_0^*\delta L\wedge\delta\Psi_0>\d k$. We also construct other higher order symplectic forms and compare our formalism with the case of 1D solitons. Restricted to spaces of finite-gap solitons, the universal symplectic form agrees with the symplectic forms which have recently appeared in non-linear WKB theory, topological field theory, and Seiberg-Witten theories. We take the opportunity to survey some developments in these areas where symplectic forms have played a major role.
