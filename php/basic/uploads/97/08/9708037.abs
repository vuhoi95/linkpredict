Title: M(atrix) Theory on $T^6$ and a m(atrix) Theory Description of KK  Monopoles
Authors: Amihay Hanany and Gilad Lifschytz
Abstract: We discuss M(atrix) theory compactification on T^6. This theory is described by the large N limit of the world volume theory, of N Kaluza-Klein monopoles in eleven dimensions. We discuss the BPS states, and their arrangement in E_6 multiplets. We then propose the formulation of the world volume theory of KK monopoles in eleven dimensions that decouples from the bulk. This is given by a large N_1 m(atrix) theory with eight supercharges, corresponding to the quantum mechanics theory of N_1 zero-branes inside the Type IIA Kaluza-Klein monopole. Various limits of the construction are considered.
