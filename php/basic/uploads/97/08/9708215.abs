Title: The Thermodynamics of Cosmic String densities in U(1) Scalar Field  Theory
Authors: Nuno D. Antunes and Luis M. A. Bettencourt and Mark Hindmarsh
Abstract: We present a full characterization of the phase transition in U(1) scalar field theory and of the associated vortex string thermodynamics in 3D. We show that phase transitions in the string densities exist and measure their critical exponents, both for the long string and the short loops. Evidence for a natural separation between these two string populations is presented. In particular our results strongly indicate that an infinite string population will only exist above the critical temperature. Canonical initial conditions for cosmic string evolution are show to correspond to the infinite temperature limit of the theory.
