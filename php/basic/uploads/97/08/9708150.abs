Title: On electromagnetic interaction of massive spin-2 particle
Authors: S. M. Klishevich and Yu. M. Zinoviev
Abstract: In this work we construct a gauge invariant description of free massive particle with an arbitrary integer spin. Such description allows one to investigate the problem of consistent interactions for massive high spin particles using the requirement that the whole interaction Lagrangian must be gauge invariant. As a first example of such approach, we consider the case of electromagnetic interaction of massive spin-2 particle: a linear approximation in a case of the arbitrary field and a full theory for the homogeneous electromagnetic field in the space-time of any dimensionality.
