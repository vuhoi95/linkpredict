Title: Koszul-Tate Cohomology For an Sp(2)-Covariant Quantization of Gauge  Theories with Linearly Dependent Generators
Authors: Liviu Tatar and Radu Tatar
Abstract: The anti-BRST transformation, in its Sp(2)-symmetric version, for the general case of any stage-reducible gauge theories is implemented in the usual BV approach. This task is accomplished not by duplicating the gauge symmetries but rather by duplicating all fields and antifields of the theory and by imposing the acyclicity of the Koszul-Tate differential. In this way the Sp(2)-covariant quantization can be realised in the standard BV approach and its equivalence with BLT quantization can be proven by a special gauge fixing procedure.
