Title: N = 1 Field Theory Duality from M-theory
Authors: Martin Schmaltz and Raman Sundrum
Abstract: We investigate Seiberg's N=1 field theory duality for four-dimensional supersymmetric QCD with the M-theory 5-brane. We find that the M-theory configuration for the magnetic dual theory arises via a smooth deformation of the M-theory configuration for the electric theory. The creation of Dirichlet 4-branes as Neveu-Schwarz 5-branes are passed through each other in Type IIA string theory is given a nice derivation from M-theory.
