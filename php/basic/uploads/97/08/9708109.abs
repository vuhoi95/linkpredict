Title: Multiplet Structures of BPS Solitons
Authors: H. Lu and C. N. Pope and K. S. Stelle
Abstract: There exist simple single-charge and multi-charge BPS p-brane solutions in the D-dimensional maximal supergravities. From these, one can fill out orbits in the charge vector space by acting with the global symmetry groups. We give a classification of these orbits, and the associated cosets that parameterise them.
