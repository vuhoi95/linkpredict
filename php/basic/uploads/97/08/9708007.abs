Title: Mathematical Derivation of Chiral Anomaly in Lattice Gauge Theory with  Wilson's Action
Authors: Tetsuya Hattori and Hiroshi Watanabe
Abstract: Chiral U(1) anomaly is derived with mathematical rigor for a Euclidean fermion coupled to a smooth external U(1) gauge field on an even dimensional torus as a continuum limit of lattice regularized fermion field theory with the Wilson term in the action. The present work rigorously proves for the first time that the Wilson term correctly reproduces the chiral anomaly.
