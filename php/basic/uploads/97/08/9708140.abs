Title: Superfield Quantization
Authors: I. A. Batalin and K. Bering and P. H. Damgaard
Abstract: We present a superfield formulation of the quantization program for theories with first class constraints. An exact operator formulation is given, and we show how to set up a phase-space path integral entirely in terms of superfields. BRST transformations and canonical transformations enter on equal footing, and they allow us to establish a superspace analog of the BFV theorem. We also present a formal derivation of the Lagrangian superfield analogue of the field-antifield formalism, by an integration over half of the phase-space variables.
