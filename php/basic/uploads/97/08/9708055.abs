Abstract: We give a full classification of the multi-charge supersymmetric $p$-brane solutions in the massless and massive maximal supergravities in dimensions $D\ge2$ obtained from the toroidal reduction of eleven-dimensional supergravity. We derive simple universal rules for determining the fractions of supersymmetry that they preserve. By reversing the steps of dimensional reduction, the $p$-brane solutions become intersections of $p$-branes, NUTs and waves in D=10 or D=11. Having classified the lower-dimensional $p$-branes, this provides a classification of all the intersections in D=10 and D=11 where the harmonic functions depend on the space transverse to all the individual objects. We also discuss the structure of U-duality multiplets of $p$-brane solutions, and show how these translate into multiplets of harmonic and non-harmonic intersections.
