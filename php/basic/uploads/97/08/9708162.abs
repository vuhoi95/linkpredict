Title: Superalgebraic Truncations from D=10, N=2 Chiral Supergravity
Authors: Chang-Ho Kim and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: We study ten-dimensional N=2 maximal chiral supergravity in the context of Lie superalgebra SU(8/1). The possible successive superalgebraic truncations from ten dimensional N=2 chiral theory to the lower dimensional supergravity theories are systematically realized as sub-superalgebraic chains of SU(8/1) by using the Kac-Dynkin weight techniques.
