Title: Bound States at Threshold in Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics
Authors: M. Porrati and A. Rozenberg
Abstract: We propose a general method that allows to detect the existence of normalizable ground states in supersymmetric quantum mechanical systems with non-Fredholm spectrum. We apply our method to show the existence of bound states at threshold in two important cases: 1) the quantum mechanical system describing H-monopoles; 2) the quantum mechanics of D0 branes.
