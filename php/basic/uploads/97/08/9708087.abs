Title: Chiral symmetry breaking, the superspace gap equation and the  no-renormalization theorem
Authors: Andras Kaiser and Stephen B. Selipsky
Abstract: Solutions of the superspace Schwinger-Dyson equations, describing mass generation and chiral symmetry breaking in supersymmetric gauge theory, need not be constrained to vanish by no-renormalization theorems, nor by special choices of gauge parameter. Thus symmetry breaking vacuum structures remain possible (as in non-supersymmetric gauge theory), inviting comparison with predictions of an alternative approach based on holomorphy and the Wilsonian effective action.
