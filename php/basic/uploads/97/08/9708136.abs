Title: Brane-Black Hole Correspondence and Asymptotics of Quantum Spectrum
Authors: A. A. Bytsenko and A. E. Goncalves and S. D. Odintsov
Abstract: We discuss the asymptotic properties of quantum states density for fundamental (super) membrane in the semiclassical approach. The matching of BPS part of spectrum for superstring and supermembrane gives the possibility to get stringy results via membrane calculations and vice versa. The brane-black hole correspondence (on the level of black hole states and brane microstates) is also studied.
