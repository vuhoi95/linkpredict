Title: A Note on Effective Lagrangians in Matrix Theory
Authors: P. Berglund and D. Minic
Abstract: We study the relation between the effective Lagrangian in Matrix Theory and eleven dimensional supergravity. In particular, we provide a relationship between supergravity operators and the corresponding terms in the post-Newtonian approximation of Matrix Theory.
