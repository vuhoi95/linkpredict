Title: Boundary S Matrix for the XXZ Chain
Authors: Anastasia Doikou and Luca Mezincescu and Rafael I. Nepomechie
Abstract: We compute by means of the Bethe Ansatz the boundary S matrix for the open anisotropic spin-1/2 chain with diagonal boundary magnetic fields in the noncritical regime (Delta > 1). Our result, which is formulated in terms of q-gamma functions, agrees with the vertex-operator result of Jimbo et al.
