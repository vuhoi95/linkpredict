Title: On the Spontaneous Identity of Chiral and Super Symmetry Breaking in  Pure Super Yang Mills Theories
Authors: M. Leibundgut and P. Minkowski
Abstract: We show that in supersymmetric pure Yang Mills theories with arbitrary simple gauge group, the spontaneous breaking of chiral fermionic and bosonic charge by the associated gaugino and gauge boson condensates implies the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry by the condensate of the underlying Lagrangian density. The explicit breaking of the restricted fermionic charge through the chiral anomaly is deferred to a secondary stage in the elimination of infrared singularities or long range forces.
