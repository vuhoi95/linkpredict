Title: Thermofield Dynamics of the Heterotic String --- Thermal Cosmological  Constant ---
Authors: H. Fujisaki and S. Sano and K. Nakagawa
Abstract: The thermofield dynamics of the $D = 10$ heterotic thermal string theory is exemplified at any finite temperature through the infrared behaviour of the one-loop cosmological constant in proper reference to the thermal duality symmetry in association with the global phase structure of the thermal string ensemble.
