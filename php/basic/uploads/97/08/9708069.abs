Title: On the gravity renormalization off shell
Authors: K. Kazakov and P. Pronin and K. Stepanyantz
Abstract: Using as an example the Einstein gravity with the cosmological constant, we discuss the calculation of renormalization group functions off shell. We found, that gauge dependent terms should be absorbed by the nonlinear renormalization of metric. Nevertheless, some terms can be included in the renormalization of Newton's constant. This ambiguity in the renormalization prescription is discussed.
