Title: Exact results for a Kondo impurity with electronic correlations
Authors: You-Quan Li and Pierre-Antoine Bares
Abstract: An one dimensional model of a Kondo impurity with arbitrary spin in the presence of electronic correlations is solved exactly. The Bethe ansatz equations are obtained for the case of quadratic dispersion. The ground state is studied in the thermodynamic limit, and the magnetic susceptibility at zero temperature is calculated.
