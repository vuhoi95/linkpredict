Title: Symmetries for generating string cosmologies
Authors: E. J. Copeland and James E. Lidsey and David Wands
Abstract: We discuss the symmetry properties of the low-energy effective action of the type IIB superstring that may be employed to derive four-dimensional solutions. A truncated effective action, compactified on a six-torus, but including both Neveu/Schwarz-Neveu/Schwarz and Ramond-Ramond field strengths, can be expressed as a non-linear sigma model which is invariant under global SL(3,R) transformations. This group contains as a sub-group the SL(2,R) symmetry of the ten-dimensional theory and a discrete Z2 reflection symmetry which leads to a further SL(2,R) sub-group. The symmetries are employed to analyse a general class of spatially homogeneous cosmological solutions with non-trivial Ramond-Ramond fields.
