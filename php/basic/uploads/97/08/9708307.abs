Title: Global Symmetries in Duals of Supersymmetric SU(N) x SU(M) and  Application to Composite Axion
Authors: Jihn E. Kim and Bookyung Sul
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a supersymmetric composite axion (c-axion) model based on the gauge group $SU(N)\times SU(M)$, which is one possible physical application of the N=1 duality. The dual of SU(M) is interpreted as the color gauge group. We illustrate the existence of c-axion for the case of one dual quark in the dual gauge group $SU(\tilde M)$.
