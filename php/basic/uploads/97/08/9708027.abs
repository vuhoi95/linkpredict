Title: Coherent-state quantization of constrained fermion systems
Authors: Georg Junker and John R. Klauder
Abstract: The quantization of systems with first- and second-class constraints within the coherent-state path-integral approach is extended to quantum systems with fermionic degrees of freedom. As in the bosonic case the importance of path-integral measures for Lagrange multipliers, which in this case are in general expected to be elements of a Grassmann algebra, is emphasized. Several examples with first- and second-class constraints are discussed.
