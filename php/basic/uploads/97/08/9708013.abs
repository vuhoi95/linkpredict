Title: Symmetries and degrees of freedom in 2-dimensional dual models
Authors: C. P. Constantinidis and F. P. Devecchi
Abstract: The 2-dimensional version of the Schwarz and Sen duality model (Tseytlin model) is analyzed at the classical and quantum levels. The solutions are obtained after removing the gauge dependent sector using the Dirac method. The Poincar\`e invariance is verified at both levels. An extension with global supersymmetry is also proposed.
