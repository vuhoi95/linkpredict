Title: The Field Theory of Non-Supersymmetric Brane Configurations
Authors: Nick Evans and Myck Schwetz
Abstract: We identify the 4D field theories living on the world volume of D4 branes in non-supersymmetric type IIA string theory constructions. They are softly broken N=2 SQCD with the breakings introduced through vevs of the auxilliary fields in the spurion coupling field. Exact solutions of these theories for perturbing soft breakings exist in the literature. We calculate the ratios of string tensions in softly broken N=2 SU(N) gauge theory testing the recently proposed M-theory prediction. The semi-classical result of M-theory is renormalized in the non-supersymmetric models.
