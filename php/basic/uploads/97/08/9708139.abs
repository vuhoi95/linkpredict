Title: Trace Anomaly Induced Effective Action and Hawking Radiation for 2d  Dilatonic Supergravity
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: We construct the theory of 2d dilatonic supergravity(SG) with matter and dilaton supermultiplets coupled to dilaton functions. Trace anomaly and induced effective action for matter supermultiplet are calculated (what gives also large-N effective action for dilatonic SG). Study of black holes and Hawking radiation which turns out to be zero in supersymmetric CGHS model with dilaton coupled matter is presented. In the same way one can study spherically symmetric collapse for other 4d SG using simplified 2d approach.
