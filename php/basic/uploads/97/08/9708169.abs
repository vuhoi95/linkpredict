Title: Tailoring T-Duality Beyond the First Loop
Authors: Nemanja Kaloper and Krzysztof A. Meissner
Abstract: In this article we review a recent calculation of the two-loop $\sigma$-model corrections to the T-duality map in string theory. Using the effective action approach, and focusing on backgrounds with a single Abelian isometry, we give the $O(\alpha')$ modifications of the lowest-order duality transformations. The torsion plays an important role in the theory to $O(\alpha')$, because of the Chern-Simons couplings to the gauge fields that arise via dimensional reduction.
