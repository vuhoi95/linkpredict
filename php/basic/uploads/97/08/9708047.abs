Title: The Gauged (2,1) Heterotic Sigma-Model
Authors: M. Abou Zeid and C. M. Hull
Abstract: The geometry of (2,1) supersymmetric sigma-models with isometry symmetries is discussed. The gauging of such symmetries in superspace is then studied. We find that the coupling to the (2,1) Yang-Mills supermultiplet can be achieved provided certain geometric conditions are satisfied. We construct the general gauged action, using an auxiliary vector to generate the full non-polynomial structure.
