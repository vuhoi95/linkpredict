Title: S-Matrices of Self-Dual Gravity
Authors: Gordon Chalmers and Warren Siegel
Abstract: We use analyticity arguments to conjecture a one-loop gravity scattering amplitude with an arbitrary number of external legs possessing the same helicity. This result also gives the complete perturbative S-matrix of self-dual gravity.
