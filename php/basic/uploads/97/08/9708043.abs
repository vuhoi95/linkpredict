Title: Wilson line in high temperature particle physics
Authors: S. Bronoff and G. Dvali and K. Farakos and C. P. Korthals Altes
Abstract: The physics of the Wilson line leads to new developments in high temperature particle physics. The main tool is the effective action for a given fixed value of the phase of the Wilson line. It furnishes a gauge invariant infrared cut off, and yields for small values of the phases a systematic procedure for obtaining a power series in the coupling g and glog(1/g). It breaks the centergroup symmetry of the gauge group only at high temperature so leads to domain walls disappearing at low temperatures. It shows long lived metastable states in the standard model, SU(5), SO(10) and its SUSY partners, with possibilities for CP violation and thermal inflation.
