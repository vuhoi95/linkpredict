Title: Virasoro amplitude from the $S^N\R^{24}$ orbifold sigma model
Authors: G. E. Arutyunov and S. A. Frolov
Abstract: Four tachyon scattering amplitude is derived from the $S^N\R^{24}$ orbifold sigma model in the large $N$ limit. The closed string interaction is described by a vertex which is a bosonic analog of the supersymmetric one, recently proposed by Dijkgraaf, Verlinde and Verlinde.
