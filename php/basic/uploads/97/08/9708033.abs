Title: Algebraic Structure in Non-Orientable Open-Closed String Field Theories
Authors: Naohito Nakazawa and Daiji Ennyu
Abstract: We apply stochastic quantization method to real symmetric matrix-vector models for the second quantization of non-orientable strings, including both open and closed strings. The Fokker-Planck hamiltonian deduces a well-defined non-orientable open-closed string field theory at the double scaling limit of the matrix model. There appears a new algebraic structure in the continuum F-P hamiltonian including a Virasoro algebra and a $SO(r)$ current algebra.
