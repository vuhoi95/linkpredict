Title: D0-Branes, Constrained Instantons and D=4 Super Yang-Mills Theories
Authors: J. L. F. Barbon and A. Pasquinucci
Abstract: We consider in more detail the role of D0-branes as instantons in the construction of SU(N) Super Yang-Mills and Super QCD theories in four space-time dimensions with D4, D6 and NS-branes. In particular, we show how the D0-branes describe both the exact and constrained instantons and reproduce the correct pattern of lifting of zero modes on the various branches of these models.
