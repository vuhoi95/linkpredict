Title: d=2, N=2 Superconformally Covariant Operators and Super W-Algebras
Authors: F. Gieres and S. Gourmelen
Abstract: We construct and classify superconformally covariant differential operators defined on N=2 super Riemann surfaces. By contrast to the N=1 theory, these operators give rise to partial rather than ordinary differential equations which leads to novel features for their matrix representation. The latter is applied to the derivation of N=2 super W-algebras in terms of N=2 superfields.
