Title: Finite N Heterotic Matrix Models and Discrete Light Cone Quantization
Authors: Lubos Motl and Leonard Susskind
Abstract: The finite N version of Matrix theory describes M-theory and superstrings in so-called discretized light cone quantization (DLCQ). Its role has been explained for M-theory in 11 dimensions and for type IIA theory. We show novelties which arise by generalizing the ideas to heterotic strings. The states which arise in O(N) theories with odd N we interpret as fields which are antiperiodic in the longitudinal direction. Consistency of these ideas provides a new evidence for the conjecture that finite N models describe sectors with a given longitudinal momentum.
