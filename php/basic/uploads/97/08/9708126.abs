Title: Supergravity from a Massive Superparticle and the Simplest Super Black  Hole
Authors: Marcia E. Knutt-Wehlau and R. B. Mann
Abstract: We describe in superspace a theory of a massive superparticle coupled to a version of two dimensional N=1 dilaton supergravity. The (1+1) dimensional supergravity is generated by the stress-energy of the superparticle, and the evolution of the superparticle is reciprocally influenced by the supergravity. We obtain exact superspace solutions for both the superparticle worldline and the supergravity fields. We use the resultant non-trivial compensator superfield solution to construct a model of a two-dimensional supersymmetric black hole.
