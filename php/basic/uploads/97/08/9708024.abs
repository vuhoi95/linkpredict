Title: Relations between the correlators of the topological sigma-model coupled  to gravity
Authors: Maxim Kontsevich and Yuri I. Manin
Abstract: We prove a new recursive relation between the correlators $< \tau_{d_1}\gamma_1...\tau_{d_n}\gamma_n >_{g,\beta}$, which together with known relations allows one to express all of them through the full system of Gromov-Witten invariants in the sense of Kontsevich-Manin and the intersection indices of tautological classes on $\bar{M}_{g,n}$, effectively calculable in view of earlier results due to Mumford, Kontsevich, Getzler, and Faber. This relation shows that a linear change of coordinates of the big phase space transforms the potential with gravitational descendants to another function defined completely in terms of the Gromov-Witten correspondence and the intersection theory on $V^n\times\bar{M}_{g,n}$. We then extend the formalism of gravitational descendants from quantum cohomology to more general Frobenius manifolds and Cohomological Field Theories.
