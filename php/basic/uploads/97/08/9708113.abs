Title: Toy Model for Breaking Super Gauge Theories at the Effective Lagrangian  Level
Authors: Francesco Sannino and Joseph Schechter
Abstract: We propose a toy model to illustrate how the effective Lagrangian for super QCD might go over to the one for ordinary QCD by a mechanism whereby the gluinos and squarks in the fundamental theory decouple below a given supersymmetry breaking scale $m$. The implementation of this approach involves a suitable choice of possible supersymmetry breaking terms. An amusing feature of the model is the emergence of the ordinary QCD degrees of freedom which were hidden in the auxiliary fields of the supersymmetric effective Lagrangian.
