Title: The incident wave in Aharonov-Bohm scattering wavefunction
Authors: Sahng-Kyoon Yoo and D. K. Park
Abstract: It is shown that only the infinite angular momentum quantum states contribute to the incident wave in Aharonov-Bohm (AB) scattering. This result is clearly shown by recalculating the AB calculation with arbitrary decomposition of summation over the angular momentum quantum numbers in wave function. It is motivated from the fact that the pole contribution in the integral representation used by Jackiw is given by only the infinite angular momentum states, in which the closed contour integration involving this pole gives just the incident wave.
