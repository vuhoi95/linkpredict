Title: Chiral transition and monopole percolation in lattice scalar QED with  quenched fermions
Authors: Wolfgang Franzki and John B. Kogut and Maria-Paola Lombardo
Abstract: We study the interplay between topological observables and chiral and Higgs transitions in lattice scalar QED with quenched fermions. Emphasis is put on the chiral transition line and magnetic monopole percolation at strong gauge coupling. We confirm that at infinite gauge coupling the chiral transition is described by mean field exponents. We find a rich and complicated behaviour at the endpoint of the Higgs transition line which hampers a satisfactory analysis of the chiral transition. We study in detail an intermediate coupling, where the data are consistent both with a trivial chiral transition clearly separated from monopole percolation and with a chiral transition coincident with monopole percolation, and characterized by the same critical exponent $\nu \simeq 0.65$. We discuss the relevance (or lack thereof) of these quenched results to our understanding of the \chupiv\ model. We comment on the interplay of magnetic monopoles and fermion dynamics in more general contexts.
