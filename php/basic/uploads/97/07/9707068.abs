Abstract: We show that the boundary state description of a Dp-brane is strictly related to the corresponding classical solution of the low-energy string effective action. By projecting the boundary state on the massless states of the closed string we obtain the tension, the R-R charge and the large distance behavior of the classical solution. We discuss both the case of a single D-brane and that of bound states of two D-branes. We also show that in the R-R sector the boundary state, written in a picture which treats asymmetrically the left and right components, directly yields the R-R gauge potentials.
