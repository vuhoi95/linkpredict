Title: Strings and D-Branes at High Temperature
Authors: Sangmin Lee and Larus Thorlacius
Abstract: The thermodynamics of a gas of strings and D-branes near the Hagedorn transition is described by a coupled set of Boltzmann equations for weakly interacting open and closed long strings. The resulting distributions are dominated by the open string sector, indicating that D-branes grow to fill space at high temperature.
