Title: Duality symmetry of N=4 Yang-Mills theory on T^3
Authors: Feike Hacquebord and Herman Verlinde
Abstract: We study the spectrum of BPS states in N=4 supersymmetric U(N) Yang-Mills theory. This theory has been proposed to describe M-theory on T^3 in the discrete light-cone formalism. We find that the degeneracy of irreducible BPS bound states in this model exhibits a (partially hidden) SL(5,Z) duality symmetry. Besides the electro-magnetic symmetry, this duality group also contains Nahm-like transformations that interchange the rank N of the gauge group with some of the magnetic or electric fluxes. In the M-theory interpretation, this mapping amounts to a reflection that interchanges the longitudinal direction with one of the transverse directions.
