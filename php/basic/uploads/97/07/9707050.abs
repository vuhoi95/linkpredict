Title: Probing integrable perturbations of conformal theories using singular  vectors II: N=1 superconformal theories
Authors: Pierre Mathieu and Gerard Watts
Abstract: In this work we pursue the singular-vector analysis of the integrable perturbations of conformal theories that was initiated in hep-th/9603088. Here we consider the detailed study of the N=1 superconformal theory and show that all integrable perturbations can be identified from a simple singular-vector argument. We identify these perturbations as theories based on affine Lie superalgebras and show that the results we obtain relating two perturbations can be understood by the extension of affine Toda duality to these theories with fermions. We also discuss how this duality is broken in specific cases.
