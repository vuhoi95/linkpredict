Title: Supergravity with a Noninvertible Vierbein
Authors: N. Dragon and H. Guenther and U. Theis
Abstract: We show that there is no off-shell Palatini formulation of minimal supergravity. Nonetheless, we have been able to generalize the multiplet and Lagrangians of this theory to the case of vanishing determinant of the vierbein. Unfortunately, the requirement of regularity does not single out a unique action.
