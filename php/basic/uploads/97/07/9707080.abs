Title: Uniqueness of the minimum of the free energy of the 2D Yang-Mills theory  at large N
Authors: A. Aghamohammadi and M. Alimohammadi and M. Khorrami
Abstract: There has been some controversies at the large $N$ behaviour of the 2D Yang-Mills and chiral 2D Yang-Mills theories. To be more specific, is there a one parameter family of minima of the free energy in the strong region, or the minimum is unique. We show that there is a missed equation which, added to the known equations, makes the minimum unique.
