Title: On the Point-Splitting Method of the Commutator Anomaly of the Gauss Law  Operators
Authors: R. A. Bertlmann and Tomas Sykora
Abstract: We analyze the generalized point-splitting method and Jo's result for the commutator anomaly. We find that certain classes of general regularization kernels satisfying integral conditions provide a unique result, which, however differs from Faddeev's cohomological result.
