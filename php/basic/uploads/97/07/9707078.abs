Title: On thermal phase structure of deformed Gross-Neveu model
Authors: H. Tochimura and H-T. Sato
Abstract: We illustrate the phase structure of a deformed two-dimensional Gross-Neveu model which is defined by undeformed field contents plus deformed Pauli matrices. This deformation is based on two motives to find a more general polymer model and to estimate how $q$-deformed field theory affects on its effective potential. There found some regions where chiral symmetry breaking and restoration take place repeatedly as temperature increasing.
