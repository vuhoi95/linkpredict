Title: Correlation functions for some conformal theories on Riemann surfaces
Authors: Michael Monastyrsky and Sergei Nechaev
Abstract: We discuss the geometrical connection between 2D conformal field theories, random walks on hyperbolic Riemann surfaces and knot theory. For the wide class of CFTs with monodromies being the discrete subgroups of SL(2,R), the determination of four-point correlation functions are related to construction of topological invariants for random walks on multipunctured Riemann surfaces
