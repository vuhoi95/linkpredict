Title: Four-dimensional BPS-spectra via M-theory
Authors: Mans Henningson and Piljin Yi
Abstract: We consider the realization of four-dimensional theories with N = 2 supersymmetry as M-theory configurations including a five-brane. Our emphasis is on the spectrum of massive states, that are realized as two-branes ending on the five-brane. We start with a determination of the supersymmetries that are left unbroken by the background metric and five-brane. We then show how the central charge of the N = 2 algebra arises from the central charge associated with the M-theory two-brane. This determines the condition for a two-brane configuration to be BPS-saturated in the four-dimensional sense. By imposing certain conditions on the moduli, we can give concrete examples of such two-branes. This leads us to conjecture that vectormultiplet and hypermultiplet BPS-saturated states correspond to two-branes with the topology of a cylinder and a disc respectively. We also discuss the phenomenon of marginal stability of BPS-saturated states.
