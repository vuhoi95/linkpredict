Title: Super-Weyl Invariant 2D Supergravity, Anomaly and WZ Action
Authors: K. Kamimura and R. Kuriki
Abstract: We present a candidate of anomaly and Wess Zumino action of the two dimensional supergravity coupling with matters in a super-Weyl invariant regularization. It is a generalization of the Weyl and the area preserving \Diff invariant formulation of two dimensional gravity theory.
