Title: Gravitational Couplings and $Z_2$ Orientifolds
Authors: Keshav Dasgupta and Dileep P. Jatkar and Sunil Mukhi
Abstract: The interplay between gravitational couplings on branes and the occurrence of fractional flux in low dimensional orientifolds is examined. It is argued that gravitational couplings need to be assigned not only to D-branes but also to orientifold planes. The fractional charges of the orientifold $d$-planes can be understood in terms of flux quantization of the $d-3$ form potential and modified Bianchi identities. Detailed results are presented for the case of the type IIB orientifold on $T^6/Z_2$, which is dual to F-theory on a complex 4-fold with terminal singularities.
