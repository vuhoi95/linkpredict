Title: Reflection Scattering Matrix of the Ising Model in a Random Boundary  Magnetic Field
Authors: A. De Martino and M. Moriconi and G. Mussardo
Abstract: The physical properties induced by a quenched surface magnetic field in the Ising model are investigated by means of boundary quantum field theory in replica space. Exact boundary scattering amplitudes are proposed and used to study the averaged quenched correlation functions.
