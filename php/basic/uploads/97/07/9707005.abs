Title: Solvability of the G_2 Integrable System
Authors: Marcos Rosenbaum and Alexander Turbiner and Antonio Capella
Abstract: It is shown that the 3-body trigonometric G_2 integrable system is exactly-solvable. If the configuration space is parametrized by certain symmetric functions of the coordinates then, for arbitrary values of the coupling constants, the Hamiltonian can be expressed as a quadratic polynomial in the generators of some Lie algebra of differential operators in a finite-dimensional representation. Four infinite families of eigenstates, represented by polynomials, and the corresponding eigenvalues are described explicitly.
