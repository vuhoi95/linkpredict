Title: D=6, N=1 String Vacua and Duality
Authors: L. E. Ibanez and A. M. Uranga
Abstract: We review the structure $D=6, N=1$ string vacua with emphasis on the different connections due to T-dualities and S-dualities. The topics discussed include: Anomaly cancellation; K3 and orbifold $D=6, N=1$ heterotic compactifications; T-dualities between $E_8\times E_8$ and $Spin(32)/Z_2$ heterotic vacua; non-perturbative heterotic vacua and small instantons; N=2 Type-II/Heterotic duality in D=4 ; F-theory/heterotic duality in D=6; and heterotic/heterotic duality in six and four dimensions.
