Title: Left and right handedness of fermions and bosons
Authors: Norma Mankoc Borstnik and Anamarija Borstnik
Abstract: It is shown, by using Grassmann space to describe the internal degrees of freedom of fermions and bosons, that the Weyl like equation exists not only for massless fermions but also for massless gauge bosons. The corresponding states have well defined helicity and handedness. It is shown that spinors and gauge bosons of the same handedness only interact.
