Title: Supersymmetry Breaking and Soft Terms in M-Theory
Authors: H. P. Nilles and M. Olechowski and M. Yamaguchi
Abstract: We investigate gaugino condensation in the framework of the strongly coupled heterotic $E_8 \times E_8$ string (M--theory). Supersymmetry is broken in a hidden sector and gravitational interactions induce soft breaking parameters in the observable sector. The resulting soft masses are of order of the gravitino mass. The situation is similar to that in the weakly coupled $E_8 \times E_8$ theory with one important difference: we avoid the problem of small gaugino masses which are now comparable to the gravitino mass.
