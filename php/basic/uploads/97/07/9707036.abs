Title: 't Hooft Anomaly Matching Conditions for Generalized Symmetries in 2D
Authors: Fiorenzo Bastianelli and Olindo Corradini
Abstract: The 't Hooft anomaly matching conditions are a standard tool to study and test non-perturbative issues in quantum field theory. We give a new, simple proof of the anomaly matching conditions in 2D Poincare` invariant theories. We consider the case of invariance under a large class of generalized symmetries, which include abelian and non-abelian internal symmetries, space-time symmetries generated by the stress tensor, and W-type of symmetries generated by higher spin currents.
