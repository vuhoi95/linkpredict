Title: An extended q-deformed su(2) algebra and the Bloch electron problem
Authors: Kazuo Fujikawa and Harunobu Kubo
Abstract: It is shown that an extended q-deformed $su(2)$ algebra with an extra (``Schwinger '') term can describe Bloch electrons in a uniform magnetic field with an additional periodic potential. This is a generalization of the analysis of Bloch electrons by Wiegmann and Zabrodin. By using a representation theory of this q-deformed algebra, we obtain functional Bethe ansatz equations whose solutions should be functions of finite degree. It is also shown that the zero energy solution is expressed in terms of an Askey Wilson polynomial.
