Title: Duality in Matrix Theory and Three Dimensional Mirror Symmetry
Authors: Duiliu-Emanuel Diaconescu and Jaume Gomis
Abstract: Certain limits of the duality between M-theory on ${T^5/Z_2}$ and IIB on K3 are analyzed in Matrix theory. The correspondence between M-theory five-branes and ALE backgrounds is realized as three dimensional mirror symmetry. Non-critical strings dual to open membranes are explicitly described as gauge theory excitations. We also comment on Type IIA on K3 and the appearance of gauge symmetry enhancement at special points in the moduli space.
