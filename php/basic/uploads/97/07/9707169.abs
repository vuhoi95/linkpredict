Title: Geodesic incompleteness in the CP^1 model on a compact Riemann surface
Authors: L. A. Sadun and J. M. Speight
Abstract: It is proved that the moduli space of static solutions of the CP^1 model on spacetime Sigma x R, where Sigma is any compact Riemann surface, is geodesically incomplete with respect to the metric induced by the kinetic energy functional. The geodesic approximation predicts, therefore, that lumps can collapse and form singularities in finite time in these models.
