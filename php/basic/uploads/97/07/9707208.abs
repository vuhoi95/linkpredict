Title: On the M-theory description of gaugino condensation
Authors: I. Antoniadis and M. Quiros
Abstract: We present an additional test of the recent proposal for describing supersymmetry breaking due to gaugino condensation in the strong coupling regime, by a Scherk-Schwarz mechanism on the eleventh dimension of M-theory. An analysis of supersymmetric transformations in the infinite-radius limit reveals the presence of a discontinuity in the spinorial parameter, which coincides with the result found in the presence of gaugino condensation. The condensate is then identified with the quantized parameter entering the modification of the Scherk-Schwarz boundary conditions. This mechanism provides an alternative perturbative explanation of the gauge hierarchy that determines the scale of low-energy supersymmetry breaking in terms of the unification gauge coupling
