Title: Chaos in Robertson-Walker Cosmology
Authors: Luca Bombelli and Fernando C. Lombardo and Mario Castagnino
Abstract: Chaos in Robertson-Walker cosmological models where gravity is coupled to one or more scalar fields has been studied by a few authors, mostly using numerical simulations. In this paper we begin a systematic study of the analytical aspect. We consider one conformally coupled scalar field and, using the fact that the model is integrable when the field is massless, we show in detail how homoclinic chaos arises for nonzero masses using a perturbative method.
