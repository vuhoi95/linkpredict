Title: The Chromoelectric and Purely Gluonic Operator Contributions to the  Neutron Electric Dipole Moment in N=1 Supergravity
Authors: Tarek Ibrahim and Pran Nath
Abstract: A complete one loop analysis of the chromoelectric dipole contribution to the electric dipole moment (edm) of the quarks and of the neutron in N=1 supergravity including the gluino, chargino and neutralino exchange contributions and exhibiting the dependence on the two CP violating phases allowed in the soft SUSY breaking sector of minimal supergravity models is given. It is found that in significant parts of the supergravity parameter space the chromoelectric dipole contribution to the neutron edm is comparable to the contribution from the electric dipole term and can exceed the contribution of the electric dipole term in certain regions of the parameter space. An analysis of the contribution of Weinberg's purely gluonic CP violating dimension six operator within supergravity unification is also given. It is found that this contribution can also be comparable to the contribution from the electric dipole term in certain regions of the supergravity parameter space.
