Title: Null Strings in Kerr Spacetime
Authors: P. I. Porfyriadis and D. Papadopoulos
Abstract: The null string's equations of motion and constraints in the Kerr spacetime are given. We assume a generic ansatz for the null strings in the Kerr spacetime and we present the resulting solutions in quadratures. Some specific string configurations, that follow from the generic one, are considered separately. In each case we also extract the corresponding solutions in the Schwarzschild spacetime.
