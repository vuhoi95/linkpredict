Title: Bose Symmetry and Chiral Decomposition of 2D Fermionic Determinants
Authors: E. M. C. de Abreu and R. Banerjee and C. Wotzasek
Abstract: We show in a precise way, either in the fermionic or its bosonized version, that Bose symmetry provides a systematic way to carry out the chiral decomposition of the two dimensional fermionic determinant. Interpreted properly, we show that there is no obstruction of this decomposition to gauge invariance, as is usually claimed. Finally, a new way of interpreting the Polyakov-Wiegman identity is proposed.
