Title: The Coulomb Branch of (4,4) Supersymmetric Field Theories in Two  Dimensions
Authors: Duiliu-Emanuel Diaconescu and Nathan Seiberg
Abstract: We study (4,4) supersymmetric field theories in two dimensions with a one dimensional Coulomb branch. These theories have applications in string theory. Our analysis explains the known relation between $A-D-E$ groups and modular invariants of affine SU(2).
