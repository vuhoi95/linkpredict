Title: Matrix Description of Interacting Theories in Six Dimensions
Authors: O. Aharony and M. Berkooz and S. Kachru and N. Seiberg and E. Silverstein
Abstract: We propose descriptions of interacting (2,0) supersymmetric theories without gravity in six dimensions in the infinite momentum frame. They are based on the large $N$ limit of quantum mechanics or 1+1 dimensional field theories on the moduli space of $N$ instantons in $\IR^4$.
