Title: Chern-Simons and Twisted Supersymmetry in Higher Dimensions
Authors: L. Baulieu and A. Losev and N. Nekrasov
Abstract: We describe special supersymmetric gauge theories in three, five, seven and nine dimensions, whose compactification on two-, four-, six- and eight-folds produces a supersymmetric quantum mechanics on moduli spaces of holomorphic bundles and/or solutions to the analogues of instanton equations in higher dimensions. The theories may occur on the worldvolumes of D-branes wrapping manifolds of special holonomy. We also discuss the theories with matter.
