Title: Fixing the Dilaton with Asymptotically Expensive Physics?
Authors: C. P. Burgess and A. de la Macorra and I. Maksymyk and F. Quevedo
Abstract: We propose a general mechanism for stabilizing the dilaton against runaway to weak coupling. The method is based on features of the effective superpotential which arise for supersymmetric gauge theories which are not asymptotically free. Consideration of the 2PI effective action for bilinear operators of matter and gauge superfields allows one to overcome the obstacles to constructing a nonvanishing superpotential.
