Title: Dynamical Flavor Hierarchy and Heavy Top
Authors: Gia Dvali and Zurab Kakushadze
Abstract: In the Standard Model one of the generations is much heavier than the other two. We propose a simple mechanism where all three generations are treated on the equal footing to begin with, and one heavy and two light families emerge from supersymmetric strong dynamics. The Yukawa mass matrix is identified with vevs of the meson fields of some additional gauge theory. It is then forced to have rank one (in the leading order) by non-perturbative superpotential.
