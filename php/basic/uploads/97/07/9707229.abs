Title: On the Three-Point Couplings in Toda Field Theory
Authors: T. Fujiwara and H. Igarashi and Y. Takimoto
Abstract: Correlation functions of Toda field vertices are investigated by applying the method of integrating zero-mode developed for Liouville theory. We generalize the relations among the zero-, two- and three-point couplings known in Liouville case to arbitrary Toda theories. Two- and three-point functions of Toda vertices associated with the simple roots are obtained.
