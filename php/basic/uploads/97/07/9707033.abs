Title: The q-Deformed Oscillator Representations and Their Coherent States of  the su(1,1) Algebra
Authors: Phillial Oh and Chaiho Rim
Abstract: We present various oscillator representations of the q-deformed su(1,1) algebra such as the Holstein-Primakoff, the Dyson, the Fock-Bargmann, the anyonic, and the parabose oscillator representations and discuss their coherent states with the resolution of unity.
