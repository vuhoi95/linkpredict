Title: A Majorana Fermion t-J Model in One Dimension
Authors: Diptiman Sen and B. Sriram Shastry
Abstract: We study a rotation invariant Majorana fermion model in one dimension using diagrammatic perturbation theory and numerical diagonalization of small systems. The model is inspired by a Majorana representation of the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chain, and it is similar in form to the t-J model of electrons, except that the Majorana fermions carry spin-1 and Z_2 charge. We discuss the implications of our results for the low-energy excitations of the spin-1/2 chain. We also discuss a generalization of our model from 3 species of Majorana fermions to N species; the SO(4) symmetric model is particularly interesting.
