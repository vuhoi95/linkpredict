Title: Self Gravitating Fundamental Strings
Authors: Gary T. Horowitz and Joseph Polchinski
Abstract: We study the configuration of a typical highly excited string as one slowly increases the string coupling. The dominant interactions are the long range dilaton and gravitational attraction. In four spacetime dimensions, the string slowly contracts from its initial (large) size until it approaches the string scale where it forms a black hole. In higher dimensions, the string stays large until the coupling reaches a critical value, and then it rapidly collapses to a black hole. The implications for the recently proposed correspondence principle are discussed.
