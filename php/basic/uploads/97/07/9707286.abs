Title: On Topological Susceptibility, Vacuum Energy and Theta Dependence in  Gluodynamics
Authors: Igor Halperin and Ariel Zhitnitsky
Abstract: We suggest that the topological susceptibility in gluodynamics can be found in terms of the gluon condensate using renormalizability and heavy fermion representation of the anomaly. Analogous relations can be also obtained for other zero momentum correlation functions involving the topological density operator. Using these relations, we find the theta dependence of the condensates <GG>, <G \tilde{G}> and of the partition function for small theta and an arbitrary number of colors.
