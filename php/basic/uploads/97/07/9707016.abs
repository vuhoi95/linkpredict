Title: Overlap in odd dimensions
Authors: Y. Kikukawa and H. Neuberger
Abstract: In odd dimensions the lattice overlap formalism is simpler than in even dimensions. Masslessness of fermions can still be preserved without fine tuning and gauge invariance without gauge averaging can be maintained, although, sometimes, only at the expense of parity invariance. When parity invariance is enforced invariance under small gauge transformations can be maintained and continuum global gauge anomalies are reproduced.
