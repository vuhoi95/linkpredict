Title: U(1) lattice gauge theory and N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Jan Ambjorn and Domenec Espriu and Naoki Sasakura
Abstract: We discuss the physics of four-dimensional compact U(1) lattice gauge theory from the point of view of softly broken N=2 supersymmetric SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. We provide arguments in favor of (pseudo-)critical mass exponents 1/3, 5/11 and 1/2, in agreement with the values observed in the computer simulations. We also show that the J^{CP} assignment of some of the lowest lying states can be naturally explained.
