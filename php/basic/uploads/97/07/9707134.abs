Title: One-loop four-graviton amplitude in eleven-dimensional supergravity
Authors: J. Russo and A. A. Tseytlin
Abstract: We find explicit expression for the one-loop four-graviton amplitude in eleven-dimensional supergravity compactified on a circle. Represented in terms of the string coupling (related to the compactification radius) it takes the form of an infinite sum of perturbative string loop corrections. We also compute the amplitude in the case of compactification on a 2-torus which is given by an SL(2,Z) invariant expansion in powers of the torus area. We discuss the structure of quantum corrections in eleven-dimensional theory and their relation to string theory.
