Title: Large-N limit of the generalized 2-dimensional Yang-Mills theories
Authors: M. Alimohammadi and M. Khorrami and A. Aghamohammdi
Abstract: Using the standard saddle-point method, we find an explicit relation for the large-N limit of the free energy of an arbitrary generalized 2D Yang-Mills theory in the weak ($A<A_c$) region. In the strong ($A>A_c$) region, we investigate carefully the specific fourth Casimir theory, and show that the ordinary integral equation of the density function is not adequate to find the solution. There exist, however, another equation which restricts the parameters. So one can find the free energy in strong region and show that the theory has a third order phase transition.
