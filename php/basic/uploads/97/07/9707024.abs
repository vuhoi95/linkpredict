Title: Some comments on $q$-deformed oscillators and $q$-deformed $su(2)$  algebras
Authors: L. C. Kwek and C. H. Oh
Abstract: The various relations between $q$-deformed oscillators algebras and the $q$-deformed $su(2)$ algebras are discussed. In particular, we exhibit the similarity of the $q$-deformed $su(2)$ algebra obtained from $q$-oscillators via Schwinger construction and those obtained from $q$-Holstein-Primakoff transformation and show how the relation between $su_{\sqrt{q}}(2)$ and Hong Yan $q$-oscillator can be regarded as an special case of In\"{o}u\"{e}- Wigner contraction. This latter observation and the imposition of positive norm requirement suggest that Hong-Yan $q$-oscillator algebra is different from the usual $su_{\sqrt{q}}(2)$ algebra, contrary to current belief in the literature.
