Title: Covariant Actions for the Bosonic Sector of D=10 IIB Supergravity
Authors: Gianguido Dall'Agata and Kurt Lechner and Dmitri Sorokin
Abstract: Covariant actions for the bosonic fields of D=10 IIB supergravity are constructed with the help of a single auxiliary scalar field and in a formulation with an infinite series of auxiliary (anti)-self-dual 5-form fields.
