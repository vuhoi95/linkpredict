Title: Perturbative Expansion around the Gaussian Effective Action: The  Background Field Method
Authors: Geon Hyoung Lee and Jae Hyung Yee
Abstract: We develop a systematic method of the perturbative expansion around the Gaussian effective action based on the background field method. We show, by applying the method to the quantum mechanical anharmonic oscillator problem, that even the first non-trivial correction terms greatly improve the Gaussian approximation.
