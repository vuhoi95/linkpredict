Abstract: We prove that there is no power-counting renormalizable nonabelian generalization of the abelian topological mass mechanism in four dimensions. The argument is based on the technique of consistent deformations of the master equation developed by G. Barnich and one of the authors. Recent attempts involving extra fields are also commented upon.
