Title: Restoration of Isotropy for Spin Models
Authors: D. C. Brody and A. Ritz
Abstract: Using real-space renormalisation techniques we analyse the Ising model on a Sierpi\'nski gasket with anisotropic microscopic couplings, and observe a restoration of isotropy on macroscopic scales. In particular, via use of a decimation procedure directly on the fractal lattice, we calculate explicitly the exponential anisotropy decay coefficients near the isotropic regime for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems. The results suggest the universality of the phenomenon in lattice field theories on fractals.
