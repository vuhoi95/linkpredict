Title: Gaugino Condensation, Moduli Potentials and Supersymmetry Breaking in  M-Theory Models
Authors: Zygmunt Lalak and Steven Thomas
Abstract: We derive the explicit form, and discuss some properties of the moduli dependent effective potential arising from M-theory compactified on $M_4 \times X\times S^1 / Z_2 $, when one of the boundaries supports a strongly interacting gauge sector and induces gaugino condensation. We discuss the relation between the explicit gaugino condensate and effective superpotential formulations and find interesting differences with respect to the situation known from the weakly coupled heterotic string case. The moduli dependence of the effective potential turns out to be more complicated than expected, and perhaps offers new clues to the stabilization problem.
