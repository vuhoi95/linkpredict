Title: Finite Energy Electroweak Monopoles
Authors: Y. M. Cho and Kyoungtae Kimm
Abstract: We present finite energy analytic monopole and dyon solutions whose size is fixed by the electroweak scale. The new solutions are obtained by regularizing the recent Cho-Maison solutions of the Weinberg-Salam model. Our result shows that genuine electroweak monopole and dyon could exist whose mass scale is much smaller than the grand unification scale.
