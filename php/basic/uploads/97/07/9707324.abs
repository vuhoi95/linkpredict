Title: Effective action and motion of a cosmic string
Authors: Malcolm Anderson and Filipe Bonjour and Ruth Gregory and John Stewart
Abstract: We examine the leading order corrections to the Nambu effective action for the motion of a cosmic string, which appear at fourth order in the ratio of the width to radius of curvature of the string. We determine the numerical coefficients of these extrinsic curvature corrections, and derive the equations of motion of the worldsheet. Using these equations, we calculate the corrections to the motion of a collapsing loop, a travelling wave, and a helical breather. From the numerical coefficients we have calculated, we discuss whether the string motion can be labelled as `rigid' or `antirigid,' and hence whether cusp or kink formation might be suppressed or enhanced.
