Title: Complete control of gauge parameter dependence in the Abelian Higgs  model
Authors: Rainer Häußling and Stephan Kappel
Abstract: We examine the dependence on all gauge parameters in the example of the Abelian Higgs model by applying a general algebraic method which roots in an extension of the usual Slavnov-Taylor identity. This method automatically yields all information about the gauge parameter dependence of Green functions and therefore especially allows to control the range of ``good'' normalization conditions. In this context we show that the physical on-shell normalization conditions are in complete agreement with the restrictions dictated by the enlarged Slavnov-Taylor identity and that the coupling can be fixed in an easily handleable way on the Ward identity of local gauge invariance. As an application of the general method we also study the Callan-Symanzik equation and the renormalization group equation of the Abelian Higgs model.
