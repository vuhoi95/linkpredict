Title: Zamalodchikov's C-Theorem and The Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory
Authors: M. R. Rahimi Tabar and S. Rouhani
Abstract: We consider perturbation of a conformal field theory by a pair of relevant logarithmic operators and calculate the beta function up to two loops. We observe that the beta function can not be derived from a potential. Thus the renormalization group trajectories are not always along decreasing values of the central charge. However there exists a domain of structure constants in which the c-theorem still holds.
