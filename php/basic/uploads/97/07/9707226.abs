Title: Geometrical approach to duality in N=1 supersymmetric theories
Authors: Ph Brax and C. Grojean and C. A. Savoy
Abstract: We investigate the geometry of the moduli spaces of dual electric and magnetic N=1 supersymmetric field theories. Using the SU(N_c) gauge group as a guideline we show that the electric and magnetic moduli spaces coincide for a suitable choice of the Kahler potential of the magnetic theory. We analyse the Kahler structure of the dual moduli spaces.
