Title: Duality between Topologically Massive and Self-Dual models
Authors: J. C. Le Guillou and E. F. Moreno and C. Nunez and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We show that, with the help of a general BRST symmetry, different theories in 3 dimensions can be connected through a fundamental topological field theory related to the classical limit of the Chern-Simons model.
