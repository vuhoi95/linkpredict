Title: Non-Abelian BPS Monopoles in N=4 Gauged Supergravity
Authors: Ali H. Chamseddine and Mikhail S. Volkov
Abstract: We study static, spherically symmetric, and purely magnetic solutions of SU(2) $\times$ SU(2) gauge supergravity in four dimensions. A systematic analysis of the supersymmetry conditions reveals solutions which preserve 1/8 of the supersymmetries and are characterized by a BPS-monopole-type gauge field and a globally hyperbolic, everywhere regular geometry. These present the first known example of non-Abelian backgrounds in gauge supergravity and in leading order effective string theory.
