Title: Hawking Radiation for Non-minimally Coupled Matter from Generalized 2D  Black Hole Models
Authors: W. Kummer and H. Liebl and D. V. Vassilevich
Abstract: It is well known that spherically symmetric reduction of General Relativity (SSG) leads to non-minimally coupled scalar matter. We generalize (and correct) recent results to Hawking radiation for a class of dilaton models which share with the Schwarzschild black hole non-minimal coupling of scalar fields and the basic global structure. An inherent ambiguity of such models (if they differ from SSG) is discussed. However, for SSG we obtain the rather disquieting result of a negative Hawking flux at infinity, if the usual recipe for such calculations is applied.
