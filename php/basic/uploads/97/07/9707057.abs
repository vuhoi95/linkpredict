Title: Rotating solitons and non-rotating, non-static black holes
Authors: O. Brodbeck and M. Heusler and N. Straumann and M. Volkov
Abstract: It is shown that the non-Abelian black hole solutions have stationary generalizations which are parameterized by their angular momentum and electric Yang-Mills charge. In particular, there exists a non-static class of stationary black holes with vanishing angular momentum. It is also argued that the particle-like Bartnik-McKinnon solutions admit slowly rotating, globally regular excitations. In agreement with the non-Abelian version of the staticity theorem, these non-static soliton excitations carry electric charge, although their non-rotating limit is neutral.
