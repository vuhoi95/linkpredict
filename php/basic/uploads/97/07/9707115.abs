Title: Nonperturbative path integral of 2d dilaton gravity and two-loop effects  from scalar matter
Authors: W. Kummer and H. Liebl and D. V. Vassilevich
Abstract: Performing an nonperturbative path integral for the geometric part of a large class of 2d theories without kinetic term for the dilaton field, the quantum effects from scalar matter fields are treated as a perturbation. When integrated out to two-loops they yield a correction to the Polyakov term which is still exact in the geometric part. Interestingly enough the effective action only experiences a renormalization of the dilaton potential.
