Title: On quark mass correction to the string potential
Authors: G. German and Yu Jiang
Abstract: Following recent work by Lambiase and Nesterenko we study in detail the interquark potential for a Nambu-Goto string with point masses attached to its ends. We obtain exact solutions to the gap equations for the Lagrange multipliers and metric components and determine the potential without simplifying assumptions. We also discuss L\"{u}scher term and argue that it remains universal.
