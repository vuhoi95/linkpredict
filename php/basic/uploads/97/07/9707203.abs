Title: Flat Symplectic Bundles of N-Extended Supergravities, Central Charges  and Black-Hole Entropy
Authors: L. Andrianopoli and R. D'Auria and S. Ferrara
Abstract: In these lectures we give a geometrical formulation of N-extended supergravities which generalizes N=2 special geometry of N=2 theories. In all these theories duality symmetries are related to the notion of "flat symplectic bundles" and central charges may be defined as "sections" over these bundles. Attractor points giving rise to "fixed scalars" of the horizon geometry and Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for extremal black-holes are discussed in some details.
