Title: Excited states in the twisted XXZ spin chain
Authors: T. Nassar and O. Tirkkonen
Abstract: We compute the finite size spectrum for the spin 1/2 XXZ chain with twisted boundary conditions, for anisotropy in the regime $0< \gamma <\pi/2$, and arbitrary twist $\theta$. The string hypothesis is employed for treating complex excitations. The Bethe Ansatz equtions are solved within a coupled non-linear integral equation approach, with one equation for each type of string. The root-of-unity quantum group invariant periodic chain reduces to the XXZ_1/2 chain with a set of twist boundary conditions ($\pi/\gamma\in Z$, $\theta$ an integer multiple of $\gamma$). For this model, the restricted Hilbert space corresponds to an unitary conformal field theory, and we recover all primary states in the Kac table in terms of states with specific twist and strings.
