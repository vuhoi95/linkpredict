Title: BRST Cohomology and Renormalizability of Quantum Gravity near Two  Dimensions
Authors: Yoshihisa Kitazawa and Rie Kuriki and Katsumi Shigura
Abstract: We discuss the renormalizability of quantum gravity near two dimensions based on the results obtained by a computation of the BRST-antibracket cohomology in the space of local functionals of the fields and antifields. We justify the assumption on the general structure of the counterterms which have been used in the original proof of renormalizability of the quantum gravity near two dimensions.
