Title: Different Approaches for Bosonization in Higher Dimensions
Authors: R. Banerjee and E. C. Marino
Abstract: We describe two distinct approaches for bosonization in higher dimensions; one is based on a direct comparison of current correlation functions while the other relies on a Master lagrangean formalism. These are used to bosonise the Massive Thirring Model in three and four dimensions in the weak coupling regime but with an arbitrary fermion mass. In both approaches the explicit bosonised lagrangean and current are derived in terms of gauge fields. The complete equivalence of the two bosonization methods is established. Exact results for the free massive fermion theory are also obtained. Finally, the two-dimensional theory is revisited and the possibility of extending this analysis for arbitrary dimensions is indicated.
