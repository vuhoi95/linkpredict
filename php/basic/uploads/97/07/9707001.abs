Title: Effective dynamics of self-gravitating extended objects
Authors: S. Ansoldi and A. Aurilia and R. Balbinot and E. Spallucci
Abstract: We introduce an effective Lagrangian which describes the classical and semiclassical dynamics of spherically symmetric, self-gravitating objects that may populate the Universe at large and small (Planck) scale. These include wormholes, black holes and inflationary bubbles. We speculate that such objects represent some possible modes of fluctuation in the primordial spacetime foam out of which our universe was born. Several results obtained by different methods are encompassed and reinterpreted by our effective approach. As an example, we discuss: i) the gravitational nucleation coefficient for a pair of Minkowski bubbles, and ii) the nucleation coefficient of an inflationary vacuum bubble in a Minkowski background
