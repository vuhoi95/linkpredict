Title: U-branes and T^3 fibrations
Authors: James T. Liu and Ruben Minasian
Abstract: We describe eight-dimensional vacuum configurations with varying moduli consistent with the U-duality group $SL(2,Z) \times SL(3,Z)$. Focusing on the latter less-well understood SL(3,Z) properties, we construct a class of fivebrane solutions living on lines on a three-dimensional base space. The resulting U-manifolds, with five scalars transforming under SL(3), admit a Ricci-flat Kahler metric. Based on the connection with special lagrangian $T^3$ fibered Calabi-Yau 3-folds, this construction provides a simple framework for the investigation of Calabi-Yau mirrors.
