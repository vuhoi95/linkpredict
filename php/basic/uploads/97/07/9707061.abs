Title: The tensor Goldstone multiplet for partially broken supersymmetry
Authors: Jonathan Bagger and Alexander Galperin
Abstract: We show that the tensor gauge multiplet of N=1 supersymmetry can serve as the Goldstone multiplet for partially broken rigid N=2 supersymmetry. We exploit a remarkable analogy with the Goldstone-Maxwell multiplet of hep-th/9608177 to find its nonlinear transformation law and its invariant Goldstone action. We demonstrate that the tensor multiplet has two dualities. The first transforms it into the chiral Goldstone multiplet; the other leaves it invariant.
