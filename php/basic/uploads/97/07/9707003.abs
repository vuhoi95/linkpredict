Title: p-Brane cosmology and phases of Brans-Dicke theory with matter
Authors: Chanyong Park and Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: We study the effect of the solitonic degrees of freedom in string cosmology following the line of Rama. The gas of solitonic p-brane is treated as a perfect fluid in a Brans-Dicke type theory. In this paper, we find exact cosmological solutions for any Brans-Dicke parameter $\omega$ and for general parameter $\gamma$ of equation of state and classify the cosmology of the solutions on a parameter space of $\gamma$ and $\omega$.
