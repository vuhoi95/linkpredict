Title: Algebraic Aspects of Matrix Theory on T^d
Authors: S. Elitzur and A. Giveon and D. Kutasov and E. Rabinovici
Abstract: We study the exceptional U duality group $E_d$ of M-theory compactified on a d-torus and its representations using Matrix theory. We exhibit the $E_d$ structure and show that p-branes wrapped or unwrapped around the longitudinal direction form representations of the U duality group together with other, more mysterious, states.
