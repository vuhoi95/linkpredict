Title: A Note on Consistent Anomalies
Authors: L. Baulieu and C. Laroche and N. Ohta and M. Picco
Abstract: Within a BRST formulation, we determine the expressions of the consistent anomaly for superstrings with extended worldsheet supersymmetries of rank N. We consider the O(N) superconformal algebras up to N=4, as well as the `small N=4' superalgebra. This is done using a superfield formalism, allowing to recover previous results that were expressed in components. Moreover, we identify the `small N=4' algebra as the constrained `large N=4' via a self-duality like condition in superspace.
