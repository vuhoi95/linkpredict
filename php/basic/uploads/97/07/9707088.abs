Title: The Initial Value Problem For Maximally Non-Local Actions
Authors: D. L. Bennett and H. B. Nielsen and R. P. Woodard
Abstract: We study the initial value problem for actions which contain non-trivial functions of integrals of local functions of the dynamical variable. In contrast to many other non-local actions, the classical solution set of these systems is at most discretely enlarged, and may even be restricted, with respect to that of a local theory. We show that the solutions are those of a local theory whose (spacetime constant) parameters vary with the initial value data according to algebraic equations. The various roots of these algebraic equations can be plausibly interpreted in quantum mechanics as different components of a multi-component wave function. It is also possible that the consistency of these algebraic equations imposes constraints upon the initial value data which appear miraculous from the context of a local theory.
