Title: Phase Coherence in Quantum Brownian Motion
Authors: M. Blasone and Y. N. Srivastava and G. Vitiello and A. Widom
Abstract: The quantum theory of Brownian motion is discussed in the Schwinger version wherein the notion of a coordinate moving forward in time $x(t)$ is replaced by two coordinates, $x_+(t)$ moving forward in time and $x_-(t)$ moving backward in time. The role of the doubling of the degrees of freedom is illustrated for the case of electron beam two slit diffraction experiments. Interference is computed with and without dissipation (described by a thermal bath). The notion of a dissipative interference phase, closely analogous to the Aharonov-Bohm magnetic field induced phase, is explored.
