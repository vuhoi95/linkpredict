Title: Spinning particles in Taub-NUT space
Authors: Diana Vaman and Mihai Visinescu
Abstract: The geodesic motion of pseudo-classical spinning particles in Euclidean Taub-NUT space is analysed. The constants of motion are expressed in terms of Killing-Yano tensors. Some previous results from the literature are corrected.
