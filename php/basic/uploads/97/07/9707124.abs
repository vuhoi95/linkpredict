Abstract: The semiclassical grey-body factor for massless fermion emission from the four dimensional black hole described by an ensemble of intersecting triplets of D- five-branes is shown to be consistent with the (statistical) decay rate of the branes (in the `long' D-string approximation) into massless fermionic closed string states, subject to assumptions regarding the energy distribution of colliding open string states.
