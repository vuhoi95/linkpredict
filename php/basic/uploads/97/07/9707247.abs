Title: Superpotentials of N=1 Supersymmetric Gauge Theories from M-theory
Authors: Soonkeon Nam and Kyungho Oh and Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: We consider brane configurations in M-theory describing N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories and using the parametric representation of the brane configurations, we calculate the superpotentials for various cases including multiple gauge groups or fermions. For SU(n) N=1 SQCD with $N_f$ fermion case ($N_f < N_c)$, we find that the superpotential from M-theory and the gauge theory agree precisely. This gives a direct evidence of the validity of Witten's M-theory method for calculating the super potential.
