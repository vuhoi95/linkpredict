Title: On the Bound States in a Non-linear Quantum Field Theory of a Spinor  Field with Higher Derivatives
Authors: A. D. Mitov and M. N. Stoilov and D. Ts. Stoyanov
Abstract: We consider a model of quantum field theory with higher derivatives for a spinor field with quartic selfinteraction. With the help of the Bethe-Salpeter equation we study the problem of the two particle bound states in the "chain" approximation. The existence of a scalar bound state is established.
