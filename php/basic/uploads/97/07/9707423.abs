Title: New physics in a nutshell, or Q-ball as a power plant
Authors: Gia Dvali and Alexander Kusenko and Mikhail Shaposhnikov
Abstract: Future experiments may discover new scalar particles with global charges and couplings that allow for solitonic states. If the effective potential has flat directions, the scalar VEV inside a large Q-ball can exceed the particle mass by many orders of magnitude. Models with low-energy supersymmetry breaking generically have both the scalars carrying some global charges, and the flat directions. The Q-ball interior can, therefore, provide an environment for exploring physics far beyond the TeV scale without the need for building colliders of ever-increasing energies. Some Standard Model processes, otherwise strongly suppressed, can also be studied inside the soliton, where the SU(2) symmetry can be restored, and the quark confinement may be absent. Baryon number violating processes catalyzed by the large VEV inside the Q-ball can provide an inexhaustible energy resource.
