Title: From Fusion Hierarchy to Excited State TBA
Authors: G. Juettner and A. Kluemper and J. Suzuki
Abstract: Functional relations among the fusion hierarchy of quantum transfer matrices give a novel derivation of the TBA equations, namely without string hypothesis. This is demonstrated for two important models of 1D highly correlated electron systems, the supersymmetric $t-J$ model and the supersymmetric extended Hubbard model. As a consequence, "the excited state TBA" equations, which characterize correlation lengths, are explicitly derived for the $t-J$ model. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first explicit derivation of excited state TBA equations for 1D lattice electron systems.
