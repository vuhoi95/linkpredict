Title: Lattice Tests of Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory?
Authors: Nick Evans and Steve Hsu and Myck Schwetz
Abstract: Supersymmetric Yang Mills theory is directly accessible to lattice simulations using current methodology, and can provide a non-trivial check of recent exact results in SQCD. In order to tune the lattice simulation to the supersymmetric point it is neccessary to understand the behavior of the theory with a small supersymmetry breaking gaugino mass. We introduce a soft breaking gaugino mass in a controlled fashion using a spurion analysis. We compute the gluino condensate, vacuum energy and bound-state masses as a function of the gaugino mass, providing more readily accessible predictions which still test the supersymmetric results. Finally we discuss diagnostics for obtaining the bare lattice parameters that correspond to the supersymmetric continuum limit.
