Title: Magnetic monopoles in U(1)_4 Lattice Gauge Theory with Wilson action
Authors: V. Cirigliano and G. Paffuti
Abstract: We construct the Euclidean Green functions for the soliton (magnetic monopole) field in the U(1)_4 Lattice Gauge Theory with Wilson action. We show that in the strong coupling regime there is monopole condensation while in the QED phase the physical Hilbert space splits into orthogonal soliton sectors labelled by integer magnetic charge.
