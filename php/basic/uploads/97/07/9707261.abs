Title: The supermembrane with winding
Authors: B. de Wit and K. Peeters and J. C. Plefka
Abstract: The supersymmetry algebra for supermembranes, quantized in the light-cone gauge, exhibits central charges induced by wrapping the membrane around compact dimensions. These central charges are manifestly consistent with Lorentz symmetry. While the central charges raise the mass of the membrane states, they still leave the mass spectrum continuous, at least generically. The lower bound on the mass spectrum is set by the winding number and corresponds to a BPS state.
