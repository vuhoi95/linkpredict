Title: On the critical behaviour of hermitean f-matrix models in the double  scaling limit with f >= 3
Authors: S. Balaska and J. Maeder and W. Ruehl
Abstract: An algorithm for the isolation of any singularity of f-matrix models in the double scaling limit is presented. In particular it is proved by construction that only those universality classes exist that are known from 2-matrix models.
