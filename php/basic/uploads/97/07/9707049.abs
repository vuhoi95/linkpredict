Title: Matter from Toric Geometry
Authors: Philip Candelas and Eugene Perevalov and Govindan Rajesh
Abstract: We present an algorithm for obtaining the matter content of effective six-dimensional theories resulting from compactification of F-theory on elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds which are hypersurfaces in toric varieties. The algorithm allows us to read off the matter content of the theory from the polyhedron describing the Calabi-Yau manifold. This is based on the generalized Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation condition.
