Title: A New Massive Type IIA Supergravity From Compactification
Authors: P. S. Howe and N. D. Lambert and P. C. West
Abstract: We consider the most general form for eleven dimensional supersymmetry compatible with on-shell superfields. This allows for the introduction of a conformal Spin(1,10) connection. In eleven dimensional Minkowski space this modification is trivial and can be removed by a field redefinition, however, upon compactification on S^1 it is possible to introduce a non-trivial `Wilson line'. The resulting ten dimensional supergravity has massive 1-form and 3-form potentials and a cosmological constant. This theory does not possess a supersymmetric eightbrane soliton but it does admit a supersymmetric non-static cosmological solution.
