Title: Euclidean D-branes and higher-dimensional gauge theory
Authors: BS Acharya and JM Figueroa-O'Farrill and M O'Loughlin and B Spence
Abstract: We consider euclidean D-branes wrapping around manifolds of exceptional holonomy in dimensions seven and eight. The resulting theory on the D-brane---that is, the dimensional reduction of 10-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory---is a cohomological field theory which describes the topology of the moduli space of instantons. The 7-dimensional theory is an N_T = 2 (or balanced) cohomological theory given by an action potential of Chern-Simons type. As a by-product of this method, we construct a related cohomological field theory which describes the monopole moduli space on a 7-manifold of G_2 holonomy.
