Abstract: We study the path realization of Demazure crystals related to solvable lattice models in statistical mechanics. Various characters are represented in a unified way as the sums over one dimensional configurations which we call unrestricted, classically restricted and restricted paths. As an application characters of Demazure modules are obtained in terms of $q$-multinomial coefficients for several level 1 modules of classical affine algebras.
