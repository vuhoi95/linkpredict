Title: Singular Yukawa and gauge couplings in d=4 Heterotic String Vacua
Authors: Matthias Klein and Jan Louis
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the singularities in the Yukawa and gauge couplings of N=1 compactifications of the SO(32) heterotic string in four space-time dimensions. Such singularities can arise from the strong coupling dynamics of a confined non-perturbative gauge group.
