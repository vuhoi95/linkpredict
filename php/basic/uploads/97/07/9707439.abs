Title: Gauge-Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking within the Dynamical Messenger  Sector
Authors: E. Poppitz and S. P. Trivedi
Abstract: We consider the idea of combining the supersymmetry breaking and messenger sectors in models of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking. We discuss the advantages and problems of such models, and present an existence proof by constructing an explicit example. We explore in some detail the low-energy supersymmetry-breaking dynamics and the generation of supersymmetry-breaking soft masses of the standard model superpartners, and discuss many features which are likely to be shared by more realistic models with dynamical messengers.
