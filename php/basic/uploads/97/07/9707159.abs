Title: Integrability of Coupled Conformal Field Theories
Authors: A. LeClair and A. Ludwig and G. Mussardo
Abstract: The massive phase of two-layer integrable systems is studied by means of RSOS restrictions of affine Toda theories. A general classification of all possible integrable perturbations of coupled minimal models is pursued by an analysis of the (extended) Dynkin diagrams. The models considered in most detail are coupled minimal models which interpolate between magnetically coupled Ising models and Heisenberg spin-ladders along the $c<1$ discrete series.
