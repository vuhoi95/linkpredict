Title: Symmetries and classical quantization
Authors: Khazret Nirov and Mikhail Plyushchay
Abstract: A phenomenon of classical quantization is discussed. This is revealed in the class of pseudoclassical gauge systems with nonlinear nilpotent constraints containing some free parameters. Variation of parameters does not change local (gauge) and discrete symmetries of the corresponding systems, but there are some special discrete values of them which give rise to the maximal global symmetries at the classical level. Exactly the same values of the parameters are separated at the quantum level, where, in particular, they are singled out by the requirement of conservation of the discrete symmetries. The phenomenon is observed for the familiar pseudoclassical model of 3D P,T-invariant massive fermion system and for a new pseudoclassical model of 3D P,T-invariant system of topologically massive U(1) gauge fields.
