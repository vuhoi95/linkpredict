Title: Factorization of Multiparticle Scattering in the Heisenberg Spin Chain
Authors: Anastasia Doikou and Luca Mezincescu and Rafael I. Nepomechie
Abstract: We give an explicit proof within the framework of the Bethe Ansatz/string hypothesis of the factorization of multiparticle scattering in the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 Heisenberg spin chain, for the case of 3 particles.
