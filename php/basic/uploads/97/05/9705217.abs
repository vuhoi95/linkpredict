Abstract: In this work we consider an Abelian O(3) sigma model coupled nonminimally with a gauge field governed by a Maxwell and Chern-Simons terms. Bogomol'nyi equations are constructed for a specific form of the potential and generic nonminimal coupling constant. Furthermore, topological and nontopological self-dual soliton solutions are obtained for a critical value of the nonminimal coupling constant. Some particular static vortex solutions (topological and nontopological) satisfying the Bogomol'nyi bound are numerically solved and presented.
