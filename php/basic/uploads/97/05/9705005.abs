Title: The Noncommutative Inhomogeneous Hopf Algebra
Authors: M. Lagraa and N. Touhami
Abstract: From the bicovariant first order differential calculus on inhomogeneous Hopf algebra ${\cal B}$ we construct the set of right-invariant Maurer-Cartan one-forms considered as a right-invariant basis of a bicovariant ${\cal B}$-bimodule over which we develop the Woronowicz's general theory of differential calculus on quantum groups. In this formalism, we introduce suitable functionals on ${\cal B}$ which control the inhomogeneous commutation rules. In particular we find that the homogeneous part of commutation rules between the translations and those between the generators of the homogeneous part of ${\cal B}$ and translations are controled by different R-matrices satisfying nontrivial characteristic equations.
