Title: Charged SU(N) Einstein-Yang-Mills Black Holes
Authors: Burkhard Kleihaus and Jutta Kunz and Abha Sood
Abstract: We consider asymptotically flat static spherically symmetric black hole solutions in SU(N) Einstein-Yang-Mills theory. Embedding the N-dimensional representation of $su(2)$ in $su(N)$, the purely magnetic gauge field ansatz contains $N-1$ functions. When one or more of these gauge field functions are identically zero, magnetically charged EYM black hole solutions emerge, consisting of a neutral and a charged gauge field part, based on non-abelian subalgebras and the Cartan subalgebra of $su(N)$, respectively. We classify these charged black hole solutions in general and present numerical solutions for SU(5) EYM theory.
