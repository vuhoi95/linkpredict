Title: Nonrenormalization of Mass of Some Nonsupersymmetric String States
Authors: Atish Dabholkar and Gautam Mandal and P. Ramadevi
Abstract: It is argued that the quantum correction to the mass of some very massive, nonsupersymmetric states vanishes in inverse proportion to their tree-level mass to all orders in string loops. This approximate nonrenormalization can explain the agreement between the perturbative degeneracy of these states and the Sen entropy of the associated black holes.
