Abstract: We present the Heisenberg-picture approach to the quantum evolution of the scalar fields in an expanding FRW universe which incorporates relatively simply the initial quantum conditions such as the vacuum state, the thermal equilibrium state, and the coherent state. We calculate the Wightman function, two-point function, and correlation function of a massive scalar field. We find the quantum evolution of fluctuations of a self-interacting field perturbatively and discuss the renormalization of field equations.
