Title: On the string interpretation of M(atrix) theory
Authors: L. Bonora and C. S. Chu
Abstract: It has been proposed recently that, in the framework of M(atrix) theory, N=8 supersymmetric U(N) Yang-Mills theory in 1+1 dimensions gives rise to type IIA long string configurations. We point out that the quantum moduli space of $SYM_{1+1}$ gives rise to two quantum numbers, which fit very well into the M(atrix) theory. The two quantum numbers become familiar if one switches to a IIB picture, where they represent configurations of D-strings and fundamental strings. We argue that, due to the SL(2,Z) symmetry, of the IIB theory, such quantum numbers must represent configurations that are present also in the IIA framework.
