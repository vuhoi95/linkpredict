Title: Vacuum Radiation and Symmetry Breaking in Conformally Invariant Quantum  Field Theory
Authors: V. Aldaya and M. Calixto and J. M. Cervero
Abstract: The underlying reasons for the difficulty of unitarily implementing the whole conformal group $SO(4,2)$ in a massless Quantum Field Theory (QFT) are investigated in this paper. Firstly, we demonstrate that the singular action of the subgroup of special conformal transformations (SCT), on the standard Minkowski space $M$, cannot be primarily associated with the vacuum radiation problems, the reason being more profound and related to the dynamical breakdown of part of the conformal symmetry (the SCT subgroup, to be more precise) when representations of null mass are selected inside the representations of the whole conformal group. Then we show how the vacuum of the massless QFT radiates under the action of SCT (usually interpreted as transitions to a uniformly accelerated frame) and we calculate exactly the spectrum of the outgoing particles, which proves to be a generalization of the Planckian one, this recovered as a given limit.
