Title: Two-Loop Beta Functions Without Feynman Diagrams
Authors: Peter E. Haagensen and Kasper Olsen and Ricardo Schiappa
Abstract: Starting from a consistency requirement between T-duality symmetry and renormalization group flows, the two-loop metric beta function is found for a d=2 bosonic sigma model on a generic, torsionless background. The result is obtained without Feynman diagram calculations, and represents further evidence that duality symmetry severely constrains renormalization flows.
