Title: On the stability problem in the O(N) nonlinear sigma model
Authors: S. E. Derkachov and A. N. Manashov
Abstract: The stability problem for the O(N) nonlinear sigma model in the 2+\epsilon dimensions is considered. We present the results of the 1/N^{2} order calculations of the critical exponents (in the 2<d<4 dimensions) of the composite operators relevant for this problem. The arguments in the favor of the scenario with the conventional fixed point are given.
