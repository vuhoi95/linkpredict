Abstract: We simulate the kinetic Ashkin-Teller model with both ordered and disordered initial states, evolving in contact with a heat-bath at the critical temperature. The power law scaling behaviour for the magnetic order and electric order are observed in the early time stage. The values of the critical exponent $\theta$ vary along the critical line. Another dynamical exponent $z$ is also obtained in the process.
