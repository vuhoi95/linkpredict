Title: Anomalous Creation of Branes
Authors: Constantin Bachas and Michael R. Douglas and Michael B. Green
Abstract: In certain circumstances when two branes pass through each other a third brane is produced stretching between them. We explain this phenomenon by the use of chains of dualities and the inflow of charge that is required for the absence of chiral gauge anomalies when pairs of D-branes intersect.
