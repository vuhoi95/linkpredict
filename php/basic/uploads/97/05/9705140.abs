Title: Violation of S-matrix factorization in massive Thirring model
Authors: Takehisa Fujita and Makoto Hiramoto
Abstract: We present a counter example which shows the violation of the S-matrix factorization in the massive Thirring model. This is done by solving the PBC equations of the massive Thirring model exactly but numerically. The violation of the S-matrix factorization is related to the fact that the crossing symmetry and the factorization do not commute with each other. This confirms that the soliton antisoliton S-matrix factorization picture of the sine-Gordon model is semiclassical and does not lead to a full quantization procedure of the massive Thirring model.
