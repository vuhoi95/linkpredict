Title: Exact Renormalization Group and Running Newtonian Coupling in Higher  Derivative Gravity
Authors: A. A. Bytsenko and L. N. Granda and S. D. Odintsov
Abstract: We discuss exact renormalization group (RG) in $R^2$-gravity using effective average action formalism. The truncated evolution equation for such a theory on De Sitter background leads to the system of nonperturbative RG equations for cosmological and gravitational coupling constants. Approximate solution of these RG equations shows the appearence of antiscreening and screening behaviour of Newtonian coupling what depends on higher derivative coupling constants.
