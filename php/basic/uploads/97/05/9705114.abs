Title: The Chiral Supereigenvalue Model
Authors: Gernot Akemann and Jan C. Plefka
Abstract: A supereigenvalue model with purely positive bosonic eigenvalues is presented and solved by considering its superloop equations. This model represents the supersymmetric generalization of the complex one matrix model, in analogy to the relation between the supereigenvalue and the hermitian one matrix model. Closed expressions for all planar multi-superloop correlation functions are found. Moreover an iterative scheme allows the calculation of higher genus contributions to the free energy and to the correlators. Explicit results for genus one are given.
