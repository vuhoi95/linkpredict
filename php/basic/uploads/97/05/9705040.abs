Title: Kappa-Symmetry, Supersymmetry and Intersecting Branes
Authors: E. Bergshoeff and R. Kallosh and T. Ortin and G. Papadopoulos
Abstract: We present a new form of kappa-symmetry transformations for D-branes in which the dependence on the Born-Infeld field strength is expressed as a relative rotation on the left- and right-moving fields with opposite parameters. Then, we apply this result to investigate the supersymmetry preserved by certain intersecting brane configurations at arbitrary angles and with non-vanishing constant Born-Infeld fields. We also comment on the covariant quantization of the D-brane actions.
