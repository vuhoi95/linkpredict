Title: Universal Spin Structure in Gauge Gravitation Theory
Authors: G. Giachetta and L. Mangiarotti and G. Sardanashvily
Abstract: Building on the universal covering group of the general linear group, we introduce the composite spinor bundle whose subbundles are Lorentz spin structures associated with different gravitational fields. General covariant transformations of this composite spinor bundle are canonically defined.
