Title: Comment on "Nongaussian Isocurvature Perturbations from Inflation"
Authors: Ignatios Antoniadis and Pawel O. Mazur and Emil Mottola
Abstract: In a recent paper of Linde and Mukhanov, a hybrid inflationary model with nongaussian density perturbations and a ``blue'' spectral index n > 1 was presented. In this comment we point out that this model can be considered as a particular realization of the general framework for the spectrum and statistics of the CMBR we proposed in astro-ph/9611208, based on the hypothesis of conformal invariance. The implication of this hypothesis is that density perturbations are nongaussian with a spectral index n > 1.
