Title: Exact Results for Soft Supersymmetry Breaking Parameters in  Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
Authors: J. Hisano and M. Shifman
Abstract: We obtain exact relations (valid to all orders in the coupling constant) for the running gaugino mass in supersymmetric gauge theories, treating the soft supersymmetry breaking effects in the linear approximation. If a supersymmetry breaking squark (selectron) mass term is introduced, our relation connects the renormalization group equation for this term with that for the gaugino mass. Exact relations for the threshold effects in the gaugino masses are derived. The key ingredients of our analysis is the use of the Wilsonean action and holomorphy of this action with respect to relevant parameters.
