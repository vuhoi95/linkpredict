Title: String Field Theory from IIB Matrix Model
Authors: M. Fukuma and H. Kawai and Y. Kitazawa and A. Tsuchiya
Abstract: We derive Schwinger-Dyson equations for the Wilson loops of a type IIB matrix model. Superstring coordinates are introduced through the construction of the loop space. We show that the continuum limit of the loop equation reproduces the light-cone superstring field theory of type IIB superstring in the large-N limit. We find that the interacting string theory can be obtained in the double scaling limit as it is expected.
