Title: Scalar-Tensor Theory of Gravity on $M_4\times Z_{2}$ Geometry
Authors: Akira Kokado and Gaku Konisi and Takesi Saito and Yutaka Tada
Abstract: In the Brans-Dicke(BD) theory on $M_{4}\times Z_{2}$ geometry the geometrical meaning of the torsion is clarified. The BD theory on $M_{4}\times Z_{2}$ is rederived by taking into account of a new isometry condition.
