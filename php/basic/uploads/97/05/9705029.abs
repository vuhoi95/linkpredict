Title: Coupled Harmonic Oscillators and Feynman's Rest of the Universe
Authors: D. Han and Y. S. Kim and Marilyn E. Noz
Abstract: According to Feynman, the universe consists of two parts - the system in which we are interested and the rest of the universe which our measurement process does not reach. Feynman then formulates the density matrix in terms of the observable world and the rest of the universe. It is shown that coupled harmonic oscillators can serve as an illustrative example for Feynman's ``rest of the universe.'' It is pointed out that this simple example has far-reaching consequences in many branches of physics, including statistical mechanics, measurement theory, information theory, thermo-field dynamics, quantum optics, and relativistic quantum mechanics. It is shown that our ignorance of the rest of the universe increases the uncertainty and entropy in the system in which we are interested.
