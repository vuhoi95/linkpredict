Title: Deformations of N=2 Dualities to N=1 Dualities in SU, SO and USp Gauge  Theories
Authors: Takayuki Hirayama and Nobuhiro Maekawa and Shigeki Sugimoto
Abstract: We study deformations of dualities in finite N=2 supersymmetric QCD. Adding mass terms for some quarks and the adjoint matter to the finite N=2 theory, which is known to have dual descriptions, the correspondence of gauge invariant operators between the original and dual theory is deformed. As a result, we naturally obtain N.Seiberg's N=1 duality. Furthermore, we discuss the origin of the meson and superpotential in the dual theory. This approach can be applied to SU(N), SO(N), and USp(2N) gauge theories, and we analyze all these cases.
