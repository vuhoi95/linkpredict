Title: Improved determination of the classical sphaleron transition rate
Authors: J. Ambjorn and A. Krasnitz
Abstract: We determine the sphaleron transition rate using real time lattice simulations of the classical system. An improved definition of the lattice topological charge allows us to obtain a more reliable estimate of the transition rate. For an SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs system in the broken phase we find the transition rate to be strongly suppressed, and we have observed no sphaleron transitions in the range of coupling constants used. For a pure SU(2) Yang-Mills system in large volumes the rate behaves as $\kappa (\alpha_w T)^4$, with $\kappa$ slightly decreasing as the lattice spacing is reduced. If the lattice size is reduced to about twice the magnetic screening length, the rate is suppressed by finite-size effects, and $\kappa$ is approximately proportional to the lattice spacing. Our rate measurements are supplemented by analysis of gauge field correlation functions in the Coulomb gauge.
