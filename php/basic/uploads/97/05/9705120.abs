Title: Interactions of type IIB D-branes from D-instanton matrix model
Authors: I. Chepelev and A. A. Tseytlin
Abstract: We compute long-distance interaction potentials between certain 1/2 and 1/4 supersymmetric D-brane configurations of type IIB theory, demonstrating detailed agreement between classical supergravity and one-loop instanton matrix model results. This confirms the interpretation of D-branes as described by classical matrix model backgrounds as being `populated' by large number of D-instantons, i.e. as corresponding to non-marginal bound states of branes of lower dimensions. In the process, we establish precise relation between matrix model expressions and non-abelian F^4 terms in the super Yang-Mills effective action.
