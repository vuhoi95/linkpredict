Title: Electron and Quasiparticle Exponents of Haldane-Rezayi state in  Non-abelian Fractional Quantum Hall Theory
Authors: Jen-Chi Lee and Xiao-Gang Wen
Abstract: The quasiparticle propagator of Haldane-Rezayi(HR) fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state is calculated, based on a chiral fermion model (or a Weyl fermion model) equipped with a hidden spin SU(2) symmetry. The spectrum of the chiral fermion model for each total spin and total momentum is shown to be identical to that of the SU(2) c = -2 model introduced to describe the edge spectrum of the HR state.
