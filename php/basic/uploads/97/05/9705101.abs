Title: New Constraints on the Yukawa-Type Hypothetical Interaction From The  Recent Casimir Force Measurement
Authors: M. Bordag and G. T. Gillies and V. M. Mostepanenko
Abstract: We calculate the constraints on the constants of hypothetical long-range interactions which follow from the recent measurement of the Casimir force. A comparison with previous constraints is given. The new constraints are up to a factor of 3000 stronger in some parameter regions .
