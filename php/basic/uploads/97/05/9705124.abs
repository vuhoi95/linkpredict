Title: Induced Parity Breaking Term at Finite Temperature
Authors: C. Fosco and G. L. Rossini and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We compute the exact induced parity-breaking part of the effective action for 2+1 massive fermions in $QED_3$ at finite temperature by calculating the fermion determinant in a particular background. The result confirms that gauge invariance of the effective action is respected even when large gauge transformations are considered.
