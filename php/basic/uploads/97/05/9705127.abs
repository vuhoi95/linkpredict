Title: Cohomological Yang-Mills Theory in Eight Dimensions
Authors: L. Baulieu and H. Kanno and I. M. Singer
Abstract: We construct nearly topological Yang-Mills theories on eight dimensional manifolds with a special holonomy group. These manifolds are the Joyce manifold with $Spin(7)$ holonomy and the Calabi-Yau manifold with SU(4) holonomy. An invariant closed four form $T_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$ on the manifold allows us to define an analogue of the instanton equation, which serves as a topological gauge fixing condition in BRST formalism. The model on the Joyce manifold is related to the eight dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Topological dimensional reduction to four dimensions gives non-abelian Seiberg-Witten equation.
