Title: Consistency Conditions for Branes at Orbifold Singularities
Authors: Julie D. Blum and Kenneth Intriligator
Abstract: We discuss consistency conditions for branes at orbifold singularities. The conditions have a world-sheet interpretation in terms of tadpole cancellation and a space-time interpretation in terms of anomalies. As examples, we consider type II and type I branes on $C^2/Z_M$ orbifolds. We give orientifold constructions of phases of type I or heterotic string theory, involving branches with extra tensor multiplets, which arise when small SO(32) instantons sit on orbifold singularities.
