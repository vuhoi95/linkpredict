Title: Supermembranes with Winding
Authors: Bernard de Wit and Kasper Peeters and Jan Plefka
Abstract: We study supermembranes in the light-cone gauge in eleven flat dimensions with compact directions. The membrane states are subject to only the central charges associated with closed two-branes, which, in this case, are generated by the winding itself. We present arguments why this winding leaves the mass spectrum continuous. The lower bound on the mass spectrum is set by the winding number and corresponds to a BPS state.
