Title: Density Perturbations in String Cosmology
Authors: Michele Maggiore and Riccardo Sturani
Abstract: We discuss the generation and evolution of density perturbations during the large curvature phase of string cosmology. We find that perturbations in the scalar components of the metric evolve with cosmic time as $\exp (\gamma H_st)$ where $H_s$ is the Hubble constant during the string phase and $\gamma$ is a constant which is determined by an algebraic equation involving all orders in the string coupling $\alpha '$. The seed for the perturbations can be provided by massive string modes.
