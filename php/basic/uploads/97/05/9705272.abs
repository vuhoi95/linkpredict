Title: Probing mu-term Generation Mechanism in String Models
Authors: Yoshiharu Kawamura and Tatsuo Kobayashi and Manabu Watanabe
Abstract: We give a generic method to select a realistic $\mu$-term generation mechanism based on the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking scenario and study which type is hopeful within the framework of string theory. We discuss effects of the moduli F-term condensation and D-term contribution to soft scalar masses.
