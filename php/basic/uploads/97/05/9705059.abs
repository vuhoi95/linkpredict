Title: Radiation Damping of a BPS Monopole; an Implication to S-duality
Authors: Dongsu Bak and Hyunsoo Min
Abstract: The radiation reaction of a BPS monopole in the presence of incident electromagnetic waves as well as massless Higgs waves is analyzed classically. The reactive forces are compared to those of $W$ boson that is interpreted as a dual partner of the BPS monopole. It is shown that the damping of acceleration is dual to each other, while in the case of finite size effects the duality is broken explicitly. Their implications on the duality are discussed.
