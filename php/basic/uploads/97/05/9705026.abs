Title: Real Time Correlators in Hot (2+1)d QCD
Authors: T. H. Hansson and J. Wirstam and I. Zahed
Abstract: We use dimensional reduction techniques to relate real time finite T correlation functions in (2+1) dimensional QCD to bound state parameters in a generalized 't Hooft model with an infinite number of heavy quark and adjoint scalar fields. While static susceptibilities and correlation functions of the DeTar type can be calculated using only the light (static) gluonic modes, the dynamical correlators require the inclusion of the heavy modes. In particular we demonstrate that the leading T perturbative result can be understood in terms of the bound states of the 2d model and that consistency requires bound state trajectories composed of both quarks and adjoint scalars. We also propose a non-perturbative expression for the dynamical DeTar correlators at small spatial momenta.
