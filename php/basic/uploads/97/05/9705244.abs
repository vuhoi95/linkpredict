Title: CP Violation By Soft Supersymmetry Breaking Terms in Orbifold  Compactifications
Authors: D. Bailin and G. V. Kraniotis and A. Love
Abstract: The possibility of spontaneous breaking of CP symmetry by the expectation values of orbifold moduli is investigated with particular reference to $CP$ violating phases in soft supersymmetry breaking terms. The effect of different mechanisms for stabilizing the dilaton and the form of the non-perturbative superpotential on the existence and size of these phases is studied. Non-perturbative superpotentials involving the absolute modular invariant $j(T)$, such as may arise from F-theory compactifications, are considered.
