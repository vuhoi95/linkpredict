Title: Analytic Solution of the Pion-Laser Model
Authors: T. Csorgo and J. Zimanyi
Abstract: Brooding over bosons, wave packets and Bose - Einstein correlations, we find that a generalization of the pion-laser model for the case of overlapping wave-packets is analytically solvable with complete n-particle symmetrization. The effective radius parameter of the two-particle correlation function is reduced for low values and enlargened for high values of the mean momentum in the rare gas limiting case, as compared to the case when multi-particle symmetrization effects are neglected. These results explicitly depend on the multiplicity, providing a theoretical basis for event-by-event analysis of high energy heavy ion reactions.
