Title: A Non-Perturbative Approach to the Random-Bond Ising Model
Authors: D. C. Cabra and A. Honecker and G. Mussardo and P. Pujol
Abstract: We study the N -> 0 limit of the O(N) Gross-Neveu model in the framework of the massless form-factor approach. This model is related to the continuum limit of the Ising model with random bonds via the replica method. We discuss how this method may be useful in calculating correlation functions of physical operators. The identification of non-perturbative fixed points of the O(N) Gross-Neveu model is pursued by its mapping to a WZW model.
