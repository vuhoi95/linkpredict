Title: Possible quantum obstructions to the process of Abelian conversion
Authors: Ricardo Amorim and Ronaldo Thibes
Abstract: The procedure for Abelian conversion of second class constraints due to Batalin, Fradkin, Fradkina and Tyutin is considered at quantum level, by using the field-antifield formalism. It is argued that quantum effects can obstruct the process. In this case, Wess-Zumino fields may be introduced in order to restore the lost symmetries.
