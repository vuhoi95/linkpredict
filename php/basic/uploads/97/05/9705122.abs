Title: Duality for the Non-Specialist
Authors: S. E. Hjelmeland and U. Lindstr√∂m
Abstract: This is the written version of a series of lectures reviewing the basics of duality as applied to p-forms and sigma-models. The ideas are introduced by way of worked examples, often quite detailed. Our approach is very pedestrian and the presentation is aimed at non-specialists, such as e.g. graduate students.
