Authors: G. Grignani and L. Paniak and G. W. Semenoff and P. Sodano
Abstract: Explicit computations of the partition function and correlation functions of Wilson and Polyakov loop operators in theta-sectors of two dimensional Yang-Mills theory on the line cylinder and torus are presented. Several observations about the correspondence of two dimensional Yang-Mills theory with unitary matrix quantum mechanics are presented. The incorporation of the theta-angle which characterizes the states of two dimensional adjoint QCD is discussed.
