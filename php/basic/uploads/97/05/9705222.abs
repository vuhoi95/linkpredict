Title: Universal Short-time Behaviour of the Dynamic Fully Frustrated XY Model
Authors: H. J. Luo and L. Schuelke and B. Zheng
Abstract: With Monte Carlo methods we investigate the dynamic relaxation of the fully frustrated XY model in two dimensions below or at the Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition temperature. Special attention is drawn to the sublattice structure of the dynamic evolution. Short-time scaling behaviour is found and universality is confirmed. The critical exponent $\theta$ is measured for different temperature and with different algorithms.
