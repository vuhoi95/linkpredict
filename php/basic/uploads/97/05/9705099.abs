Title: Correlation between momentum modes and winding modes in  Brandenberger-Vafa's string cosmological model
Authors: Kenji Hotta and Keiji Kikkawa and Hiroshi Kunitomo
Abstract: Brandenberger and Vafa have proposed the string cosmological model based on T-duality. In this model, they took the toroidal target space and introduced the new position \tilde{x} conjugate to the winding mode, in addition to the position x conjugate to the momentum mode. In this way they can describe a universe larger than the string scale with the coordinate x and one smaller with the coordinate \tilde{x}. Resultingly, they never encounter the singularity seen in the standard Big Bang scenario. The most interesting phenomenon in this model is the transition from \tilde{x}-space to x-space when the size of universe is nearly the string scale. Here, we define the dispersion of the momentum number m times the winding number w as the `correlation' of momentum modes and winding modes. Then using the statistical mechanics of strings on a torus, we calculate the correlation in low and high temperature limits, and we consider the possibility that we can observe this effect today, but we will see that this is unlikely.
