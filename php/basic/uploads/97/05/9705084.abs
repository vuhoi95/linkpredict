Title: Creation of Fundamental Strings by Crossing D-branes
Authors: U. H. Danielsson and G. Ferretti and I. R. Klebanov
Abstract: We study the force balance between orthogonally positioned $p$-brane and $(8-p)$-brane. The force due to graviton and dilaton exchange is repulsive in this case. We identify the attractive force that balances this repulsion as due to one-half of a fundamental string stretched between the branes. As the $p$-brane passes through the $(8-p)$-brane, the connecting string changes direction, which may be interpreted as creation of one fundamental string. We show this directly from the structure of the Chern-Simons terms in the D-brane effective actions. We also discuss the effect of string creation on the 0-brane quantum mechanics in the type I' theory. The creation of a fundamental string is related by U-duality to the creation of a 3-brane discussed by Hanany and Witten. Both processes have a common origin in M-theory: as two M5-branes with one common direction cross, a M2-brane stretched between them is created.
