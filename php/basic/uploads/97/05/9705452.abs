Title: Classical Statistical Mechanics and Landau Damping
Authors: W. Buchmuller and A. Jakovac
Abstract: We study the retarded response function in scalar $\phi^4$-theory at finite temperature. We find that in the high-temperature limit the imaginary part of the self-energy is given by the classical theory to leading order in the coupling. In particular the plasmon damping rate is a purely classical effect to leading order, as shown by Aarts and Smit. The dominant contribution to Landau damping is given by the propagation of classical fields in a heat bath of non-interacting fields.
