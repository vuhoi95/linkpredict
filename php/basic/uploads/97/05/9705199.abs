Title: N=2 Supersymmetric Gauge Theories, Branes and Orientifolds
Authors: Karl Landsteiner and Esperanza Lopez and David A. Lowe
Abstract: Starting with configurations of fourbranes, fivebranes, sixbranes and orientifolds in Type IIA string theory we derive via M-theory the curves solving N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories with gauge groups SO(N) and Sp(2N). We also obtain new curves describing theories with product gauge groups. A crucial role in the discussion is played by the interaction of the orientifolds with the NS-fivebranes.
