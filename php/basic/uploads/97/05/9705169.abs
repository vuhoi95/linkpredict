Title: Stationary solutions of N=2 supergravity
Authors: Klaus Behrndt and Dieter Lust and Wafic. A. Sabra
Abstract: We discuss general bosonic stationary configurations of N=2, D=4 supergravity coupled to vector multiplets. The requirement of unbroken supersymmetries imposes constraints on the holomorphic symplectic section of the underlying special K\"ahler manifold. The corresponding solutions of the field equations are completely determined by a set of harmonic functions. As examples we discuss rotating black holes, Taub-NUT and Eguchi-Hanson like instantons for the STU model. In addition, we discuss, in the static limit, worldsheet instanton corrections to the STU black hole solution, in the neighbourhood of a vanishing 4-cycle of the Calabi-Yau manifold. Our procedure is quite general and includes all known black hole solutions that can be embedded into N=2 supergravity.
