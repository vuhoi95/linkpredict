Title: Exact solutions in two-dimensional string cosmology with back reaction
Authors: Sukanta Bose and Sayan Kar
Abstract: We present analytic cosmological solutions in a model of two-dimensional dilaton gravity with back reaction. One of these solutions exhibits a graceful exit from the inflationary to the FRW phase and is nonsingular everywhere. A duality related second solution is found to exist only in the ``pre-big-bang'' epoch and is singular at $\tau = 0$. In either case back reaction is shown to play a crucial role in determining the specific nature of these geometries.
