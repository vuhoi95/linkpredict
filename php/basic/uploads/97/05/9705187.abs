Title: Simplified Calculation of Boundary S Matrices
Authors: Anastasia Doikou and Luca Mezincescu and Rafael I. Nepomechie
Abstract: The antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin chain with N spins has a sector with N=odd, in which the number of excitations is odd. In particular, there is a state with a single one-particle excitation. We exploit this fact to give a simplified derivation of the boundary S matrix for the open antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 Heisenberg spin chain with diagonal boundary magnetic fields.
