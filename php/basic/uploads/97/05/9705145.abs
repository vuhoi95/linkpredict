Title: Canonical Equivalence of a Generic 2D Dilaton Gravity Model and a  Bosonic String Theory
Authors: J. Cruz and J. Navarro-Salas
Abstract: We show that a canonical tranformation converts, up to a boundary term, a generic 2d dilaton gravity model into a bosonic string theory with a Minkowskian target space.
