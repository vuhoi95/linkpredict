Title: String Dualities from Matrix Theory
Authors: Micha Berkooz and Moshe Rozali
Abstract: We suggest that the (2,0) six dimensional field theory compactified on $S^1\times K3$ is the Matrix model description of both M-theory on $K3$ and the Heterotic string on $T^3$. This proposal is different from existing proposals for the Heterotic theory. Different limits of the base space geometry give the different space-time interpretations, making M-theory/Heterotic duality manifest. We also present partial results on Heterotic/F-theory duality.
