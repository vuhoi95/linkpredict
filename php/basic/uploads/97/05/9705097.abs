Title: Extended conformal symmetry of the one-dimensional Bose gas
Authors: M. Maule and S. Sciuto
Abstract: We show that the low-lying excitations of the one-dimensional Bose gas are described, at all orders in a 1/N expansion and at the first order in the inverse of the coupling constant, by an effective hamiltonian written in terms of an extended conformal algebra, namely the Cartan subalgebra of the $W_{1+\infty}\times \bar{W}_{1+\infty}$ algebra. This enables us to construct the first interaction term which corrects the hamiltonian of free fermions equivalent to a hard-core boson system.
