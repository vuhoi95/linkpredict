Title: Point-like Instantons on K3 Orbifolds
Authors: Paul S. Aspinwall and David R. Morrison
Abstract: The map between the moduli space of F-theory (or type II string) compactifications and heterotic string compactifications can be considerably simplified by using "stable degenerations". We discuss how this method applies to both the E8 x E8 and the Spin(32)/Z2 heterotic string. As a simple application of this method we derive some basic properties of the nonperturbative physics of collections of E8 or Spin(32)/Z2 point-like instantons sitting at A-D-E singularities on a K3 surface.
