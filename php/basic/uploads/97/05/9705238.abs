Title: Calabi-Yau manifolds constructed by Borcea-Voisin method
Authors: Mitsuko Abe and Masamichi Sato
Abstract: We construct Calabi-Yau manifolds and their mirrors from K3 surfaces. This method was first developed by Borcea and Voisin. We examined their properties torically and checked mirror symmetry for Calabi-Yau 4-fold case. From Borcea-Voisin 3-fold or 4-fold examples, it may be possible to probe the S-duality of Seiberg -Witten.
