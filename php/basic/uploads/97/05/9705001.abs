Title: Hamiltonian structure and coset construction of the supersymmetric  extensions of N=2 KdV hierarchy
Authors: L. Bonora and S. Krivonos
Abstract: A manifestly N=2 supersymmetric coset formalism is applied to analyse the "fermionic" extensions of N=2 $a=4$ and $a=-2$ KdV hierarchies. Both these hierarchies can be obtained from a manifest N=2 coset construction. This coset is defined as the quotient of some local but non-linear superalgebra by a $\hat{U(1)}$ subalgebra. Three superextensions of N=2 KdV hierarchy are proposed, among which one seems to be entirely new.
