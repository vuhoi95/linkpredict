Title: Flavor from Strongly Coupled Supersymmetry
Authors: David B. Kaplan and Francois Lepeintre and Martin Schmaltz
Abstract: Strongly coupled supersymmetric theories can give rise to composite quarks and leptons at low energy. We show that the internal structure of these particles can explain the origin of three generations and provide a qualitative understanding of mass ratios and mixing angles between the different flavors of fermions, all within a renormalizable theory. The main point of the paper is to show how fermion masses and mixing angles can result from a ``dual'' Frogatt-Nielsen mechanism: fields neutral under $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ which carry flavor quantum numbers are confined within quarks and leptons, and from their perturbative interactions arises the observed flavor structure.
