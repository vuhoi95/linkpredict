Abstract: In the 3-family grand unified string models constructed so far, there is only one adjoint (and no higher dimensional representation) Higgs field in the grand unified gauge group. In this preliminary analysis, we address the proton-decay problem in the 3-family E_6 and related SO(10) string models. In particular, we analyze the doublet-triplet splitting (within certain assumptions about non-perturbative dynamics). It appears that generically some fine-tuning is necessary to arrange for a pair of Higgs doublets to be light, while having color Higgs triplets superheavy. We also discuss charge-2/3 quark mass matrix that generically also seems to require some fine-tuning to have rank 1.
