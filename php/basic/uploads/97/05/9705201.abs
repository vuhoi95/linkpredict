Title: The topology of multi-coupling deformations of CFT
Authors: Ulf Lindstrom and Maxim Zabzine
Abstract: We discuss the topological properties of the manifold of coupling constants for multi-coupling deformations of conformal field theories. We calculate the Euler and Betti numbers and briefly discuss physical applications of these results.
