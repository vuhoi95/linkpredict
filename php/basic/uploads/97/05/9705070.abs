Abstract: We perform the dimensional reduction of the linear $\sigma$ model at one-loop level. The effective potential of the reduced theory obtained from the integration over the nonzero Matsubara frequencies is exhibited. Thermal mass and coupling constant renormalization constants are given, as well as the thermal renormalization group equation which controls the dependence of the counterterms on the temperature. We also recover, for the reduced theory, the vacuum unstability of the model for large N.
