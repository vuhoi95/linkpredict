Title: Gauging the nonlinear sigma-model through a non-Abelian algebra
Authors: J. Barcelos-Neto and W. Oliveira
Abstract: We use an extension of the method due to Batalin, Fradkin, Fradkina, and Tyutin (BFFT) for transforming the nonlinear $\sigma$ model in a non-Abelian gauge theory. We deal with both supersymmetric and nonsupersymmetric cases. The bosonic case was already considered in literature but just gauged with an Abelian algebra. We show that the supersymmetric version is only compatible with a non-Abelian gauge theory. The usual BFFT method for this case leads to a nonlocal algebra.
