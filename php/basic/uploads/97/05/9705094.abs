Title: Transformation of Black-Hole Hair under Duality and Supersymmetry
Authors: Enrique Alvarez and Patrick Meessen and Tomas Ortin
Abstract: We study the transformation under the String Theory duality group of the observable charges (mass, angular momentum, NUT charge, electric, magnetic and different scalar charges) of four dimensional point-like objects whose asymptotic behavior constitutes a subclass closed under duality. The charges fall into two complex four-dimensional representations of the duality group. T duality (including Buscher's) has an O(1,2) action on them and S duality a U(1) action. The generalized Bogomol'nyi bound is an U(2,2)-invariant built out of one representations while the other representation (which includes the angular momentum) never appears in it. The bound is manifestly duality-invariant. Consistency between T duality and supersymmetry requires that primary scalar hair is included in the Bogomol'nyi bound. Four-dimensional supersymmetric massless black holes are the T duals in time of massive supersymmetric black holes. Non-extreme massless ``black holes'' are the T duals of the non-extreme black holes and have primary scalar hair and naked singularities.
