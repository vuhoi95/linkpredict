Title: Superbrane Actions and Geometrical Approach
Authors: Igor Bandos and Paolo Pasti and Dmitri Sorokin and Mario Tonin
Abstract: We review a generic structure of conventional (Nambu-Goto and Dirac-Born-Infeld-like) worldvolume actions for the superbranes and show how it is connected through a generalized action construction with a doubly supersymmetric geometrical approach to the description of super-p-brane dynamics as embedding world supersurfaces into target superspaces.
