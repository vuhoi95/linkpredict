Title: Five Dimensional U-Duality, Black-Hole Entropy and Topological  Invariants
Authors: L. Andrianopoli and R. D'Auria and S. Ferrara
Abstract: We find the topological entropy formula for all $N>2$ extended supergravities in five dimensions and the fixed scalar condition for the black-hole ``potential energy'' which extremizes the BPS mass. We comment upon the interpretation of these results in a string and M-theory setting.
