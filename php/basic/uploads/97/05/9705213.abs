Title: Electroweak Monopoles
Authors: Y. M. Cho and Kyoungtae Kimm
Abstract: We present finite energy analytic monopole and dyon solutions whose size is fixed by the electroweak scale. Our result shows that genuine electroweak monopole and dyon could exist whose mass scale is much smaller than the grand unification scale.
