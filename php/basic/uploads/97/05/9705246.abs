Title: Vortex-Antivortex Pair Production in a First Order Phase Transition
Authors: Sanatan Digal and Supratim Sengupta and Ajit M. Srivastava
Abstract: We carry out numerical simulation of a first order phase transition in 2+1 dimensions by randomly nucleating bubbles, and study the formation of global U(1) vortices. Bubbles grow and coalesce and vortices are formed at junctions of bubbles via standard Kibble mechanism as well as due to a new mechanism, recently proposed by us, where defect-antidefect pairs are produced due to field oscillations. We make a comparative study of the contribution of both of these mechanisms for vortex production. We find that, for high nucleation rate of bubbles, vortex-antivortex pairs produced via the new mechanism have overlapping configurations, and annihilate quickly; so only those vortices survive till late which are produced via the Kibble mechanism. However, for low nucleation rates, bubble collisions are energetic enough to lead to many well separated vortex-antivortex pairs being produced via the new mechanism. For example, in a simulation involving nucleation of 20 bubbles, a total of 14 non-overlapping vortices and antivortices formed via this new mechanism of pair creation (6 of them being very well separated), as compared to 6 vortices and antivortices produced via the Kibble mechanism. Our results show the possibility that in extremely energetic bubble collisions, such as those in the inflationary models of the early Universe, this new mechanism may drastically affect the defect production scenario.
