Title: Aspects of Superembeddings
Authors: P. S. Howe and E. Sezgin and P. C. West
Abstract: Some aspects of the geometry of superembeddings and its application to supersymmetric extended objects are discussed. In particular, the embeddings of (3|16) and (6|16) dimensional superspaces into (11|32) dimensional superspace, corresponding to supermembranes and superfivebranes in eleven dimensions, are treated in some detail.
