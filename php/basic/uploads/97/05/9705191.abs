Title: On calculation of the off-shell renormalization functions in the R^2  gravity
Authors: M. Yu. Kalmykov and D. I. Kazakov
Abstract: A new way how to calculate the off-shell renormalization functions within the $R^2$-gravity has been proposed. The one-loop renormalization group equations in the approach suggested have been constructed. The behaviour of effective potential for an massless scalar field interacting with the quantum gravitational field has been analyzed in this approach.
