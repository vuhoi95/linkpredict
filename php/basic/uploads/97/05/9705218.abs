Abstract: Dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (D$\chi$SB) is studied in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model for an arbitrary combination of external constant electric and magnetic fields. In 3+1 dimensions it is shown that the critical coupling constant increases with increasing of the value of the second invariant of electromagentic field $\vec{E}\cdot\vec{B}$, i.e. the second invariant inhibits $D\chi SB$. The case of 2+1 dimensions is simpler because there is only one Lorentz invariant of electromagnetic field and any combination of constant fields can be reduced to cases either purely magnetic or purely electric field.
