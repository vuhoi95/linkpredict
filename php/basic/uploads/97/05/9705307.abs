Title: Dynamical Soft Terms with Unbroken Supersymmetry
Authors: Savas Dimopoulos and Gia Dvali and Riccardo Rattazzi and Gian Giudice
Abstract: We construct a class of simple and calculable theories for the supersymmetry breaking soft terms. They are based on quantum modified moduli spaces. These theories do not break supersymmetry in their ground state; instead we postulate that we live in a supersymmetry breaking plateau of false vacua. We demonstrate that tunneling from the plateau to the supersymmetric ground state is highly supressed. At one loop, the plateau develops a local minimum which can be anywhere between $10^8$ GeV and the grand unification scale. The value of this minimum is the mass of the messengers of supersymmetry breaking. Primordial element abundances indicate that the messengers' mass is smaller than $10^{12}$ GeV.
