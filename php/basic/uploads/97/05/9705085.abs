Title: A Remark on the Effective Description of Topological Defects
Authors: Jordi Paris and Jaume Roca
Abstract: We subject the methodology used to derive the effective dynamics of topological defects to a critical reappraisal, using the two-dimensional kink as an illustrative example. Special care is taken on how the zero modes should be handled in order to avoid overcounting of degrees of freedom. This is an issue that has been overlooked in many recent contributions on the derivation of domain wall effective actions. We show that, unless such redundancy is completely removed by means of a sort of gauge-fixing, the expression obtained for the effective action will not be consistent. We readdress some earlier calculations over the existence of curvature corrections in the light of the previous discussion and briefly comment on the application of this method to higher dimensional topological defects.
