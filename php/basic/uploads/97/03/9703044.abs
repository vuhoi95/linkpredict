Title: Exactly solvable charged dilaton gravity theories in two dimensions
Authors: Youngjai Kiem and Chang-Yeong Lee and Dahl Park
Abstract: We find exactly solvable dilaton gravity theories containing a U(1) gauge field in two dimensional space-time. The classical general solutions for the gravity sector (the metric plus the dilaton field) of the theories coupled to a massless complex scalar field are obtained in terms of the stress-energy tensor and the U(1) current of the scalar field. We discuss issues that arise when we attempt to use these models for the study of the gravitational back-reaction.
