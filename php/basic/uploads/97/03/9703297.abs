Title: T-Duality Considerations for Hadronic Strings
Authors: James A. Feigenbaum and Peter G. O. Freund and Mircea Pigli
Abstract: We show that a simple account of hadronic high energy total cross-sections and of the observed masses and flavor-gauge-like couplings of the familiar vector mesons is obtained in a hadronic string model suggested by QCD in the limit of a large number of colors. Our picture involves a Minkowski space which in addition to the well established continuous one time and three space dimensions is endowed with an extra discrete space dimension involving a minimal 2-point lattice with spacing of order 10^{-14} cm in one of the two T-dual pictures. New mesonic states with characteristic decay modes are expected in such a picture.
