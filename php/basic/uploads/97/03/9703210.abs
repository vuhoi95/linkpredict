Title: Orientifolds, Branes, and Duality of 4D Gauge Theories
Authors: Nick Evans and Clifford V. Johnson and Alfred D. Shapere
Abstract: Recently, a D-brane construction in type IIA string theory was shown to yield the electric/magnetic duality of four dimensional N=1 supersymmetric U(N_c) gauge theories with N_f flavours of quark. We present here an extension of that construction which yields the electric/magnetic duality for the SO(N_c) and USp(N_c) gauge theories with N_f quarks, by adding an orientifold plane which is consistent with the supersymmetry. Due to the intersection of the orientifold plane with the NS-NS fivebranes already present, new features arise which are crucial in determining the correct final structure of the dualities.
