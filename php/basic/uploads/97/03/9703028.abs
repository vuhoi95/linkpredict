Authors: I. I. Kogan and A. Lewis and O. A. Soloviev
Abstract: We study correlation functions of coset constructions by utilizing the method of gauge dressing. As an example we apply this method to the minimal models and to the Witten 2D black hole. We exhibit a striking similarity between the latter and the gravitational dressing. In particular, we look for logarithmic operators in the 2D black hole.
