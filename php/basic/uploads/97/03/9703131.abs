Title: Cross-Confinement in Multi-Chern-Simons Theories
Authors: Lorenzo Cornalba and Frank Wilczek
Abstract: We identify a class of 2+1 dimensional models, involving multiple Chern-Simons gauge fields, in which a form of classical confinement occurs. This confinement is not cumulative, but allows finite mass combinations of individually confined objects, as in baryons. The occurrence and nature of the phenomena depends on number theoretic properties of the couplings and charges.
