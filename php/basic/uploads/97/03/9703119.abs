Title: On Hamiltonian structure of the spin Ruijsenaars-Schneider model
Authors: G. E. Arutyunov and S. A. Frolov
Abstract: The Hamiltonian structure of spin generalization of the rational Ruijsenaars-Schneider model is found by using the Hamiltonian reduction technique. It is shown that the model possesses the current algebra symmetry. The possibility of generalizing the found Poisson structure to the trigonometric case is discussed and degeneration to the Euler-Calogero-Moser system is examined.
