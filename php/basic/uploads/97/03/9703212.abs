Title: A 1D Model for N-level Atoms Coupled to an EM Field
Authors: Z. S. Bassi and A. LeClair
Abstract: We construct a model for n-level atoms coupled to quantized electromagnetic fields in a fibrillar geometry. In the slowly varying envelope and rotating wave approximations, the equations of motion are shown to satisfy a zero curvature representation, implying integrability of the quantum system.
