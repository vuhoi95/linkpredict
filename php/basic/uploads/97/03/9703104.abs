Title: A linear realization for the new space-time superalgebras in ten and  eleven dimensions
Authors: A. A. Deriglazov and A. V. Galajinsky
Abstract: The new extensions of the Poincar\'e superalgebra recently found in ten and eleven dimensions are shown to admit a linear realization. The generators of the nonlinear and linear group transformations are shown to fall into equivalent representations of the superalgebra. The parametrization of the coset space $G/H$, with $G$ a given extended supergroup and $H$ the Lorentz subgroup, that corresponds to the linear transformations is presented.
