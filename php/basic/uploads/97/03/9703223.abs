Title: Solitons in Chern-Simons theories of nonrelativistic CP^{N-1} models:  Spin textures in the quantum Hall effect
Authors: Ikuo Ichinose and Akira Sekiguchi
Abstract: Topological solitons in CP^{N-1} models coupled with Chern-Simons gauge theory and a Hopf term are studied both analytically and numerically.These models are low-energy effective theories for the quantum Hall effect with internal degrees of freedom, like that in bilayer electron systems. We explicitly show that the CP^{N-1} models describe quite well spin textures in the original Chern-Simons theory of bosonized electrons.
