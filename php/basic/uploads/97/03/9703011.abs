Title: Non-standard Construction of Hamiltonian Structures
Authors: Andres Gomberoff and Sergio A. Hojman
Abstract: Examples of the construction of Hamiltonian structures for dynamical systems in field theory (including one reputedly non-Hamiltonian problem) without using Lagrangians, are presented. The recently developed method used requires the knowledge of one constant of the motion of the system under consideration and one solution of the symmetry equation.
