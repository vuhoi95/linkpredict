Title: T-Duality and Time development of a (2+1)-Dimensional String Universe
Authors: Kenji Hotta and Keiji Kikkawa and Michihiko Sakamoto
Abstract: The time development of a model of (2+1)-dimensional torus universe is studied based on background field equations which follow from a string theory. The metrics in various cases are characterized by a real parameter which specifies a ratio of the lengths of two independent cycles. When the parameter is a rational number, the space is asymptotically stretched along a cycle while the other cycle kept finite. When the parameter is an irrational number, the lengths of two cycles, as well as the space volume (area), grow in proportion to the proper time $t$ for an observer sitting at rest in this universe in the asymptotic region.
