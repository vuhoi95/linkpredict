Title: Bosonic Super Liouville System: Lax Pair and Solution
Authors: Liu Zhao and Changzheng Qu
Abstract: We study the bosonic super Liouville system which is a statistical transmutation of super Liouville system. Lax pair for the bosonic super Liouville system is constructed using prolongation method, ensuring the Lax integrability, and the solution to the equations of motion is also considered via Leznov-Saveliev analysis.
