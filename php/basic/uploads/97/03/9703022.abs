Title: Exact Operator Solution for Liouville Theory with $q$ A Root of Unity
Authors: T. Fujiwara and H. Igarashi and Y. Takimoto
Abstract: The exact operator solution for quantum Liouville theory constructed for the generic quantum deformation parameter $q$ is extended to the case with $q$ being a root of unity. The screening charge operator becomes nilpotent in such cases and arbitrary Liouville exponentials can be obtained in finite polynomials of the screening charge.
