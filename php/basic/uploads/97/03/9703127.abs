Abstract: We show that the field equations for the supercoordinates and the self--dual antisymmetric tensor field derived from the recently constructed kappa-invariant action for the M theory five-brane are equivalent to the equations of motion obtained in the doubly supersymmetric geometrical approach at the worldvolume component level.
