Title: U(2)-chiral symmetries of supersymmetric QED3
Authors: M. L. Walker and C. J. Burden
Abstract: Supersymmetry is studied in 2+1 dimensions. In addition to the multiplets corresponding to those in 3+1 dimensions the Clifford algebra allows an extra set. When the extra chiral multiplet is included, formulating supersymmetric QED3 in the manner of Wess and Zumino yields a lagrangian with a richer 'chiral' symmetry than that derived from supersymmetric QED by dimensional reduction.
