Title: Hamiltonians for Reduced Gravity
Authors: James D. E. Grant and Ian G. Moss
Abstract: A generalised canonical formulation of gravity is devised for foliations of spacetime with codimension $n\ge1$. The new formalism retains n-dimensional covariance and is especially suited to 2+2 decompositions of spacetime. It is also possible to use the generalised formalism to obtain boundary contributions to the 3+1 Hamiltonian.
