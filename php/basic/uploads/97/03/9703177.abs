Title: Loop Quantization of Maxwell Theory and Electric Charge Quantization
Authors: Alejandro Corichi and Kirill Krasnov
Abstract: We consider the loop quantization of Maxwell theory. A quantization of this type leads to a quantum theory in which the fundamental excitations are loop-like rather than particle-like. Each such loop plays the role of a quantized Faraday's line of electric flux. We find that the quantization depends on an arbitrary choice of a parameter e that carries the dimension of electric charge. For each value of e an electric charge that can be contained inside a bounded spatial region is automatically quantized in units of hbar/4*pi*e. The requirement of consistency with the quantization of electric charge observed in our Universe fixes a value of the, so far arbitrary, parameter e of the theory. Finally, we compare the ambiguity in the choice of parameter e with the beta-ambiguity that, as pointed by Immirzi, arises in the loop quantization of general relativity, and comment on a possible way this ambiguity can be fixed.
