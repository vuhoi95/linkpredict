Title: Covariant field theory for self-dual strings
Authors: N. Berkovits and W. Siegel
Abstract: We give a gauge and manifestly SO(2,2) covariant formulation of the field theory of the self-dual string. The string fields are gauge connections that turn the super-Virasoro generators into covariant derivatives.
