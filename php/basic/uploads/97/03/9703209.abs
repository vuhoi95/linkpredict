Title: Hybrid Inflation in Supergravity
Authors: Andrei Linde and Antonio Riotto
Abstract: We propose a simple realization of hybrid inflation in supergravity, which does not require any unnaturally small parameters. Inflation in this scenario is relatively short, and inflationary density perturbations fall down on large scales, which corresponds to a blue spectrum with n > 1. Superheavy strings which are formed after inflation in this scenario produce density perturbations of comparable magnitude. In this mixed perturbation (MP) model one may have microwave anisotropy produced by strings and galaxy formation due to inflationary perturbations.
