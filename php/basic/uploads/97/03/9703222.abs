Title: N=2 Super-Conformal Filed Theory on the Basis of osp(2|2)
Authors: A. Shafiekhani and W. -S. Chung
Abstract: Using a unified and systematic scheme, the free field realization of irreducible representations of osp(2|2) is constructed. By using these realization, the correlation functions of N=2 super-conformal model based on osp(2|2) symmetry and free field representation of ${\hat{osp(2|2)}}$ generators are calculated. Free field representation of currents are used to determine the stress-energy tensor and the central charge of the model.
