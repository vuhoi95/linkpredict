Title: What is Special KÃ¤hler Geometry ?
Authors: B. Craps and F. Roose and W. Troost and A. Van Proeyen
Abstract: The scalars in vector multiplets of N=2 supersymmetric theories in 4 dimensions exhibit `special Kaehler geometry', related to duality symmetries, due to their coupling to the vectors. In the literature there is some confusion on the definition of special geometry. We show equivalences of some definitions and give examples which show that earlier definitions are not equivalent, and are not sufficient to restrict the Kaehler metric to one that occurs in N=2 supersymmetry. We treat the rigid as well as the local supersymmetry case. The connection is made to moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces and Calabi-Yau 3-folds. The conditions for the existence of a prepotential translate to a condition on the choice of canonical basis of cycles.
