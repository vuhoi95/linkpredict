Title: Instructive Properties of Quantized Gravitating Dust Shell
Authors: A. D. Dolgov and I. B. Khriplovich
Abstract: We investigate quantum dynamics of self-gravitating spherical dust shell. The wave functions of discrete spectrum are not localized inside the Schwarzschild radius. We argue that such shells can transform into white holes (in another space). It is plausible that shells with bare masses larger than the Planck mass loose their mass emitting lighter shells.
