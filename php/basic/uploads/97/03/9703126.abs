Authors: Heng Fan and Bo-yu Hou and Kang-jie Shi and Wen-li Yang
Abstract: Based on the bosonization of vertex operators for $A_{n-1}^{(1)}$ face model by Asai,Jimbo, Miwa and Pugai, using vertex-face correspondence we obtain vertex operators for Zn symmetric Belavin model,which are constructed by deformed boson oscilllators. The correlation functions are also obtained.
