Title: Quantization of the complex linear superfield
Authors: M. Grisaru and A. Van Proeyen and D. Zanon
Abstract: The quantization of the complex linear superfield requires an infinite tower of ghosts. We use the Batalin-Vilkovisky method to obtain a gauge-fixed action. In superspace, the method brings in some novel features.
