Title: N=2 Supersymmetric Gauged O(3) Sigma Model
Authors: Kyoungtae Kimm and Bukyung Sul
Abstract: We discuss the N=2 supersymmetric extension of the gauged O(3) sigma model in (2+1) dimensions with an abelian Chern-Simons term. It is shown that the self-dual potential and the Bogomolny relations naturally appear as consequences of extended supersymmetry.
