Title: Real forms of nonlinear superconformal and quasi-superconformal algebras  and their unified realization
Authors: Behzad Bina and Murat Gunaydin
Abstract: We give a complete classification of the real forms of simple nonlinear superconformal algebras (SCA) and quasi-superconformal algebras (QSCA) and present a unified realization of these algebras with simple symmetry groups. This classification is achieved by establishing a correspondence between simple nonlinear QSCA's and SCA's and quaternionic and super-quaternionic symmetric spaces of simple Lie groups and Lie supergroups, respectively. The unified realization involves a dimension zero boson (dilaton), dimension one symmetry currents and dimension 1/2 free bosons for QSCA'a and dimension 1/2 free fermions for SCA's. The dimension 1/2 free bosons and fermions are associated with the quaternionic and super-quaternionic symmetric spaces of corresponding Lie groups and Lie supergroups, respectively. We conclude with a discussion of possible applications of our results.
