Title: Green Function on the q-Symmetric Space SU_q(2)/U(1)
Authors: H. Ahmedov and I. H. Duru
Abstract: Following the introduction of the invariant distance on the non-commutative C-algebra of the quantum group SU_q(2), the Green function and the Kernel on the q-homogeneous space M=SU(2)_q/U(1) are derived. A path integration is formulated. Green function for the free massive scalar field on the non-commutative Einstein space R^1xM is presented.
