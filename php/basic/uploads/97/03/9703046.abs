Title: The massive spinning particle revisited
Authors: F. Delduc and E. Ivanov and E. Sokatchev
Abstract: We propose a formulation of the massive spinning particle in terms of physical bosonic and fermionic fields only. We make use neither of auxiliary objects of the type of $\gamma_5$ nor of gauge fields. The model is to be used as a suitable starting point for a forthcoming study of the rigid superparticle.
