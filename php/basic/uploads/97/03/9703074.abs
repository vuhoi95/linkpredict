Title: Mesons in 2-Dimensional QCD on the Light Cone
Authors: O. Abe and G. Aubrecht and K. Tanaka
Abstract: Two dimensional QCD is quantized on the light front coordinate. We solve the Einstein-Schr\"odinger equation by the use of Tamm-Dancoff truncation and find that the simplest wavefunction produces the $M/g$ versus $m/g$ relation in agreement with other calculations, where $M$ and $m$ are the masses of the ground state and quarks, respectively.
