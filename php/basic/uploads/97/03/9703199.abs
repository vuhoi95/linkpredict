Title: Second Class Constraints in a Higher-Order Lagrangian Formalism
Authors: I. A. Batalin and K. Bering and P. H. Damgaard
Abstract: We consider the description of second-class constraints in a Lagrangian path integral associated with a higher-order $\Delta$-operator. Based on two conjugate higher-order $\Delta$-operators, we also propose a Lagrangian path integral with $Sp(2)$ symmetry, and describe the corresponding system in the presence of second-class constraints.
