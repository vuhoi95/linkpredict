Title: A note on T^5/Z_2 compactification of the M-theory matrix model
Authors: Ansar Fayyazuddin and Douglas J. Smith
Abstract: We study the T^5/Z_2 orbifold compactification of the M-theory matrix model. This model was originally studied by Dasgupta, Mukhi, and Witten. It was found that one had to add 16 5-branes to the system to make the compactification consistent. We demonstrate how this is mimicked in the matrix model.
