Title: Multiflavor Massive Schwinger Model With Non-Abelian Bosonization
Authors: David Delphenich and Joseph Schechter
Abstract: We revisit the treatment of the multiflavor massive Schwinger model by non-Abelian Bosonization. We compare three different approximations to the low-lying spectrum: i) reading it off from the bosonized Lagrangian (neglecting interactions), ii) semi-classical quantization of the static soliton, iii) approximate semi-classical quantization of the ``breather'' solitons. A number of new points are made in this process. We also suggest a different ``effective low-energy Lagrangian'' for the theory which permits easy calculation of the low-energy scattering amplitudes. It correlates an exact mass formula of the system with the requirement of the Mermin-Wagner theorem.
