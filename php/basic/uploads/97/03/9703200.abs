Title: The Low Energy Limit of the Chern-Simons Theory Coupled to Fermions

Abstract: We study the nonrelativistic limit of the theory of a quantum Chern--Simons field minimally coupled to Dirac fermions. To get the nonrelativistic effective Lagrangian one has to incorporate vacuum polarization and anomalous magnetic moment effects. Besides that, an unsuspected quartic fermionic interaction may also be induced. As a by product, the method we use to calculate loop diagrams, separating low and high loop momenta contributions, allows to identify how a quantum nonrelativistic theory nests in a relativistic one.
