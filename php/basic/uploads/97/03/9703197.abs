Title: Controlled Soft Breaking of N=1 SQCD
Authors: Nick Evans and Stephen Hsu and Myckola Schwetz
Abstract: We discuss the introduction of soft breaking terms into the exact solutions of N=1 SQCD using a spurion analysis. The spurion symmetries are not sufficient to determine the behavior of models in which squark or gaugino masses alone are introduced. However, a controlled approximation is obtained in some cases if a supersymmetric mass is first introduced for the matter fields. We present low-energy solutions for two models with perturbing soft breaking terms, one with a gaugino mass and one with squark mixing. These models have non-trivial theta angle dependence and exhibit phase transitions at non-zero theta angle analogous to those found in the chiral Lagrangian description of QCD.
