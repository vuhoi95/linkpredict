Title: BPS states and supersymmetric index in N=2 type I string vacua
Authors: Jose F. Morales and Marco Serone
Abstract: We study the moduli dependence of a class of couplings in $K3\times T^2$ compactifications of type I string theory, for which one-loop amplitudes can be written in terms of an N=2 supersymmetric index. This index is determined for generic models as a function of the BPS spectrum. As an application we compute the one-loop moduli dependence of the $F_g W^{2g}$ couplings, where W is the N=2 gravitational superfield, for type I compactifications based on the Gimon-Johnson K3 orientifolds, showing explicitly their dependence on the aforementioned index.
