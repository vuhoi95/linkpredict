Title: Conformal Invariance and the exact solution of BFKL equations
Authors: H. Navelet and R. Peschanski
Abstract: The conformal invariance properties of the QCD Pomeron in the transverse plane allow us to give an explicit analytical expression for the solution of the BFKL equations both in the transverse coordinate and momentum spaces. This result is obtained from the solution of the conformal eigenvectors in the mixed representation in terms of two conformal blocks, each block being the product of an holomorphic times an antiholomorphic function. This property is used to give an exact expression for the QCD dipole multiplicities and dipole-dipole cross-sections in the whole parameter space, proving the equivalence between the BFKL and dipole representations of the QCD Pomeron.
