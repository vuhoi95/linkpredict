Title: Mass inflation and chaotic behaviour inside hairy black holes
Authors: Peter Breitenlohner and George Lavrelashvili and Dieter Maison
Abstract: We analyze the interior geometry of static, spherically symmetric black holes of the Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory. Generically the solutions exhibit a behaviour that may be described as ``mass inflation'', although with a remarkable difference between the cases with and without a Higgs field. Without Higgs field the YM field induces a kind of cyclic behaviour leading to repeated cycles of mass inflation - taking the form of violent explosions - interrupted by quiescent periods and subsequent approaches to an almost Cauchy horizon. With the Higgs field no such cycles occur. In addition there are non-generic families with a Schwarzschild resp. Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m type singularity at r=0.
