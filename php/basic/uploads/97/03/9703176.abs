Authors: J. M. Isidro and A. Mukherjee and J. P. Nunes and H. J. Schnitzer
Abstract: A concise presentation of the PF equations for N=2 Seiberg-Witten theories for the classical groups of rank r with N_f massless hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation is provided. For N_f=0, all r PF equations can be given in a generic form. For certain cases with N_f\neq zero, not all equations are generic. However, in all cases there are at least r-2 generic PF equations. For these cases the classical part of the equations is generic, while the quantum part can be formulated using a method described in a previous paper by the authors, which is well suited to symbolic computer calculations.
