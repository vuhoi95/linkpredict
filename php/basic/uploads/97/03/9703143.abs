Title: Potentials and T-duality
Authors: S. F. Hewson and N. D. Lambert
Abstract: We discuss the application of T-duality to massive supersymmetric sigma models. In particular (1,1) supersymmetric models with off-shell central charges reveal an interesting structure. The T-duality transformations of the BPS states of these theories are also discussed and an explicit example of Q-kinks is given.
