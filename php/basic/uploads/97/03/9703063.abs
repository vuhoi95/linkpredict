Title: D=9 supergravity and p-brane solitons
Authors: N. Khviengia and Z. Khviengia
Abstract: We construct the N=2, D=9 supergravity theory up to the quartic fermionic terms and derive the supersymmetry transformation rules for the fields modulo cubic fermions. We consider a class of p-brane solutions of this theory, the stainless p-branes, which cannot be isotropically oxidized into higher dimensions. The new stainless elementary membrane and elementary particle solutions are found. It is explicitly verified that these solutions preserve half of the supersymmetry.
