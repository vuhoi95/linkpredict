Title: Polynomial Form of the Stueckelberg Model
Authors: Norbert Dragon and Tobias Hurth and Peter van Nieuwenhuizen
Abstract: The Stueckelberg model for massive vector fields is cast into a BRS invariant, polynomial form. Its symmetry algebra simplifies to an abelian gauge symmetry which is sufficient to decouple the negative norm states. The propagators fall off like $1/k^2$ and the Lagrangean is polynomial but it is not powercounting renormalizable due to derivative couplings.
