Title: Duality of the 2D Nonhomogeneous Ising Model on the Torus
Authors: Anatolij I. Bugrij and Vitalij N. Shadura
Abstract: Duality relations for the 2D nonhomogeneous Ising model on the finite square lattice wrapped on the torus are obtained. The partition function of the model on the dual lattice with arbitrary combinations of the periodical and antiperiodical boundary conditions along the cycles of the torus is expressed through some specific combination of the partition functions of the model on the original lattice with corresponding boundary conditions. It is shown that the structure of the duality relations is connected with the topological peculiarities of the dual transformation of the model on the torus.
