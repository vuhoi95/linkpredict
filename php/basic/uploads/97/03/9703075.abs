Title: New Couplings of Six-Dimensional Supergravity
Authors: Hitoshi Nishino and Ergin Sezgin
Abstract: We describe the couplings of six-dimensional supergravity, which contain a self-dual tensor multiplet, to $n_T$ anti-self-dual tensor matter multiplets, $n_V$ vector multiplets and $n_H$ hypermultiplets. The scalar fields of the tensor multiplets form a coset $SO(n_T,1)/SO(n_T)$, while the scalars in the hypermultiplets form quaternionic K\"ahler symmetric spaces, the generic example being $Sp(n_H,1)/Sp(n_H)\otimes Sp(1)$. The gauging of the compact subgroup $Sp(n_H) \times Sp(1)$ is also described. These results generalize previous ones in the literature on matter couplings of $N=1$ supergravity in six dimensions.
