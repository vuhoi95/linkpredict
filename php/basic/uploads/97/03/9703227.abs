Title: A Note on Supersymmetry Breaking
Authors: Stephen D. H. Hsu and Myckola Schwetz
Abstract: Using a simple observation based on holomorphy, we argue that any model which spontaneously breaks supersymmetry for some range of a parameter will do so generically for all values of that parameter, modulo some isolated exceptional points. Conversely, a model which preserves supersymmetry for some range of a parameter will also do so everywhere except at isolated exceptional points. We discuss how these observations can be useful in the construction of new models which break supersymmetry and discuss some simple examples. We also comment on the relation of these results to the Witten index.
