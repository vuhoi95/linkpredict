Title: Geometric interpretation of the 2-index potential as twisted de Rham  cohomology
Authors: S. T. Tsou and I. P. Zois
Abstract: It is found that the 2-index potential in nonabelian theories does not behave geometrically as a connection but that, considered as an element of the second de Rham cohomology group twisted by a flat connection, it fits well with all the properties assigned to it in various physical contexts. We also prove some results on the Euler characteristic of the twisted de Rham complex.
