Title: Errata for: Differential Equations for Sine-Gordon Correlation Functions  at the Free Fermion Point
Authors: D. Bernard and A. Leclair
Abstract: We present some important corrections to our work which appeared in Nucl. Phys. B426 (1994) 534 (hep-th/9402144). Our previous results for the correlation functions $\langle e^{i\alpha \Phi(x)} e^{i\alpha' \Phi (0) } \rangle$ were only valid for $\alpha = \alpha'$, due to the fact that we didn't find the most general solution to the differential equations we derived. Here we present the solution corresponding to $\alpha \neq \alpha'$.
