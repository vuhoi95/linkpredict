Title: Consistency of Orthodox Gravity
Authors: S. Bellucci and A. Shiekh
Abstract: A recent proposal for quantizing gravity is investigated for self consistency. There are well-known difficulties in dealing with Einstein gravity when resorting to the perturbative techniques of quantum field theory. This however does not preclude the existence of a quantum form. This Letter is all about such a subtle but important difference.
