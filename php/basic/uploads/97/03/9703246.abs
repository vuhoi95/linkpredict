Title: Some Remarks On Gauge-Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking
Authors: Erich Poppitz and Sandip P. Trivedi
Abstract: We investigate the communication of supersymmetry breaking to the Standard Model in theories of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking with general weakly coupled messenger sectors. We calculate the one loop gaugino and two loop soft scalar masses for nonvanishing Str M^2 of the messenger sector. The soft scalar masses are sensitive to physics at scales higher than the messenger scale, in contrast to models with vanishing messenger supertrace. We discuss the implications of this ultraviolet sensitivity in theories with renormalizable and nonrenormalizable supersymmetry breaking sectors. We note that the standard relation, in minimal gauge mediation, between soft scalar and gaugino masses is altered in models with nonvanishing messenger supertrace.
