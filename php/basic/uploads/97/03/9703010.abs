Title: Dimensional reduction and BRST approach to the description of a Regge  trajectory
Authors: A. Pashnev and M. Tsulaia
Abstract: The local free field theory for Regge trajectory is described in the framework of the BRST - quantization method. The corresponding BRST - charge is constructed with the help of the method of dimensional reduction.
