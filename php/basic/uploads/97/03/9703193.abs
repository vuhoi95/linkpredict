Title: Self-dual Chern-Simons Solitons in the Planar Ferromagnet
Authors: Yoonbai Kim and Phillial Oh and Chaiho Rim
Abstract: We consider a uniaxial planar ferromagnet coupled minimally to an Abelian Chern-Simons gauge field and study self-dual solitons which saturate the Bogomol'nyi bound. We find a rich structure of rotationally symmetric static soliton solutions for various uniform background charge densities. For a given ferromagnet material, the properties of these solitons are controlled only by the external magnetic field and the background charge.
