Title: Construction of supercharges for the one-dimensional supersymmetric  nonlinear sigma model
Authors: A. J. Macfarlane and A. J. Mountain
Abstract: This paper addresses an issue essential to the study of hidden supersymmetries (meaning here ones that do not close on the Hamiltonian) for one-dimensional non-linear supersymmetric sigma models. The issue relates to ambiguities, due to partial integrations in superspace, both in the actual definition of these supersymmetries and in the Noether definition of the associated supercharges. The unique consistent forms of both these definitions have to be determined simultaneously by a process that adjusts the former definitions so that the associated supercharges do indeed correctly generate them with the aid of the canonical formalism. The paper explains and illustrates these matters and gives some new results.
