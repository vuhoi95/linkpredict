Title: On the generalizations of Poisson structures
Authors: J. A. de Azcarraga and J. M. Izquierdo and J. C. Perez Bueno
Abstract: The characterization of the Nambu-Poisson n-tensors as a subfamily of the Generalized-Poisson ones recently introduced (and here extended to the odd order case) is discussed. The homology and cohomology complexes of both structures are compared, and some physical considerations are made.
