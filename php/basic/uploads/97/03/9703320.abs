Title: Soft Scalar-Mass Sum Rule in Gauge-Yukawa Unified Models and Its  Superstring Interpretation
Authors: Yoshiharu Kawamura and Tatsuo Kobayashi and Jisuke Kubo
Abstract: It is shown that a certain sum rule for soft supersymmetry-breaking scalar masses, which has been recently found in a certain class of superstring models, is universal for gauge-Yukawa unified models. To explain this coincidence, we argue that the low-energy remnant of the target-space duality invariance in the effective supergravity of compactified superstrings can be identified with the (broken) scale invariance in gauge-Yukawa unified models, and that gauge-Yukawa unification which is indispensable for the sum rule to be satisfied follows from the matching of anomalies.
