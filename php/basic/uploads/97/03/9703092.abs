Title: Consistent and covriant anomalies in the overlap formulation of chiral  gauge theories
Authors: S. Randjbar-Daemi and J. Strathdee
Abstract: In this letter we show how the covariant anomaly emerges in the overlap scheme. We also prove that the overlap scheme correctly reproduces the anomaly in the flavour currents such as $j^5_\mu$ in vector like theories like QCD.
