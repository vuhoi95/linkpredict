Title: F Theory on K3xK3 and Instantons on 7-branes
Authors: Michael Bershadsky and Vladimir Sadov
Abstract: We discuss N=2 supersymmetric compactifications to four dimensions from the point of view of F-theory and heterotic theory. In a relatively simple setup, we illustrate the spectral theory for vector bundles on K3xT^2 and discuss the heterotic -- F-theory map. The moduli space of instantons on the 7-brane wrapped around K3 is discussed from the point of view of Higgs mechanism in the effective four-dimensional N=2 theory. This allows us to elaborate on the transitions between various branches of the moduli space of the heterotic/F-theory. We also describe the F-theory compactification on smooth K3xK3 without the 3-branes in which the anomaly is cancelled by the gauge fields.
