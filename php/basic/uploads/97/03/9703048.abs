Title: On three dimensional bosonization
Authors: J. C. Le Guillou and E. Moreno and C. Nu√±ez and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We discuss Abelian and non-Abelian three dimensional bosonization within the path-integral framework. We present a systematic approach leading to the construction of the bosonic action which, together with the bosonization recipe for fermion currents, describes the original fermion system in terms of vector bosons.
