Title: Quantization of Diffeomorphism-Invariant Theories with Fermions
Authors: John C. Baez and Kirill V. Krasnov
Abstract: We extend ideas developed for the loop representation of quantum gravity to diffeomorphism-invariant gauge theories coupled to fermions. Let P -> Sigma be a principal G-bundle over space and let F be a vector bundle associated to P whose fiber is a sum of continuous unitary irreducible representations of the compact connected gauge group G, each representation appearing together with its dual. We consider theories whose classical configuration space is A x F, where A is the space of connections on P and F is the space of sections of F, regarded as a collection of Grassmann-valued fermionic fields. We construct the `quantum configuration space a x f as a completion of A x F. Using this we construct a Hilbert space L^2(a x f) for the quantum theory on which all automorphisms of P act as unitary operators, and determine an explicit `spin network basis' of the subspace L^2((a x f)/G) consisting of gauge-invariant states. We represent observables constructed from holonomies of the connection along paths together with fermionic fields and their conjugate momenta as operators on L^2((a x f)/G). We also construct a Hilbert space H_diff of diffeomorphism-invariant states using the group averaging procedure of Ashtekar, Lewandowski, Marolf, Mourao and Thiemann.
