Title: Thermodynamic Properties of the Piecewise Uniform String
Authors: I. Brevik and A. A. Bytsenko and H. B. Nielsen
Abstract: The thermodynamic free energy F is calculated for a gas whose particles are the quantum excitations of a piecewise uniform bosonic string. The string consists of two parts of length L_I and L_II, endowed with different tensions and mass densities, adjusted in such a way that the velocity of sound always equals the velocity of light. The explicit calculation is done under the restrictive condition that the tension ratio x = T_I/T_II approaches zero. Also, the length ratio s = L_II/L_I is assumed to be an integer. The expression for F is given on an integral form, in which s is present as a parameter. For large values of s, the Hagedorn temperature becomes proportional to the square root of s.
