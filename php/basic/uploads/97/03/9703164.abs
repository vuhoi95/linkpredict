Title: The Poincare' coset models ISO(d-1,1)/R^n and T-duality
Authors: Roberto Casadio and Benjamin Harms
Abstract: We generalize a family of Lagrangians with values in the Poincar\'e group ISO(d-1,1), which contain the description of spinning strings in flat (d-1)+1 dimensions, by including symmetric terms in the world-sheet coordinates. Then, by promoting a subgroup H=R^n, n less than or equal to d, which acts invariantly from the left on the element of ISO(d-1,1), to a gauge symmetry of the action, we obtain a family of sigma-models. They describe bosonic strings moving in (generally) curved, and in some cases degenerate, space-times with an axion field. Further, the space-times of the effective theory admit in general T-dual geometries. We give explicit results for two non degenerate cases.
