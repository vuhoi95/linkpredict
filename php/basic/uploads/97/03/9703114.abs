Title: Screening and confinement in large N_f QCD_2 and in N=1 SYM_2
Authors: A. Armoni and J. Sonnenschein
Abstract: The screening nature of the potential between external quarks in massless $SU(N_c)$ $QCD_2$ is derived using an expansion in $N_f$- the number of flavors. Applying the same method to the massive model, we find a confining potential. We consider the N=1 super Yang Mills theory, reveal certain problematic aspects of its bosonized version and show the associated screening behavior by applying a point splitting method to the scalar current.
