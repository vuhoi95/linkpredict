Title: Phenomenological implications of moduli-dominant SUSY breaking
Authors: Yoshiharu Kawamura and Shaaban Khalil and Tatsuo Kobayashi
Abstract: We study moduli-dominated SUSY breaking within the framework of string models. This type of SUSY breaking in general leads to non-universal soft masses, i.e. soft scalar masses and gaugino masses. Further gauginos are lighter than sfermions. This non-universality has phenomenologically important implications. We investigate radiative electroweak symmetry breaking in the mass spectrum derived from moduli-dominated SUSY breaking, where the lightest chargino and neutralino are almost gauginos. Moreover, constraints from the branching ratio of $b \to s \gamma$ and the relic abundance of the LSP are also considered. The mass spectrum of moduli-dominated SUSY breaking is favorable to the experimental bound of the $b \to s \gamma$ decay decreasing its branching ratio. We obtain an upper bound for the gravitino mass from the cosmological constraint.
