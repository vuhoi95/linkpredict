Title: Matrix Black Holes
Authors: Miao Li and Emil Martinec
Abstract: Four and five dimensional extremal black holes with nonzero entropy have simple presentations in M-theory as gravitational waves bound to configurations of intersecting M-branes. We discuss realizations of these objects in matrix models of M-theory, investigate the properties of zero-brane probes, and propose a measure of their internal density. A scenario for black hole dynamics is presented.
