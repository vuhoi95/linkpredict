Title: New angles on D-branes
Authors: J. C. Breckenridge and G. Michaud and R. C. Myers
Abstract: A low-energy background field solution is presented which describes several D-membranes oriented at angles with respect to one another. The mass and charge densities for this configuration are computed and found to saturate the BPS bound, implying the preservation of one-quarter of the supersymmetries. T-duality is exploited to construct new solutions with nontrivial angles from the basic one.
