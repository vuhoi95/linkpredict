Title: Elementary Excitations and Dynamical Correlation Functions of the  Calogero-Sutherland Model with Internal Symmetry
Authors: Yusuke Kato and Takashi Yamamoto and Mitsuhiro Arikawa
Abstract: We consider the physical properties of elementary excitations of the Calogero-Sutherland (CS) model with SU(K) internal symmetry. From the results on the thermodynamics of this model, we obtain the charge, spin, and statistics of elementary excitations. Combining this knowledge and the known results on the dynamics in the spinless CS model, we propose the expression for the dynamical correlation functions of the SU(K) CS model. In the asymptotic region, we confirm the consistency of our results with predictions from conformal field theory.
