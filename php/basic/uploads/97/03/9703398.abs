Title: QCD at Finite Extension
Authors: F. Lenz and M. Thies
Abstract: A study of QCD at finite extension is presented and the relation to QCD at finite temperature and in the infinite momentum frame is discussed. The dynamics of Polyakov loops is investigated and shown to be described by functional integrals with finite range of integration. Consequences of this non-Gaussian form of the generating functional concerning the QCD vacuum, gluonic excitations and confinement are discussed.
