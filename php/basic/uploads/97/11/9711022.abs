Title: Equations of the moduli of pointed curves in the infinite Grassmannian
Authors: J. M. Muñoz Porras and F. J. Plaza Martín
Abstract: The main result of this paper is the explicit computation of the equations defining the moduli space of triples $(C,p,z)$ (where $C$ is an integral and complete algebraic curve, $p$ a smooth rational point and $z$ a formal trivialization around $p$) in the infinite Grassmannian of $k((t))$. This is achieved by introducing infinite Grassmannians, tau and Baker-Ahkiezer functions algebraically and by proving an Addition Formula for tau functions.
