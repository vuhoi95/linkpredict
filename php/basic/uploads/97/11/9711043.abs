Title: M-brane intersections from worldvolume superalgebras
Authors: Eric Bergshoeff and Joaquim Gomis and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: It is known that the M-branes of M-theory correspond to p-form charges in the D=11 spacetime supersymmetry algebra. Here we show that their intersections are encoded in the p-form charges of their worldvolume supersymmetry algebras. Triple intersections are encoded in double intersection worldvolume algebras with eight supercharges.
