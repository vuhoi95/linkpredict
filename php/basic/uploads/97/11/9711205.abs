Title: BPS Bounds for Worldvolume Branes
Authors: Jerome P. Gauntlett and Joaquim Gomis and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: The worldvolume field equations of M-branes and D-branes are known to admit p-brane soliton solutions. These solitons are shown to saturate a BPS-type bound on their p-volume tensions, which are expressed in terms of central charges that are expected to appear in the worldvolume supertranslation algebra. The cases we consider include vortices, `BIons', instantons and dyons (both abelian and non-abelian), and the string boundaries of M-2-branes in the M-5-brane.
