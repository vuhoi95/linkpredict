Title: Cosmic Strings, Zero Modes and SUSY breaking in Nonabelian N=1 Gauge  Theories
Authors: Stephen C. Davis and Anne C. Davis and Mark Trodden
Abstract: We investigate the microphysics of cosmic strings in Nonabelian gauge theories with N=1 supersymmetry. We give the vortex solutions in a specific example and demonstrate that fermionic superconductivity arises because of the couplings and interactions dictated by supersymmetry. We then use supersymmetry transformations to obtain the relevant fermionic zero modes and investigate the role of soft supersymmetry breaking on the existence and properties of the superconducting strings.
