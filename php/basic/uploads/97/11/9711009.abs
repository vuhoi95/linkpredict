Title: The N=2 supersymmetric matrix GNLS hierarchies
Authors: L. Bonora and S. Krivonos and A. Sorin
Abstract: We construct the matrix generalization of the N=2 supersymmetric GNLS hierarchies. This is done by exhibiting the corresponding matrix super Lax operators in terms of N=2 superfields in two different superfield bases. We present the second Hamiltonian structure and discrete symmetries. We then extend our discussion by conjecturing the Lax operators of different reductions of the N=2 supersymmetric matrix KP hierarchy and discuss the simplest examples.
