Title: Branes and Toric Geometry
Authors: N. C. Leung and C. Vafa
Abstract: We show that toric geometry can be used rather effectively to translate a brane configuration to geometry. Roughly speaking the skeletons of toric space are identified with the brane configurations. The cases where the local geometry involves hypersurfaces in toric varieties (such as P^2 blown up at more than 3 points) presents a challenge for the brane picture. We also find a simple physical explanation of Batyrev's construction of mirror pairs of Calabi-Yau manifolds using T-duality.
