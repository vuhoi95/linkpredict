Title: Schwarzchild Black Holes in Matrix Theory II
Authors: T. Banks and W. Fischler and I. R. Klebanov and L. Susskind
Abstract: We present a crude Matrix Theory model for Schwarzchild black holes in uncompactified dimension greater than $5$. The model accounts for the size, entropy, and long range state interactions of black holes. The key feature of the model is a Boltzmann gas of D0 branes, a concept which depends on certain qualitative features of Matrix Theory which have not previously been utilized in studies of black holes.
