Title: Finite-Time Amplitudes In Matrix Theory
Authors: Oyvind Tafjord and Vipul Periwal
Abstract: We evaluate one-loop finite-time amplitudes for graviton scattering in Matrix theory and compare to the corresponding amplitudes in supergravity. We find agreement for arbitrary time intervals at leading order in distance, providing a functional agreement between supergravity and Matrix theory. At subleading order, we find corrections to the effective potential found from previous phase shift calculations in Matrix theory.
