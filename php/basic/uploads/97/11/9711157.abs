Title: Dualities in all order finite N=1 gauge theories
Authors: Andreas Karch and Dieter Lust and George Zoupanos
Abstract: We search for dual gauge theories of all-loop finite, N = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories. It is shown how to find explicitly the dual gauge theories of almost all chiral, N = 1, all-loop finite gauge theories, while several models have been discussed in detail, including a realistic finite SU(5) unified theory. Out of our search only one all-loop, N = 1 finite SO(10) theory emerges, so far, as a candidate for exhibiting also S-duality.
