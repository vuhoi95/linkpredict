Title: Gonihedric String Equation
Authors: G. K. Savvidy and K. G. Savvidy
Abstract: We discuss the basic properties of the gonihedric string and the problem of its formulation in continuum. We propose a generalization of the Dirac equation and of the corresponding gamma matrices in order to describe the gonihedric string. The wave function and the Dirac matrices are infinite-dimensional. The spectrum of the theory consists of particles and antiparticles of increasing half-integer spin lying on quasilinear trajectories of different slope. Explicit formulas for the mass spectrum allow to compute the string tension and thus demonstrate the string character of the theory.
