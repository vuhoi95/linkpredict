Title: The QCD triple Pomeron coupling from string amplitudes
Authors: A. Bialas and H. Navelet and R. Peschanski
Abstract: Using the recent solution of the triple Pomeron coupling in the QCD dipole picture as a closed string amplitude with six legs, its analytical form in terms of hypergeometric functions and numerical value are derived.
