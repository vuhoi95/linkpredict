Title: Supersymmetry in Dimensions Beyond Eleven
Authors: I. Rudychev and E. Sezgin and P. Sundell
Abstract: Spacetime superalgebras with 64 or less number of real supercharges, containing the type IIB Poincare superalgebra in (9,1) dimensions and the N=1 Poincare superalgebra in (10,1) are considered. The restriction D<14, and two distinct possibilities arise: The N=(1,0) superalgebra in (11,3) dimensions, and the N=(2,0) superalgebra in (10,2) dimensions. Emphasizing the former, we describe superparticle and super Yang-Mills systems in (11,3) dimensions. We also propose an N=(2,1) superstring theory in (n,n) dimensions as a possible origin of super Yang-Mills in (8+n,n) dimensions.
