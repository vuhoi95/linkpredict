Title: Note on the Abelian Pure CS Theory Based on the Improved BFT Method
Authors: Mu-In Park and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: We reconsider the Abelian pure Chern-Simons theory in three dimensions by using our improved Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin Hamiltonian formalism. As a result, we show several novel features, including the connection of the Dirac brackets. In particular, through the path integral quantization, we obtain the desired new type of the Wess-Zumino action.
