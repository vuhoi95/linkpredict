Title: Fermion Mass Textures in an M-Inspired Flipped SU(5) Model Derived from  String
Authors: J. Ellis and G. K. Leontaris and S. Lola and D. V. Nanopoulos
Abstract: We are inspired by the facts that M-theory may reconcile the supersymmetric GUT scale with that of quantum gravity, and that it provides new avenues for low-energy supersymmetry breaking, to re-examine a flipped SU(5) model that has been derived from string and may possess an elevation to a fully-fledged M-phenomenological model. Using a complete analysis of all superpotential terms through the sixth order, we explore in this model a new flat potential direction that provides a pair of light Higgs doublets, yields realistic textures for the fermion mass matrices, and is free of R-violating interactions and dimension-five proton decay operators.
