Abstract: We investigate the effect of a constant external non-Abelian field on chiral symmetry breaking in a (2+1)-dimensional Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model and in 3D QCD by solving the gap equation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation, and also by RG analysis. In the (2+1)-dimensional NJL model chiral symmetry breaking occurs for any weak coupling constant but in 3D QCD catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking does not occur.
