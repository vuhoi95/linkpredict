Title: Wheeler-DeWitt equation and Feynman diagrams
Authors: A. O. Barvinsky and C. Kiefer
Abstract: We present a systematic expansion of all constraint equations in canonical quantum gravity up to the order of the inverse Planck mass squared. It is demonstrated that this method generates the conventional Feynman diagrammatic technique involving graviton loops and vertices. It also reveals explicitly the back reaction effects of quantized matter and graviton vacuum polarization. This provides an explicit correspondence between the frameworks of canonical and covariant quantum gravity in the semiclassical limit.
