Title: Aharonov-Bohm effect in curved space and cosmic strings
Authors: Yurii Sitenko and Alexei Mishchenko
Abstract: A quantum theory is developed for the scattering of a nonrelativistic particle in the field of a cosmic string regarded as a combination of a magnetic and gravitational strings. Allowance is made for the effects due to the finite transverse dimensions of the string under fairly general assumptions about the distribution of the magnetic field and spatial curvature in the string. It is shown that in a definite range of angles the differential cross section at all absolute values of the wave vector of the incident particle depends strongly on the magnetic flux of the string.
