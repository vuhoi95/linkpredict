Title: Central Extensions of Supersymmetry in Four and Three Dimensions
Authors: S. Ferrara and M. Porrati
Abstract: We consider the maximal central extension of the supertranslation algebra in d=4 and 3, which includes tensor central charges associated to topological defects such as domain walls (membranes) and strings. We show that for all N-extended superalgebras these charges are related to nontrivial configurations on the scalar moduli space. For N=2 theories obtained from compactification on Calabi-Yau threefolds, we give an explicit realization of the moduli-dependent charges in terms of wrapped branes.
