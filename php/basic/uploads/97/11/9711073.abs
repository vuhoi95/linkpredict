Title: Exact Results in N_c=2 IIB Matrix Model
Authors: T. Suyama and A. Tsuchiya
Abstract: We investigate N_c=2 case of IIB matrix model, which is exactly soluble. We calculate the partition function exactly and obtain a finite result without introducing any cut-off. We also evaluate some correlation functions consisting of Wilson loops.
