Title: On the equivalence of the self-dual and Maxwell-Chern-Simons models  coupled to Fermions
Authors: M. Gomes and L. C. Malacarne and A. J. da Silva
Abstract: We study the exact equivalence between the self-dual model minimally coupled with a Dirac field and the Maxwell-Chern-Simons model with non-minimal magnetic coupling to fermions. We show that the fermion sectors of the models are equivalent only if a Thirring like interaction is included. Using functional methods we verify that, up to renormalizations, the equivalence persists at the quantum level.
