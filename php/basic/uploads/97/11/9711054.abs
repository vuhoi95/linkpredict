Title: A Non-renormalization Theorem for the Wilsonian Gauge Couplings in  Supersymmetric Theories
Authors: Michael Graesser and Bogdan Morariu
Abstract: We show that the holomorphic Wilsonian beta-function of a renormalizable asymptotically free supersymmetric gauge theory with an arbitrary semi-simple gauge group, matter content, and renormalizable superpotential is exhausted at 1-loop with no higher loops and no non-perturbative contributions. This is a non-perturbative extension of the well known result of Shifman and Vainshtein.
