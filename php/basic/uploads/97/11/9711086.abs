Title: On Genus-One-Corrected Extremal Black Holes and the Correspondence  Principle
Authors: Mikhail Z. Iofa and Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas
Abstract: We discuss charged black-hole solutions to the equations of motion of the string-loop-corrected effective action. At the string-tree level, these solutions provide backgrounds for the "chiral null model". The effective action contains gravity, dilaton and moduli fields. Analytic solutions of the one-loop-corrected equations of motion are presented for the extremal magnetic and dyonic black holes. Using the fact that in magnetic solution the loop-corrected dilaton is non-singular at the origin, we apply the correspondence principle to show that the entropy of the loop-corrected magnetic black hole can be interpreted as the microscopic entropy of the D-brane system.
