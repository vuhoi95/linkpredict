Title: On the Effective Action of N=1 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: G. R. Farrar and G. Gabadadze and M. Schwetz
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the Veneziano-Yankielowicz effective low-energy action for N=1 SUSY Yang-Mills theory which includes composite operators interpolating pure gluonic bound states. The chiral supermultiplet of anomalies is embedded in a larger three-form multiplet and an extra term in the effective action is introduced. The mass spectrum and mixing of the lowest-spin bound states are studied within the effective Lagrangian approach. The physical mass eigenstates form two multiplets, each containing a scalar, pseudoscalar and Weyl fermion. The multiplet containing the states which are most closely related to glueballs is the lighter one.
