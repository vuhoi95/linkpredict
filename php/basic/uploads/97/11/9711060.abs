Title: Non-Abelian Gauge Configuration with a Magnetic Field Concentrated at a  Point
Authors: Minoru Hirayama and Takeshi Hamada and Masafumi Hasegawa
Abstract: A specific SU(2) gauge configuration yielding a magnetic field concentrated at a point is investigated. Its relation to the Aharonov-Bohm gauge potential and its cohomological meaning in a three dimensional space are clarified. Quantum mechanics of a spinning particle in such a gauge configuration is briefly discussed.
