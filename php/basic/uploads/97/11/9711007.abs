Title: Worldline Superfield Actions for N=2 Superparticles
Authors: Igor Bandos and Alexey Maznytsia and Dmitri Sorokin
Abstract: We propose doubly supersymmetric actions in terms of n=2(D-2) worldline superfields for N=2 superparticles in D=3,4 and Type IIA D=6 superspaces. These actions are obtained by dimensional reduction of superfield actions for N=1 superparticles in D=4,6 and 10, respectively. We show that in all these models geometrodynamical constraints on target superspace coordinates do not put the theory on the mass shell, so the actions constructed consistently describe the dynamics of the corresponding N=2 superparticles. We also find that in contrast to the IIA D=6 superparticle a chiral IIB D=6 superparticle, which is not obtainable by dimensional reduction from N=1, D=10, is described by superfield constraints which produce dynamical equations. This implies that for the IIB D=6 superparticle the doubly supersymmetric action does not exist in the conventional form.
