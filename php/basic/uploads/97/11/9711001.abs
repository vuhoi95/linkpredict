Title: Integrable Models and the Higher Dimensional Representations of Graded  Lie Algebras
Authors: J. C. Brunelli and Ashok Das
Abstract: We construct a zero curvature formulation, in superspace, for the sTB-B hierarchy which naturally reduces to the zero curvature condition in terms of components, thus solving one of the puzzling features of this model. This analysis, further, suggests a systematic method of constructing higher dimensional representations for the zero curvature condition starting with the fundamental representation. We illustrate this with the examples of the sTB hierarchy and the sKdV hierarchy. This would be particularly useful in constructing explicit higher dimensional representations of graded Lie algebras.
