Title: Effective actions, relative cohomology and Chern Simons forms
Authors: J. A. de Azcarraga and A. J. Macfarlane and J. C. Perez Bueno
Abstract: The explicit expression of all the WZW effective actions for a simple group G broken down to a subgroup H is established in a simple and direct way, and the formal similarity of these actions to the Chern-Simons forms is explained. Applications are also discussed.
