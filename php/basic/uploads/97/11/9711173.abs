Title: N=2 Supersymmetry and Dipole Moments
Authors: Ioannis Giannakis and James T. Liu
Abstract: We derive sum rules for the magnetic and electric dipole moments of all particle states of an N=2 supermultiplet. For short representations, we find agreement with previously determined N=1 sum rules, while there is added freedom for long representations (expressed as certain scalar expectation values). With mild assumptions we find the simple result that the supersymmetry generated spin adds to the magnetic (electric) dipole moment with strength corresponding to $g=2$ ($g_e=0$). This result is equally valid for N=1, this time without any further assumptions.
