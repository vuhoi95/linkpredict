Title: Extended Objects in MQCD
Authors: A. Fayyazuddin and M. Spalinski
Abstract: N=1 supersymmetric QCD is considered using the recently proposed picture of it as the world volume theory of a single M-theory fivebrane with two of its dimensions wrapped on a Riemann surface. The conditions under which a second M-theory brane can be introduced preserving some supersymmetry are analysed. Such configurations represent BPS saturated extended objects in the quantum field theory on the brane worldvolume. Formulae for the tension of these extended objects are derived. An explicit intersecting fivebrane configuration is found which is interpreted as a BPS domain wall in 4-dimensional MQCD.
