Title: The nondynamical r-matrix structure of the elliptic Calogero-Moser model
Authors: Bo-yu Hou and Wen-li Yang
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a new Lax operator for the elliptic Calogero-Moser model with N=2. The nondynamical r-matrix structure of this Lax operator is also studied . The relation between our Lax operator and the Lax operator given by Krichever is also obtained.
