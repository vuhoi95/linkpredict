Title: Conserved Charges and Supersymmetry in Principal Chiral Models
Authors: J. M. Evans and M. Hassan and N. J. MacKay and A. J. Mountain
Abstract: We report on investigations of local (and non-local) charges in bosonic and supersymmetric principal chiral models in 1+1 dimensions. In the bosonic PCM there is a classically conserved local charge for each symmetric invariant tensor of the underlying group. These all commute with the non-local Yangian charges. The algebra of the local charges amongst themselves is rather more subtle. We give a universal formula for infinite sets of mutually commuting local charges with spins equal to the exponents of the underlying classical algebra modulo its Coxeter number. Many of these results extend to the supersymmetric PCM, but with local conserved charges associated with antisymmetric invariants in the Lie algebra. We comment briefly on the quantum conservation of local charges in both the bosonic and super PCMs.
