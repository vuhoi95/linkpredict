Title: Factored coset models: A unifying approach to different bosonization  schemes
Authors: A N Theron and F G Scholtz and H B Geyer
Abstract: We discuss various bosonization schemes from a path integral perspective. Our analysis shows that the existence of different bosonization schemes, such as abelian bosonization of non-abelian models and non-abelian bosonization of fermions with colour and flavour indices, can be understood as different ways of factoring out a dynamically trivial coset which contains the fermions. From this perspective follows the importance of the coset model in ensuring the correct superselection rules on the bosonic level.
