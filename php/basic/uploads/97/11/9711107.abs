Title: D-particle bound states and the D-instanton measure
Authors: M. B. Green and M. Gutperle
Abstract: A connection is made between the Witten index of relevance to threshold bound states of D-particles in the type IIA superstring theory and the measure that enters D-instanton sums for processes dominated by single multiply-charged D-instantons in the type IIB theory.
