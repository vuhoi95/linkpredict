Title: Universal Spectral Correlators and Massive Dirac Operators
Authors: P. H. Damgaard and S. M. Nishigaki
Abstract: We derive the large-N spectral correlators of complex matrix ensembles with weights that in the context of Dirac spectra correspond to N_f massive fermions, and prove that the results are universal in the appropriate scaling limits. The resulting microscopic spectral densities satisfy exact spectral sum rules of massive Dirac operators in QCD.
