Title: A Technique for Calculating Quantum Corrections to Solitons
Authors: Chris Barnes and Neil Turok
Abstract: We present a numerical scheme for calculating the first quantum corrections to the properties of static solitons. The technique is applicable to solitons of arbitrary shape, and may be used in 3+1 dimensions for multiskyrmions or other complicated solitons. We report on a test computation in 1+1 dimensions, where we accurately reproduce the analytical result with minimal numerical effort.
