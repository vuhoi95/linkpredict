Title: Renormalization group for renormalization-group equations toward the  universality classification of infinite-order phase transitions
Authors: Chigak Itoi and Hisamitsu Mukaida
Abstract: We derive a new renormalization group to calculate a non-trivial critical exponent of the divergent correlation length which gives a universality classification of essential singularities in infinite-order phase transitions. This method resolves the problem of a vanishing scaling matrix. The exponent is obtained from the maximal eigenvalue of a scaling matrix in this renormalization group, as in the case of ordinary second-order phase transitions. We exhibit several nontrivial universality classes in infinite-order transitions different from the well-known Berezinski\u\i-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition.
