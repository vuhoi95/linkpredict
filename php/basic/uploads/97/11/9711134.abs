Title: Graceful Exit in String Cosmology
Authors: Ram Brustein and Richard Madden
Abstract: The graceful exit transition from a dilaton-driven inflationary phase to a decelerated Friedmann-Robertson-Walker era requires certain classical and quantum corrections to the string effective action. Classical corrections can stabilize a high curvature string phase while the evolution is still in the weakly coupled regime, and quantum corrections can induce violation of the null energy condition, allowing evolution towards a decelerated phase.
