Title: Tensor and Vector Multiplets in Six-Dimensional Supergravity
Authors: S. Ferrara and F. Riccioni and A. Sagnotti
Abstract: We construct the complete coupling of $(1,0)$ supergravity in six dimensions to $n$ tensor multiplets, extending previous results to all orders in the fermi fields. We then add couplings to vector multiplets, as dictated by the generalized Green-Schwarz mechanism. The resulting theory embodies factorized gauge and supersymmetry anomalies, to be disposed of by fermion loops, and is determined by corresponding Wess-Zumino consistency conditions, aside from a quartic coupling for the gaugini. The supersymmetry algebra contains a corresponding extension that plays a crucial role for the consistency of the construction. We leave aside gravitational and mixed anomalies, that would only contribute to higher-derivative couplings.
