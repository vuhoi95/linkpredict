Title: Mode-by-mode summation for the zero point electromagnetic energy of an  infinite cylinder
Authors: Kimball A. Milton and A. V. Nesterenko and V. V. Nesterenko
Abstract: Using the mode-by-mode summation technique the zero point energy of the electromagnetic field is calculated for the boundary conditions given on the surface of an infinite solid cylinder. It is assumed that the dielectric and magnetic characteristics of the material which makes up the cylinder $(\epsilon_1, \mu_1)$ and of that which makes up the surroundings $(\epsilon_2, \mu_2)$ obey the relation $\epsilon_1\mu_1= \epsilon_2\mu_2$. With this assumption all the divergences cancel. The divergences are regulated by making use of zeta function techniques. Numerical calculations are carried out for a dilute dielectric cylinder and for a perfectly conducting cylindrical shell. The Casimir energy in the first case vanishes, and in the second is in complete agreement with that obtained by DeRaad and Milton who employed a Green's function technique with an ultraviolet regulator.
