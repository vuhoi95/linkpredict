Abstract: We study configurations of a single $M$ fivebrane in the geometry ${\bf R}^7 \times Q$ where $Q$ is the Taub-NUT space. Taking the IIA limit at each value of their modulus, two possibilities of the IIA configuration are revealed. One consists of a NS fivebrane and a D sixbrane while the other consists of a NS fivebrane, a D sixbrane and a D fourbrane. In the latter case the fourbrane is shown to be suspended by the fivebrane and the sixbrane. This appearance of fourbrane can be interpreted in Type IIA picture as the result of the crossing of the fivebrane and the sixbrane
