Title: Aspects of D-brane dynamics on orbifolds
Authors: Faheem Hussain and Roberto Iengo and Carmen Nunez and Claudio A. Scrucca
Abstract: We discuss D-brane dynamics in orbifold compactifications of type II superstring theory. We compute the interaction potential between two D-branes moving with constant velocities and give a field theory interpretation of it in the large distance limit.
