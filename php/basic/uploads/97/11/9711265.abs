Title: Lattice two-point functions and conformal invariance
Authors: Malte Henkel and Dragi Karevski
Abstract: A new realization of the conformal algebra is studied which mimics the behaviour of a statistical system on a discrete albeit infinite lattice. The two-point function is found from the requirement that it transforms covariantly under this realization. The result is in agreement with explicit lattice calculations of the $(1+1)D$ Ising model and the $d-$dimensional spherical model. A hard core is found which is not present in the continuum. For a semi-infinite lattice, profiles are also obtained.
