Authors: Jan de Boer and Kentaro Hori and Hirosi Ooguri and Yaron Oz
Abstract: The construction of four dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories via the fivebrane of M theory wrapped around a Riemann surface has been successfully applied to the computation of holomorphic quantities of field theory. In this paper we compute non-holomorphic quantities in the eleven dimensional supergravity limit of M theory. While the Kahler potential on the Coulomb of N=2 theories is correctly reproduced, higher derivative terms in the N=2 effective action differ from what is expected for the four dimensional gauge theory. For the Kahler potential of N=1 theories at an abelian Coulomb phase, the result again differs from what is expected for the four-dimensional gauge theory. Using a gravitational back reaction method for the fivebrane we compute the metric on the Higgs branch of N=2 gauge theories. Here we find an agreement with the results expected for the gauge theories. A similar computation of the metric on N=1 Higgs branches yields information on the complex structure associated with the flavor rotation in one case and the classical metric in another. We discuss what four-dimensional field theory quantities can be computed via the fivebrane in the supergravity limit of M theory.
