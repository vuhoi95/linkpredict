Title: On the Geometry on Antisymmetric Fields
Authors: M. I. Caicedo and I. Martin and A. Restuccia
Abstract: The geometry of antisymmetric fields with nontrivial transitions over a base manifold is described in terms of exact sequences of cohomology groups. This formulation leads naturally to the appearance of nontrivial topological charges associated to the periods of the curvature of the antisymmetric fields. The relation between the partition functions of dual theories is carefully studied under the most general assumptions, and new topological factors related to zero modes and the Ray Singer torsion are found.
