Title: The modified Seiberg-Witten monopole equations and their exact solutions
Authors: Zhong-Qi Ma and Bo-Yuan Hou
Abstract: The modified Seiberg-Witten monopole equations are presented in this letter. These equations have analytic solutions in the whole 1+3 Minkowski space with finite energy. The physical meaning of the equations and solutions are discussed here.
