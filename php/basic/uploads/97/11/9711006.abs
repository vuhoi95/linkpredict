Title: Duality of Quasilocal Black Hole Thermodynamics
Authors: Jeongwon Ho and Won Tae Kim and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: We consider T-duality of the quasilocal black hole thermodynamics for the three-dimensional low energy effective string theory. Quasilocal thermodynamic variables in the first law are explicitly calculated on a general axisymmetric three-dimensional black hole solution and corresponding dual one. Physical meaning of the dual invariance of the black hole entropy is considered in terms of the Euclidean path integral formulation.
