Authors: V. L. Eletsky and A. C. Kalloniatis and F. Lenz and M. Thies
Abstract: SU(2) Yang-Mills theory at finite extension or, equivalently, at finite temperature is probed by a homogeneous chromomagnetic field. We use a recent modified axial gauge formulation which has the novel feature of respecting the center symmetry in perturbation theory. The characteristic properties of the Z_2-symmetric phase, an extension-dependent mass term and antiperiodic boundary conditions, provide stabilization against magnetic field formation for sufficiently small extension or high temperature. In an extension of this investigation to the deconfined phase with broken center symmetry, the combined constraints of thermodynamic and magnetic stability are shown to yield many of the high temperature properties of lattice SU(2) gauge theory.
