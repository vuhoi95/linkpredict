Title: A New Approach of Fermion Field on Lattice
Authors: Bo Feng and Jianming Li and Xingchang Song
Abstract: A new approach to formulate the fermion field on lattice is introduced by proposing a new Dirac operator on lattice.This approach can eliminate the Fermion doubling problem, preserve the chiral symmetry and get the same dispersion relation for both Fermion and Boson fields.Then the Weinberg-Salam model on lattice may be formulated in this approach.
