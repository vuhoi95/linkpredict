Abstract: Considering three-dimensional Chern-Simons theory, either coupled to matter or with a Yang-Mills term, we show the validity of a trace identity, playing the role of a local form of the Callan-Symanzik equation, in all orders of perturbation theory. From this we deduce the vanishing of the $\beta$-function associated to the Chern-Simons coupling constant and the full finiteness in the case of the Yang-Mills Chern-Simons theory. The main ingredient in the proof of the latter property is the noninvariance of the Chern-Simons form under the gauge transformations. Our results hold for the three-dimensional Chern-Simons model in a general Riemannian manifold.
