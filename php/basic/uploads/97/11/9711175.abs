Title: Supersymmetry and Bosonization in Three Dimensions
Authors: Jose D. Edelstein and Carlos Nunez
Abstract: We discuss on the possible existence of a supersymmetric invariance in purely fermionic planar systems and its relation to the fermion-boson mapping in three-dimensional quantum field theory. We consider, as a very simple example, the bosonization of free massive fermions and show that, under certain conditions on the masses, this model displays a supersymmetric-like invariance in the low energy regime. We construct the purely fermionic expression for the supercurrent and the non-linear supersymmetry transformation laws. We argue that the supersymmetry is absent in the limit of massless fermions where the bosonized theory is non-local.
