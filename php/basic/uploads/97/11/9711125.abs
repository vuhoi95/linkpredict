Title: Solitons in a six-dimensional super Yang-Mills-tensor system and  noncritical strings
Authors: V. P. Nair and S. Randjbar-Daemi
Abstract: In this letter we study a coupled system of six-dimensional N=1 tensor and super Yang-Mills multiplets. We identify some of the solitonic states of this system which exhibit stringy behaviour in six dimensions. A discussion of the supercharges and energy for the tensor multiplet as well as zero modes is also given. We speculate about the possible relationship between our solution and what is known as tensionless strings.
