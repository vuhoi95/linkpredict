Title: Massless Wess-Zumino model as first quantized Siegel superparticle
Authors: A. A. Deriglazov and A. V. Galajinsky and D. M. Gitman
Abstract: It is shown that canonical quantization of the $4d$ Siegel superparticle yields massless Wess-Zumino model as an effective field theory. Quantum states of the superparticle are realized in terms of the real scalar superfields which prove to be decomposed into the sum of on-shell chiral and antichiral superfields.
