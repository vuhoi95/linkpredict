Title: Universal Massive Spectral Correlators and QCD_3
Authors: Poul H. Damgaard and Shinsuke M. Nishigaki
Abstract: Based on random matrix theory in the unitary ensemble, we derive the double-microscopic massive spectral correlators corresponding to the Dirac operator of QCD_3 with an even number of fermions N_f. We prove that these spectral correlators are universal, and demonstrate that they satisfy exact massive spectral sum rules of QCD_3 in a phase where flavor symmetries are spontaneously broken according to U(N_f) -> U(N_f/2) x U(N_f/2).
