Title: Termination of Multifractal Behaviour for Critical Disordered Dirac  Fermions
Authors: J. -S. Caux and N. Taniguchi and A. M. Tsvelik
Abstract: We consider Dirac fermions interacting with a disordered non-Abelian vector potential. The exact solution is obtained through a special type of conformal field theory including logarithmic correlators, without resorting to the replica or supersymmetry approaches. It is shown that the proper treatment of the conformal theory leads to a different multifractal scaling behaviour than initially expected. Moreover, the previous replica solution is found to be incorrect at the level of higher correlation functions.
