Title: BPS Nature of 3-String Junctions
Authors: Keshav Dasgupta and Sunil Mukhi
Abstract: We study BPS-saturated classical solutions for the world-sheet theory of a D-string in the presence of a point charge. These solutions are interpreted as describing planar 3-string junctions, which arise because the original D-string is deformed by the presence of the inserted charge. We compute the angles of the junctions and show that the vector sum of string tensions is zero, confirming a conjecture of Schwarz that such configurations are BPS states.
