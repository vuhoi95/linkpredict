Title: Feynman rules in N=2 projective Superspace II: Massive hypermultiplets
Authors: F. Gonzalez-Rey and R. von Unge
Abstract: Manifest N=2 supersymmetric hypermultiplet mass terms can be introduced in the projective N=2 superspace formalism. In the case of complex hypermultiplets, where the gauge covariantized spinor derivatives have an explicit representation in terms of gauge prepotentials, it is possible to interpret such masses as vacuum expectation values of an Abelian vector multiplet. The duality transformation that relates the N=2 off-shell projective description of the hypermultiplet to the on-shell description involving two N=1 chiral superfields allows us to obtain the massive propagators of the N=1 complex linear fields in the projective hypermultiplet. The N=1 massive propagators of the component superfields in the projective hypermultiplet suggest a possible ansatz for the N=2 massive propagator, which agrees with an explicit calculation in N=2 superspace.
