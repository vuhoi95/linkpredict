Title: Unoriented Open-Closed String Field Theory
Authors: Taichiro Kugo and Tomohiko Takahashi
Abstract: The string field theory for unoriented open-closed string mixed system is constructed up to quadratic order based on the joining-splitting type vertices. The gauge invariance with closed string transformation parameter is proved. The infinity cancellation mechanism between disk and projective plane amplitudes plays an essential role for the gauge invariance of the theory.
