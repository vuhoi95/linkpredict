Title: Logarithmic conformal field theories with continuous weights
Authors: M. Khorrami and A. Aghamohammadi and M. R. Rahimi Tabar
Abstract: We study the logarithmic conformal field theories in which conformal weights are continuous subset of real numbers. A general relation between the correlators consisting of logarithmic fields and those consisting of ordinary conformal fields is investigated. As an example the correlators of the Coulomb-gas model are explicitly studied.
