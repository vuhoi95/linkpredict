Title: Superparticles, p-Form Coordinates and the BPS Condition
Authors: I. Rudychev and E. Sezgin
Abstract: A model for $n$ superparticles in $(d-n,n)$ dimensions is studied. The target space supersymmetry involves a product of $n$ momentum generators, and the action has $n(n+1)/2$ local bosonic symmetries and $n$ local fermionic symmetries. The precise relation between the symmetries presented here and those existing in the literature is explained. A new model is proposed for superparticles in arbitrary dimensions where coordinates are associated with all the $p$-form charges occuring in the superalgebra. The model naturally gives rise to the BPS condition for the charges.
