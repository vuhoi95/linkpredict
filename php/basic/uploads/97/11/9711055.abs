Title: Duality-Symmetric Eleven-Dimensional Supergravity and its Coupling to  M-Branes
Authors: Igor Bandos and Nathan Berkovits and Dmitri Sorokin
Abstract: The standard eleven-dimensional supergravity action depends on a three-form gauge field and does not allow direct coupling to five-branes. Using previously developed methods, we construct a covariant eleven-dimensional supergravity action depending on a three-form and six-form gauge field in a duality-symmetric manner. This action is coupled to both the M-theory two-brane and five-brane, and corresponding equations of motion are obtained. Consistent coupling relates D=11 duality properties with self-duality properties of the M-5-brane. From this duality-symmetric formulation, one can derive an action describing coupling of the M-branes to standard D=11 supergravity.
