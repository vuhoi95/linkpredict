Title: Coloring Random Triangulations
Authors: P. Di Francesco and B. Eynard and E. Guitter
Abstract: We introduce and solve a two-matrix model for the tri-coloring problem of the vertices of a random triangulation. We present three different solutions: (i) by orthogonal polynomial techniques (ii) by use of a discrete Hirota bilinear equation (iii) by direct expansion. The model is found to lie in the universality class of pure two-dimensional quantum gravity, despite the non-polynomiality of its potential.
