Title: Gauging the Central Charge
Authors: N. Dragon and U. Theis
Abstract: We gauge the central charge of the N=2 supersymmetry algebra in rigid superspace. The Fayet Sohnius hypermultiplet with gauged central charge coincides on-shell with N=2 supersymmetric electrodynamics. The gauge couplings of the vector-tensor multiplet turn out to be nonpolynomial.
