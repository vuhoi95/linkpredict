Abstract: We present some methods of determining explicit solutions for self-dual supermembranes in 4+1 and 8+1 dimensions with spherical or toroidal topology. For configurations of axial symmetry, the continuous SU(\infty) Toda equation turns out to play a central role, and a specific method of determining all the periodic solutions are suggested. A number of examples are studied in detail.
