Title: Gauge Dyonic Strings and Their Global Limit
Authors: M. J. Duff and J. Liu and H. Lu and C. N. Pope
Abstract: We show that six-dimensional supergravity coupled to tensor and Yang-Mills multiplets admits not one but two different theories as global limits, one of which was previously thought not to arise as a global limit and the other of which is new. The new theory has the virtue that it admits a global anti-self-dual string solution obtained as the limit of the curved-space gauge dyonic string, and can, in particular, describe tensionless strings. We speculate that this global model can also represent the worldvolume theory of coincident branes. We also discuss the Bogomol'nyi bounds of the gauge dyonic string and show that, contrary to expectations, zero eigenvalues of the Bogomol'nyi matrix do not lead to enhanced supersymmetry and that negative tension does not necessarily imply a naked singularity.
