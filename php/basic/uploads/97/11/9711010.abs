Title: The nondynamical r-matrix structure for the elliptic $A_{n-1}$  Calogero-Moser model
Authors: Bo-yu Hou and Wen-li Yang
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a new Lax operator for the elliptic $A_{n-1}$ Calogero-Moser model with general $n(2\leq n$) from the classical dynamical twisting,in which the corresponding r-matrix is purely numeric (nondynamical one). The nondynamical r-matrix structure of this Lax operator is obtained, which is elliptic $Z_n$-symmetric r-matrix.
