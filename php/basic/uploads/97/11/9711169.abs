Title: Absence of Zero Energy States in Reduced SU(N) 3d Supersymmetric Yang  Mills Theory
Authors: Jens Hoppe and Shing-Tung Yau
Abstract: For the SU(N) invariant supersymmetric matrix model related to membranes in 4 space-time dimensions we argue that <Psi,chi> = 0 for the previously obtained solution of Q chi = 0, Q^{dagger} Psi = 0.
