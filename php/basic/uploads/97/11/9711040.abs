Title: Oscillating D-Strings from IIB Matrix Theory
Authors: Anindya K. Biswas and Alok Kumar and Gautam Sengupta
Abstract: We present a class of BPS solutions of the IIB Matrix Theory which preserve 1/4 supersymmetry. The solutions desrcibe D-string configurations with left-moving oscillations. We demonstrate that the one-loop quantum effective action of Matrix Theory vanishes for this solution, confirming its BPS nature. We also study the world-volume gauge theory of oscillating strings and show its connection with static D-strings.
