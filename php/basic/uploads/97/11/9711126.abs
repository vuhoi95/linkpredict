Title: Chiral symmetry breaking in a uniform external magnetic field II.  Symmetry restoration at high temperatures and chemical potentials
Authors: D. -S. Lee and C. N. Leung and Y. J. Ng
Abstract: Chiral symmetry is dynamically broken in quenched, ladder QED at weak gauge couplings when an external magnetic field is present. In this paper, we show that chiral symmetry is restored above a critical chemical potential and the corresponding phase transition is of first order. In contrast, the chiral symmetry restoration at high temperatures (and at zero chemical potential) is a second order phase transition.
