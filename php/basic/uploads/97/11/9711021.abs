Title: Interaction of D-branes on orbifolds and massless particle emission
Authors: Faheem Hussain and Roberto Iengo and Carmen Nunez and Claudio A. Scrucca
Abstract: We discuss various D-brane configurations in 4-dimensional orbifold compactifications of type II superstring theory which are point-like 0-branes from the 4-dimensional space-time point of view. We analyze their interactions and compute the amplitude for the emission of a massless NSNS boson from them, in the case where the branes have a non vanishing relative velocity. In the large distance limit, we compare our computation to the expected field theory results, finding complete agreement.
