Title: Maxwell--Chern-Simons gauged non-relativistic O(3) model with self-dual  vortices
Authors: D. H. Tchrakian and T. N. Tomaras
Abstract: A non-relativistic version of the 2+1 dimensional gauged Chern-Simons O(3) sigma model, augmented by a Maxwell term, is presented and shown to support topologically stable static self-dual vortices. Exactly like their counterparts of the ungauged model, these vortices are shown to exhibit Hall behaviour in their dynamics.
