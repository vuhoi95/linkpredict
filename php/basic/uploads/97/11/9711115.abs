Title: Towards a Gravitational Analog to S-duality in Non-abelian Gauge  Theories
Authors: H. Garcia-Compean and O. Obregon and J. F. Plebanski and C. Ramirez
Abstract: For non-abelian non-supersymmetric gauge theories, generic dual theories have been constructed. In these theories the couplings appear inverted. However, they do not possess a Yang-Mills structure but rather are a kind of non-linear sigma model. It is shown that for a topological gravitational model an analog to this duality exists.
