Title: Towards a String Formulation of Vortex Dynamics
Authors: Elsebeth Schroder and Ola Tornkvist
Abstract: We derive an exact equation of motion for a non-relativistic vortex in two- and three-dimensional models with a complex field. The velocity is given in terms of gradients of the complex field at the vortex position. We discuss the problem of reducing the field dynamics to a closed dynamical system with non-locally interacting strings as the fundamental degrees of freedom.
