Title: Intersecting Branes in Matrix Theory
Authors: M. de Roo and S. Panda and J. P. van der Schaar
Abstract: We construct BPS states in the matrix description of M-theory. Starting from a set of basic M-theory branes, we study pair intersections which preserve supersymmetry. The fractions of the maximal supersymmetry obtained in this way are 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 3/16 and 1/16. In explicit examples we establish that the matrix BPS states correspond to (intersecting) brane configurations that are obtained from the d=11 supersymmetry algebra. This correspondence for the 1/2 supersymmetric branes includes the precise relations between the charges.
