Abstract: We calculate a temperature dependent part of the one-loop thermodynamic potential (and the free energy) for charged massive fields in a general class of irreducible rank 1 symmetric spaces. Both low- and high-temperature expansions are derived and the role of non-trivial topology influence on asymptotic properties of the potential is discussed.
