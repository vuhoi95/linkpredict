Title: The microscopic spectrum of the QCD Dirac operator with finite quark  masses
Authors: T. Wilke and T. Guhr and T. Wettig
Abstract: We compute the microscopic spectrum of the QCD Dirac operator in the presence of dynamical fermions in the framework of random-matrix theory for the chiral Gaussian unitary ensemble. We obtain results for the microscopic spectral correlators, the microscopic spectral density, and the distribution of the smallest eigenvalue for an arbitrary number of flavors, arbitrary quark masses, and arbitrary topological charge.
