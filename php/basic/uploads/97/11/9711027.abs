Title: Cos(M)ological Solutions in M- and String Theory
Authors: Nemanja Kaloper and Ian I. Kogan and Keith A. Olive
Abstract: We consider solutions to the cosmological equations of motion in 11 dimensions with and without 4-form charges. We show explicitly the correspondence between some of these solutions and known solutions in 10 dimensional string gravity. New solutions involving combinations of 4-form charges are explored. We also speculate on the possibility of removing curvature singularities present in 10D theories by oxidizing to 11D.
