Abstract: $D$ dimensional neutral black strings wrapped on a circle are related to $(D-1)$ dimensional charged black holes by boosts. We show that the boost has to be performed in the covering space and the boosted coordinate has to be compactified on a circle with a Lorentz contracted radius. Using this fact we show that the transition between Schwarzschild black holes to black p-branes observed recently in M theory is the well-known black hole- black string transition viewed in a boosted frame. In a similar way the correspondence point where an excited string state goes over to a neutral black hole is mapped exactly to the correspondence point for black p-branes. In terms of the $p$ brane quantities the equation of state for an excited string state becomes identical to that of a 3+1 dimensional massless gas for all $p$. Finally, we show how boosts can be used to relate Hawking radiation rates. Using the known microscopic derivation of absorption by extremal 3-branes and near-extremal 5D holes with three large charges we provide a microscopic derivation of absorption of 0-branes by seven and five dimensional Schwarzschild black holes in a certain regime.
