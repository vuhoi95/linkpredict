Abstract: In this paper the complete geometrical setting of (lowest order) abelian T-duality is explored with the help of some new geometrical tools (the reduced formalism). In particular, all invariant polynomials (the integrands of the characteristic classes) can be explicitly computed for the dual model in terms of quantities pertaining to the original one and with the help of the canonical connection whose intrinsic characterization is given. Using our formalism the physically, and T-duality invariant, relevant result that top forms are zero when there is an isometry without fixed points is easily proved.
