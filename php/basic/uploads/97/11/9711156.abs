Title: Grassmann Variables and Exact Solutions for Two-Dimensional Dimer Models
Authors: R. Hayn and V. N. Plechko
Abstract: We discuss some aspects of a new noncombinatorial fermionic approach to the two-dimensional dimer problem in statistical mechanics based on the integration over anticommuting Grassmann variables and factorization ideas for dimer density matrix. The dimer partition function can be expressed as a Gaussian fermionic integral. For regular lattices, the analytic solution then follows by passing to the momentum space for fermions.
