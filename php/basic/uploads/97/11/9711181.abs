Title: Non-Abelian Solitons in N=4 Gauged Supergravity and Leading Order String  Theory
Authors: Ali H. Chamseddine and Mikhail S. Volkov
Abstract: We study static, spherically symmetric, and purely magnetic solutions of the N=4 gauged supergravity in four dimensions. A systematic analysis of the supersymmetry conditions reveals solutions which preserve 1/4 of the supersymmetries and are characterized by a BPS-monopole-type gauge field and a globally hyperbolic, everywhere regular geometry. We show that the theory in which these solutions arise can be obtained via compactification of ten-dimensional supergravity on the group manifold. This result is then used to lift the solutions to ten dimensions.
