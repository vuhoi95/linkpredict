Title: Strongly coupled U(1) lattice gauge theory as a microscopic model of  Yukawa theory
Authors: W. Franzki and J. Jersak
Abstract: Dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in a strongly coupled U(1) lattice gauge model with charged fermions and scalar is investigated by numerical simulation. Several composite neutral states are observed, in particular a massive fermion. In the vicinity of the tricritical point of this model we study the effective Yukawa coupling between this fermion and the Goldstone boson. The perturbative triviality bound of Yukawa models is nearly saturated. The theory is quite similar to strongly coupled Yukawa models for sufficiently large coupling except the occurrence of an additional state -- a gauge ball of mass about half the mass of the fermion.
