Title: Rotational Invariance in the M(atrix) Formulation of Type IIB Theory
Authors: Savdeep Sethi and Leonard Susskind
Abstract: The matrix model formulation of M-theory can be generalized by compactification to ten-dimensional type II string theory, formulated in the infinite momentum frame. Both the type IIA and IIB string theories can be formulated in this way. In the M-theory and type IIA cases, the transverse rotational invariance is manifest, but in the IIB case, one of the transverse dimensions materializes in a completely different way from the other seven. The full O(8) rotational symmetry then follows in a surprising way from the electric-magnetic duality of supersymmetric Yang-Mills field theory.
