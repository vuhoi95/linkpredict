Title: Principal Bundles and the Dixmier Douady Class
Authors: Alan L. Carey and Diarmuid Crowley and Michael K. Murray
Abstract: A systematic consideration of the problem of the reduction and extension of the structure group of a principal bundle is made and a variety of techniques in each case are explored and related to one another. We apply these to the study of the Dixmier-Douady class in various contexts including string structures, U-res bundles and other examples motivated by considerations from quantum field theory.
