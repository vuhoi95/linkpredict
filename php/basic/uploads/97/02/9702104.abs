Title: Equivalence between Schwinger and Dirac schemes of quantization
Authors: N. Ogawa and K. Fujii and H. Miyazaki and N. Chepilko and T. Okazaki
Abstract: This paper introduces the modified version of Schwinger's quantization method, in which the information on constraints and the choice of gauge conditions are included implicitly in the choice of variations used in quantization scheme. A proof of equivalence between Schwinger- and Dirac-methods for constraint systems is given.
