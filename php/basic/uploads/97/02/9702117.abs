Title: 't Hooft's Order-Disorder Parameters and the Dual Potential
Authors: H. M. Chan and S. T. Tsou
Abstract: It is shown that the operator $B(C) = Tr [P \exp i \tilde{g} \oint \tilde{A}_i(x) dx^i]$ constructed with the recently derived dual potential $\tilde{A}(x)$ and a coupling $\tilde{g}$ related to $g$ by the Dirac quantization condition satisfies the correct commutation relation with the Wilson operator $Tr [P \exp ig \oint A_i(x) dx^i]$ as required by 't Hooft for his order-disorder parameters.
