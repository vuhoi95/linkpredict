Title: On a possible new R^2 theory of supergravity
Authors: Tobias Hurth and Peter van Nieuwenhuizen and Andrew Waldron and Christian Preitschopf
Abstract: We consider a new MacDowell-Mansouri R^2-type of supergravity theory, an extension of conformal supergravity, based on the superalgebra Osp(1|8). Invariance under local symmetries with negative Weyl weight is achieved by imposing chirality-duality and double-duality constraints on curvatures, along with the usual constraint of vanishing supertorsion. An analysis of the remaining gauge symmetries shows that those with vanishing Weyl weight are invariances of the action at the linearized level. For the symmetries with positive Weyl weight we find that invariance of the action would require further modifications of the transformation rules. This conclusion is supported by a kinematical analysis of the closure of the gauge algebra.
