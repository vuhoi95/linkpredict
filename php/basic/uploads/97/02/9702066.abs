Abstract: The algebra of observables for identical particles on a line is formulated starting from postulated basic commutation relations. A realization of this algebra in the Calogero model was previously known. New realizations are presented here in terms of differentiation operators and in terms of SU(N)-invariant observables of the Hermitian matrix models. Some particular structure properties of the algebra are briefly discussed.
