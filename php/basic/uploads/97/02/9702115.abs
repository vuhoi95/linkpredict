Title: Partial Spontaneous Breaking of Global Supersymmetry
Authors: H. Partouche and B. Pioline
Abstract: We review in detail the recently discovered phenomenon of partial spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry in the case of a N=2 pure gauge U(1) theory, and recall how the standard lore no-go theorem is evaded. We discuss the extension of this mechanism to theories with charged matter, and surprisingly find that the gauging forbids the existence of a magnetic Fayet-Iliopoulos term.
