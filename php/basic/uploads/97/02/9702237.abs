Title: M-theory Inspired No-scale Supergravity
Authors: T. Li and J. Lopez and D. Nanopoulos
Abstract: We propose a supergravity model that contains elements recently shown to arise in the strongly-coupled limit of the $E_8\times E_8$ heterotic string (M-theory), including a no-scale--like K\"ahler potential, the identification of the string scale with the gauge coupling unification scale, and the onset of supersymmetry breaking at an intermediate scale determined by the size of the eleventh dimension of M-theory. We also study the phenomenological consequences of such scenario, which include a rather constrained sparticle spectrum within the reach of present-generation particle accelerators.
