Title: The Size of a Polymer of String-Bits: A Numerical Investigation
Authors: O. Bergman and C. B. Thorn
Abstract: In string-bit models, string is described as a polymer of point-like constituents. We attempt to use string-bit ideas to investigate how the size of string is affected by string interactions in a non-perturbative context. Lacking adequate methods to deal with the full complications of bit rearrangement interactions, we study instead a simplified analog model with only ``direct'' potential interactions among the bits. We use the variational principle in an approximate calculation of the mean-square size of a polymer as a function of the number of constituents/bits for various interaction strengths g in three specific models.
