Title: Matrix Ernst potentials for EMDA with multiple vector fields
Authors: D. V. Gal'tsov and S. A. Sharakin
Abstract: We show that the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion system with multiple vector fields (bosonic sector of the D=4, N=4 supergravity) restricted to spacetimes possessing a non-null Killing vector field admits a concise representation in terms of the Ernst-type matrix valued potentials. A constructive derivation of the SWIP solutions is given and a colliding waves counterpart of the DARN-NUT solution is obtained. SU(m,m) chiral representation of the two-dimensionally reduced system is derived and the corresponding Kramer-Neugebauer-type map is presented.
