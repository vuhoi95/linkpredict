Abstract: We investigate the relation between on-shell and zero-momentum non-perturbative quantities entering the parametrization of the two-point Green's function of two-dimensional non-linear O(N) sigma models. We present accurate estimates of ratios of mass-scales and renormalization constants, obtained by an analysis of the strong-coupling expansion of the two-point Green's function. These ratios allow to connect exact known on-shell results with typical zero-momentum lattice evaluations. Our results are supported by the 1/N-expansion.
