Abstract: We develop an operator formalism to compute scattering amplitudes of arbitrary bosonic string states in the background of many D-branes. Specifically, we construct a suitable boundary state which we use to saturate the multi-Reggeon vertex in order to obtain the generator of multi-membrane scattering amplitudes. We explicitly show that the amplitudes with $h$ parallel D-branes are similar to amplitudes with $h-1$ open string loops.
