Title: Duality Symmetry in the Schwarz-Sen Model
Authors: H. O. Girotti and M. Gomes and V. O. Rivelles and A. J. da Silva
Abstract: The continuous extension of the discrete duality symmetry of the Schwarz-Sen model is studied. The corresponding infinitesimal generator $Q$ turns out to be local, gauge invariant and metric independent. Furthermore, $Q$ commutes with all the conformal group generators. We also show that $Q$ is equivalent to the non---local duality transformation generator found in the Hamiltonian formulation of Maxwell theory. We next consider the Batalin--Fradkin-Vilkovisky formalism for the Maxwell theory and demonstrate that requiring a local duality transformation lead us to the Schwarz--Sen formulation. The partition functions are shown to be the same which implies the quantum equivalence of the two approaches.
