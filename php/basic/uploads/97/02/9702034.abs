Title: Bubble collisions in SU(2)xU(1) gauge theory and the production of  non-topological strings
Authors: P. M. Saffin and E. J. Copeland
Abstract: We extend work done previously concerning the formation of vortices in a U(1)->1 gauge theory at a first order phase transition to the symmetry breaking SU(2)xU(1)->U(1). It is shown that the collision of bubbles, appearing at the phase transition, allow the possibility for forming non-topological strings associated with the gauge group. The method used also shows clearly how these vortices are related to the Nielsen-Olesen vortices.
