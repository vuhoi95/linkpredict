Title: Twisted Baryon Number in N=2 Supersymmetric QCD
Authors: J. M. F. Labastida and M. Marino
Abstract: We show that the baryon number of N=2 supersymmetric QCD can be twisted in order to couple the topological field theory of non-abelian monopoles to $Spin^c$-structures. To motivate the construction, we also consider some aspects of the twisting procedure as a gauging of global currents in two and four dimensions, in particular the role played by anomalies.
