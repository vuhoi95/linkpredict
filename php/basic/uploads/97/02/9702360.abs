Title: N=1 Supersymmetric Cosmic Strings
Authors: Stephen C. Davis and Anne-Christine Davis and Mark Trodden
Abstract: We investigate the microphysics of supersymmetric cosmic strings. In particular we focus on the vortices admitted by N=1 supersymmetric abelian Higgs models. We find the vortex solutions and demonstrate that the two simplest supersymmetric cosmic string models admit fermionic superconductivity. Further, by using supersymmetry transformations, we show how to solve for the fermion zero modes giving rise to string superconductivity in terms of the background string fields.
