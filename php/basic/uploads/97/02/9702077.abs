Authors: I. Ya. Aref'eva and M. G. Ivanov and O. A. Rytchkov
Abstract: General properties of intersecting extremal p-brane solutions of gravity coupled with dilatons and several different d-form fields in arbitrary space-time dimensions are considered. It is show that heuristically expected properties of the intersecting p-branes follow from the explicit formulae for solutions. In particular, harmonic superposition and S-duality hold for all p-brane solutions. Generalized T-duality takes place under additional restrictions on the initial theory parameters .
