Title: Geometry of N=1 Dualities in Four Dimensions
Authors: Hirosi Ooguri and Cumrun Vafa
Abstract: We discuss how N=1 dualities in four dimensions are geometrically realized by wrapping D-branes about 3-cycles of Calabi-Yau threefolds. In this setup the N=1 dualities for SU, SO and USp gauge groups with fundamental fields get mapped to statements about the monodromy and relations among 3-cycles of Calabi-Yau threefolds. The connection between the theory and its dual requires passing through configurations which are T-dual to the well-known phenomenon of decay of BPS states in N=2 field theories in four dimensions. We compare our approach to recent works based on configurations of D-branes in the presence of NS 5-branes and give simple classical geometric derivations of various exotic dynamics involving D-branes ending on NS-branes.
