Title: Quasiclassical Limit in q-Deformed Systems, Noncommutativity and the  q-Path Integral
Authors: M. Chaichian and A. Demichev and P. P. Kulish
Abstract: Different analogs of quasiclassical limit for a q-oscillator which result in different (commutative and non-commutative) algebras of ``classical'' observables are derived. In particular, this gives the q-deformed Poisson brackets in terms of variables on the quantum planes. We consider the Hamiltonian made of special combination of operators (the analog of even operators in Grassmann algebra) and discuss q-path integrals constructed with the help of contracted ``classical'' algebras.
