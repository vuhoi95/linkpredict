Title: Algebraic Quantization on the Torus and Modular Invariance
Authors: J. Guerrero and V. Aldaya and M. Calixto
Abstract: New features of systems with non-trivial topology such as fractional quantum numbers, inequivalent quantizations, good operators, topological anomalies, etc. are described in the framework of an algebraic quantization procedure on a group. Modular invariance naturally appears as a subgroup of good operators in the particular case of the torus.
