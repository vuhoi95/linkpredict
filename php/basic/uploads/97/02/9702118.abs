Title: Vortices and domain walls in a Chern-Simons theory with magnetic moment  interaction
Authors: Armando Antillon and Joaquin Escalona and Manuel Torres
Abstract: We study the structure and properties of vortices in a recently proposed Abelian Maxwell-Chern-Simons model in $2 +1 $ dimensions. The model which is described by gauge field interacting with a complex scalar field, includes two parity and time violating terms: the Chern-Simons and the anomalous magnetic terms. Self-dual relativistic vortices are discussed in detail. We also find one dimensional soliton solutions of the domain wall type. The vortices are correctly described by the domain wall solutions in the large flux limit.
