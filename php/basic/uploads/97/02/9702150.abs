Title: Universal Functions in Euclidean Quantum Gravity
Authors: Ivan G. Avramidi and Giampiero Esposito
Abstract: A key problem in the attempt to quantize the gravitational field is the choice of boundary conditions. These are mixed, in that spatial and normal components of metric perturbations obey different sets of boundary conditions. In the covariant quantization scheme this leads to a boundary operator involving both normal and tangential derivatives of metric perturbations. On studying the corresponding heat-kernel asymptotics, one finds that universal, tensorial, nonpolynomial structures contribute through the integrals over the boundary of linear combinations of all geometric invariants of the problem. These universal functions are independent of conformal rescalings of the background metric, and they might lead to a deep revolution in the current understanding of quantum gravity.
