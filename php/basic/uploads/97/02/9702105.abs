Title: Supersymmetry breaking and weakly vs. strongly coupled string theory
Authors: Pierre Binetruy and Mary K. Gaillard and Yi-Yen Wu
Abstract: In the context of the field theory limit of superstrings, we consider an almost realistic model of supersymmetry breaking by gaugino condensation which includes, through nonperturbative corrections to the K\"ahler potential, dilaton stabilization at a value compatible with a weak coupling regime. Invariance under modular transformations is ensured through a Green-Schwarz term and string threshold corrections, which lead to moduli stabilization at the self-dual point. We are thus in a position to discuss several issues of physical relevance: gravitino, dilaton and moduli masses, axion, soft supersymmetry breaking parameters and gauge coupling unification.
