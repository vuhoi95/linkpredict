Title: Generalized canonical quantization of bosonic string model in massive  background fields
Authors: I. L. Buchbinder and V. D. Pershin and G. B. Toder
Abstract: A method of constructing a canonical gauge invariant quantum formulation for a non-gauge classical theory depending on a set of parameters is advanced and then applied to the theory of closed bosonic string interacting with massive background fields. It is shown that within the proposed formulation the correct linear equations of motion for background fields arise.
