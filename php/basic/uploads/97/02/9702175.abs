Title: Anomaly Problem in a Simple Model Analogous to the Lightcone-Gauge  Two-Dimensional Quantum Gravity
Authors: Mitsuo Abe and Noboru Nakanishi
Abstract: It was found in the two-dimensional quantum gravity both in the de Donder gauge and in the lightcone gauge that one of field equations breaks down at the level of the representation, though the breakdown is very little. It is shown that this anomalous behavior occurs also in a very simple model analogous to the lightcone-gauge two-dimensional quantum gravity. This model, however, can be transformed into a free field theory by a nonsingular transformation. Of course, the latter has no anomaly. The cause of the discrepancy is analyzed.
