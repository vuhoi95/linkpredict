Title: Interaction of Non-Abelian Monopole with External Field
Authors: V. G. Kiselev and Ya. M. Shnir
Abstract: The interaction of a nontrivial topological field configuration with the external fields is considered. The approach is based on the calculation of the zero modes excitation probability. We consider the interaction of the t'Hooft-Polyakov monopole with an external weak uniform magnetic field and the field of another monopole.
