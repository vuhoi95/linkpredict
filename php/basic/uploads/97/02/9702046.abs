Title: Geometry Associated with Self-dual Yang-Mills and the Chiral Model  Approaches to Self-dual Gravity
Authors: Hugo Garcia-Compean and Jerzy F. Plebanski and Maciej Przanowski
Abstract: A geometric formulation of the Moyal deformation for the Self-dual Yang-Mills theory and the Chiral Model approach to Self-dual gravity is given. We find in Fedosov's geometrical construction of deformation quantization the natural geometrical framework associated to the Moyal deformation of the six-dimensional version of the second heavenly equation and the Park-Husain heavenly equation. The Wess-Zumino-Witten-like Lagrangian of Self-dual gravity is re-examined within this context.
