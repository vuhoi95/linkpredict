Title: Coordinate-Free Quantization of Second-Class Constraints
Authors: John R. Klauder and Sergei V. Shabanov
Abstract: The conversion of second-class constraints into first-class constraints is used to extend the coordinate-free path integral quantization, achieved by a flat-space Brownian motion regularization of the coherent-state path integral measure, to systems with second-class constraints.
