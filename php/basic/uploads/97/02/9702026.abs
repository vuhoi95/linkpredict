Title: Twisted h-spacetimes and invariant equations
Authors: J. A. de Azc√°rraga and P. P. Kulish and F. Rodenas
Abstract: We analyze the h-deformations of the Lorentz group and their associated spacetimes. We prove that they have a twisted character and give explicitly the twisting matrices. After studying the representations of one of the deformed spacetime algebras, we discuss the Klein-Gordon operator. It is found that the h-deformed d'Alembertian has plane wave solutions of the same form as the standard ones. We also give explicit expressions for the h-gamma matrices defining the associated Dirac equations.
