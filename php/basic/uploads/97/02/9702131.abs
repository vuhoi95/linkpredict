Title: Classical Electrodynamics of a Particle with Maximal Acceleration  Corrections
Authors: A. Feoli and G. Lambiase and G. Papini and G. Scarpetta
Abstract: We calculate the first order maximal acceleration corrections to the classical electrodynamics of a particle in external electromagnetic fields. These include additional dissipation terms, the presence of a critical electric field, a correction to the cyclotron frequency of an electron in a constant magnetic field and the power radiated by the particle. The electric effects are sizeble at the fields that are considered attainable with ultrashort $TW$ laser pulses on plasmas.
