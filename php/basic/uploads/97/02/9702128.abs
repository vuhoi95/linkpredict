Abstract: We consider exactly solvable 1d multi-band fermionic Hamiltonians, which have affine quantum group symmetry for all values of the deformation. The simplest Hamiltonian is a multi-band t-J model with vanishing spin-spin interaction, which is the affinization of an underlying XXZ model. We also find a multi-band generalization of standard t-J model Hamiltonian.
