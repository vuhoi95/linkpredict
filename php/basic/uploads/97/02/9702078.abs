Title: Nonabelian Fields in Exact String Solutions
Authors: M. Z. Iofa and and L. A. Pando Zayas
Abstract: Within the framework of "anomalously gauged" Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models, we construct solutions which include nonabelian fields. Both compact and noncompact groups are discussed. In the case of compact groups, as an example of background containing nonabelian fields, we discuss conformal theory on the $SO(4)/SO(3)$ coset, which is the natural generalization of the 2D monopole theory corresponding to the $SO(3)/SO(2)$ coset. In noncompact case, we consider examples with $SO(2,1)/SO(1,1)$ and $SO(3,2)/SO(3,1)$ cosets.
