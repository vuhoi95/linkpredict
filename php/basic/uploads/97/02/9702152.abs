Title: Applications of the Collective Field Theory for the Calogero-Sutherland  Model
Authors: Diptiman Sen and R. K. Bhaduri
Abstract: We use the collective field theory known for the Calogero-Sutherland model to study a variety of low-energy properties. These include the ground state energy in a confining potential upto the two leading orders in the particle number, the dispersion relation of sound modes with a comparison to the two leading terms in the low temperature specific heat, large amplitude waves, and single soliton solutions. The two-point correlation function derived from the dispersion relation of the sound mode only gives its nonoscillatory asymptotic behavior correctly, demonstrating that the theory is applicable only for the low-energy and long wavelength excitations of the system.
