Title: Gauge Boson and Fermion Masses Without a Higgs Field
Authors: Angus F. Nicholson and Dallas C. Kennedy
Abstract: A simple, anomaly-free chiral gauge theory can be perturbatively quantised and renormalised in such a way as to generate fermion and gauge boson masses. This development exploits certain freedoms inherent in choosing the unperturbed Lagrangian and in the renormalisation procedure. Apart from its intrinsic interest, such a mechanism might be employed in electroweak gauge theory to generate fermion and gauge boson masses without a Higgs sector.
