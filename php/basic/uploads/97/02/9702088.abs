Title: Dynamical Description of Spectral Flow in N=2 Superconformal Field  Theories
Authors: Leith Cooper and Ian I. Kogan and Richard J. Szabo
Abstract: We show how the spectral flow between the Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond sectors of N=2 superconformal field theories can be described in three dimensions in terms of the propagation of charged particles coupled to a a Chern-Simons gauge theory. Quantum mechanical mixing between the degenerate Chern-Simons vacua interpolates between the different boundary conditions of the two sectors and so provides a dynamical picture for the GSO-projection.
