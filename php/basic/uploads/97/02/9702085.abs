Title: 3-Cocycles and the Operator Product Expansion
Authors: Javier P. Muniain and Jose Wudka
Abstract: Anomalous contributions to the Jacobi identity of chromo-electric fields and non-Abelian vector currents are calculated using a non-perturbative approach that combines operator product expansion and a generalization of Bjorken-Johnson-Low limit. The failure of the Jacobi identity and the associated 3-cocycles are discussed.
