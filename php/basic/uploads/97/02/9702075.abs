Title: High Energy Effects on D-Brane and Black Hole Emission Rates
Authors: Saurya Das and Arundhati Dasgupta and Tapobrata Sarkar
Abstract: We study the emission of scalar particles from a class of near-extremal five dimensional black holes and the corresponding D-brane configuration at high energies. We show that the distribution functions and the black hole greybody factors are modified in the high energy tail of the Hawking spectrum in such way that the emission rates exactly match. We extend the results to charged scalar emission and to four dimensions.
