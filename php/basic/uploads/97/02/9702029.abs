Abstract: We find the static vortex solutions of the model of Maxwell-Chern-Simons gauge field coupled to a (2+1)-dimensional four-fermion theory. Especially, we introduce two matter currents coupled to the gauge field minimally: the electromagnetic current and a topological current associated with the electromagnetic current. Unlike other Chern-Simons solitons the N-soliton solution of this theory has binding energy and the stability of the solutions is maintained by the charge conservation laws.
