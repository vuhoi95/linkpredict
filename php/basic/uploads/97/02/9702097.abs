Authors: I. L. Buchbinder and T. Inagaki and S. D. Odintsov
Abstract: We investigate the effect of an external gravitational fields to the chiral symmetry breaking in the SUSY (supersymmetric) NJL (Nambu-Jona-Lasinio) model non-minimally interacting with external supergravity. Evaluating the effective potential in the leading order of the $1/N_{c}$-expansion and in the linear curvature approximation it is found the possibility of the chiral symmetry breaking in the SUSY NJL model in an external gravitational fields. In the broken phase the dynamically generated mass is analytically and numerically calculated.
