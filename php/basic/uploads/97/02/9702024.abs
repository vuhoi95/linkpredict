Title: Symplectic Structures and Self -dual Fields in (4k+2) Dimensions
Authors: Ioannis Giannakis and V. P. Nair
Abstract: We discuss symplectic structures for the chiral boson in (1+1) dimensions and the self-dual field in (4k+2) dimensions. Dimensional reduction of the six-dimensional field on a torus is also considered.
