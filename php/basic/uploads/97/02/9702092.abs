Title: Application of the Worldline Path Integral Method to the Calculation of  Inverse Mass Expansions
Authors: D. Fliegner and P. Haberl and M. G. Schmidt and C. Schubert
Abstract: Higher order coefficients of the inverse mass expansion of one-loop effective actions are obtained from a one-dimensional path integral representation. For the case of a massive scalar loop in the background of both a scalar potential and a (non Abelian) gauge field explicit results to $O(T^5)$ in the proper time parameter are presented.
