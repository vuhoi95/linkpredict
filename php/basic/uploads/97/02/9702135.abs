Title: Generalized Stochastic Gauge Fixing
Authors: Helmuth Huffel and Gerald Kelnhofer
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the stochastic gauge fixing procedure for the stochastic quantization of gauge theories where not only the drift term of the stochastic process is changed but also the Wiener process itself. All gauge invariant expectation values remain unchanged. As an explicit example we study the case of an abelian gauge field coupled with three bosonic matter fields in 0+1 dimensions. We nonperturbatively prove quivalence with the path integral formalism.
