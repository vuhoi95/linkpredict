Title: Asymptotic freedom in a scalar field theory on the lattice
Authors: K. Langfeld and H. Reinhardt
Abstract: An alternative model to the trivial $\phi^4$-theory of the standard model of weak interactions is suggested, which embodies the Higgs-mechanism, but is free of the conceptual problems of standard $\phi ^4$-theory. We propose a N-component, O(N)-symmetric scalar field theory, which is originally defined on the lattice. The model can be motivated from SU(2) gauge theory. Thereby the scalar field arises as a gauge invariant degree of freedom. The scalar lattice model is analytically solved in the large N limit. The continuum limit is approached via an asymptotically free scaling. The renormalized theory evades triviality, and furthermore gives rise to a dynamically formed mass of the scalar particle.
