Abstract: The method of differential renormalization is extended to the calculation of the one-loop graviton and gravitino corrections to $(g-2)_l$ in unbroken supergravity. Rewriting the singular contributions of all the diagrams in terms of only one singular function, U(1) gauge invariance and supersymmetry are preserved. We compare this calculation with previous ones which made use of momentum space regularization (renormalization) methods.
