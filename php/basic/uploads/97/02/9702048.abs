Abstract: We propose and canonically quantize a generalization of the two-dimensional massive fermion theory described by a Lagrangian containing third-order derivatives. In our approach the mass term contains a derivative coupling. The quantum solution is expressed in terms of three usual fermions. Employing the standard bosonization scheme, the equivalent boson theory is derived. The results obtained are used to solve a theory including a current-current interaction.
