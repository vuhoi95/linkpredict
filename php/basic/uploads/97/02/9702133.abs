Title: Dual D-Brane Actions
Authors: Mina Aganagic and Jaemo Park and Costin Popescu and John H. Schwarz
Abstract: Dual super Dp-brane actions are constructed by carrying out a duality transformation of the world-volume U(1) gauge field. The resulting world-volume actions, which contain a (p - 2)-form gauge field, are shown to have the expected properties. Specifically, the D1-brane and D3-brane transform in ways that can be understood on the basis of the SL(2, Z) duality of type IIB superstring theory. Also, the D2-brane and the D4-brane transform in ways that are expected on the basis of the relationship between type IIA superstring theory and 11d M theory. For example, the dual D4-brane action is shown to coincide with the double-dimensional reduction of the recently constructed M5-brane action. The implications for gauge-fixed D-brane actions are discussed briefly.
