Title: The Six Dimensional Self-Dual Tensor
Authors: P. S. Howe and E. Sezgin and P. C. West
Abstract: The equations of motion for a self-interacting self-dual tensor in six dimensions are extracted from the equations describing the M-theory five-brane. These equations are presented in a self-contained, six-dimensional Lorentz-covariant form. In particular, it is shown that the field-strength tensor satisfies a non-linear generalised self-duality constraint. The self-duality equation is rewritten in five-dimensional notation and shown to be identical to the corresponding equation in the non-covariant formalism.
