Title: On the Wavefunctional for Two Heavy Color Sources in Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Peter E. Haagensen and Kenneth Johnson
Abstract: In an abelian gauge theory, the Coulombic potential between two static charges is obtained most directly when a correct separation between gauge-invariant and gauge degrees of freedom is made. This motivates a similar separation in the nonabelian theory. When a careful identification of the Hilbert space is made, along with the proper analyticity requirements, it is then possible to find the appropriate wavefunctionals describing heavy color sources in the theory. This treatment is consistent with, and realizes in a simple way the center symmetry Z_N of SU(N) gauge theories.
