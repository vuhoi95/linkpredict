Title: M(atrix)-Theory in Various Dimensions
Authors: David Berenstein and Richard Corrado
Abstract: We demonstrate the precise numerical correspondence between long range scattering of supergravitons and membranes in supergravity in the infinite momentum frame and in M(atrix)-Theory, both in 11 dimensions and for toroidal compactifications. We also identify wrapped membranes in terms of topological invariants of the vector bundles associated to the field theory description of compactified M(atrix)-Theory. We use these results to check the realization of T-duality in M(atrix)-Theory.
