Title: p-brane Taxonomy
Authors: H. Lu and C. N. Pope
Abstract: We review an approach to the construction and classification of p-brane solitons in arbitrary dimensions, with an emphasis on those that arise in toroidally-compactified M-theory. Procedures for constructing the low-energy supergravity limits in arbitrary dimensions, and for studying the supersymmetry properties of the solitons are presented. Wide classes of p-brane solutions are obtained, and their properties and classification in terms of bound states and intersections of M-branes are described. (Based on lectures presented at the Summer School in High-Energy Physics and Cosmology, Trieste, Italy, 10 Jun - 26 Jul 1996.)
