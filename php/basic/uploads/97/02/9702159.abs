Title: Critical behavior for the dilaton black holes
Authors: Rong-Gen Cai and Y. S. Myung
Abstract: We study the critical behavior in the black p-branes and four dimensional charged dilaton black holes. We calculate the thermodynamic fluctuations in the various (microcanonical, canonical, and grandcanonical) ensembles. It is found that the extremal limit of some black configurations has a critical point and a phase transition takes place from the extremal to nonextremal black configurations. Some critical exponents are obtained, which satisfy the scaling laws. This is related to the fact that the entropy of these black configurations is a homogeneous function.
