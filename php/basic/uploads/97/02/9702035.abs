Title: Feynman rules and beta-function for the BF Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Maurizio Martellini and Mauro Zeni
Abstract: Yang-Mills theory in the first order formalism appears as the deformation of a topological field theory, the pure BF theory. We discuss this formulation at the quantum level, giving the Feynman rules of the BF-YM theory, the structure of the renormalization and checking its uv-behaviour in the computation of the beta-function which agrees with the expected result.
