Title: Equivalence of renormalized covariant and light-front perturbation  theory: I. Longitudinal divergences in the Yukawa model
Authors: N. C. J. Schoonderwoerd and B. L. G. Bakker
Abstract: Light-front perturbation theory has been proposed as an alternative to covariant perturbation theory. Light-front perturbation theory is only acceptable if it produces invariant S-matrix elements. Doubts have been raised concerning the equivalence of light-front and covariant perturbation theory. One of the obstacles to a rigorous proof of equivalence is the occurrence of longitudinal divergences not present in covariant perturbation theory. We show in the case of the Yukawa model of fermions interacting with scalar bosons at the one-loop level how to deal with the longitudinal divergences. Invariant S-matrix elements are obtained using our method.
