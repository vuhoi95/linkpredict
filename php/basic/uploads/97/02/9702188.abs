Title: On the Connection Between 2d Topological Gravity and the Reduced  Hermitian Matrix Model
Authors: J. Ambjorn and M. G. Harris and M. Weis
Abstract: We discuss how concepts such as geodesic length and the volume of space-time can appear in 2d topological gravity. We then construct a detailed mapping between the reduced Hermitian matrix model and 2d topological gravity at genus zero. This leads to a complete solution of the counting problem for planar graphs with vertices of even coordination number. The connection between multi-critical matrix models and multi-critical topological gravity at genus zero is studied in some detail.
