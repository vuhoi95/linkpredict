Title: Renormalization Theory for the Self-Avoiding Polymerized Membranes
Authors: Francois David and Bertrand Duplantier and Emmanuel Guitter
Abstract: We prove the renormalizability of the generalized Edwards model for self-avoiding polymerized membranes. This is done by use of a short distance multilocal operator product expansion, which extends the methods of local field theories to a large class of models with non-local singular interactions. This ensures the existence of scaling laws for crumpled self-avoiding membranes, and validates the direct renormalization method used for polymers and membranes. This also provides a framework for explicit perturbative calculations. We discuss hyperscaling relations for the configuration exponent and contact exponents. We finally consider membranes with long range interactions and at the Theta-point.
