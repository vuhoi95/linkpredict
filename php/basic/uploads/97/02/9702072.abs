Title: Short Distance Properties from Large Distance Behaviour
Authors: Paul Mansfield and Marcos Sampaio and Jiannis Pachos
Abstract: For slowly varying fields the vacuum functional of a quantum field theory may be expanded in terms of local functionals. This expansion satisfies its own form of the Schr\"odinger equation from which the expansion coefficents can be found. For scalar field theory in 1+1 dimensions we show that this approach correctly reproduces the short-distance properties as contained in the counter-terms. We also describe an approximate simplification that occurs for the Sine-Gordon and Sinh-Gordon vacuum functionals.
