Title: Field-Theoretic Techniques in the Study of Critical Phenomena
Authors: C. Bagnuls and C. Bervillier
Abstract: We shortly illustrate how the field-theoretic approach to critical phenomena takes place in the more complete Wilson theory of renormalization and qualitatively discuss its domain of validity. By the way, we suggest that the differential renormalization functions (like the beta-function) of the perturbative scalar theory in four dimensions should be Borel summable provided they are calculated within a minimal subtraction scheme.
