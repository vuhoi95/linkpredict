Title: Expectation values of boundary fields in the boundary sine-Gordon model
Authors: V. Fateev and S. Lukyanov and A. Zamolodchikov and Al. Zamolodchikov
Abstract: We propose an explicit expression for vacuum expectation values of the boundary field e^{ia\phi_{B}} in the boundary sine-Gordon model with zero bulk mass. This expression agrees with known exact results for the boundary free energy and with perturbative calculations.
