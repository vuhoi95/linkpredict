Title: Gravitational Dressing of N=2 Sigma-Models Beyond Leading Order
Authors: S. Penati and A. Santambrogio and D. Zanon
Abstract: We study the beta-function of the N=2 sigma-model coupled to N=2 induced supergravity. We compute corrections to first order in the semiclassical limit, $c \to -\infty$, beyond one-loop in the matter fields. As compared to the corresponding bosonic, metric sigma-model calculation, we find new types of contributions arising from the dilaton coupling automatically accounted for, once the K\"ahler potential is coupled to N=2 supergravity.
