Title: BPS-Saturated Bound States of Tilted P-Branes in Type II String Theory
Authors: Klaus Behrndt and Mirjam Cvetic
Abstract: We found BPS-saturated solutions of M-theory and Type II string theory which correspond to (non-marginally) bound states of p-branes intersecting at angles different from pi/2. These solutions are obtained by starting with a BPS marginally bound (orthogonally) intersecting configurations of two p-branes (e.g, two four-branes of Type II string theory), performing a boost transformation at an angle with respect to the world-volume of the configuration, performing T-duality transformation along the boost-direction, S-duality transformation, and T- transformations along the direction perpendicular to the boost transformation. The resulting configuration is non-marginally bound BPS-saturated solution whose static metric possesses the off-diagonal term which cannot be removed by a coordinate transformation, and thus signifies an angle (different from pi/2) between the resulting intersecting p-branes. Additional new p-branes are bound to this configuration, in order to ensure the stability of such a static, tilted configuration.
