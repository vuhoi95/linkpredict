Title: On the Stability of the GPS Magnetic Monopole Solution
Authors: Bj√∏rn Jensen and Parviz H. Mani
Abstract: The question of the stability of the four dimensional Gross-Perry-Sorkin Kaluza-Klein magnetic monopole solution is investigated within the framework of a N=2, D=5 supergravity theory. We show that this solution does not support a spin structure of the Killing type and is therefore, contrary to previous expectations, not necessarily stable.
