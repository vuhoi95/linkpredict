Title: Large-N supersymmetric beta-functions
Authors: P. M. Ferreira and I. Jack and D. R. T. Jones
Abstract: We present calculations of the leading and O(1/N) terms in a large-N expansion of the \beta-functions for various supersymmetric theories: a Wess-Zumino model, supersymmetric QED and a non-abelian supersymmetric gauge theory. In all cases N is the number of a class of the chiral superfields in the theory.
