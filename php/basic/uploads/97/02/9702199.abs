Title: Aspects of (0,2) Orbifolds and Mirror Symmetry
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Michael Flohr
Abstract: We study orbifolds of (0,2) models and their relation to (0,2) mirror symmetry. In the Landau-Ginzburg phase of a (0,2) model the superpotential features a whole bunch of discrete symmetries, which by quotient action lead to a variety of consistent (0,2) vacua. We study a few examples in very much detail. Furthermore, we comment on the application of (0,2) mirror symmetry to the calculation of Yukawa couplings in the space-time superpotential.
