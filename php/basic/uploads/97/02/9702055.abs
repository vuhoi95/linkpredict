Title: Lorentz Group derivable from Polarization Optics
Authors: D. Han and Y. S. Kim and M. E. Noz
Abstract: The Lorentz group is the fundamental language for space-time symmetries of relativistic particles. This group can these days be derived from the symmetries observed in other branches of physics. It is shown that this group can be derived from optical filters. The group O(2,1) is appropriate for attenuation filters, while the O(3) group describes phase-shift filters. The combined operation leads to a two-by-two representation of the six-parameter Lorentz group. It is shown also that the bilinear representation of this group is the natural language for the polarization optics.
