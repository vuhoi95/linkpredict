Title: Conformal invariance and rationality in an even dimensional quantum  field theory
Authors: Nikolay M. Nikolov and Ivan T. Todorov
Abstract: Invariance under finite conformal transformations in Minkowski space and the Wightman axioms imply strong locality (Huygens principle) and rationality of correlation functions, thus providing an extension of the concept of vertex algebra to higher dimensions. Gibbs (finite temperature) expectation values appear as elliptic functions in the conformal time. We survey and further pursue our program of constructing a globally conformal invariant model of a hermitean scalar field L of scale dimension four in Minkowski space-time which can be interpreted as the Lagrangian density of a gauge field theory.
