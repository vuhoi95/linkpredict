Title: Consistency of cosmic strings with cosmic microwave background  measurements
Authors: Jonathan Rocher and Mairi Sakellariadou
Abstract: In the context of SUSY GUTs, GUT scale cosmic strings formed at the end of hybrid inflation are compatible with currently available CMB measurements. The maximum allowed cosmic strings contribution to the CMB data constrains the free parameters (mass scales, couplings) of inflationary models. For F-term inflation either the superpotential coupling must be fine tuned or one has to invoke the curvaton mechanism. D-term inflation should be addressed in the framework of SUGRA. We find that the cosmic strings contribution is not constant, contrary to some previous results. Using CMB measurements we constrain the gauge and the superpotential couplings.
