Title: New results for deformed defects
Authors: C. A. Almeida and D. Bazeia and L. Losano and J. M. C. Malbouisson
Abstract: We extend a deformation prescription recently introduced and present some new soluble nonlinear problems for kinks and lumps. In particular, we show how to generate models which present the basic ingredients needed to give rise to dimension bubbles. Also, we show how to deform models which possess lumplike solutions, to get to new models that support kinklike solutions.
