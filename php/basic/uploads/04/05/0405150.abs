Title: Oxidizing SuperYang-Mills from (N=4,d=4) to (N=1,d=10)
Authors: Sudarshan Ananth and Lars Brink and Pierre Ramond
Abstract: We introduce superspace generalizations of the transverse derivatives to rewrite the four-dimensional N=4 Yang-Mills theory into the fully ten-dimensional N=1 Yang-Mills in light-cone form. The explicit SuperPoincare algebra is constructed and invariance of the ten-dimensional action is proved.
