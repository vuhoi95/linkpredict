Title: Vacua of N=1 Supersymmetric QCD from Spin Chains and Matrix Models
Authors: Timothy J. Hollowood and Kazutoshi Ohta
Abstract: We consider the vacuum structure of the finite N=2 theory with N_f=2N fundamental hypermultiplets broken to N=1 by a superpotential for the adjoint chiral multiplet. We do this in two ways: firstly, by compactification to three dimensions, in which case the effective superpotential is the Hamiltonian of an integrable spin chain. In the second approach, we consider the Dijkgraaf-Vafa holomorphic matrix model. We prove that the two approaches agree as long as the couplings of the two theories are related in a particular way involving an infinite series of instanton terms. The case of gauge group SU(2) with N_f=4 is considered in greater detail.
