Title: Lagrangians with linear velocities within Riemann-Liouville fractional  derivatives
Authors: D. Baleanu and T. Avkar
Abstract: Lagrangians linear in velocities were analyzed using the fractional calculus and the Euler-Lagrange equations were derived. Two examples were investigated in details, the explicit solutions of Euler-Lagrange equations were obtained and the recovery of the classical results was discussed.
