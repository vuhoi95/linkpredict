Title: Finite-Size Corrections to Anomalous Dimensions in N=4 SYM Theory
Authors: Martin Lubcke and Konstantin Zarembo
Abstract: The scaling dimensions of large operators in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory are dual to energies of semiclassical strings in AdS(5)xS(5). At one loop, the dimensions of large operators can be computed with the help of Bethe ansatz and can be directly compared to the string energies. We study finite-size corrections for Bethe states which should describe quantum corrections to energies of extended semiclassical strings.
