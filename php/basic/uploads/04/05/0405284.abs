Title: New constraint for Black Holes in N=2, D=5 supergravity with matter
Authors: S. L. Cacciatori and A. Celi
Abstract: With the general aim to classify BPS solutions in N=2, D=5 supergravity with hypermultiplets and vector multiplets, here we consider a family of static spacetime metrics containing black hole-like solutions, with generic hypermultiplets coupled to radially symmetric electrostatic vector multiplets. We derive the general conditions which the fields must satisfy and determine the form of the fixed point solutions.
