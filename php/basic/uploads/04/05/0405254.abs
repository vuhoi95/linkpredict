Title: The de Sitter Relativistic Top Theory
Authors: J. Armenta and J. A. Nieto
Abstract: We discuss the relativistic top theory from the point of view of the de Sitter (or anti de Sitter) group. Our treatment rests on Hanson-Regge's spherical relativistic top lagrangian formulation. We propose an alternative method for studying spinning objects via Kaluza-Klein theory. In particular, we derive the relativistic top equations of motion starting with the geodesic equation for a point particle in 4+N dimensions. We compare our approach with the Fukuyama's formulation of spinning objects, which is also based on Kaluza-Klein theory. We also report a generalization of our approach to a 4+N+D dimensional theory.
