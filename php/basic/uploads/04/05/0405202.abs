Title: Wess-Zumino terms for AdS D-branes
Authors: Machiko Hatsuda and Kiyoshi Kamimura
Abstract: We show that Wess-Zumino terms for D-p branes with p>0 in the Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space are given in terms of "left-invariant" currents on the super-AdS group or the "expanded" super-AdS group. As a result there is no topological extension of the super-AdS algebra. In the flat limit the global Lorentz rotational charges of the AdS space turn out to be brane charges of the supertranslation algebra representing the BPS mass. We also show that a D-instanton is described by the GL(1) degree of freedom in the Roiban-Siegel formalism based on the GL(4|4)/[Sp(4)xGL(1)]^2 coset.
