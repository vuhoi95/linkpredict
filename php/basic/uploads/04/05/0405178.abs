Title: Noncommutativity and Reparametrisation symmetry
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Biswajit Chakraborty and Sunandan Gangopadhyay
Abstract: We discuss a general method of revealing both space-space and space-time noncommuting structures in various models in particle mechanics exhibiting reparametrisation symmetry. Starting from the commuting algebra in the conventional gauge, it is possible to obtain a noncommuting algebra in a nonstandard gauge. The change of variables relating the algebra in the two gauges is systematically derived using gauge/reparametrisation transformations.
