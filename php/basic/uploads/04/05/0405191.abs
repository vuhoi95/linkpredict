Title: The universal area spectrum in single-horizon black holes
Authors: Takashi Tamaki and Hidefumi Nomura
Abstract: We investigate highly damped quasinormal mode of single-horizon black holes motivated by its relation to the loop quantum gravity. Using the WKB approximation, we show that the real part of the frequency approaches the value $T_{\rm H}\ln 3$ for dilatonic black hole as conjectured by Medved et al. and Padmanabhan. It is surprising since the area specrtum of the black hole determined by the Bohr's correspondence principle completely agrees with that of Schwarzschild black hole for any values of the electromagnetic charge or the dilaton coupling. We discuss its generality for single-horizon black holes and the meaning in the loop quantum gravity.
