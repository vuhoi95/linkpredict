Title: Integrals of motion from TBA and lattice-conformal dictionary
Authors: G. Feverati and P. Grinza
Abstract: The integrals of motion of the tricritical Ising model are obtained by Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) equations derived from the A_4 integrable lattice model. They are compared with those given by the conformal field theory leading to a unique one-to-one lattice-conformal correspondence. They can also be followed along the renormalization group flows generated by the action of the boundary field \phi_{1,3} on conformal boundary conditions in close analogy to the usual TBA description of energies.
