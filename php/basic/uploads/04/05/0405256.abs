Title: Sasakian Geometry, Hypersurface Singularities, and Einstein Metrics
Authors: Charles P. Boyer and Krzysztof Galicki
Abstract: We review our study of Sasakian geometry as an agent for proving the existence of Einstein metrics on odd dimensional manifolds. Particular emphasis is given to the Sasakian structures occuring on links of isolated hypersurface singularities.
