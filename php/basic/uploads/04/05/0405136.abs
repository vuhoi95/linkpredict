Title: Stochastic quantization of Born-Infeld field
Authors: Hiroshi Hotta and Mikio Namiki and Masahiko Kanenaga
Abstract: We stochastically quantize the Born-Infeld field which can hardly be dealtwith by means of the standard canonical and/or path-integral quantization methods. We set a hypothetical Langevin equation in order to quantize the Born-Infeld field, following the basic idea of stochastic quantization method. Numerically solving this nonlinear Langevin equation, we obtain a sort of "particle mass" associated with the gauge-invariant Born-Infeld field as a function of the so-called universal length. This is a revised version of which original non-electronic one was published in 1995 by RISE in Waseda Univ.
