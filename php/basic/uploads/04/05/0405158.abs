Title: Hypermultiplets and hypercomplex geometry from 6 to 3 dimensions
Authors: Jan Rosseel and Antoine Van Proeyen
Abstract: The formulation of hypermultiplets that has been developed for 5-dimensional matter multiplets is by dimensional reductions translated into the appropriate spinor language for 6 and 4 dimensions. We also treat the theories without actions that have the geometrical structure of hypercomplex geometry. The latter is the generalization of hyper-Kaehler geometry that does not require a Hermitian metric and hence corresponds to field equations without action. The translation tables of this paper allow the direct application of superconformal tensor calculus for the hypermultiplets using the available Weyl multiplets in 6 and 4 dimensions. Furthermore, the hypermultiplets in 3 dimensions that result from reduction of vector multiplets in 4 dimensions are considered, leading to a superconformal formulation of the c-map and an expression for the main geometric quantities of the hyper-Kaehler manifolds in the image of this map.
