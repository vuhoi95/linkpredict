Title: Separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi and Klein-Gordon Equations in  Kerr-de Sitter Metrics
Authors: Muraari Vasudevan and Kory A. Stevens and Don N. Page
Abstract: We study separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi and massive Klein-Gordon equations in the general Kerr-de Sitter spacetime in all dimensions. Complete separation of both equations is carried out in 2n+1 spacetime dimensions with all n rotation parameters equal, in which case the rotational symmetry group is enlarged from (U(1))^n to U(n). We explicitly construct the additional Killing vectors associated with the enlarged symmetry group which permit separation. We also derive first-order equations of motion for particles in these backgrounds and examine some of their properties.
