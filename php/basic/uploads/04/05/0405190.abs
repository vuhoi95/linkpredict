Title: Catastrophic Decays of Compactified Space-Times
Authors: Michael Dine and Patrick J. Fox and Elie Gorbatov
Abstract: Witten long ago pointed out that the simplest Kaluza-Klein theory, without supersymmetry, is subject to a catastrophic instability. There are a variety of string theories which are potentially subject to these instabilities. Here we explore a number of questions: how generic are these instabilities? what happens when a potential is generated on the moduli space? in the presence of supersymmetry breaking, is there still a distinction between supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric states?
