Title: Randall-Sundrum two D-brane model
Authors: Tetsuya Shiromizu and Yoshiaki Himemoto and Keitaro Takahashi
Abstract: In Randall-Sundrum two D-brane system we derive the gravitational theory on the branes. It is turned out from the consistency that one D-brane has the negative tension brane under Randall-Sundrum tuning and both gauge fields on the brane are related by scale transformation through the bulk RR/NS-NS fields. As same with the single D-brane case, the gauge field which is supposed to be localised on the brane does not couple to the gravity on the branes.
