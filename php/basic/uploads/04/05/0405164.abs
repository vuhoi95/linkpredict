Title: Scherk-Schwarz Reduction of D=5 Special and Quaternionic Geometry
Authors: L. Andrianopoli and S. Ferrara and M. A. Lledo'
Abstract: We give the N=2 gauged supergravity interpretation of a generic D=4, N=2 theory as it comes from generalized Scherk-Schwarz reduction of D=5, N=2 (ungauged) supergravity. We focus on the geometric aspects of the D=4 data such as the general form of the scalar potential and masses in terms of the gauging of a ``flat group''. Higgs and super-Higgs mechanism are discussed in some detail.
