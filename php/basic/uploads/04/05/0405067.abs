Title: Local fields in boundary conformal QFT
Authors: Roberto Longo and Karl-Henning Rehren
Abstract: Conformal field theory on the half-space x>0 of Minkowski space-time ("boundary CFT") is analyzed from an algebraic point of view, clarifying in particular the algebraic structure of local algebras and the bi-localized charge structure of local fields. The field content and the admissible boundary conditions are characterized in terms of a non-local chiral field algebra.
