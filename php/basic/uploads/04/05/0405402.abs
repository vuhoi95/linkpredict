Title: q,k-generalized gamma and beta functions
Authors: Rafael Diaz and Carolina Teruel
Abstract: We introduce the q,k-generalized Pochhammer symbol. We construct $\Gamma_{q,k}$ and $B_{q,k}$, the q,k-generalized gamma and beta fuctions, and show that they satisfy properties that generalize those satisfied by the classical gamma and beta functions. Moreover, we provide integral representations for $\Gamma_{q,k}$ and $B_{q,k}.$
