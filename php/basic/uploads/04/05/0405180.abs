Title: On Four-Point Functions of Half-BPS Operators in General Dimensions
Authors: Francis A. Dolan and Laurent Gallot and Emery Sokatchev
Abstract: We study four-point correlation functions of half-BPS operators of arbitrary weight for all dimensions d=3,4,5,6 where superconformal theories exist. Using harmonic superspace techniques, we derive the superconformal Ward identities for these correlators and present them in a universal form. We then solve these identities, employing Jack polynomial expansions. We show that the general solution is parameterized by a set of arbitrary two-variable functions, with the exception of the case d=4, where in addition functions of a single variable appear. We also discuss the operator product expansion using recent results on conformal partial wave amplitudes in arbitrary dimension.
