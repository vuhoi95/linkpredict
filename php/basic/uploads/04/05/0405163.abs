Title: Vacuum orbit and spontaneous symmetry breaking in hyperbolic sigma  models
Authors: A. Duncan and M. Niedermaier and E. Seiler
Abstract: We present a detailed study of quantized noncompact, nonlinear SO(1,N) sigma-models in arbitrary space-time dimensions D \geq 2, with the focus on issues of spontaneous symmetry breaking of boost and rotation elements of the symmetry group. The models are defined on a lattice both in terms of a transfer matrix and by an appropriately gauge-fixed Euclidean functional integral. The main results in all dimensions \geq 2 are: (i) On a finite lattice the systems have infinitely many nonnormalizable ground states transforming irreducibly under a nontrivial representation of SO(1,N); (ii) the SO(1,N) symmetry is spontaneously broken. For D =2 this shows that the systems evade the Mermin-Wagner theorem. In this case in addition: (iii) Ward identities for the Noether currents are derived to verify numerically the absence of explicit symmetry breaking; (iv) numerical results are presented for the two-point functions of the spin field and the Noether current as well as a new order parameter; (v) in a large N saddle-point analysis the dynamically generated squared mass is found to be negative and of order 1/(V \ln V) in the volume, the 0-component of the spin field diverges as \sqrt{\ln V}, while SO(1,N) invariant quantities remain finite.
