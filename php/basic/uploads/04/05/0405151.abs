Title: Strings on Eight-Orbifolds
Authors: Anamaria Font and Jose Antonio Lopez
Abstract: We present several examples of T^8/P orbifolds with $P \subset SU(4)$. We compute their Hodge numbers and consider turning on discrete torsion. We then study supersymmetric compactifications of type II, heterotic, and type I strings on these orbifolds. Heterotic compactifications to D=2 have a B-field tadpole with coefficient given by that of the anomaly polynomial. In the SO(32) heterotic with standard embedding the tadpole is absent provided the internal space has a precise value of the Euler number. Guided by their relation to type I, we find tadpole-free SO(32) heterotic orbifolds with non-standard embedding.
