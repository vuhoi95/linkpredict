Title: The Higgs field and the ultraviolet behaviour of the vortex operator in  2+1 dimensions
Authors: Arsen Khvedelidze and Alex Kovner and David McMullan
Abstract: We calculate the change in the ultraviolet behaviour of the vortex operator due to the presence of dynamical Higgs field in both 2+1 dimensional QED and the 2+1 dimensional Georgi-Glashow model. We find that in the QED case the presence of the Higgs field leads at the one loop level to power like correction to the propagator of the vortex operator. On the other hand, in the Georgi-Glashow model, the adjoint Higgs at one loop has no affect on the vortex propagator. Thus, as long as the mass of the Higgs field is much larger than the gauge coupling constant, the ultraviolet behaviour of the vortex operator in the Georgi-Glashow model is independent of the Higgs mass.
