Title: Non-Anticommutative Deformations of N=(1,1) Supersymmetric Theories
Authors: E. A. Ivanov and B. M. Zupnik
Abstract: We discuss chirality-preserving nilpotent deformations of four-dimensional N=(1,1) Euclidean harmonic superspace and their implications in N=(1,1) supersymmetric gauge and hypermultiplet theories, basically following [hep-th/0308012] and [hep-th/0405049]. For the SO(4) x SU(2) invariant deformation, we present non-anticommutative Euclidean analogs of the N=2 gauge multiplet and hypermultiplet off-shell actions. As a new result, we consider a specific non-anticommutative hypermultiplet model with N=(1,0) supersymmetry. It involves free scalar fields and interacting right-handed spinor fields.
