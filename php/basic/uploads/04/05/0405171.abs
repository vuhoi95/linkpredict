Title: Mass in anti-de Sitter spaces
Authors: James T. Liu and W. A. Sabra
Abstract: The boundary stress tensor approach has proven extremely useful in defining mass and angular momentum in asymptotically anti-de Sitter spaces with CFT duals. An integral part of this method is the use of boundary counterterms to regulate the gravitational action and stress tensor. In addition to the standard gravitational counterterms, in the presence of matter we advocate the use of a finite counterterm proportional to phi^2 (in five dimensions). We demonstrate that this finite shift is necessary to properly reproduce the expected mass/charge relation for R-charged black holes in AdS_5.
