Title: Bigger Rip with No Dark Energy
Authors: Paul H. Frampton and Tomo Takahashi
Abstract: By studying a modified Friedmann equation which arises in an extension of general relativity which accommodates a time-dependent fundamental length $L(t)$, we consider cosmological models where the scale factor diverges with an essential singularity at a finite future time. Such models have no dark energy in the conventional sense of energy possessing a truly simple pressure-energy relationship. Data on supernovae restrict the time from the present until the Rip to be generically longer than the current age of the Universe.
