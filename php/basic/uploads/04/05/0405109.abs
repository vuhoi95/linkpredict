Title: The Dynamics of General Relativity
Authors: R. Arnowitt and S. Deser and C. W. Misner
Abstract: This article--summarizing the authors' then novel formulation of General Relativity--appeared as Chapter 7 of an often cited compendium edited by L. Witten in 1962, which is now long out of print. Intentionally unretouched, this posting is intended to provide contemporary accessibility to the flavor of the original ideas. Some typographical corrections have been made: footnote and page numbering have changed--but not section nor equation numbering etc. The authors' current institutional affiliations are encoded in: arnowitt@physics.tamu.edu, deser@brandeis.edu, misner@physics.umd.edu .
