Title: Topological mass in seven dimensions and dualities in four dimensions
Authors: M. Betancourt and A. Khoudeir
Abstract: The massive topologically and self dual theories en seven dimensions are considered. The local duality between these theories is established and the dimensional reduction lead to the different dualities for massive antisymmetric fields in four dimensions.
