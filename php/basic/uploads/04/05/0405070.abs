Abstract: We study topological as well as dynamical properties of BPS nonabelian magnetic monopoles of Goddard-Nuyts-Olive-Weinberg type in $ G=SU(N)$, $USp(2N)$ and SO(N) gauge theories, spontaneously broken to nonabelian subgroups $H$. We find that monopoles transform under the group dual to $H$ in a tensor representation of rank determined by the corresponding element in $\pi_1(H)$. When the system is embedded in a ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric theory with an appropriate set of flavors with appropriate bare masses, the BPS monopoles constructed semiclassically persist in the full quantum theory. This result supports the identification of ``dual quarks'' found at $r$-vacua of ${\cal N}=2$ theories with the nonabelian magnetic monopoles. We present several consistency checks of our monopole spectra.
