Title: Solitons with Isospin
Authors: J. F. Gomes and G. M. Sotkov and A. H. Zimerman
Abstract: We study the symmetries of the soliton spectrum of a pair of T-dual integrable models, invariant under global $SL(2)_q\otimes U(1)$ transformations. They represent an integrable perturbation of the reduced Gepner parafermions, based on certain gauged SL(3) - WZW model. Their (semiclassical) topological soliton solutions, carrying isospin and belonging to the root of unity representations of q-deformed $SU(2)_q$ - algebra are obtained. We derive the semiclassical particle spectrum of these models, which is further used to prove their T-duality properties.
