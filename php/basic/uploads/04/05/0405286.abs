Title: Branon search in hadronic colliders
Authors: J. A. R. Cembranos and A. Dobado and A. L. Maroto
Abstract: In the context of the brane-world scenarios with compactified extra dimensions, we study the production of brane fluctuations (branons) in hadron colliders ($p \bar p$, $pp$ and $e^\pm p$) in terms of the brane tension parameter $f$, the branon mass $M$ and the number of branons $N$. From the absence of monojets events at HERA and Tevatron (run I), we set bounds on these parameters and we also study how such bounds could be improved at Tevatron (run II) and the future LHC. The single photon channel is also analyzed for the two last colliders.
