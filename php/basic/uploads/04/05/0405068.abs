Abstract: We discuss a many-particle quantum system, which is obtained by adding some nonhermitian but PT (i.e. combined parity and time reversal) invariant interaction to the $A_{N-1}$ rational Calogero model without confining potential. This model gives rise to scattering states with continuous real spectrum. The scattering phase shift is determined through the exchange statistics parameter. We find that, unlike the case of usual Calogero model, the exclusion and exchange statistics parameter differ from each other in the presence of PT invariant interaction.
