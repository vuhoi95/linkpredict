Title: Massive Relativistic Particle Model with Spin and Electric Charge from  Two-Twistor Dynamics
Authors: A. Bette and A. de Azcarraga and J. Lukierski and C. Miquel-Espanya
Abstract: The sixteen real coordinates of two-twistor space are transformed by a nonlinear mapping into an enlarged space-time framework. The standard relativistic phase space of coordinates $(X_\mu, P_\mu)$ is supplemented by a six-parameter spin phase manifold (two pairs $(\eta_\alpha,\sigma_\alpha)$ and $(\bar{\eta}_{\dot\alpha}, \bar{\sigma}_{\dot{\alpha}})$ of canonically conjugated Weyl spinors constrained by two second class constraints) and the electric charge phase space ($e,\phi$). The free two-twistor classical mechanics is rewritten in this enlarged relativistic phase space as a model for a relativistic particle. Definite values for the mass, spin and the electric charge of the particle are introduced by means of three first class constraints.
