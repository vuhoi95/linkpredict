Title: Effective Theory on Non-Abelian Vortices in Six Dimensions
Authors: Minoru Eto and Muneto Nitta and Norisuke Sakai
Abstract: Non-Abelian vortices in six spacetime dimensions are obtained for a supersymmetric U(N) gauge theory with N hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation. Massless (moduli) fields are identified and classified into Nambu-Goldstone and quasi-Nambu-Goldstone fields. Effective gauge theories for the moduli fields are constructed on the four-dimensional world volume of vortices. A systematic method to obtain the most general form of the effective Lagrangian consistent with symmetry is proposed. The moduli space for the multi-vortices is found to be a vector bundle over the complex Grassmann manifold.
