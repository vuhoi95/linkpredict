Title: The Difficulty of Symplectic Analysis with Second Class Systems
Authors: A. Shirzad and M. Mojiri
Abstract: Using the basic concepts of chain by chain method we show that the symplectic analysis, which was claimed to be equivalent to the usual Dirac method, fails when second class constraints are present. We propose a modification in symplectic analysis that solves the problem.
