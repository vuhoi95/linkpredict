Title: Soft Supersymmetry Breaking on the Brane
Authors: Ph. Brax and N. Chatillon
Abstract: We consider the low energy description of five dimensional models of supergravity with boundaries comprising a vector multiplet and the universal hypermultiplet in the bulk. We analyse the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry induced by the vacuum expectation value of superpotentials on the boundary branes. When supersymmetry is broken, the moduli corresponding to the radion, the zero mode of the vector multiplet scalar field and the dilaton develop a potential in the effective action. We compute the resulting soft breaking terms and give some indications on the features of the corresponding particle spectrum. We consider some of the possible phenomenological implications when supersymmetry is broken on the hidden brane.
