Title: On the quantum stress tensor for extreme 2D Reissner-Nordstrom black  holes
Authors: Roberto Balbinot and Serena Fagnocchi and Alessandro Fabbri and Sara Farese and Jose Navarro-Salas
Abstract: Contrary to previous claims, it is shown that the expectation values of the quantum stress tensor for a massless scalar field propagating on a two-dimensional extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black hole are indeed regular on the horizon.
