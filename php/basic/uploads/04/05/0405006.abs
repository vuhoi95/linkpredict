Title: Small Kerr-anti-de Sitter black holes are unstable
Authors: Vitor Cardoso and Oscar J. C. Dias
Abstract: Superradiance in black hole spacetimes can trigger instabilities. Here we show that, due to superradiance, small Kerr-anti-de Sitter black holes are unstable. Our demonstration uses a matching procedure, in a long wavelength approximation.
