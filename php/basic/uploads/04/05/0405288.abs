Title: Wavy Wilson Line and AdS/CFT
Authors: Gordon W. Semenoff and Donovan Young
Abstract: Wilson loops which are small deviations from straight, infinite lines, called wavy lines, are considered in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. A single wavy line and the connected correlation function of a straight and wavy line are considered. It is argued that, to leading order in ``waviness'', the functional form of the loop is universal and the coefficient, which is a function of the 't Hooft coupling, is found in weak coupling perturbation theory and the strong coupling limit using the AdS/CFT correspondence. Supersymmetric arguments are used to simplify the computation and to show that the straight line obeys the Migdal-Makeenko loop equation.
