Title: Dual geometries for a set of 3-charge microstates
Authors: Stefano Giusto and Samir D. Mathur and Ashish Saxena
Abstract: We construct a set of extremal D1-D5-P solutions, by taking appropriate limits in a known family of nonextremal 3-charge solutions. The extremal geometries turn out to be completely smooth, with no horizon and no singularity. The solutions have the right charges to be the duals of a family of CFT microstates which are obtained by spectral flow from the NS vacuum.
