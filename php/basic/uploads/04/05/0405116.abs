Title: The Dilatation Operator of $\cal N$ $=$ 4 SYM and Classical Limits of  Spin Chains and Matrix Models
Authors: Abhishek Agarwal and Sarada. G. Rajeev
Abstract: A study of the one loop dilatation operator in the scalar sector of $\cal N$ $=$ 4 SYM is presented. The dilatation operator is analyzed from the point of view of Hamiltonian matrix models. A Lie algebra underlying operator mixing in the planar large $N$ limit is presented, and its role in understanding the integrability of the planar dilatation operator is emphasized. A classical limit of the dilatation operator is obtained by considering a contraction of this Lie algebra, leading to a new way of constructing classical limits for quantum spin chains. An infinite tower of local conserved charges is constructed in this classical limit purely within the context of the matrix model. The deformation of these charges and their relation to the charges of the spin chain is also elaborated upon.
