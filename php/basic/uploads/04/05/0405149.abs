Title: G+++ and Brane Solutions
Authors: Paul P. Cook and Peter C. West
Abstract: We demonstrate that the very extended G+++ group element of the form $g_A=\exp(-{\frac{1}{(\beta,\beta)}\ln N}\beta \cdot H)\exp((1-N)E_\beta)$ describes the usual BPS, electric, single brane solutions found in G+++ theories.
