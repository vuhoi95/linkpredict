Title: Hartle-Hawking Vacuum for c=1 Tachyon Condensation
Authors: Joanna L. Karczmarek and Alexander Maloney and Andrew Strominger
Abstract: Quantum vacua are constructed for a time-symmetric cosmology describing closed string tachyon condensation in two-dimensional string theory. Due to the Euclidean periodicity of the solution, and despite its time dependence, we are able to construct thermal states at discrete values of the temperature. The asymptotic thermal Green functions and stress energy tensor are computed and found to have an intriguing resemblance to those in the Hartle-Hawking vacuum of a black hole.
