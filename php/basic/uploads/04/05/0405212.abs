Authors: U. A. al-Binni and M. S. Shikakhwa
Abstract: In the presence of an external Aharonov-Bohm potential, we investigate the two QED processes of the emission of a bremsstrahlung photon by an electron, and the production of an electron-positron pair by a single photon. Calculations are carried out using the Born approximation within the framework of covariant perturbation theory to lowest non-vanishing order in \alpha. The matrix element for each process is derived, and the corresponding differential cross-section is calculated. In the non-relativistic limit, the resulting angular and spectral distributions and some polarization properties are considered, and compared to results of previous works.
