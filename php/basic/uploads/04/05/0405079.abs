Title: A Novel Multi-parameter Family of Quantum Systems with Partially Broken  N-fold Supersymmetry
Authors: Artemio Gonzalez-Lopez and Toshiaki Tanaka
Abstract: We develop a systematic algorithm for constructing an N-fold supersymmetric system from a given vector space invariant under one of the supercharges. Applying this algorithm to spaces of monomials, we construct a new multi-parameter family of N-fold supersymmetric models, which shall be referred to as "type C". We investigate various aspects of these type C models in detail. It turns out that in certain cases these systems exhibit a novel phenomenon, namely, partial breaking of N-fold supersymmetry.
