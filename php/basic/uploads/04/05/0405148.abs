Title: New Reducible Five-brane Solutions in M-theory
Authors: R. Clarkson and A. M. Ghezelbash and R. B. Mann
Abstract: We construct new M-theory solutions of M5 branes that are a realization of the fully localized ten dimensional NS5/D6 and NS5/D5 brane intersections. These solutions are obtained by embedding self-dual geometries lifted to M-theory. We reduce these solutions down to ten dimensions, obtaining new D-brane systems in type IIA/IIB supergravity. The worldvolume theories of the NS5-branes are new non-local, non-gravitational, six dimensional, T-dual little string theories with eight supersymmetries.
