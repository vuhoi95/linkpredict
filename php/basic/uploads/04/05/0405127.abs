Title: Holography and the Higgs branch of N=2 SYM theories
Authors: Zachary Guralnik and Stefano Kovacs and Bogdan Kulik
Abstract: We present a proposal for the description of the Higgs branch of four-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We focus on a finite Sp(N) N=2 theory arising as dual of a configuration of N D3-branes in the vicinity of four D7-branes and an orientifold 7-plane in type I' string theory. The field theory contains hypermultiplets in the second rank anti-symmetric and in the fundamental representations. The Higgs branch has a dual description in terms of gauge field configurations with non-zero instanton number on the world-volume of the D7-branes. In this setting the non-renormalisation of the metric on the Higgs branch implies constraints on the alpha' corrections to the D7-brane effective action, including couplings to the curvature and five-form field strength. In the second part of the paper we discuss non-renormalisation properties of BPS Wilson lines, which are closely related to the physics of the Higgs branch. Using a formulation of the four-dimensional N=2 theory in terms of a three-dimensional N=2 superspace we show that the expectation value of certain Wilson-line operators with hypermultiplets at the end points is independent of the length and thus coincides with the expectation value of the local operators parametrising the Higgs branch.
