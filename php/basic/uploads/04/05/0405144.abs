Title: Regular compactifications and Higgs model vortices
Authors: B. de Carlos and J. M. Moreno
Abstract: We present full numerical solutions to the system of a global string embedded in a six-dimensional space time. The solutions are regular everywhere and do confine gravity in our four-dimensional world. They depend on the value of the (negative) cosmological constant in the bulk and on the parameters of the Higgs potential, and we perform a systematic study to determine their allowed values. We also comment on the relation of our results with previous studies on the same subject and on their phenomenological viability.
