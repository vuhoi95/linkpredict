Title: Asymptotic tails of massive scalar fields in a stationary axisymmetric  EMDA black hole geometry
Authors: Qiyuan Pan and Jiliang Jing
Abstract: The late-time tail behavior of massive scalar fields is studied analytically in a stationary axisymmetric EMDA black hole geometry. It is shown that the asymptotic behavior of massive perturbations is dominated by the oscillatory inverse power-law decaying tail $ t^{-(l+3/2)}\sin(\mu t)$ at the intermediate late times, and by the asymptotic tail $ t^{-5/6}\sin(\mu t)$ at asymptotically late times. Our result seems to suggest that the intermediate tails $ t^{-(l+3/2)}\sin(\mu t)$ and the asymptotically tails $t^{-5/6} \sin(\mu t)$ may be quite general features for evolution of massive scalar fields in any four dimensional asymptotically flat rotating black hole backgrounds.
