Title: New Einstein-Hilbert-type Action and Superon-Graviton Model(SGM) of  Nature
Authors: K. Shima and M. Tsuda and M. Sawaguchi
Abstract: A nonlinear supersymmetric(NLSUSY) Einstein-Hilbert(EH)-type new action for unity of nature is obtained by performing the Einstein gravity analogue geomtrical arguments in high symmetry spacetime inspired by NLSUSY. The new action is unstable and breaks down spontaneously into E-H action with matter in ordinary Riemann spacetime. All elementary particles except graviton are composed of the fundamental fermion "superon" of Nambu-Goldstone(NG) fermion of NLSUSY and regarded as the eigenstates of SO(10) super-Poincar\'e (SP) algebra, called superon-graviton model(SGM) of nature. Some phenomenological implications for the low energy particle physics and the cosmology are discussed. The linearization of NLSUSY including N=1 SGM action is attempted explicitly to obtain the linear SUSY local field theory, which is equivalent and renormalizable.
