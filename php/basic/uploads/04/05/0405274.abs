Title: ZZ-Branes of N=2 Super-Liouville Theory
Authors: Changrim Ahn and Marian Stanishkov and Masayoshi Yamamoto
Abstract: We study conformal boundary conditions and corresponding one-point functions of the N=2 super-Liouville theory using both conformal and modular bootstrap methods. We have found both continuous (`FZZT-branes') and discrete (`ZZ-branes') boundary conditions. In particular, we identify two different types of the discrete ZZ-brane solutions, which are associated with degenerate fields of the N=2 super-Liouville theory.
