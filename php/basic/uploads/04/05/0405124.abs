Title: Perfect hypermomentum fluid: variational theory and equations of motion
Authors: Olga V. Babourova and Boris N. Frolov
Abstract: The variational theory of the perfect hypermomentum fluid is developed. The new type of the generalized Frenkel condition is considered. The Lagrangian density of such fluid is stated, and the equations of motion of the fluid and the Weyssenhoff-type evolution equation of the hypermomentum tensor are derived. The expressions of the matter currents of the fluid (the canonical energy-momentum 3-form, the metric stress-energy 4-form and the hypermomentum 3-form) are obtained. The Euler-type hydrodynamic equation of motion of the perfect hypermomentum fluid is derived. It is proved that the motion of the perfect fluid without hypermomentum in a metric-affine space coincides with the motion of this fluid in a Riemann space.
