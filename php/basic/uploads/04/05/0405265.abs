Title: Dynamical brane creation and annihilation via a background flux
Authors: Yi-Fei Chen and J. X. Lu
Abstract: We study the dynamical Myers effect by allowing the fuzzy (or the dynamical dielectric brane) coordinates to be time dependent. We find three novel kinds of the dynamical spherical dielectric branes depending on their respective excess energies. The first represents a dynamical spherical brane carrying a negative excess energy (having a lower bound) with its radius oscillating periodically between two given non-zero values. The second is the one with zero excess energy and whose time dependence can be expressed in terms of a simple function. This particular dynamical spherical configuration represents the dielectric brane creation and/or annihilation like a photon in the presence of a background creating an electron-position pair and then annihilating back to a photon. The third is the one carrying positive excess energy and the radius can also oscillate periodically between two non-zero values but, unlike the first kind, it passes zero twice for each cycle. Each of the above can also be interpreted as the time evolution of a semi-spherical D-brane--anti semi-spherical D-brane system.
