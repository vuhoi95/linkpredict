Title: Quivers, Quotients, and Duality
Authors: Daniel Robles-Llana and Martin Rocek
Abstract: We give a direct computational proof of N=2 Seiberg duality for arbitrary quivers, and find the action on the Fayet-Iliopoulos parameters. We also find a new analogous classical duality for Kahler potentials of N=1 quivers that generalizes the trivial duality Gr(N,N+M) ~ Gr(M,N+M) for Grassmannians.
