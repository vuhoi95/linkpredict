Title: Exactly solvable potentials of Calogero type for q-deformed Coxeter  groups
Authors: Andreas Fring and Christian Korff
Abstract: We establish that by parameterizing the configuration space of a one-dimensional quantum system by polynomial invariants of q-deformed Coxeter groups it is possible to construct exactly solvable models of Calogero type. We adopt the previously introduced notion of solvability which consists of relating the Hamiltonian to finite dimensional representation spaces of a Lie algebra. We present explicitly the $G_2^q $-case for which we construct the potentials by means of suitable gauge transformations.
