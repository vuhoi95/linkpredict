Title: Classical Physics and Quantum Loops
Authors: Barry R. Holstein and John F. Donoghue
Abstract: The standard picture of the loop expansion associates a factor of h-bar with each loop, suggesting that the tree diagrams are to be associated with classical physics, while loop effects are quantum mechanical in nature. We discuss examples wherein classical effects arise from loop contributions and display the relationship between the classical terms and the long range effects of massless particles.
