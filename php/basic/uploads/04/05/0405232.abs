Title: On the relation between open and closed topological strings
Authors: A. Kapustin and L. Rozansky
Abstract: We discuss the relation between open and closed string correlators using topological string theories as a toy model. We propose that one can reconstruct closed string correlators from the open ones by considering the Hochschild cohomology of the category of D-branes. We compute the Hochschild cohomology of the category of D-branes in topological Landau-Ginzburg models and partially verify the conjecture in this case.
