Title: A First Glimpse of String Theory in the Sky?
Authors: Steen Hannestad and Laura Mersini-Houghton
Abstract: We propose a new method for identifying new physics imprints on present observational data in cosmology whereby signatures of string theory are clearly distinguished from imprints of possible features on the inflaton potential. Our method relies on the cross-correlations spectra of cosmic shear from large scale structure (LSS) with the CMB temperature anisotropies and E-mode polarization, by using the following properties: inflationary cosmology provides only one source term for all CMB spectra and LSS which highly constrains any deviations from the standard predictions; string theory can add new non-inflationary channels to the source of perturbations as well as modify clustering properties at large scales. Discrepancies in the source terms of correlations and clustering properties provide the evidence for new physics. Models of single-field inflation with a feature are disfavored even with present data. Upcoming WMAP results and future data from weak lensing of LSS will further improve our ability to probe new physics in this manner and could open the first direct window to string theory.
