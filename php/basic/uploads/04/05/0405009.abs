Title: S-brane solutions with acceleration in models with forms and multiple  exponential potentials
Authors: V. D. Ivashchuk and V. N. Melnikov and S. -W. Kim
Abstract: A family of generalized S-brane solutions with orthogonal intersection rules and n Ricci-flat factor spaces in the theory with several scalar fields, antisymmetric forms and multiple scalar potential is considered. Two subclasses of solutions with power-law and exponential behaviour of scale factors are singled out. These subclasses contain sub-families of solutions with accelerated expansion of certain factor spaces. Some examples of solutions with exponential dependence of one scale factor and constant scale factors of "internal" spaces (e.g. Freund-Rubin type solutions) are also considered.
