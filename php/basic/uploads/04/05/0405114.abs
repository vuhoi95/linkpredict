Title: Remarks on gauge fixing and BRST quantization of noncommutative gauge  theories
Authors: Ricardo Amorim and Henrique Boschi-Filho and Nelson R. F. Braga
Abstract: We consider the BRST gauge fixing procedure of the noncommutative Yang-Mills theory and of the gauged U(N) Proca model. An extended Seiberg-Witten map involving ghosts, antighosts and auxiliary fields for non Abelian gauge theories is studied. We find that the extended map behaves differently for these models. For the Yang-Mills theory in the Lorentz gauge it was not possible to find a map that relates the gauge conditions in the noncommutative and ordinary theories. For the gauged Proca model we found a particular map relating the unitary gauge fixings in both formulations.
