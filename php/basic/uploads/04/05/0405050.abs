Title: Update on Cosmic Censorship Violation in AdS
Authors: Thomas Hertog and Gary T. Horowitz and Kengo Maeda
Abstract: We reexamine our proposed counterexample (gr-qc/0307102) to cosmic censorship in anti de Sitter (AdS) space, and find a gap in the construction. We mention some possible ways to close the gap, but at present the question of whether cosmic censorship is violated in AdS remains open.
