Title: A Unified and Complete Construction of All Finite Dimensional  Irreducible Representations of gl(2|2)
Authors: Yao-Zhong Zhang and Mark D. Gould
Abstract: Representations of the non-semisimple superalgebra $gl(2|2)$ in the standard basis are investigated by means of the vector coherent state method and boson-fermion realization. All finite-dimensional irreducible typical and atypical representations and lowest weight (indecomposable) Kac modules of $gl(2|2)$ are constructed explicitly through the explicit construction of all $gl(2)\oplus gl(2)$ particle states (multiplets) in terms of boson and fermion creation operators in the super-Fock space. This gives a unified and complete treatment of finite-dimensional representations of $gl(2|2)$ in explicit form, essential for the construction of primary fields of the corresponding current superalgebra at arbitrary level.
