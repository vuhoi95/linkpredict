Title: The New Fat Higgs: Slimmer and More Attractive
Authors: Spencer Chang and Can Kilic and Rakhi Mahbubani
Abstract: In this paper we increase the MSSM tree level higgs mass bound to a value that is naturally larger than the LEP-II search constraint by adding to the superpotential a $\lambda S H_{u}H_{d}$ term, as in the NMSSM, and UV completing with new strong dynamics {\it before} $\lambda$ becomes non-perturbative. Unlike other models of this type the higgs fields remain elementary, alleviating the supersymmetric fine-tuning problem while maintaining unification in a natural way.
