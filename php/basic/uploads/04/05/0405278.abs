Title: Non-anticommutative N=2 supersymmetric SU(2) gauge theory
Authors: Sergei V. Ketov and Shin Sasaki
Abstract: We calculate the component Lagrangian of a four-dimensional non-anticommutative (with a singlet deformation parameter) and fully N=2 supersymmetric gauge field theory with the simple gauge group SU(2). We find that the deformed (classical) scalar potential is unbounded from below, in contrast to the undeformed case.
