Title: Supersymmetry in the Non-Commutative Plane
Authors: Luc Lapointe and Hideaki Ujino and Luc Vinet
Abstract: The supersymmetric extension of a model introduced by Lukierski, Stichel and Zakrewski in the non-commutative plane is studied. The Noether charges associated to the symmetries are determined. Their Poisson algebra is investigated in the Ostrogradski--Dirac formalism for constrained Hamiltonian systems. It is shown to provide a supersymmetric generalization of the Galilei algebra with a two-dimensional central extension.
