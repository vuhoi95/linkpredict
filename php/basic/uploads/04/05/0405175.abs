Title: Enhanced Worldvolume Supersymmetry and Intersecting Domain Walls in N=1  SQCD
Authors: A. Ritz and M. Shifman and A. Vainshtein
Abstract: We study the worldvolume dynamics of BPS domain walls in N=1 SQCD with N_f=N flavors, and exhibit an enhancement of supersymmetry for the reduced moduli space associated with broken flavor symmetries. We provide an explicit construction of the worldvolume superalgebra which corresponds to an N=2 Kahler sigma model in 2+1D deformed by a potential, given by the norm squared of a U(1) Killing vector, resulting from the flavor symmetries broken by unequal quark masses. This framework leads to a worldvolume description of novel two-wall junction configurations, which are 1/4-BPS objects, but nonetheless preserve two supercharges when viewed as kinks on the wall worldvolume.
