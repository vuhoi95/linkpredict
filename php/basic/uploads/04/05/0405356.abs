Title: The shape of non-Gaussianities
Authors: Daniel Babich and Paolo Creminelli and Matias Zaldarriaga
Abstract: We study the dependence on configuration in momentum space of the primordial 3-point function of density perturbations in several different scenarios: standard slow-roll inflation, curvaton and variable decay models, ghost inflation, models with higher derivative operators and the DBI model of inflation. We define a cosine between the distributions using a measure based on the ability of experiments to distinguish between them. We find that models fall into two broad categories with fairly orthogonal distributions. Models where non-Gaussianity is created at horizon-crossing during inflation and models in which the evolution outside the horizon dominates. In the first case the 3-point function is largest for equilateral triangles, while in the second the dominant contribution to the signal comes from the influence of long wavelength modes on small wavelength ones. We show that, because the distributions in these two cases are so different, translating constraints on parameters of one model to those of another based on the normalization of the 3-point function for equilateral triangles can be very misleading.
