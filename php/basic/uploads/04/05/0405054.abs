Title: SUSY Production From TeV Scale Blackhole at LHC
Authors: Andrew Chamblin and Fred Cooper and Gouranga C. Nayak
Abstract: If the fundamental Planck scale is near a TeV, then we should expect to see TeV scale black holes at the LHC. Similarly, if the scale of supersymmetry breaking is sufficiently low, then we might expect to see light supersymmetric particles in the next generation of colliders. If the mass of the supersymmetric particle is of order a TeV and is comparable to the temperature of a typical TeV scale black hole, then such sparticles will be copiously produced via Hawking radiation: The black hole will act as a resonance for sparticles, among other things. In this paper we compared various signatures for SUSY production at LHC, and we contrasted the situation where the sparticles are produced directly via parton fusion processes with the situation where they are produced indirectly through black hole resonances. We found that black hole resonances provide a larger source for heavy mass SUSY (squark and gluino) production than the direct pQCD-SUSY production via parton fusion processes depending on the values of the Planck mass and blackhole mass. Hence black hole production at LHC may indirectly act as a dominant channel for SUSY production. We also found that the differential cross section d\sigma/dp_t for SUSY production increases as a function of the p_t (up to p_t equal to about 1 TeV or more) of the SUSY particles (squarks and gluinos), which is in sharp contrast with the pQCD predictions where the differential cross section d\sigma/dp_t decreases as p_t increases for high p_t about 1 TeV or higher. This is a feature for any particle emission from TeV scale blackhole as long as the temperature of the blackhole is very high (~ TeV). Hence measurement of increase of d\sigma/dp_t with p_t for p_t up to about 1 TeV or higher for final state particles might be a useful signature for blackhole production at LHC.
