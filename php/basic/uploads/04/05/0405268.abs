Title: Realization of algebras with the help of star-products
Authors: Andreas Sykora and Claudia Jambor
Abstract: We present a closed formula for a family of star-products by replacing the partial derivatives in the Moyal-Weyl formula with commuting vector fields. We show how to reproduce algebra relations on commutative spaces with these star-products and give some physically interesting examples of that procedure.
