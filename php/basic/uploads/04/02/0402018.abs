Title: Quantum long-range interactions in general relativity
Authors: I. B. Khriplovich and G. G. Kirilin
Abstract: We consider one-loop effects in general relativity which result in quantum long-range corrections to the Newton law, as well as to the gravitational spin-dependent and velocity-dependent interactions. Some contributions to these effects can be interpreted as quantum corrections to the Schwarzschild and Kerr metric.
