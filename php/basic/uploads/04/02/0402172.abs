Title: Concerning the generalized Lorentz symmetry and the generalization of  the Dirac equation
Authors: G. Yu. Bogoslovsky and H. F. Goenner
Abstract: The work is devoted to the generalization of the Dirac equation for a flat locally anisotropic, i.e., Finslerian space-time. At first we reproduce the corresponding metric and a group of the generalized Lorentz transformations, which has the meaning of the relativistic symmetry group of such event space. Next, proceeding from the requirement of the generalized Lorentz invariance we find a generalized Dirac equation in its explicit form. An exact solution of the nonlinear generalized Dirac equation is also presented.
