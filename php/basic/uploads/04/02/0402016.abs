Title: A Googly Amplitude from the B-model in Twistor Space
Authors: Radu Roiban and Marcus Spradlin and Anastasia Volovich
Abstract: Recently it has been proposed that gluon scattering amplitudes in gauge theory can be computed from the D-instanton expansion of the topological B-model on P^{3|4}, although only maximally helicity violating (MHV) amplitudes have so far been obtained from a direct B-model calculation. In this note we compute the simplest non-MHV gluon amplitudes (++--- and +-+--) from the B-model as an integral over the moduli space of degree 2 curves in P^{3|4} and find perfect agreement with Yang-Mills theory.
