Title: Holography and Eternal Inflation
Authors: David A. Lowe and Donald Marolf
Abstract: We show that eternal inflation is compatible with holography. In particular, we emphasize that if a region is asymptotically de Sitter in the future, holographic arguments by themselves place no bound on the number of past e-foldings. We also comment briefly on holographic restrictions on the production of baby universes.
