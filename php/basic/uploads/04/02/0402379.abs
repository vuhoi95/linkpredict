Title: Linearized Bekenstein Varying Alpha Models
Authors: P. P. Avelino and C. J. A. P. Martins and J. C. R. E. Oliveira
Abstract: We study the simplest class of Bekenstein-type, varying $\alpha$ models, in which the two available free functions (potential and gauge kinetic function) are Taylor-expanded up to linear order. Any realistic model of this type reduces to a model in this class for a certain time interval around the present day. Nevertheless, we show that no such model is consistent with all existing observational results. We discuss possible implications of these findings, and in particular clarify the ambiguous statement (often found in the literature) that ``the Webb results are inconsistent with Oklo''.
