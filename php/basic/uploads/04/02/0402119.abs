Title: Candidates for Inflaton in Quiver Gauge Theory
Authors: Paul H. Frampton and Tomo Takahashi
Abstract: The inflaton necessary to implement the mechanism of inflationary cosmology has natural candidates in quiver gauge theory. We discuss the dimensionless coefficients of quartic couplings and enumerate scalars which are singlet under the low-energy gauge group. The inflaton mass is generally predicted to be in the TeV region, close to 4 TeV for one specific unified model. A quartic inflaton potential, and a mutated hybrid inflation, are discussed. They can give adequate inflation and appropriate fluctuations but different spectral indices.
