Title: Deformed logarithms and entropies
Authors: G. Kaniadakis and M. Lissia and A. M. Scarfone
Abstract: By solving a differential-functional equation inposed by the MaxEnt principle we obtain a class of two-parameter deformed logarithms and construct the corresponding two-parameter generalized trace-form entropies. Generalized distributions follow from these generalized entropies in the same fashion as the Gaussian distribution follows from the Shannon entropy, which is a special limiting case of the family. We determine the region of parameters where the deformed logarithm conserves the most important properties of the logarithm, and show that important existing generalizations of the entropy are included as special cases in this two-parameter class.
