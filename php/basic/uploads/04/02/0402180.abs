Title: Consistent deformations of [p,p]-type gauge field theories
Authors: Nicolas Boulanger and Sandrine Cnockaert
Abstract: Using BRST-cohomological techniques, we analyze the consistent deformations of theories describing free tensor gauge fields whose symmetries are represented by Young tableaux made of two columns of equal length p, p>1. Under the assumptions of locality and Poincare invariance, we find that there is no consistent deformation of these theories that non-trivially modifies the gauge algebra and/or the gauge transformations. Adding the requirement that the deformation contains no more than two derivatives, the only possible deformation is a cosmological-constant-like term.
