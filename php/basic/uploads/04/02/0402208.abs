Title: Euler Chern Simons Gravity from Lovelock Born Infeld Gravity
Authors: Fernando Izaurieta and Eduardo Rodriguez and Patricio Salgado
Abstract: In the context of a gauge theoretical formulation, higher dimensional gravity invariant under the AdS group is dimensionally reduced to Euler-Chern-Simons gravity. The dimensional reduction procedure of Grignani-Nardelli [Phys. Lett. B 300, 38 (1993)] is generalized so as to permit reducing D-dimensional Lanczos Lovelock gravity to d=D-1 dimensions.
