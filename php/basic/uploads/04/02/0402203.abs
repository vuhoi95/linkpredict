Title: Higher-Derivative Terms in N=2 SUSY Effective Actions
Authors: Philip C. Argyres and Adel M. Awad and Gregory A. Braun and F. Paul Esposito
Abstract: Harmonic superspace can be used to construct higher derivative terms in N=2 supersymmetric effective actions despite the infinite redundancy in their description due to the infinite number of auxiliary fields. We are able to write down all of the 3- and 4-derivative terms on the Higgs, Coulomb, and mixed branches, modulo the possible existence of superspace Chern-Simons-like terms, which we discuss. Many of the terms we find are holomorphic, and at least one is shown to not receive quantum corrections.
