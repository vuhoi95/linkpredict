Title: All Googly Amplitudes from the B-model in Twistor Space
Authors: Radu Roiban and Anastasia Volovich
Abstract: It has recently been proposed that the D-instanton expansion of the open topological B-model on P^{3|4} is equivalent to the perturbative expansion of N=4 super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. In this note we extend the results of hep-th/0402016 and recover the gauge theory results for all n-point googly amplitudes by computing the integral over the moduli space of curves of degree n-3 in P^{3|4}.
