Title: Decay widths of three-impurity states in the BMN correspondence
Authors: Petra Gutjahr and Jan Plefka
Abstract: We extend the study of the quantum mechanics of BMN gauge theory to the sector of three scalar impurities at one loop and all genus. The relevant matrix elements of the non-planar one loop dilatation operator are computed in the gauge theory basis. After a similarity transform the BMN gauge theory prediction for the corresponding piece of the plane wave string Hamiltonian is derived and shown to agree with light-cone string field theory. In the three-impurity sector single string states are unstable for the decay into two-string states at leading order in g_2. The corresponding decay widths are computed.
