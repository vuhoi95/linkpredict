Title: On representations of the rotation group and magnetic monopoles
Authors: Alexander I. Nesterov and F. Aceves de la Cruz
Abstract: Recently (Phys. Lett. A302 (2002) 253, hep-th/0208210; hep-th/0403146) employing bounded infinite-dimensional representations of the rotation group we have argued that one can obtain the consistent monopole theory with generalized Dirac quantization condition, $2\kappa\mu \in \mathbb Z$, where $\kappa$ is the weight of the Dirac string. Here we extend this proof to the unbounded infinite-dimensional representations.
