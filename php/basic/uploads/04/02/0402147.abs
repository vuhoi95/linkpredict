Title: The spectral action for Moyal planes
Authors: Victor Gayral and Bruno Iochum
Abstract: Extending a result of D.V. Vassilevich, we obtain the asymptotic expansion for the trace of a "spatially" regularized heat operator associated with a generalized Laplacian defined with integral Moyal products. The Moyal hyperplanes corresponding to any skewsymmetric matrix $\Theta$ being spectral triples, the spectral action introduced in noncommutative geometry by A. Chamseddine and A. Connes is computed. This result generalizes the Connes-Lott action previously computed by Gayral for symplectic $\Theta$.
