Title: Type 0A 2D Black Hole Thermodynamics and the Deformed Matrix Model
Authors: Ulf H. Danielsson and James P. Gregory and Martin E. Olsson and Peter Rajan and Marcel Vonk
Abstract: Recently, it has been proposed that the deformed matrix model describes a two-dimensional type 0A extremal black hole. In this paper, the thermodynamics of 0A charged non-extremal black holes is investigated. We observe that the free energy of the deformed matrix model to leading order in 1/q can be seen to agree to that of the extremal black hole. We also speculate on how the deformed matrix model is able to describe the thermodynamics of non-extremal black holes.
