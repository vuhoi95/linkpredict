Title: Comments on the scalar propagator in AdS x S and the BMN plane wave
Authors: H. Dorn and M. Salizzoni and C. Sieg
Abstract: We discuss the scalar propagator on generic AdS_{d+1} x S^{d'+1} backgrounds. For the conformally flat situations and masses corresponding to Weyl invariant actions the propagator is powerlike in the sum of the chordal distances with respect to AdS_{d+1} and S^{d'+1}. In all other cases the propagator depends on both chordal distances separately. We discuss the KK mode summation to construct the propagator in brief. For AdS_5 x S^5 we relate our propagator to the expression in the BMN plane wave limit and find a geometric interpretation of the variables occurring in the known explicit construction on the plane wave.
