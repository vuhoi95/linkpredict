Title: Topology and Signature Changes in Braneworlds
Authors: Gary W. Gibbons and Akihiro Ishibashi
Abstract: It has been believed that topology and signature change of the universe can only happen accompanied by singularities, in classical, or instantons, in quantum, gravity. In this note, we point out however that in the braneworld context, such an event can be understood as a classical, smooth event. We supply some explicit examples of such cases, starting from the Dirac-Born-Infeld action. Topology change of the brane universe can be realised by allowing self-intersecting branes. Signature change in a braneworld is made possible in an everywhere Lorentzian bulk spacetime. In our examples, the boundary of the signature change is a curvature singularity from the brane point of view, but nevertheless that event can be described in a completely smooth manner from the bulk point of view.
