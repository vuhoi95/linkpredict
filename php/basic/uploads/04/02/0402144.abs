Title: Three Charge Supertubes and Black Hole Hair
Authors: Iosif Bena and Per Kraus
Abstract: We construct finite size, supersymmetric, tubular D-brane configurations with three charges, two angular momenta and several brane dipole moments. In type IIA string theory these are tubular configurations with D0, D4 and F1 charge, as well as D2, D6 and NS5 dipole moments. These multi-charge generalizations of supertubes might have interesting consequences for the physics of the D1-D5-P black hole. We study the relation of the tubes to the spinning BMPV black hole, and find that they have properties consistent with describing some of the hair of this black hole.
