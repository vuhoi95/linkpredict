Title: Critical points and supersymmetric vacua
Authors: Michael R. Douglas and Bernard Shiffman and Steve Zelditch
Abstract: Supersymmetric vacua (`universes') of string/M theory may be identified with certain critical points of a holomorphic section (the `superpotential') of a Hermitian holomorphic line bundle over a complex manifold. An important physical problem is to determine how many vacua there are and how they are distributed. The present paper initiates the study of the statistics of critical points $\nabla s = 0$ of Gaussian random holomorphic sections with respect to a connection $\nabla$. Even the expected number of critical points depends on the curvature of $\nabla$. The principal results give formulas for the expected density and number of critical points of Gaussian random sections relative to $\nabla$ in a variety of settings. The results are particularly concrete for Riemann surfaces. Analogous results on the density of critical points of fixed Morse index are given.
