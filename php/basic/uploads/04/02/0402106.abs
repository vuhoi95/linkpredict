Title: Quark and gluon confinement in Coulomb gauge
Authors: C. Feuchter and H. Reinhardt
Abstract: The Yang-Mills Schr\"odinger equation is variationally solved in Coulomb gauge for the vacuum sector using a trial wave functional, which is strongly peaked at the Gribov horizon. We find the absence of gluons in the infrared and also a confining quark potential.
