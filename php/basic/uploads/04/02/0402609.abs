Title: Addendum to "Superimposed Oscillations in the WMAP Data?"
Authors: Jerome Martin and Christophe Ringeval
Abstract: We elaborate further on the possibility that the inflationary primordial power spectrum contains superimposed oscillations. We study various effects which could influence the calculation of the multipole moments in this case. We also present the theoretical predictions for two other cosmological observables, the matter power spectrum and the EE polarization channel.
