Title: Imaginary time D-branes to all orders
Authors: Oren Bergman and Shlomo S. Razamat
Abstract: Extending the work of Gaiotto, Itzhaki and Rastelli in hep-th/0304192, we derive a general prescription for computing amplitudes involving a periodic array of D-branes in imaginary time to arbitrary order. We use this prescription to show that closed string amplitudes with b boundaries are identical to closed string amplitudes with b additional insertions of a particular physical closed string state. We perform an explicit computation for the annulus, and argue on the basis of open and closed string field theory for higher order amplitudes. We also discuss possible subtleties in the prescription related to collisions of boundaries and insertions, and argue that they are harmless. This verifies the proposal that a periodic array of D-branes in imaginary time corresponds to a pure closed string background.
