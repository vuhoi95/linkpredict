Title: The Effective Potential of the N=0* Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Assaf Patir and Dori Reichmann
Abstract: We study the \N=4 SYM theory with SU(N) gauge group in the large N limit, deformed by giving equal mass to the four adjoint fermions. With this modification, a potential is dynamically generated for the six scalars in the theory, \phi^i. We show that the resulting theory is stable (perturbatively in the 't Hooft coupling), and that there are some indications that <\phi>=0 is the vacuum of the theory. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we compare the results to the corresponding supergravity computation, i.e. brane probing a deformed AdS_5 x S^5 background, and we find qualitative agreement.
