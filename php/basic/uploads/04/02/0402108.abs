Title: Origin of FRW cosmology in slow-roll inflation from noncompact  Kaluza-Klein theory
Authors: Edgar Madriz Aguilar and Mauricio Bellini
Abstract: Using a recently introduced formalism we discuss slow-roll inflaton from Kaluza-Klein theory without the cylinder condition. In particular, some examples corresponding to polynomic and hyperbolic $\phi$-potentials are studied. We find that the evolution of the fifth coordinate should be determinant for both, the evolution of the early inflationary universe and the quantum fluctuations.
