Title: Generalized Holonomy of Supergravities with 8 Real Supercharges
Authors: A. Batrachenko and W. Y. Wen
Abstract: We show that the generalized holonomy groups of ungauged supergravity theories with 8 real supercharges must be contained in SL(2-\nu,H)\ltimes{\nu H^{2-\nu}}\subseteq SL(2,H), where SL(2,H) is the generalized structure group. Here n=4\nu is the number of preserved supersymmetries, so the allowed values are limited to n=0,4,8. In particular, solutions of ungauged supergravities in four, five and six dimensions are examined and found to explicitly follow this pattern. We also argue that the G-structure has to be a subgroup of this generalized holonomy group, which may provide a possible classification for supergravity vacua with respect to the number of supercharges.
