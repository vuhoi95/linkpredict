Title: String creation in cosmologies with a varying dilaton
Authors: Joshua J. Friess and Steven S. Gubser and Indrajit Mitra
Abstract: FRW solutions of the string theory low-energy effective actions are described, yielding a dilaton which first decreases and then increases. We study string creation in these backgrounds and find an exponential divergence due to an initial space-like singularity. We conjecture that this singularity may be removed by the effects of back-reaction, leading to a solution which at early times is de Sitter space.
