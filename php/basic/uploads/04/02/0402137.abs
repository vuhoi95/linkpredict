Title: Supersymmetric CP^N Sigma Model on Noncommutative Superspace
Authors: Takeo Inami and Hiroaki Nakajima
Abstract: We construct a closed form of the action of the supersymmetric $CP^N$ sigma model on noncommutative superspace in four dimensions. We show that this model has $\mathcal{N}={1/2}$ supersymmetry and that the transformation law is not modified. The supersymmetric $CP^N$ sigma model on noncommutative superspace in two dimensions is obtained by dimensional reducing the model in four dimensions.
