Title: D-term inflation without cosmic strings
Authors: J. Urrestilla and A. Achucarro and A. C. Davis
Abstract: We present a superstring-inspired version of D-term inflation which does not lead to cosmic string formation and appears to satisfy the current CMB constraints. It differs from minimal D-term inflation by a second pair of charged superfields which makes the strings non-topological (semilocal). The strings are also BPS, so the scenario is expected to survive supergravity corrections. The second pair of charged superfields arises naturally in several brane and conifold scenarios, but its effect on cosmic string formation had not been noticed so far.
