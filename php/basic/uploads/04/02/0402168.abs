Title: Noncommutative Topological Half-flat Gravity
Authors: H. Garcia-Compean and O. Obregon and C. Ramirez
Abstract: We formulate a noncommutative description of topological half-flat gravity in four dimensions. BRST symmetry of this topological gravity is deformed through a twisting of the usual BRST quantization of noncommutative gauge theories. Finally it is argued that resulting moduli space of instantons is characterized by the solutions of a noncommutative version of the Plebanski's heavenly equation.
