Title: Branons as dark matter
Authors: J. A. R. Cembranos and A. Dobado and A. L. Maroto
Abstract: In the brane-world scenario with low tension, brane fluctuations (branons) together with the Standard Model particles are the only relevant degrees of freedom at low energies. Branons are stable, weakly interacting, massive particles and their relic abundance can account for the dark matter of the universe. In a certain range of the parameter space, they could be detectable by future direct search experiments.
