Title: The non-equilibrium phase transition of the pair-contact process with  diffusion
Authors: Malte Henkel and Haye Hinrichsen
Abstract: The pair-contact process 2A->3A, 2A->0 with diffusion of individual particles is a simple branching-annihilation processes which exhibits a phase transition from an active into an absorbing phase with an unusual type of critical behaviour which had not been seen before. Although the model has attracted considerable interest during the past few years it is not yet clear how its critical behaviour can be characterized and to what extent the diffusive pair-contact process represents an independent universality class. Recent research is reviewed and some standing open questions are outlined.
