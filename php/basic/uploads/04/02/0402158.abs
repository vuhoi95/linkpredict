Title: The Entropy of the Rotating Charged Black Threebrane from a  Brane-Antibrane System
Authors: Alberto Guijosa and Hector H. Hernandez and Hugo A. Morales-Tecotl
Abstract: We show that a model based on a D3-brane--anti-D3-brane system at finite temperature, proposed previously as a microscopic description of the non-rotating black threebrane of type IIB supergravity arbitrarily far from extremality, can also successfully reproduce the entropy of the rotating threebrane with arbitrary charge (including the neutral case, which corresponds to the Kerr black hole in seven dimensions). Our results appear to confirm in particular the need for a peculiar condition on the energy of the two gases involved in the model, whose physical interpretation remains to be elucidated.
