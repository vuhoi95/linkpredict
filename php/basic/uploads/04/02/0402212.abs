Abstract: We propose new Wightman functions as vacuum expectation values of products of field operators in the noncommutative space-time. These Wightman functions involve the $\star$-product among the fields, compatible with the twisted Poincar\'e symmetry of the noncommutative quantum field theory (NC QFT). In the case of only space-space noncommutativity ($\theta_{0i}=0$), we prove the CPT theorem using the noncommutative form of the Wightman functions. We also show that the spin-statistics theorem, demonstrated for the simplest case of a scalar field, holds in NC QFT within this formalism.
