Title: Supergravities with Minkowski x Sphere Vacua
Authors: J. Kerimo and James. T. Liu and H. Lu and C. N. Pope
Abstract: Recently the authors have introduced a new gauged supergravity theory with a positive definite potential in D=6, obtained through a generalised Kaluza-Klein reduction from D=7. Of particular interest is the fact that this theory admits certain Minkowski x Sphere vacua. In this paper we extend the previous results by constructing gauged supergravities with positive definitive potentials in diverse dimensions, together with their vacuum solutions. In addition, we prove the supersymmetry of the generalised reduction ansatz. We obtain a supersymmetric solution with no form-field fluxes in the new gauged theory in D=9. This solution may be lifted to D=10, where it acquires an interpretation as a time-dependent supersymmetric cosmological solution supported purely by the dilaton. A further uplift to D=11 yields a solution describing a pp-wave.
