Title: BPS Wall Solutions in Five Dimensional Supergravity
Authors: Masato Arai and Shigeo Fujita and Masashi Naganuma and Norisuke Sakai
Abstract: We find an exact solution of BPS wall in five-dimensional supergravity using a gravitational deformation of the massive Eguchi-Hanson nonlinear sigma model. The warp factor decreases for both infinities of the extra dimension. Our solution requires no fine-tuning between boundary and bulk cosmological constants, in contrast to the Randall-Sundrum model. Wall solutions are also obtained with warp factors which are flat or increasing in one side by varying a deformation parameter.
