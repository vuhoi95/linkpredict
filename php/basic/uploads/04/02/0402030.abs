Title: A Note on Tachyons in the $D3+{\bar {D3}}$ System
Authors: Yan-Gang Miao and Harald J. W. MÃ¼ller-Kirsten and Dae Kil Park
Abstract: The periodic bounce of Born-Infeld theory of $D3$-branes is derived, and the BPS limit of infinite period is discussed as an example of tachyon condensation. The explicit bounce solution to the Born--Infeld action is interpreted as an unstable fundamental string stretched between the brane and its antibrane.
