Title: Bonnor-type Black Dihole Solution in Brans-Dicke-Maxwell Theory
Authors: Hongsu Kim and Hyung Mok Lee
Abstract: It was originally thought that Bonnor's solution in Einstein-Maxwell theory describes a singular point-like magnetic dipole. Lately, however, it has been demonstrated that indeed it may describe a black {\it dihole}, i.e., a pair of static, oppositely-charged extremal black holes with regular horizons. Motivated particularly by this new interpretation, in the present work, the construction and extensive analysis of a solution in the context of the Brans-Dicke-Maxwell theory representing a black dihole are attempted. It has been known for some time that the solution-generating algorithm of Singh and Rai produces stationary, axisymmetric, charged solutions in Brans-Dicke-Maxwell theory from the known such solutions in Einstein-Maxwell theory. Thus this algorithm of Singh and Rai's is employed in order to construct a Bonnor-type magnetic black dihole solution in Brans-Dicke-Maxwell theory from the known Bonnor solution in Einstein-Maxwell theory. The peculiar feature of the new solution including internal infinity nature of the symmetry axis and its stability issue have been discussed in full detail.
