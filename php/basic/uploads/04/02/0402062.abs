Title: Non-anticommutative N=(1,1) Euclidean Superspace
Authors: E. Ivanov and O. Lechtenfeld and B. Zupnik
Abstract: We study deformations of four-dimensional N=(1,1)Euclidean superspace induced by non-anticommuting fermionic coordinates. We essentially use the harmonic superspace approach and consider nilpotent bi-differential Poisson operators only, which generalizes the recently studied chiral deformation of N=(1/2,1/2) superspace. We present non-anticommutative Euclidean analogs of N=2 Maxwell and hypermultiplet off-shell actions. The talk is based on the paper hep-th/0308012.
