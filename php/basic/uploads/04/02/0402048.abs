Title: Quasinormal Modes of Extremal BTZ Black Hole
Authors: Juan Cris√≥stomo and Samuel Lepe and Joel Saavedra
Abstract: Motivated by several pieces of evidence, in order to show that extreme black holes cannot be obtained as limits of non-extremal black holes, in this article we calculate explicitly quasinormal modes for Ba\~{n}ados, Teitelboim and Zanelli (BTZ) extremal black hole and we showed that the imaginary part of the frequency is zero. We obtain exact result for the scalar an fermionic perturbations. We also showed that the frequency is bounded from below for the existence of the normal modes (non-dissipative modes).
