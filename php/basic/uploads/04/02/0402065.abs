Title: Gravitational Wave Spectrum in Inflation with Nonclassical States
Authors: Seoktae Koh and Sang Pyo Kim and Doo Jong Song
Abstract: The initial quantum state during inflation may evolve to a highly squeezed quantum state due to the amplification of the time-dependent parameter, $\omega_{phys}(k/a)$, which may be the modified dispersion relation in trans-Planckian physics. This squeezed quantum state is a nonclassical state that has no counterpart in the classical theory. We have considered the nonclassical states such as squeezed, squeezed coherent, and squeezed thermal states, and calculated the power spectrum of the gravitational wave perturbation when the mode leaves the horizon.
