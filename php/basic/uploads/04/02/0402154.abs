Title: Searching for Lorentz Violation
Authors: Roland E. Allen and Seiichirou Yokoo
Abstract: Astrophysical, terrestrial, and space-based searches for Lorentz violation are very briefly reviewed. Such searches are motivated by the fact that all superunified theories (and other theories that attempt to include quantum gravity) have some potential for observable violations of Lorentz invariance. Another motivation is the exquisite sensitivity of certain well-designed experiments and observations to particular forms of Lorentz violation. We also review some new predictions of a specific Lorentz-violating theory: If a fundamental energy \bar{m} in this theory lies below the usual GZK cutoff E_{GZK}, the cutoff is shifted to infinite energy; i.e., it no longer exists. On the other hand, if \bar{m} lies above E_{GZK}, there is a high-energy branch of the fermion dispersion relation which provides an alternative mechanism for super-GZK cosmic-ray protons.
