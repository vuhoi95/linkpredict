Title: Holography, Diffeomorphisms, and Scaling Violations in the CMB
Authors: Finn Larsen and Robert McNees
Abstract: We analyze diffeomorphism invariance in inflationary spacetimes regulated by a boundary at late time. We present the action for quadratic fluctuations in the presence of a boundary, and verify that it is gauge invariant precisely when the correct local counterterms are included. The scaling behavior of bulk correlation functions at the boundary is determined by Callan-Symanzik equations which predict scaling violations in agreement with the standard inflationary predictions for spectral indices of the CMB.
