Title: Wrapped membranes, matrix string theory and an infinite dimensional Lie  algebra
Authors: Shozo Uehara and Satoshi Yamada
Abstract: We examine the algebraic structure of the matrix regularization for the wrapped membrane on $R^{10}\times S^1$ in the light-cone gauge. We give a concrete representation for the algebra and obtain the matrix string theory having the boundary conditions for the matrix variables corresponding to the wrapped membrane, which is referred to neither Seiberg and Sen's arguments nor string dualities. We also embed the configuration of the multi-wrapped membrane in matrix string theory.
