Title: Quantum fluctuations of a "constant" gauge field
Authors: A. Aurilia and E. Spallucci
Abstract: It is argued here that the quantum computation of the vacuum pressure must take into account the contribution of zero-point oscillations of a rank-three gauge field. The field A_{\mu\nu\rho} possesses no radiative degrees of freedom, its sole function being that of polarizing the vacuum through the formation of \textit{finite} domains characterized by a non-vanishing, constant, but otherwise arbitrary pressure. This extraordinary feature, rather unique among quantum fields, is exploited to associate the A_{\mu\nu\rho} field with the ``bag constant'' of the hadronic vacuum, or with the cosmological term in the cosmic case. We find that the quantum fluctuations of A_{\mu\nu\rho} are inversely proportional to the confinement volume and interpret the result as a Casimir effect for the hadronic vacuum. With these results in hands and by analogy with the electromagnetic and string case, we proceed to calculate the Wilson loop of the three-index potential coupled to a ``test'' relativistic bubble. From this calculation we extract the static potential between two opposite points on the surface of a spherical bag and find it to be proportional to the enclosed volume.
