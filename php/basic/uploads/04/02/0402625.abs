Abstract: The correlation functions of the spin-1/2 XXZ chain in the ground state were expressed in the form of multiple integrals for -1<\Delta \leq 1 and 1<\Delta. In particular, adjacent four-point correlation functions were given as certain four-dimensional integrals. We show that these integrals can be reduced to polynomials with respect to specific one-dimensional integrals. The results give the polynomial representation of the third-neighbor correlation functions.
