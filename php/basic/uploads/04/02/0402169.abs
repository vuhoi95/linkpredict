Title: A Noncommutative Deformation of Topological Field Theory
Authors: Hugo Garcia-Compean and Pablo Paniagua
Abstract: Cohomological Yang-Mills theory is formulated on a noncommutative differentiable four manifold through the $\theta$-deformation of its corresponding BRST algebra. The resulting noncommutative field theory is a natural setting to define the $\theta$-deformation of Donaldson invariants and they are interpreted as a mapping between the Chevalley-Eilenberg homology of noncommutative spacetime and the Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology of noncommutative moduli of instantons. In the process we find that in the weak coupling limit the quantum theory is localized at the moduli space of noncommutative instantons.
