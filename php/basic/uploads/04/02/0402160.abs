Title: Product-Group Unification in Type IIB String Thoery
Authors: Taizan Watari and T. Yanagida
Abstract: The product-group unification is a model of unified theories, in which masslessness of the two Higgs doublets and absence of dimension-five proton decay are guaranteed by a symmetry. It is based on SU(5) x U(N) (N=2,3) gauge group. It is known that various features of the model are explained naturally, when it is embedded in a brane world. This article describes an idea of how to accommodate all the particles of the model in Type IIB brane world. The GUT-breaking sector is realized by a D3--D7 system, and chiral quarks and leptons arise from intersection of D7-branes. The D-brane configuration can be a geometric realization of the non-parallel family structure of quarks and leptons, an idea proposed to explain the large mixing angles observed in the neutrino oscillation. The tri-linear interaction of the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model is obtained naturally in some cases.
