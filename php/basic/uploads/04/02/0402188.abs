Title: Inhomogeneous chiral symmetry breaking in noncommutative four fermion  interactions
Authors: Paolo Castorina and Giuseppe Riccobene and Dario Zappala'
Abstract: The generalization of the Gross-Neveu model for noncommutative 3+1 space-time has been analyzed. We find indications that the chiral symmetry breaking occurs for an inhomogeneous background as in the LOFF phase in condensed matter.
