Title: Supersymmetry breaking in two dimensions: the lattice N=1 Wess-Zumino  model
Authors: Matteo Beccaria and Massimo Campostrini and Alessandra Feo
Abstract: We study dynamical supersymmetry breaking by non perturbative lattice techniques in a class of two-dimensional N=1 Wess-Zumino models. We work in the Hamiltonian formalism and analyze the phase diagram by analytical strong-coupling expansions and explicit numerical simulations with Green Function Monte Carlo methods.
