Title: N=2 strings and the twistorial Calabi-Yau
Authors: Andrew Neitzke and Cumrun Vafa
Abstract: We interpret the A and B model topological strings on CP^{3|4} as equivalent to open N=2 string theory on spacetime with signature (2,2), when covariantized with respect to SO(2,2) and supersymmetrized a la Siegel. We propose that instantons ending on Lagrangian branes wrapping RP^{3|4} deform the self-dual N=4 Yang-Mills sector to ordinary Yang-Mills by generating a `t Hooft like expansion. We conjecture that the A and B versions are S-dual to each other. We also conjecture that mirror symmetry may explain the recent observations of Witten that twistor transformed N=4 Yang-Mills amplitudes lie on holomorphic curves.
