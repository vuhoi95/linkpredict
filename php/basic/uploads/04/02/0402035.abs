Title: N=1* model and glueball superpotential from  Renormalization-Group-improved perturbation theory
Authors: Stefano Arnone and Francesco Guerrieri and Kensuke Yoshida
Abstract: A method for computing the low-energy non-perturbative properties of SUSY GFT, starting from the microscopic lagrangian model, is presented. The method relies on covariant SUSY Feynman graph techniques, adapted to low energy, and Renormalization-Group-improved perturbation theory. We apply the method to calculate the glueball superpotential in N=1 SU(2) SYM and obtain a potential of the Veneziano-Yankielowicz type.
