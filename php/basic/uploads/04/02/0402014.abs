Title: Compatible Poisson Structures of Toda Type Discrete Hierarchy
Authors: H. Aratyn and K. Bering
Abstract: An algebra isomorphism between algebras of matrices and difference operators is used to investigate the discrete integrable hierarchy. We find local and non-local families of R-matrix solutions to the modified Yang-Baxter equation. The three R-theoretic Poisson structures and the Suris quadratic bracket are derived. The resulting family of bi-Poisson structures include a seminal discrete bi-Poisson structure of Kupershmidt at a special value.
