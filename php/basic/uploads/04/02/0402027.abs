Title: Topological susceptibility in full QCD with Ginsparg-Wilson fermions
Authors: L. Giusti and G. C. Rossi and M. Testa
Abstract: We show that, if the formula for the topological charge density operator suggested by fermions obeying the Ginsparg-Wilson relation is employed, it is possible to give a precise and unambiguous definition of the topological susceptibility in full QCD, chi_tL, for finite quark masses on the lattice. The lattice expression of chi_tL looks like the formal continuum one, in the sense that no power divergent subtractions are needed for its proper definition. As a consequence, the small mass behaviour of chi_tL leads directly to a multiplicative renormalizable definition of the chiral condensate that does not require any power divergent subtraction.
