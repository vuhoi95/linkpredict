Title: String-localized quantum fields from Wigner representations
Authors: Jens Mund and Bert Schroer and Jakob Yngvason
Abstract: In contrast to the usual representations of of the Poincar\'e group of finite spin or helicity the Wigner representations of mass zero and infinite spin are known to be incompatible with pointlike localized quantum fields. We present here a construction of quantum fields associated with these representations that are localized in semi-infinite, space-like strings. The construction is based on concepts outside the realm of Lagrangian quantization with the potential for further applications.
