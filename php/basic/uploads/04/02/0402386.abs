Title: Differential equations, mirror maps and zeta values
Authors: Gert Almkvist and Wadim Zudilin
Abstract: The aim of this work is an analytic investigation of differential equations producing mirror maps as well as giving new examples of mirror maps; one of these examples is related to (rational approximations to) $\zeta(4)$. We also indicate certain observations that might become a subject of further research.
