Abstract: Vacuum effects in (2+1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED) with the topological Chern-Simons term are considered. The photon polarization operator is studied and the decay rate for the electron-positron photoproduction is presented as a function of the photon energy and external field strength. The radiatively induced electron mass shift in an external magnetic field is investigated. The electron self-energy in topologically massive (2+1)-QED at finite temperature and density is studied. The parity breaking part of the Yang-Mills action in the framework of the $SU(2)\times U(1)$ gauge field model at finite temperature is considered.
