Title: Halperin-Lubensky-Ma effect in type-I superconducting films
Authors: L. M. Abreu and C. de Calan and A. P. C. Malbouisson
Abstract: In this note we employ concurrently techniques of generalized $zeta$-functions and compactification methods introduced in previous publications, to study the Halperin-Lubensky-Ma theory of induced weak first-order phase transitions applied to type-I superconducting films. We obtain closed formulas to the critical temperature and to the size temperature as functions of the film thickness.
