Abstract: We investigate the high-energy behavior of the scattering amplitudes in the extra dimensional gauge theory where the gauge symmetry is broken by the boundary condition. We study, in particular, the 5-dimensional SU(5) grand unified theory whose 5th-dimensional coordinate is compactified on S^1/Z_2. We pay attention to the gauge symmetry compatible with the boundary condition on the orbifold and give the BRST formalism of the 4D theory which is obtained through integration of the 5D theory along the extra dimension. We derive the 4D equivalence theorem on the basis of the Slavnov-Taylor identities. We calculate the amplitudes of the process including four massive gauge bosons in the external lines and compare them with the ones for the connected reactions where the gauge fields are replaced by the corresponding would-be NG-like fields. We explicitly confirm the equivalence theorem to hold.
