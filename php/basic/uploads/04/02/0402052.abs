Title: Cubic interactions in the BMN limit of AdS(3) x S(3)
Authors: Sera Cremonini and Aristomenis Donos
Abstract: We study the pp limit of AdS(3) x S(3) at the interaction level. We find the interacting Hamiltonian for the bosonic fields of D=6 SUGRA in the pp-wave background, and compare it to the cubic couplings of the full AdS(3) x S(3). We show how the pp-wave theory vertex arises in the large J limit. Our analysis also provides some insight into the origin of specific prefactors which appear in the pp-wave interaction.
