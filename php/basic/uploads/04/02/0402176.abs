Title: Radius stabilization and brane running in RS1 model
Authors: Iver Brevik and Kazuo Ghoroku and Masanobu Yahiro
Abstract: We study the effective potential of a scalar field based on the 5D gauged supergravity for the RS1 brane model in terms of the brane running method. The scalar couples to the brane such that the BPS conditions are satisfied for the bulk configuration. The resulting effective potential implies that the interbrane distance is undetermined in this case, and we need a small BPS breaking term on the brane to stabilize the interbrane distance at a finite length. We also discuss the relationship to the Goldberger-Wise model.
