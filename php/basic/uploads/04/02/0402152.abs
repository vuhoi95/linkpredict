Title: On Black Hole Thermodynamics of 2-D Type 0A
Authors: Joshua L. Davis and Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas and Diana Vaman
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the thermodynamics of two dimensional black hole solutions to type 0A with q units of electric and magnetic flux. We compute the free energy and derived quantities such as entropy and mass for an arbitrary non-extremal black hole. The free energy is non-vanishing, in contrast to the case of dilatonic 2-d black holes without electric and magnetic fluxes. The entropy of the extremal black holes is obtained, and we find it to be proportional to q^2, the square of the RR flux. We compare these thermodynamics quantities with those from candidate matrix model duals.
