Title: On elimination of the Gribov ambiguity
Authors: J. Manjavidze and A. Sissakian and V. Voronyuk
Abstract: We find a strong coupling expansion around the non-trivial extremum of the Yang-Mills action. It is shown that the developed formalism is the Gribov ambiguity free since each order of the developed perturbation theory is transparently gauge invariant. The success is a consequence of the restriction: calculations are not going beyond the norm of the $S$-matrix element.
