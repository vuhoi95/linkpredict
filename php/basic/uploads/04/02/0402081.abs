Title: Propagating Cosmological Perturbations in a Bouncing Universe
Authors: Patrick Peter and Jerome Martin
Abstract: Using the simplest model for a bouncing universe, namely that for which gravity is described by pure general relativity, the spatial sections are positively curved and the matter content is a single scalar field, we obtain the transition matrix relating cosmological perturbation modes between the contracting and expanding phases. We show that this case provides a specific example in which this relation explicitely depends on the perturbation scale whenever the null energy condition (NEC) is close to be violated.
