Title: What do we (not) know theoretically about solar neutrino fluxes?
Authors: John N. Bahcall and M. H. Pinsonneault
Abstract: Solar model predictions of 8B and p-p neutrinos agree with the experimentally-determined fluxes (including oscillations): phi(pp)_{measured} = (1.02 +- 0.02 +- 0.01)phi(pp)_{theory}, and phi(8B)_{measured} =(0.88 +- .04 +- 0.23)phi(8B)_{theory}, 1 sigma experimental and theoretical uncertainties, respectively. We use improved input data for nuclear fusion reactions, the equation of state, and the chemical composition of the Sun. The solar composition is the dominant uncertainty in calculating the 8B and CNO neutrino fluxes; the cross section for the 3He(4He, gamma)7Be reaction is the largest uncertainty for the calculated 7Be neutrino flux.
