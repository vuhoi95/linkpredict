Authors: E. Harikumar and V. Sunil Kumar and Avinash Khare
Abstract: We study the Pauli equation on non-commutative plane. It is shown that the Supersymmetry algebra holds to all orders in the non-commutative parameter $\theta$ in case the gyro-magnetic ratio $g$ is 2. Using Seiberg-Witten map, the first order in $\theta$ correction to the spectrum is obtained in the case of uniform magnetic field. We find that the eigenstates in the non-commutative case are identical to the commutative case provided the magnetic field $B$ is everywhere replaced by $B(1+B\theta)$.
