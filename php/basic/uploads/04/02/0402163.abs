Title: Using D-Strings to Describe Monopole Scattering
Authors: Jessica K. Barrett and Peter Bowcock
Abstract: We describe the scattering of D-strings stretched between D3-branes, working from the D-string perspective. From the D3-brane perspective the ends of the D-strings are magnetic monopoles, and so the scattering we describe is equivalent to monopole scattering. Our aim is to test the prediction made by Manton for the energy radiated during monopole scattering.
