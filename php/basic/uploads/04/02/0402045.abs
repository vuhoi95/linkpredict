Title: The cosmic censor conjecture: Is it generically violated?
Authors: Miguel Alcubierre and Jose A. Gonzalez and Marcelo Salgado and Daniel Sudarsky
Abstract: It has been recently argued by Hertog, Horowitz and Maeda, that generic reasonable initial data in asymptotically anti deSitter, spherically symmetric, space-times within an Einstein-Higgs theory, will evolve toward a naked singularity, in clear violation of the cosmic censor conjecture. We will argue that there is a logical and physically plausible loophole in the argument and that the numerical evidence in a related problem suggests that this loophole is in fact employed by physics.
