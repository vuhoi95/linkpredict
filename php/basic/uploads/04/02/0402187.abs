Title: The (2,0) supersymmetric theory of tensor multiplets and self-dual  strings in six dimensions
Authors: Par Arvidsson and Erik Flink and Mans Henningson
Abstract: We construct a unique (2,0) supersymmetric action in six dimensions, describing a tensor multiplet interacting with a self-dual string. It is a sum of four terms: A free kinetic term for the tensor multiplet fields integrated over Minkowski space, a Nambu-Goto type kinetic term for the string integrated over the string world-sheet, a Wess-Zumino type electromagnetic coupling integrated over the world-volume of a Dirac membrane attached to the string, and a direct interaction of such Dirac membranes. In addition to supersymmetry, the action is also invariant under a local symmetry, which allows us to choose the Dirac membrane world-volume freely and eliminate half of the fermionic degrees of freedom on the string world-sheet.
