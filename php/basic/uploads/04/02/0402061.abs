Title: Spin Two Glueball Mass and Glueball Regge Trajectory from Supergravity
Authors: Xavier Amador and Elena Caceres
Abstract: We calculate the mass of the lowest lying spin two glueball in N=1 super Yang-Mills from the dual Klebanov-Strassler background. We show that the Regge trajectory obtained is linear; the 0++, 1-- and 2++ states lie on a line of slope 0.23 -measured in units of the conifold deformation. We also compare mass ratios with lattice data and find agreement within one standard deviation.
