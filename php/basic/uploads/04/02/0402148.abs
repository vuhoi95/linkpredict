Title: Surveillance on the light-front gauge fixing Lagrangians
Authors: Alfredo T. Suzuki and J. H. O. Sales
Abstract: In this work we propose two Lagrange multipliers with distinct coefficients for the light-front gauge that leads to the complete (non-reduced) propagator. This is accomplished via $(n\cdot A)^{2}+(\partial \cdot A)^{2}$ terms in the Lagrangian density. These lead to a well-defined and exact though Lorentz non invariant light front propagator.
