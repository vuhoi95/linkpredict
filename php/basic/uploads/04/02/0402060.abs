Title: Signaling and the Black Hole Final State
Authors: Ulvi Yurtsever and George Hockney
Abstract: In an attempt to restore the unitarity of the evaporation process, Horowitz and Maldacena recently proposed a boundary-condition constraint for the final quantum state of an evaporating black hole at its singularity. Gottesman and Preskill have argued that the proposed constraint must lead to nonlinear evolution of the initial (collapsing) quantum state. Here we show that in fact this evolution allows signaling, making it detectable outside the event horizon with entangled-probe experiments of the kind we proposed recently. As a result the Horowitz-Maldacena proposal may be subject to terrestrial tests.
