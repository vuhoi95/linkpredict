Title: Timelike Killing spinors in seven dimensions
Authors: Marco Cariglia and Oisin A. P. Mac Conamhna
Abstract: We employ the G-structure formalism to study supersymmetric solutions of minimal and SU(2) gauged supergravities in seven dimensions admitting Killing spinors with associated timelike Killing vector. The most general such Killing spinor defines an SU(3) structure. We deduce necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a timelike Killing spinor on the bosonic fields of the theories, and find that such configurations generically preserve one out of sixteen supersymmetries. Using our general supersymmetric ansatz we obtain numerous new solutions, including squashed or deformed AdS solutions of the gauged theory, and a large class of Godel-like solutions with closed timelike curves.
