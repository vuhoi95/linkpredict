Title: Relativistic free-particle quantization on the light-front: New aspects
Authors: J. H. O. Sales and A. T. Suzuki and G. E. R. Zambrano
Abstract: We use the light-front machinery to study the behavior of a relativistic free particle and obtain the quantum commutation relations from the classical Poisson brackets. We argue that the usual projection onto the light-front coordinates for these from the covariant commutation ralations does not reproduce the expected results.
