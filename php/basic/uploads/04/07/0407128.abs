Abstract: A variational theory of a perfect spin fluid with intrinsic non-Abelian color charge is constructed with allowance for spin-polarization chromomagnetic effects in Riemann-Cartan space with curvature and torsion. The spacelike nature of the spin is taken into account explicitly in this theory by including the Frenkel condition in the Lagrangian. The equations of motion, the laws that govern the evolutions of the spin and color-charge tensors, and the expression for the energy-momentum tensor for the fluid in question are obtained. In the limiting case, the theory goes over to the well-known theory of Weyssenhoff-Raabe perfect spin fluid.
