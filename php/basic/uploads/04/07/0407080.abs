Title: Linear Form of 3-scale Relativity Algebra and the Relevance of Stability
Authors: C. Chryssomalakos and E. Okon
Abstract: We show that the algebra of the recently proposed Triply Special Relativity can be brought to a linear (ie, Lie) form by a correct identification of its generators. The resulting Lie algebra is the stable form proposed by Vilela Mendes a decade ago, itself a reapparition of Yang's algebra, dating from 1947. As a corollary we assure that, within the Lie algebra framework, there is no Quadruply Special Relativity.
