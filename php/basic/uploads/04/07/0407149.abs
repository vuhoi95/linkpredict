Title: Lorentz-Violating Vector Fields Slow the Universe Down
Authors: Sean M. Carroll and Eugene A. Lim
Abstract: We consider the gravitational effects of a single, fixed-norm, Lorentz-violating timelike vector field. In a cosmological background, such a vector field acts to rescale the effective value of Newton's constant. The energy density of this vector field precisely tracks the energy density of the rest of the universe, but with the opposite sign, so that the universe experiences a slower rate of expansion for a given matter content. This vector field similarly rescales Newton's constant in the Newtonian limit, although by a different factor. We put constraints on the parameters of the theory using the predictions of primordial nucleosynthesis, demonstrating that the norm of the vector field should be less than the Planck scale by an order of magnitude or more.
