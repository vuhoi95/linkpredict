Title: Holography in Einstein Gauss-Bonnet Gravity
Authors: Sachiko Ogushi and Misao Sasaki
Abstract: We investigate a holographic relation between Einstein Gauss-Bonnet gravity in $n$ dimensions and its dual field theory in ($n-1$) dimensions. We briefly review the AdS/CFT correspondence for the entropy in the $n$-dimensional Einstein gravity and consider its extension to the case of the $n$-dimensional Einstein Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We show that there is a holographic relation between entropies of an Einstein Gauss-Bonnet black hole in the bulk and the corresponding radiation on the brane in the high temperature limit. In particular, we find that the Hubble entropy evaluated when the brane crosses the horizon also coincides with the black hole entropy in the high temperature limit.
