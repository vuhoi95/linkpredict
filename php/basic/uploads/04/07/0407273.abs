Title: Grassmann variables on quantum spaces
Authors: Dzo Mikulovic and Alexander Schmidt and Hartmut Wachter
Abstract: Attention is focused on antisymmetrized versions of quantum spaces that are of particular importance in physics, i.e. two-dimensional quantum plane, q-deformed Euclidean space in three or four dimensions as well as q-deformed Minkowski space. For each case standard techniques for dealing with q-deformed Grassmann variables are developed. Formulae for multiplying supernumbers are given. The actions of symmetry generators and fermionic derivatives upon antisymmetrized quantum spaces are calculated. The complete Hopf structure for all types of quantum space generators is written down. From the formulae for the coproduct a realization of the L-matrices in terms of symmetry generators can be read off. The L-matrices together with the action of symmetry generators determine how quantum spaces of different type have to be fused together.
