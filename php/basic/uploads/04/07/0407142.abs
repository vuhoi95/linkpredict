Title: Matrix elements of the operator T\bar{T} in integrable quantum field  theory
Authors: Gesualdo Delfino and Giuliano Niccoli
Abstract: Recently A. Zamolodchikov obtained a series of identities for the expectation values of the composite operator T\bar{T} constructed from the components of the energy-momentum tensor in two-dimensional quantum field theory. We show that if the theory is integrable the addition of a requirement of factorization at high energies can lead to the exact determination of the generic matrix element of this operator on the asymptotic states. The construction is performed explicitly in the Lee-Yang model.
