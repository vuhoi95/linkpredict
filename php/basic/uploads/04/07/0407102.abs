Title: No Self-Interaction for Two-Column Massless Fields
Authors: Xavier Bekaert and Nicolas Boulanger and Sandrine Cnockaert
Abstract: We investigate the problem of introducing consistent self-couplings in free theories for mixed tensor gauge fields whose symmetry properties are characterized by Young diagrams made of two columns of arbitrary (but different) lengths. We prove that, in flat space, these theories admit no local, Poincar\'e-invariant, smooth, self-interacting deformation with at most two derivatives in the Lagrangian. Relaxing the derivative and Lorentz-invariance assumptions, there still is no deformation that modifies the gauge algebra, and in most cases no deformation that alters the gauge transformations.Our approach is based on a BRST-cohomology deformation procedure.
