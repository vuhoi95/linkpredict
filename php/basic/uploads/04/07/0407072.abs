Title: Corrections to the Planck's radiation law from loop quantum gravity
Authors: Huitzilin Yepez and Juan M. Romero and Adolfo Zamora
Abstract: We study the dispersion relation obtained from the semiclassical loop quantum gravity. This dispersion relation is considered for a photon system at finite temperatures and the changes to the Planck's radiation law, the Wien and Boltzmann laws are discussed. Corrections to the equation of state of the black body radiation are also obtained.
