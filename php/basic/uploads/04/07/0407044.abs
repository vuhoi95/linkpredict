Title: Classical Integrability and Super Yangian of Superstring on AdS_5 x S^5
Authors: Machiko Hatsuda and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We discuss a classical integrability in the type IIB string theory on the AdS_5 x S^5 background. By using the Roiban-Siegel formulation of the superstring on the AdS_5 x S^5, we carefully treat the Wess-Zumino term and the constraint conditions intrinsic to the supersymmetric case, and construct explicitly non-local charges for a hidden infinite-dimensional symmetry. The existence of the symmetry is shown by Bena-Polchinski-Roiban. Then the super Yangian algebra is calculated. We also show the Serre relation ensuring the structure of the Hopf algebra. In addition, the classical integrability is discussed by constructing the Lax pair and the transfer matrix.
