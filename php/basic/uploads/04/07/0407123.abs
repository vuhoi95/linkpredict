Title: Quantum versus classical scattering of Dirac particles by a solenoidal  magnetic field and the correspondence principle
Authors: Gabriela Murguia and Matias Moreno and Manuel Torres
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the scattering of charged particles by the magnetic field of a long solenoid of constant magnetic flux and finite radius. We study the relativistic and non-relativistic quantum and classical scenarios. The classical limit of the perturbative quantum expressions, understood as the Planck's limit (making $\hbar$ going to zero) is analyzed and compared with the classical result. The classical cross section shows a general non-symmetric behavior with respect to the scattering angle in contradistinction to the quantum calculations performed so far. The various regimes analyzed show that the quantum cross sections do not satisfy the correspondence principle: they do not reduce to the classical result in any considered limit, an argument in favor of the interpretation of the process as a purely quantum phenomenon. We conclude that in order to restore the classical correspondence of the phenomenon, a complete non-perturbative quantum calculation for a finite solenoid radius is required.
