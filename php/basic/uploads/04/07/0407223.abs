Authors: N. Kitanine and J. M. Maillet and N. A. Slavnov and V. Terras
Abstract: We obtain a new multiple integral representation for the spin-spin correlation functions of the XXZ spin-1/2 infinite chain. We show that this representation is closely related with the partition function of the six-vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions.
