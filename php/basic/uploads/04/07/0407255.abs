Title: Aspects of Quantum Gravity in de Sitter Spaces
Authors: Dietmar Klemm and Luciano Vanzo
Abstract: In these lectures we give a review of recent attempts to understand quantum gravity on de Sitter spaces. In particular, we discuss the holographic correspondence between de Sitter gravity and conformal field theories proposed by Hull and by Strominger, and how this may be reconciled with the finite-dimensional Hilbert space proposal by Banks and Fischler. Furthermore we review the no-go theorems that forbid an embedding of de Sitter spaces in string theory, and discuss how they can be circumvented. Finally, some curious issues concerning the thermal nature of de Sitter space are elucidated.
