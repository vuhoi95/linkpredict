Title: Self-Dual Vector Multiplet in 3D with Gauged Scale Covariance
Authors: Hitoshi Nishino and Subhash Rajpoot
Abstract: We present non-trivial interactions of N=1 self-dual massive vector multiplet in three-dimensions, with gauged scale covariance. Our multiplets are a vector multiplet (A_\mu, \lambda) and a gauge multiplet (B_\mu, \chi), where the latter is used for the gauging of the scale covariance of the former. Due tothe absence of supergravity, this system has no lagrangian formulation, but has only a set of field equations. The gauge multiplet can also have Dirac-Born-Infeld type interactions, even in the presence of the massive self-dual vector multiplet. As a by-product, we also show that scale covariant couplings are possible for scalar multiplet. We also try a mechanism of spontaneous breaking of scale covariance by introducing a superpotential for scalar multiplets.
