Abstract: We consider a hydrodynamic approach in which a quantum system of interacting quarks and gluons is approximated classically by representing it as a perfect fluid having intrinsic degrees of freedom. Every particle of such fluid is endowed with spin and non-Abelian color charge. The variational theory of such perfect spin fluid with color charge is constructed, the spin-polarization chromomagnetic effects in an external Yang-Mills field and in Riemann-Cartan space with curvature and torsion being taken into account.
