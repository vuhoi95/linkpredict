Title: A Geometric Look on the Microstates of Supertubes
Authors: Dongsu Bak and Yoshifumi Hyakutake and Seok Kim and Nobuyoshi Ohta
Abstract: We give a geometric interpretation of the entropy of the supertubes with fixed conserved charges and angular momenta in two different approaches using the DBI action and the supermembrane theory. By counting the geometrically allowed microstates, it is shown that both the methods give consistent result on the entropy. In doing so, we make the connection to the gravity microstates clear.
