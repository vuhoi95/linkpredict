Title: Sasaki-Einstein Twist of Kerr-AdS Black Holes
Authors: Yoshitake Hashimoto and Makoto Sakaguchi and Yukinori Yasui
Abstract: We consider Kerr-AdS black holes with equal angular momenta in arbitrary odd spacetime dimensions \ge 5. Twisting the Killing vector fields of the black holes, we reproduce the compact Sasaki-Einstein manifolds constructed by Gauntlett, Martelli, Sparks and Waldram. We also discuss an implication of the twist in string theory and M-theory.
