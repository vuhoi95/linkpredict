Title: Rigorous Dynamics and Radiation Theory for a Pauli-Fierz Model in the  Ultraviolet Limit
Authors: Massimo Bertini and Diego Noja and Andrea Posilicano
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to the detailed study of quantization and evolution of the point limit of the Pauli-Fierz model for a charged oscillator interacting with the electromagnetic field in dipole approximation. In particular, a well defined dynamics is constructed for the classical model, which is subsequently quantized according to the Segal scheme. To this end, the classical model in the point limit is reformulated as a second order abstract wave equation, and a consistent quantum evolution is given. This allows a study of the behaviour of the survival and transition amplitudes for the process of decay of the excited states of the charged particle, and the emission of photons in the decay process. In particular, for the survival amplitude the exact time behaviour is found. This is completely determined by the resonances of the systems plus a tail term prevailing in the asymptotic, long time regime. Moreover, the survival amplitude exhibites in a fairly clear way the Lamb shift correction to the unperturbed frequencies of the oscillator.
