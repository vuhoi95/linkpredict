Title: Dynamical correlation functions of the XXZ spin-1/2 chain
Authors: N. Kitanine and J. M. Maillet and N. A. Slavnov and V. Terras
Abstract: We derive a master equation for the dynamical spin-spin correlation functions of the XXZ spin-1/2 Heisenberg finite chain in an external magnetic field. In the thermodynamic limit, we obtain their multiple integral representation.
