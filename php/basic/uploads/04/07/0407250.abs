Title: Doppler effect of gamma-ray bursts in the fireball framework
Authors: Yi-Ping Qin and Fu-Wen Zhang
Abstract: The influence of the Doppler effect in the fireball framework on the spectrum of gamma-ray bursts is investigated. The study shows that the shape of the expected spectrum of an expanding fireball remains almost the same as that of the corresponding rest frame spectrum for constant radiations of the bremsstrahlung, Comptonized, and synchrotron mechanisms as well as for that of the GRB model. The peak flux spectrum and the peak frequency are obviously correlated. When the value of the Lorentz factor becomes 10 times larger, the flux of fireballs would be several orders of magnitude larger. The expansion speed of fireballs is a fundamental factor of the enhancement of the flux of gamma-ray bursts.
