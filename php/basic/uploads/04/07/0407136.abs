Title: Scattered Results in 2D String Theory
Authors: Emil Martinec and Kazumi Okuyama
Abstract: The nonperturbative $1\to N$ tachyon scattering amplitude in 2D type 0A string theory is computed. The probability that $N$ particles are produced is a monotonically decreasing function of $N$ whenever $N$ is large enough that statistical methods apply. The results are compared with expectations from black hole thermodynamics.
