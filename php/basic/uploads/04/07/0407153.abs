Abstract: On the basis of the method of Cartan exterior forms and extended Lie derivatives, a hydrodynamic equation of the Euler type that describes a perfect spin fluid with an intrinsic color charge in an external non-Abelian color field in Riemann-Cartan space is derived from the energy-momentum quasiconservation law. This equation is used to obtain a self-consistent set of equations of motion for a classical test particle with a spin and a color charge in a color field combined with a gravitational field characterized by curvature and torsion. The resulting equations generalize the Wong equation, which describes the motion of a particle with an isospin, and the Tamm-Good and Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equations, which describe the evolution of a charged-particle spin in an electromagnetic field.
