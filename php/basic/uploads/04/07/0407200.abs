Title: Gravitational F-terms of N=1 Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
Authors: Ido Adam and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We consider four-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories in a supergravity background. We use generalized Konishi anomaly equations and R-symmetry anomaly to compute the exact perturbative and non-perturbative gravitational F-terms. We study two types of theories: The first model breaks supersymmetry dynamically, and the second is based on a $G_2$ gauge group. The results are compared with the corresponding vector models. We discuss the diagrammatic expansion of the $G_2$ theory.
