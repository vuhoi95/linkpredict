Title: On Stochastic Evolutions and Superconformal Field Theory
Authors: Jasbir Nagi and Jorgen Rasmussen
Abstract: Links between certain stochastic evolutions of conformal maps and conformal field theory have been studied in the realm of SLE and by utilizing singular vectors in highest-weight modules of the Virasoro algebra. It was recently found that this scenario could be extended to stochastic evolutions of superconformal maps of N=1 superspace with links to superconformal field theory and singular vectors of the N=1 superconformal algebra in the Neveu-Schwarz sector. Here we discuss the analogous extension to the Ramond sector. We also discuss how the links are modified when an unconventional superconformal structure or superderivative is employed.
