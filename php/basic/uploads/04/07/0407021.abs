Title: High precision study of the structure of D=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills  quantum mechanics
Authors: M. Campostrini and J. Wosiek
Abstract: The spectrum of D=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills quantum mechanics is computed with high accuracy in all channels of angular momentum and fermion number. Localized and non-localized states coexists in certain channels as a consequence of the supersymmetric interactions with flat valleys. All states fall into well identifiable supermultiplets providing an explicit realization of supersymmetry on the spectroscopic level. An accidental degeneracy among some supermultiplets has been found. Regularized Witten index converges to a time-independent constant which agrees with earlier calculations.
