Title: A model of flavors
Authors: Tomas Brauner and Jiri Hosek
Abstract: We argue in favor of dynamical mass generation in an SU(2)xU(1) electroweak model with two complex scalar doublets with ordinary masses. The masses of leptons and quarks are generated by ultraviolet-finite non-perturbative solutions of the Schwinger-Dyson equations for full fermion propagators with self-consistently modified scalar boson exchanges. The W and Z boson masses are expressed in terms of spontaneously generated fermion proper self-energies in the form of sum rules. The model predicts two charged and four real neutral heavy scalars.
