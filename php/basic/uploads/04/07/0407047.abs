Title: Scalar Cosmology with Multi-exponential Potentials
Authors: Andres Collinucci and Mikkel Nielsen and Thomas Van Riet
Abstract: We investigate cosmologies with an arbitrary number of scalars and the most general multi-exponential potential. By formulating the equations of motion in terms of autonomous systems we complete the classification of power-law and de Sitter solutions as critical points, e.g. attractor and repeller solutions, in terms of the scalar couplings. Many of these solutions have been overlooked in the literature. We provide specific examples for double and triple exponential potentials with one and two scalars, where we find numerical solutions, which interpolate between the critical points. Some of these correspond to the reduction of new exotic S-brane solutions.
