Title: Reflection on event horizon and escape of particles from confinement  inside black holes
Authors: M. Yu. Kuchiev and V. V. Flambaum
Abstract: Several recently found properties of the event horizon of black holes are discussed. One of them is the reflection of the incoming particles on the horizon. A particle approaching the black hole can bounce on the horizon back, into the outside world, which drastically reduces the absorption cross section in the infrared region. Another, though related phenomenon takes place for particles inside the horizon. A locked inside particle has, in fact, an opportunity to escape into the outside world. Thus, the confinement inside the horizon is not absolute. The escape from within the interior region of the horizon allows the transfer of information from this region into the outside world. This result may help resolve the information paradox for black holes. Both the reflection and escape phenomena happen due to pure quantum reasons, being impossible in the classical approximation.
