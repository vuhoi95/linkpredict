Title: Effective action of dressed mean fields for N = 4 super-Yang-Mills  theory
Authors: Gorazd Cvetic and Igor Kondrashuk and Ivan Schmidt
Abstract: Based on general considerations such as $R$-operation and Slavnov-Taylor identity we show that the effective action, being understood as Legendre transform of the logarithm of the path integral, possesses particular structure in ${\cal N} =4$ supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory for kernels of the effective action expressed in terms of the dressed effective fields. These dressed effective fields have been introduced in our previous papers as actual variables of the effective action. The concept of dressed effective fields naturally appears in the framework of solution to Slavnov-Taylor identity. The particularity of the structure is the independence of these kernels on the ultraviolet regularization scale $\Lambda.$ These kernels are functions of mutual spacetime distances and of the gauge coupling. The fact that $\beta$ function in this theory is zero is used significantly.
