Title: Kappa-symmetric Derivative Corrections to D-brane Dynamics
Authors: J. M. Drummond and S. F. Kerstan
Abstract: We show how the superembedding formalism can be applied to construct manifestly kappa-symmetric higher derivative corrections for the D9-brane. We also show that all correction terms appear at even powers of the fundamental length scale $l$. We explicitly construct the first potential correction, which corresponds to the kappa-symmetric version of the $\partial^4 F^4$, which one finds from the four-point amplitude of the open superstring.
