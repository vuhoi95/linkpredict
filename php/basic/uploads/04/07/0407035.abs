Title: Axially symmetric SU(3) Gravitating Skyrmions
Authors: Theodora Ioannidou and Burkhard Kleihaus and Wojtek Zakrzewski
Abstract: Axially symmetric gravitating multi-skyrmion configurations are obtained using the harmonic map ansatz introduced in [1]. In particular, the effect of gravity on the energy and baryon densities of the SU(3) non-gravitating multi-skyrmion configurations is studied in detail.
