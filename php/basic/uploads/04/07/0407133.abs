Title: Noncommutative Correction to the Aharonov-Bohm Scattering: a Field  Theory Approach
Authors: M. A. Anacleto and M. Gomes and A. J. da Silva and D. Spehler
Abstract: We study a noncommutative nonrelativistic theory in 2+1 dimensions of a scalar field coupled to the Chern-Simons field. In the commutative situation this model has been used to simulate the Aharonov-Bohm effect in the field theory context. We verified that, contrarily to the commutative result, the inclusion of a quartic self-interaction of the scalar field is not necessary to secure the ultraviolet renormalizability of the model. However, to obtain a smooth commutative limit the presence of a quartic gauge invariant self-interaction is required. For small noncommutativity we fix the corrections to the Aharonov-Bohm scattering and prove that up to one-loop the model is free from dangerous infrared/ultraviolet divergences.
