Title: Casimir Energy for a Wedge with Three Surfaces and for a Pyramidal  Cavity
Authors: H. Ahmedov and I. H. Duru
Abstract: Casimir energy calculations for the conformally coupled massless scalar field for a wedge defined by three intersecting planes and for a pyramid with four triangular surfaces are presented. The group generated by reflections are employed in the formulation of the required Green functions and the wave functions.
