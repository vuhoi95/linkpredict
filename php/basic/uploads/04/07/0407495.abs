Title: Lagrange-Fedosov Nonholonomic Manifolds
Authors: Fernando Etayo and Rafael Santamar\{'Ä±}a and Sergiu I. Vacaru
Abstract: We outline an unified approach to geometrization of Lagrange mechanics, Finsler geometry and geometric methods of constructing exact solutions with generic off-diagonal terms and nonholonomic variables in gravity theories. Such geometries with induced almost symplectic structure are modelled on nonholonomic manifolds provided with nonintegrable distributions defining nonlinear connections. We introduce the concept of Lagrange-Fedosov spaces and Fedosov nonholonomic manifolds provided with almost symplectic connection adapted to the nonlinear connection structure. We investigate the main properties of generalized Fedosov nonholonomic manifolds and analyze exact solutions defining almost symplectic Einstein spaces.
