Title: Anomalous magnetic moment in parity-conserving QED3
Authors: Jean Alexandre and K. Farakos and N. E. Mavromatos
Abstract: In this article we derive the anomalous magnetic moment of fermions in (2+1)-dimensional parity-conserving QED3, in the presence of an externally applied constant magnetic field. We use a spectral representation of the photon propagator to avoid infrared divergences. We also discuss the scaling with the magnetic field intensity in the case of strong external fields, where there is dynamical mass generation for fermions induced by the magnetic field itself (magnetic catalysis). The results of this paper may be of relevance to the physics of high-temperature superconductors.
