Title: The Energy Density of "Wound" Fields in a Toroidal Universe
Authors: W. Fischler and S. Paban and M. Zanic
Abstract: The observational limits on the present energy density of the Universe allow for a component that redshifts like $1/a^2$ and can contribute significantly to the total. We show that a possible origin for such a contribution is that the universe has a toroidal topology with "wound" scalar fields around its cycles.
