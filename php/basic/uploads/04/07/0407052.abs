Title: Topological susceptibility in the SU(3) gauge theory
Authors: Luigi Del Debbio and Leonardo Giusti and Claudio Pica
Abstract: We compute the topological susceptibility for the SU(3) Yang--Mills theory by employing the expression of the topological charge density operator suggested by Neuberger's fermions. In the continuum limit we find r_0^4 chi = 0.059(3), which corresponds to chi=(191 +/- 5 MeV)^4 if F_K is used to set the scale. Our result supports the Witten--Veneziano explanation for the large mass of the eta'.
