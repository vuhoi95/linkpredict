Title: Planar Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics of a Charged Particle in an  External Electromagnetic Field
Authors: Ricardo C. Paschoal and José A. Helayël-Neto and Leonardo P. G. de Assis
Abstract: The supersymmetric quantum mechanics of a two-dimensional non-relativistic particle subject to external magnetic and electric fields is studied in a superfield formulation and with the typical non-minimal coupling of (2+1) dimensions. Both the N=1 and N=2 cases are contemplated and the introduction of the electric interaction is suitably analysed.
