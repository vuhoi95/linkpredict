Title: Touring the Hagedorn Ridge
Authors: J. L. F. Barbon and E. Rabinovici
Abstract: We review aspects of the Hagedorn regime in critical string theories, from basic facts about the ideal gas approximation to the proposal of a global picture inspired by general ideas of holography. It was suggested that the condensation of thermal winding modes triggers a first-order phase transition. We propose, by an Euclidean analogue of the string/black hole correspondence principle, that the transition is actually related to a topology change in spacetime. Similar phase transitions induced by unstable winding modes can be studied in toy models. There, using T-duality of supersymmetric cycles, one can identify a topology change of the Gregory--Laflamme type, which we associate with large-N phase transitions of Yang--Mills theories on tori. This essay is dedicated to the memory of Ian Kogan.
