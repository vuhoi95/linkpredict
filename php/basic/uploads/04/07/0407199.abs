Title: Aspects of sine-Gordon solitons, defects and gates
Authors: E. Corrigan and C. Zambon
Abstract: It was recently noted how the classical sine-Gordon theory can support discontinuities, or `defects', and yet maintain integrability by preserving sufficiently many conservation laws. Since soliton number is not preserved by a defect, a possible application to the construction of logical gates is suggested.
