Title: A supersymmetric black ring
Authors: Henriette Elvang and Roberto Emparan and David Mateos and Harvey S. Reall
Abstract: A new supersymmetric black hole solution of five-dimensional supergravity is presented. It has an event horizon of topology S1xS2. This is the first example of a supersymmetric, asymptotically flat black hole of non-spherical topology. The solution is uniquely specified by its electric charge and two independent angular momenta. These conserved charges can be arbitrarily close, but not exactly equal, to those of a supersymmetric black hole of spherical topology.
