Title: Supersymmetric SO(10) Models Inspired by Deconstruction
Authors: Chao-Shang Huang and Jing Jiang and Tianjun Li
Abstract: We consider 4-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric SO(10) models inspired by deconstruction of 5-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric orbifold SO(10) models and high dimensional non-supersymmetric SO(10) models with Wilson line gauge symmetry breaking. We discuss the $SO(10) \times SO(10)$ models with bi-fundamental link fields where the gauge symmetry can be broken down to the Pati-Salam, $SU(5) \times U(1)$, flipped $SU(5) \times U(1)'$ or the standard model like gauge symmetry. We also propose an $SO(10) \times SO(6) \times SO(4)$ model with bi-fundamental link fields where the gauge symmetry is broken down to the Pati-Salam gauge symmetry, and an $SO(10) \times SO(10)$ model with bi-spinor link fields where the gauge symmetry is broken down to the flipped $SU(5) \times U(1)'$ gauge symmetry. In these two models, the Pati-Salam and flipped $SU(5) \times U(1)'$ gauge symmetry can be further broken down to the standard model gauge symmetry, the doublet-triplet splittings can be obtained by the missing partner mechanism, and the proton decay problem can be solved. We also study the gauge coupling unification. We briefly comment on the interesting variation models with gauge groups $SO(10) \times SO(6)$ and $SO(10) \times flipped SU(5) \times U(1)'$ in which the proton decay problem can be solved.
