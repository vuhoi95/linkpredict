Title: Dimensional Reduction of Nonlinear Gauge Theories
Authors: Noriaki Ikeda and K. -I. Izawa
Abstract: We investigate an extension of 2D nonlinear gauge theory from the Poisson sigma model based on Lie algebroid to a model with additional two-form gauge fields. Dimensional reduction of 3D nonlinear gauge theory yields an example of such a model, which provides a realization of Courant algebroid by 2D nonlinear gauge theory. We see that the reduction of the base structure generically results in a modification of the target (algebroid) structure.
