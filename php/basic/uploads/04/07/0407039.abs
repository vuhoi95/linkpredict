Title: Yang-Mills action from minimally coupled bosons on R^4 and on the 4D  Moyal plane
Authors: Juha Loikkanen and Cornelius Paufler
Abstract: We consider bosons on Euclidean R^4 that are minimally coupled to an external Yang-Mills field. We compute the logarithmically divergent part of the cut-off regularized quantum effective action of this system. We confirm the known result that this term is proportional to the Yang-Mills action. We use pseudodifferential operator methods throughout to prepare the ground for a generalization of our calculation to the noncommutative four-dimensional Moyal plane (also known as noncommutative flat space). We also include a detailed comparison of our cut-off regularization to heat kernel techniques. In the case of the noncommutative space, we complement the usual technique of asymptotic expansion in the momentum variable with operator theoretic arguments in order to keep separated quantum from noncommutativity effects. We show that the result from the commutative space R^4 still holds if one replaces all pointwise products by the noncommutative Moyal product.
