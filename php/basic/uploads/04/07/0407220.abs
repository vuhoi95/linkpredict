Title: On Coordinate Transformations in Planar Noncommutative Theories
Authors: D. H. Correa and C. D. Fosco and F. A. Schaposnik and G. Torroba
Abstract: We consider planar noncommutative theories such that the coordinates verify a space-dependent commutation relation. We show that, in some special cases, new coordinates may be introduced that have a constant commutator, and as a consequence the construction of Field Theory models may be carried out by an application of the standard Moyal approach in terms of the new coordinates. We apply these ideas to the concrete example of a noncommutative plane with a curved interface. We also show how to extend this method to more general situations.
