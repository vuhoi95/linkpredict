Title: Pre-logarithmic and logarithmic fields in a sandpile model
Authors: Geoffroy Piroux and Philippe Ruelle
Abstract: We consider the unoriented two-dimensional Abelian sandpile model on the half-plane with open and closed boundary conditions, and relate it to the boundary logarithmic conformal field theory with central charge c=-2. Building on previous results, we first perform a complementary lattice analysis of the operator effecting the change of boundary condition between open and closed, which confirms that this operator is a weight -1/8 boundary primary field, whose fusion agrees with lattice calculations. We then consider the operators corresponding to the unit height variable and to a mass insertion at an isolated site of the upper half plane and compute their one-point functions in presence of a boundary containing the two kinds of boundary conditions. We show that the scaling limit of the mass insertion operator is a weight zero logarithmic field.
