Title: Effective Hamiltonian for Isotropic Loop Quantum Cosmology
Authors: Ghanashyam Date and Golam Mortuza Hossain
Abstract: For a class of solutions of the fundamental difference equation of isotropic loop quantum cosmology, the difference equation can be replaced by a differential equation valid for {\em all} values of the triad variable. The differential equation admits a `unique' non-singular continuation through vanishing triad. A WKB approximation for the solutions leads to an effective continuum Hamiltonian. The effective dynamics is also non-singular (no big bang singularity) and approximates the classical dynamics for large volumes. The effective evolution is thus a more reliable model for further phenomenological implications of the small volume effects.
