Title: D=4, N=2 Supergravity with Abelian electric and magnetic charges
Authors: Luca Sommovigo and Silvia Vaul√°
Abstract: We discuss the relation between standard N=2 supergravity with translational gauging and N=2 supergravities with scalar-tensor multiplets with massive tensors and Abelian electric charges. We point out that a symplectic covariant formulation of N=2 supergravity can be achieved just in the presence of tensor multiplets. As a consequence one can see that the formulation of the N=2 theory as it comes from IIB flux compactification, which is included in these models, is equivalent to a non perturbative phase of standard N=2 supergravity. It is also shown that the IIB tadpole cancellation condition is imposed by supersymmetry in four dimensions.
