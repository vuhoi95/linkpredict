Title: S-brane solutions in gauged and ungauged supergravities
Authors: Michael Gutperle and Wafic Sabra
Abstract: We construct time dependent S-brane solutions in gauged and ungauged supergravities in various dimensions. The supergravity solutions we find are all special cases of solutions in gauged supergravities with symmetric potentials. We discuss some properties of these solutions and their relation to topological black holes in anti-de Sitter spaces.
