Title: Non-trivial extension of the Poincar√© algebra for antisymmetric gauge  fields
Authors: G. Moultaka and M. Rausch de Traubenberg and A. Tanasa
Abstract: We investigate a non-trivial extension of the $D-$dimensional Poincar\'e algebra. Matrix representations are obtained. The bosonic multiplets contain antisymmetric tensor fields. It turns out that this symmetry acts in a natural geometric way on these $p-$forms. Some field theoretical aspects of this symmetry are studied and invariant Lagrangians are explicitly given.
