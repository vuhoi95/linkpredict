Title: The low-lying mass spectrum of the N=1 SU(2) SUSY Yang-Mills theory with  Wilson fermions
Authors: Federico Farchioni and Roland Peetz
Abstract: We analyze the low energy spectrum of bound states of the N=1 SU(2) SUSY Yang-Mills Theory (SYM). This work continues the investigation of the non-perturbative properties of SYM by Monte Carlo simulations in the Wilson discretization with dynamical gluinos. The dynamics of the gluinos is included by the Two-Step Multi-Bosonic Algorithm (TSMB) for dynamical fermions. A new set of configurations has been generated on a 16^3x32 lattice at beta=2.3 and kappa=0.194. The analysis also includes sets of configurations previously generated on a smaller (12^3x24) lattice at kappa=0.1925, 0.194 and 0.1955. Guided by predictions from low energy Lagrangians, we consider spin-1/2, scalar and pseudoscalar particles. The spectrum of SYM is a challenging subject of investigation because of the extremely noisy correlators. In particular, meson-like correlators contain disconnected contributions. The larger time-extention of the 16^3x32 lattice allows to observe two-state signals in the effective mass. Finite-volume effects are monitored by comparing results from the two lattice sizes.
