Title: Lagrangian supersymmetries depending on derivatives. Global analysis and  cohomology
Authors: G. Giachetta and L. Mangiarotti and G. Sardanashvily
Abstract: Lagrangian contact supersymmetries (depending on derivatives of arbitrary order) are treated in very general setting. The cohomology of the variational bicomplex on an arbitrary graded manifold and the iterated cohomology of a generic nilpotent contact supersymmetry are computed. In particular, the first variational formula and conservation laws for Lagrangian systems on graded manifolds using contact supersymmetries are obtained.
