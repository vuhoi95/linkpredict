Title: Space-time symmetry restoration in cosmological models with Kalb--Ramond  and scalar fields
Authors: E. Di Grezia and G. Mangano and G. Miele
Abstract: We study symmetry of space-time in presence of a minimally coupled scalar field interacting with a Kalb--Ramond tensor fields in a homogeneous but initially anisotropic universe. The analysis is performed for the two relevant cases of a pure cosmological constant and a minimal quadratic, renormalizable, interaction term. In both cases, due to expansion, a complete spatial symmetry restoration is dynamically obtained.
