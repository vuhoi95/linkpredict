Abstract: We study the one-loop quantum corrections to the U(N) noncommutative supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in three spacetime dimensions (NCSYM$_3$). We show that the cancellation of the dangerous UV/IR infrared divergences only takes place in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. Furthermore, in the one-loop approximation, the would be subleading UV and UV/IR infrared divergences are shown to vanish.
