Title: D-instanton sums for matter hypermultiplets
Authors: Sergei V. Ketov and Osvaldo P. Santillan and Andrei G. Zorin
Abstract: We calculate some non-perturbative (D-instanton) quantum corrections to the moduli space metric of several (n>1) identical matter hypermultiplets for the type-IIA superstrings compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold, near conifold singularities. We find a non-trivial deformation of the (real) 4n-dimensional hypermultiplet moduli space metric due to the infinite number of D-instantons, under the assumption of n tri-holomorphic commuting isometries of the metric, in the hyper-K"ahler limit (i.e. in the absence of gravitational corrections).
