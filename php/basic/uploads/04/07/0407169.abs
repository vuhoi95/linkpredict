Title: Towards SDp-brane Quantization
Authors: H. Garcia-Compean and G. Garcia-Jimenez and O. Obregon and C. Ramirez
Abstract: The quantum mechanical analysis of the canonical hamiltonian description of the effective action of a SDp-brane in bosonic ten dimensional Type II supergravity in a homogeneous background is given. We find exact solutions for the corresponding quantum theory by solving the Wheeler-deWitt equation in the late-time limit of the rolling tachyon. The probability densities for several values of p are shown and their possible interpretation is discussed. In the process the effects of electromagnetic fields are also incorporated and it is shown that in this case the interpretation of tachyon regarded as ``matter clock'' is modified.
