Title: Dualisation of the Salam-Sezgin D=8 Supergravity
Authors: Tekin Dereli and Nejat Tevfik Yilmaz
Abstract: The first-order formulation of the Salam-Sezgin D=8 supergravity coupled to N vector multiplets is discussed. The non-linear realization of the bosonic sector of the D=8 matter coupled Salam-Sezgin supergravity is introduced by the dualisation of the fields and by constructing the Lie superalgebra of the symmetry group of the doubled field strength.
