Title: One dimensional M5-brane intersections
Authors: Ansar Fayyazuddin and Tasneem Zehra Husain and Dileep P. Jatkar
Abstract: We study one dimensional intersections of M5 branes with M5 and M2 branes. On the worldvolume of the M5-brane, such an intersection appears as a string soliton. We study this worldvolume theory in two different regimes: 1) Where the worldvolume theory is formulated in flat space and 2) where the worldvolume theory is studied in the supergravity background produced by a stack of M5 (or M2) branes. In both cases, we study the corresponding string solitons, and find the most general BPS configuration consistent with the fraction of supersymmetries preserved. We argue that M5 and M2 brane intersections leave different imprints on the worldvolume theory of the intersecting probe brane, although geometrically they appear to be similar.
