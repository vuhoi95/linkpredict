Title: Static axially symmetric solutions of Einstein-Yang-Mills equations with  a negative cosmological constant: black hole solutions
Authors: Eugen Radu and Elizabeth Winstanley
Abstract: We investigate static axially symmetric black hole solutions in a four-dimensional Einstein-Yang-Mills-SU(2) theory with a negative cosmological constant $\Lambda$. These solutions approach asymptotically the anti-de Sitter spacetime and possess a regular event horizon. A discussion of the main properties of the solutions and the differences with respect to the asymptotically flat case is presented. The mass of these configurations is computed by using a counterterm method. We note that the $\Lambda=-3$ configurations have an higher dimensional interpretation in context of $d=11$ supergravity. The existence of axially symmetric monopole and dyon solutions in a fixed Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter background is also discussed. An exact solution of the Einstein-Yang-Mills equations is presented in Appendix.
