Title: Dimensions and Units in Electrodynamics
Authors: Friedrich W. Hehl and Yuri N. Obukhov
Abstract: We sketch the foundations of classical electrodynamics, in particular the transition that took place when Einstein, in 1915, succeeded to formulate general relativity. In 1916 Einstein demonstrated that, with a choice of suitable variables for the electromagnetic field, it is possible to put Maxwell's equation into a form that is covariant under general coordinate transformations. This unfolded, by basic contributions of Kottler, Cartan, van Dantzig, Schouten & Dorgelo, Toupin & Truesdell, and Post, to what one may call {\em premetric classical electrodynamics.} This framework will be described shortly. An analysis is given of the physical dimensions involved in electrodynamics and subsequently the question of units addressed. It will be pointed out that these results are untouched by the generalization of classical to quantum electrodynamics (QED). We compare critically our results with those of {\sl L.B. Okun} which he had presented at a recent conference.
