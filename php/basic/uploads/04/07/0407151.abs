Title: Spectrum of rotating black holes and its implications for Hawking  radiation
Authors: Saurya Das and Himan Mukhopadhyay and P. Ramadevi
Abstract: The reduced phase space formalism for quantising black holes has recently been extended to find the area and angular momentum spectra of four dimensional Kerr black holes. We extend this further to rotating black holes in all spacetime dimensions and show that although as in four dimensions the spectrum is discrete, it is not equispaced in general. As a result, Hawking radiation spectra from these black holes are continuous, as opposed to the discrete spectrum predicted for four dimensional black holes.
