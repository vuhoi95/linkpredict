Title: Relativistic quantum communication with bosonic and fermionic  interferometers
Authors: Pieter Kok and Samuel L. Braunstein
Abstract: We derive the relativistic transformation laws for the annihilation operators of the scalar field, the massive spin-1 vector field, the electromagnetic field and the spinor field. The technique developed here involves straightforward mathematical techniques based on fundamental quantum field theory, and is applicable to the study of entanglement in arbitrary coordinate transformations. In particular, it predicts particle creation for non-inertial motion. Furthermore, we present a unified description of relativistic transformations and multi-particle interferometry with bosons and fermions, which encompasses linear optical quantum computing.
