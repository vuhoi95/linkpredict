Title: Physical Variables of $d=3$ Maxwell-Chern-Simons Theory by Symplectic  Projector Method
Authors: J. A. Helayel-Neto and M. A. Santos and I. V. Vancea
Abstract: The Symplectic Projector Method is applied to derive the local physical degrees of freedom and the physical Hamiltonian of the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory in $d=1+2$. The results agree with the ones obtained in the literature through different approaches.
