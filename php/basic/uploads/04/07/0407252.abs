Title: Flux Vacua Statistics for Two-Parameter Calabi-Yau's
Authors: A. Misra and A. Nanda
Abstract: We study the number of flux vacua for type IIB string theory on an orientifold of the Calabi-Yau expressed as a hypersurface in WCP^4[1,1,2,2,6] by evaluating a suitable integral over the complex-structure moduli space as per the conjecture of Douglas and Ashok. We show that away from the singular conifold locus, one gets a power law, and that the (neighborhood) of the conifold locus indeed acts as an attractor in the (complex structure) moduli space. We also study (non)supersymmetric solutions near the conifold locus.In the process, we evaluate the periods near the conifold locus. We also study (non)supersymmetric solutions near the conifold locus, and show that supersymmetric solutions near the conifold locus do not support fluxes.
