Title: Power Law Inflation and the Cosmic No Hair Theorem in Brane World
Authors: B. C. Paul and A. Beesham
Abstract: The Cosmic no hair theorem is studied in anisotropic Bianchi brane models which admit power law inflation with a scalar field. We note that all Bianchi models except Bianchi type IX transit to an inflationary regime and the anisotropy washes out at a later epoch. It is found that in the brane world, the anisotropic universe approaches the isotropic phase via inflation much faster than that in the general theory of relativity. The modification in the Einstein field equations on the brane is helpful for a quick transition to an isotropic era from the anisotropic brane. We note a case where the curvature term in the field equation initially drives power law inflation on the isotropic brane which is however not permitted without the brane framework.
