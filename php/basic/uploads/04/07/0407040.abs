Title: Monopole gas in three dimensional SU(2) gluodynamics
Authors: M. N. Chernodub and Katsuya Ishiguro and Tsuneo Suzuki
Abstract: We study properties of the Abelian monopoles in the Maximal Abelian projection of the three dimensional pure SU(2) gauge model. We match the lattice monopole dynamics with the continuum Coulomb gas model using a method of blocking from continuum. We obtain the Debye screening length and the monopole density in continuum using numerical results for the lattice density of the (squared) monopole charges and for the monopole action. The monopoles treated within our blocking method provide about 75% contribution to the non--Abelian Debye screening length. We also find that monopoles form a Coulomb plasma which is not dilute.
