Title: Nut Charged Space-times and Closed Timelike Curves on the Boundary
Authors: Dumitru Astefanesei and Robert B. Mann and Eugen Radu
Abstract: We consider higher dimensional generalizations of the four dimensional topological Taub-NUT-AdS solutions, where the angular spheres are replaced by planes and hyperboloids. The thermodynamics of these configurations is discussed to some extent. The results we find suggest that the entropy/area relation is always violated in the presence of a NUT charge. We argue also that the conjectured AdS/CFT correspondence may teach us something about the physics in spacetimes containing closed timelike curves. To this aim, we use the observation that the boundary metric of a (D+1)-dimensional Taub-NUT-AdS solution provides a D-dimensional generalization of the known G\"odel-type spacetimes.
