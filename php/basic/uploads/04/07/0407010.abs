Title: Non-commuting coordinates, exotic particles, & anomalous anyons in the  Hall effect
Authors: C. Duval and P. A. Horvathy
Abstract: Our previous ``exotic'' particle, together with the more recent anomalous anyon model (which has arbitrary gyromagnetic factor $g$) are reviewed. The non-relativistic limit of the anyon generalizes the exotic particle which has $g=0$ to any $g$.When put into planar electric and magnetic fields, the Hall effect becomes mandatory for all $g\neq2$, when the field takes some critical value.
