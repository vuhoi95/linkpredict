Title: Perfect Fluid Theory and its Extensions
Authors: R. Jackiw and V. P. Nair and S. -Y. Pi and A. P. Polychronakos
Abstract: We review the canonical theory for perfect fluids, in Eulerian and Lagrangian formulations. The theory is related to a description of extended structures in higher dimensions. Internal symmetry and supersymmetry degrees of freedom are incorporated. Additional miscellaneous subjects that are covered include physical topics concerning quantization, as well as mathematical issues of volume preserving diffeomorphisms and representations of Chern-Simons terms (= vortex or magnetic helicity).
