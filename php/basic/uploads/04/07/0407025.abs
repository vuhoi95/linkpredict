Title: The 4d effective action of 5d gauged supergravity with boundaries
Authors: Ph. Brax and N. Chatillon
Abstract: We consider gauged five dimensional supergravity with boundaries and vector multiplets in the bulk. We analyse the zero modes of the BPS configurations preserving N=1 supergravity at low energy. We find the 4d low energy effective action involving the moduli associated to the BPS zero modes. In particular, we derive the K\"ahler potential on the moduli space corresponding to the low energy 4d N=1 effective action.
