Abstract: In the study of conjecture on M-theory as a non-linear realization $E_{11}/K_{11}$ we present arguments for the following: 1)roots of $K_{11}$ coincide with the roots of Kac-Moody algebra $EE_{11}$ with Dynkin diagram given in the paper, 2)one of the fundamental weights of $EE_{11}$ coincides with $l_1$ weight of $E_{11}$, known to contain 11d supergravity brane charges. The statement 1) is extended on $E_{10}$ and $E_9$ algebras.
