Title: Low Energy Supersymmetry From the Landscape
Authors: Michael Dine and Elie Gorbatov and Scott Thomas
Abstract: There has been some debate as to whether the landscape does or does not predict low energy supersymmetry. We argue that under rather mild assumptions, the landscape seems to favor such breaking, quite possibly at a very low scale. Some of the issues which must be addressed in order to settle these questions are the relative frequency with which tree level and non-perturbative effects generate expectation values for auxillary fields and the superpotential, as well as the likelihood of both $R$- and non-$R$ discrete or accidental symmetries. Alternate scenarios with warped compactifications or large extra dimensions are also discussed.
