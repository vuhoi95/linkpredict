Title: Fluxes in M-theory on 7-manifolds: G_2-, SU(3)- and SU(2)-structures
Authors: Klaus Behrndt and Claus Jeschek
Abstract: We consider compactifications of M-theory on 7-manifolds in the presence of 4-form fluxes, which leave at least four supercharges unbroken. Supersymmetric vacua admit G-structures and we discuss the cases of G_2-, SU(3)- as well as SU(2)-structures. We derive the constraints on the fluxes imposed by supersymmetry and determine the flux components that fix the resulting 4-dimensional cosmological constant (i.e. superpotential).
