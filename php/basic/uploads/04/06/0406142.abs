Title: A speculative relation between the cosmological constant and the Planck  mass
Authors: S. Hsu and A. Zee
Abstract: We propose the relation $M_\Lambda \sim (M_{Pl} M_U)^{1/2}$ where $M_\Lambda$, $M_{Pl},$ and $M_U$ denote the mass scale associated with the cosmological constant, the gravitational interaction, and the size of the universe respectively.
