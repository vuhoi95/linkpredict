Title: Quantification and scaling of multipartite entanglement in continuous  variable systems
Authors: Gerardo Adesso and Alessio Serafini and Fabrizio Illuminati
Abstract: We present a theoretical method to determine the multipartite entanglement between different partitions of multimode, fully or partially symmetric Gaussian states of continuous variable systems. For such states, we determine the exact expression of the logarithmic negativity and show that it coincides with that of equivalent two--mode Gaussian states. Exploiting this reduction, we demonstrate the scaling of the multipartite entanglement with the number of modes and its reliable experimental estimate by direct measurements of the global and local purities.
