Title: Inflation in large N limit of supersymmetric gauge theories
Authors: Asko Jokinen and Anupam Mazumdar
Abstract: Within supersymmetry we provide an example where the inflaton sector is derived from a gauge invariant polynomial of SU(N) or SO(N) gauge theory. Inflation in our model is driven by multi-flat directions, which assist accelerated expansion. We show that multi-flat directions can flatten the individual non-renormalizable potentials such that inflation can occur at sub-Planckian scales. We calculate the density perturbations and the spectral index, we find that the spectral index is closer to scale invariance for large N. In order to realize a successful cosmology we require large N of order, N~600.
