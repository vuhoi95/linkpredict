Title: U-duality covariant membranes
Authors: Viktor Bengtsson and Martin Cederwall and Henric Larsson and Bengt E. W. Nilsson
Abstract: We outline a formulation of membrane dynamics in D=8 which is fully covariant under the U-duality group SL(2,Z) x SL(3,Z), and encodes all interactions to fields in the eight-dimensional supergravity, which is constructed through Kaluza-Klein reduction on T^3. Among the membrane degrees of freedom is an SL(2,R) doublet of world-volume 2-form potentials, whose quantised electric fluxes determine the membrane charges, and are conjectured to provide an interpretation of the variables occurring in the minimal representation of E_{6(6)} which appears in the context of automorphic membranes. We solve the relevant equations for the action for a restricted class of supergravity backgrounds. Some comments are made on supersymmetry and lower dimensions.
