Title: Phantom inflation and the "Big Trip"
Authors: Pedro F. Gonzalez-Diaz and Jose A. Jimenez-Madrid
Abstract: Primordial inflation is regarded to be driven by a phantom field which is here implemented as a scalar field satisfying an equation of state $p=\omega\rho$, with $\omega<-1$. Being even aggravated by the weird properties of phantom energy, this will pose a serious problem with the exit from the inflationary phase. We argue however in favor of the speculation that a smooth exit from the phantom inflationary phase can still be tentatively recovered by considering a multiverse scenario where the primordial phantom universe would travel in time toward a future universe filled with usual radiation, before reaching the big rip. We call this transition the "big trip" and assume it to take place with the help of some form of anthropic principle which chooses our current universe as being the final destination of the time transition.
