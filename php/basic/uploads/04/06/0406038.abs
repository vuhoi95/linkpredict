Title: The symplectic Kadomtsev-Petviashvili hierarchy and rational solutions  of Painlev√© VI
Authors: Henrik Aratyn and Johan van de Leur
Abstract: Equivalence is established between a special class of Painleve VI equations parametrized by a conformal dimension $\mu$, time dependent Euler top equations, isomonodromic deformations and three-dimensional Frobenius manifolds. The isomodromic tau function and solutions of the Euler top equations are explicitly constructed in terms of Wronskian solutions of the 2-vector 1-constrained symplectic Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (CKP) hierarchy by means of Grassmannian formulation. These Wronskian solutions give rational solutions of the Painleve VI equation for $\mu=1,2,{...} $.
