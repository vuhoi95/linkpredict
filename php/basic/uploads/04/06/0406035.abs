Title: Decoherent Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy and Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry
Authors: Gabriela Barenboim and Nick Mavromatos
Abstract: A CPT violating decoherence scenario can easily account for all the experimental evidence in the neutrino sector including LSND. In this work it is argued that this framework can also accommodate the Dark Energy content of the Universe, as well as the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry.
