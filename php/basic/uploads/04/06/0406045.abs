Title: Generating a dynamical M2 brane from super-gravitons in a pp-wave  background
Authors: Yi-Fei Chen and J. X. Lu
Abstract: We present a detail study of dynamically generating a M2 brane from super-gravitons (or D0 branes) in a pp-wave background possessing maximal spacetime SUSY. We have three kinds of dynamical solutions depending on the excess energy which appears as an order parameter signalling a critical phenomenon about the solutions. As the excess energy is below a critical value, we have two branches of the solution, one can have its size zero while the other cannot for each given excess energy. However there can be an instanton tunnelling between the two. Once the excess energy is above the critical value, we have a single solution whose dynamical behavior is basically independent of the background chosen and whose size can be zero at some instant. A by product of this study is that the size of particles or extended objects can grow once there is a non-zero excess energy even without the presence of a background flux, therefore lending support to the spacetime uncertainty principle.
