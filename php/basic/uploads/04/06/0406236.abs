Title: Basic properties of Fedosov supermanifolds
Authors: B. Geyer and P. M. Lavrov
Abstract: Basic properties of even (odd) supermanifolds endowed with a connection respecting a given symplectic structure are studied. Such supermanifolds can be considered as generalization of Fedosov manifolds to the supersymmetric case.
