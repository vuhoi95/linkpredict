Abstract: The dynamical quantum effects arising due to the boundary presence with two types of boundary conditions (BC) satisfied by scalar fields are studied. It is shown that while the Neumann BC lead to the usual scalar field mass generation, the Dirichlet BC give rise to the dynamical mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Due to the later, there arises the possibility of the respective phase transition from the normal phase to the spontaneously broken one. In particular, at the critical value of the combined evolution parameter the usual massless scalar QED transforms to the Higgs model.
