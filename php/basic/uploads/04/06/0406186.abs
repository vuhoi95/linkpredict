Title: Conformal entropy as a consequence of the properties of stationary  Killing horizons
Authors: M. Cvitan and S. Pallua and P. Prester
Abstract: We show that microscopic black hole entropy formula based on Virasoro algebra can be derived from usual properties of stationary Killing horizons alone and absence of singularities of curvature invariants on them. In such a way some usual additional assumptions are shown to be fulfilled. In addition, for all quantities power expansion near horizon and thus explicit insight of the limiting procedure is given. More important the near horizon conformal symmetry proposed by Carlip together with its consequences on microscopic entropy is given a clear geometric origin.
