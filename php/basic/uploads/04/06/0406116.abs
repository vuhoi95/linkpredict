Title: Regular non-twisting S-branes
Authors: Octavio Obregon and Hernando Quevedo and Michael P. Ryan
Abstract: We construct a family of time and angular dependent, regular S-brane solutions which corresponds to a simple analytical continuation of the Zipoy-Voorhees 4-dimensional vacuum spacetime. The solutions are asymptotically flat and turn out to be free of singularities without requiring a twist in space. They can be considered as the simplest non-singular generalization of the singular S0-brane solution. We analyze the properties of a representative of this family of solutions and show that it resembles to some extent the asymptotic properties of the regular Kerr S-brane. The R-symmetry corresponds, however, to the general Lorentzian symmetry. Several generalizations of this regular solution are derived which include a charged S-brane and an additional dilatonic field.
