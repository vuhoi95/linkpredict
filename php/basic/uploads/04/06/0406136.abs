Authors: D. V. Uvarov and A. A. Zheltukhin
Abstract: Algebra of the constraints of twistor-like p-branes restoring 3/4 fraction of the spontaneously broken D=4 N=1 supersymmetry is studied using the conversion method. Classical and quantum realizations of the BRST charge, unified superalgebra of the global generalized superconformal OSp(1|8) and Virasoro and Weyl symmetries are constructed. It is shown that the quantum Hermitian BRST charge is nilpotent and the quantized OSp(1|8) superalgebra is closed.
