Title: Sneutrino condensate as a candidate for the hot big bang cosmology
Authors: Anupam Mazumdar and A. PÃ©rez-Lorenzana
Abstract: If inflationary paradigm is correct, then it must create conditions for the hot big bang model with all observed matter, baryons and the seed perturbations for the structure formation. In this paper we propose a scenario where the inflaton energy density is dumped into the bulk in a brane world setup, and all the required physical conditions are created by the right handed neutrino sector within supersymmetry. The scalar component of the right handed Majorana neutrino is responsible for generating the scale invariant fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation, reheating the Universe at a temperature~$T_{rh}\leq 10^{9}$ GeV, and finally generating the lepton/baryon asymmetry, $n_{B}/s\sim 10^{-10}$, with no lepton/baryon isocurvature fluctuations.
