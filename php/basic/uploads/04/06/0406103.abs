Title: 3-charge geometries and their CFT duals
Authors: Stefano Giusto and Samir D. Mathur and Ashish Saxena
Abstract: We consider two families of D1-D5-P states and find their gravity duals. In each case the geometries are found to `cap off' smoothly near r=0; thus there are no horizons or closed timelike curves. These constructions support the general conjecture that the interior of black holes is nontrivial all the way up to the horizon.
