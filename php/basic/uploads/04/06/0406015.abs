Title: ABC of N=8, d=1 supermultiplets
Authors: S. Bellucci and E. Ivanov and S. Krivonos and O. Lechtenfeld
Abstract: We construct a variety of off-shell $N{=}8, d{=}1$ supermultiplets with finite numbers of component fields as direct sums of properly constrained $N{=}4, d{=}1$ superfields. We also show how these multiplets can be described in $N{=}8, d{=}1$ superspace where the whole amount of supersymmetry is manifest. Some of these multiplets can be obtained by dimensional reduction {}from $N{=}2$ multiplets in $d{=}4$, whereas others cannot. We give examples of invariant superfield actions for the multiplets constructed, including $N{=}8$ superconformally invariant ones.
