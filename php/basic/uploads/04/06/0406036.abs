Title: A new general approximation scheme(NGAS) in quantum theory:application  to the anharmonic- and double well oscillators
Authors: B. P. Mahapatra and N. Santi and N. B. Pradhan
Abstract: A new scheme of approximation in quantum theory is proposed which is potentially applicable to arbtrary interacting systems. The method consists in in approximating the original Hamiltonian by one corresponding to a suitable exactly solvable system (with interaction) such that the "quantum average" of both are equal, thus forcing self-consistency.The method transcends the limitations of the variational method and the perturbation theory.The results are systematically improvable by the construction of a improved perturbation theory (IPT) which automatically satisfies the condition of convergence. Uniformly accurate results are obtained for the case of the quartic-,sextic- and octic anharmonic oscillators as well as the quartic and sextic double well oscillators. The leading order results reproduce earlier results by different methods using different input assumptions.The results for the sextic oscillators agree well with exact prediction of supersymmetry. We also discuss the stability and structure of the effective vacuum state of the approximation.
