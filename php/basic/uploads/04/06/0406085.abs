Title: MHV Vertices and Scattering Amplitudes in Gauge Theory
Authors: Jun-Bao Wu and Chuan-Jie Zhu
Abstract: The generic googly amplitudes in gauge theory are computed by using the Cachazo-Svrcek-Witten approach to perturbative calculation in gauge theory and the results are in agreement with the previously well-known ones. Within this approach we also discuss the parity transformation, charge conjugation and the dual Ward identity. We also extend this calculation to include fermions and the googly amplitudes with a single quark-anti-quark pair are obtained correctly from fermionic MHV vertices. At the end we briefly discuss the possible extension of this approach to gravity.
