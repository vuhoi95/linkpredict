Title: Gaugino Condensation and Generation of Supersymmetric 3-Form Flux
Authors: G. L. Cardoso and G. Curio and G. Dall'Agata and D. Lust
Abstract: We extend the linearised solution of Polchinski and Strassler describing the supergravity dual of the N=1* gauge theory. By analysing the equations of motion of type IIB supergravity at cubic order in the mass perturbation parameter, we demonstrate the emergence of a 3-form flux of type (3,0) with respect to the natural complex structure. The generation of this flux can be associated to the dynamical formation of a gaugino condensate in the confining phase of the N=1* gauge theory. We also check that the supersymmetry conditions are satisfied, and we discuss how this (3,0)-form flux is tied to the existence of a supersymmetric background with SU(2)-structure.
