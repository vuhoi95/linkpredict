Title: Nonassociative geometry: Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime
Authors: Alexander I. Nesterov and Lev V. Sabinin
Abstract: In (Phys. Rev. D 62, 081501, 2000) we proposed a unified approach to description of continuous and discrete spacetime based on nonassociative geometry and described nonassociative smooth and discrete de Sitter models. In our paper we give the description of nonassociative Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime.
