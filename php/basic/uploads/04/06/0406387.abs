Title: Test of patch cosmology with WMAP
Authors: Kyong Hee Kim and Yun Soo Myung
Abstract: We calculate the power spectrum, spectral index, and running spectral index for inflationary patch cosmology arisen from Gauss-Bonnet braneworld scenario using the Mukhanov equation. This patch cosmology consists of Gauss-Bonnet(GB), Randall-Sundrum (RS-II), and four dimensional (4D) cosmological models. There exist several modifications in higher order calculations. However, taking the power-law inflation by choosing different potentials depending on the model, there exist minor changes up to second order corrections. Since second order corrections are rather small in the slow-roll limit, we could not choose a desired power-law model which explains the WMAP data. Finally we discuss the reliability of high order calculations based on the Mukhanov equation by comparing the perturbed equation including 5D metric perturbations. It turns out that first order corrections are reliable, while second order corrections are not proved to be reliable.
