Title: Central Charges and Extra Dimensions in Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Michael Faux and David Kagan and Donald Spector
Abstract: We systematically include central charges into supersymmetric quantum mechanics formulated on curved Euclidean spaces, and explain how the background geometry manifests itself on states of the theory. In particular, we show in detail how, from the point of view of non-relativistic d=1 world-line physics, one can infer the existence of target space dualities typically associated with string theory. We also explain in detail how the presence of a non-trivial supersymmetry central charge restricts the background geometry in which a particle may propagate.
