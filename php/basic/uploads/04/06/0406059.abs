Title: Half-Monopole and Multimonopole
Authors: Rosy Teh and Khai-Ming Wong
Abstract: We would like to present some exact SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs monopole solutions of half-integer topological charge. These solutions can be just an isolated half-monopole or a multimonopole with topological magnetic charge, ${1/2}m$, where $m$ is a natural number. These static monopole solutions satisfy the first order Bogomol'nyi equations. The axially symmetric one-half monopole gauge potentials possess a Dirac-like string singularity along the negative z-axis. The multimonopole gauge potentials are also singular along the z-axis and possess only mirror symmetries.
