Title: Giant Gravitons in AdS_3 x S^3 x T^4 as Fuzzy Cylinders
Authors: Bert Janssen and Yolanda Lozano and Diego Rodriguez-Gomez
Abstract: Using the non-Abelian action for coincident Type IIB gravitational waves proposed in hep-th/0303183 we show that giant gravitons in the AdS_3 x S^3 x T^4 background can be described in terms of coincident waves expanding into a fuzzy cylinder, spanned by two embedding scalars and one worldvolume scalar. This fuzzy cylinder has dipole and magnetic moments with respect to the 2-form and 6-form potentials of the background, and can be interpreted as a bound state of D1-branes and D5-branes (wrapped on the 4-torus) wrapped around the basis of the cylinder. We show the exact agreement between this description and the Abelian, macroscopical description given in the literature.
