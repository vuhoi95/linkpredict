Title: Semiclassical relativistic strings in S^5 and long coherent operators in  N=4 SYM theory
Authors: M. Kruczenski and A. Tseytlin
Abstract: We consider the low energy effective action corresponding to the 1-loop, planar, dilatation operator in the scalar sector of N=4 SU(N) SYM theory. For a general class of non-holomorphic ``long'' operators, of bare dimension L>>1, it is a sigma model action with 8-dimensional target space and agrees with a limit of the phase-space string sigma model action describing generic fast-moving strings in the S^5 part of AdS_5 x S^5. The limit of the string action is taken in a way that allows for a systematic expansion to higher orders in the effective coupling $\lambda/L^2$. This extends previous work on rigid rotating strings in S^5 (dual to operators in the SU(3) sector of the dilatation operator) to the case when string oscillations or pulsations in S^5 are allowed. We establish a map between the profile of the leading order string solution and the structure of the corresponding coherent, ``locally BPS'', SYM scalar operator. As an application, we explicitly determine the form of the non-holomorphic operators dual to the pulsating strings. Using action--angle variables, we also directly compute the energy of pulsating solutions, simplifying previous treatments.
