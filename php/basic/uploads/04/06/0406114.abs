Title: Energy Density in Expanding Universes as Seen by Unruh's Detector
Authors: Bjorn Garbrecht and Tomislav Prokopec
Abstract: We consider the response of an Unruh detector to scalar fields in an expanding space-time. When combining transition elements of the scalar field Hamiltonian with the interaction operator of detector and field, one finds at second order in time-dependent perturbation theory a transition amplitude, which actually dominates in the ultraviolet over the first order contribution. In particular, the detector response faithfully reproduces the particle number implied by the stress-energy of a minimally coupled scalar field, which is inversely proportional to the energy of a scalar mode. This finding disagrees with the contention that in de Sitter space, the response of the detector drops exponentially with particle energy and therefore indicates a thermal spectrum.
