Title: Flux-induced Soft Supersymmetry Breaking in Chiral Type IIB Orientifolds  with D3/D7-Branes
Authors: D. Lust and S. Reffert and S. Stieberger
Abstract: We discuss supersymmetry breaking via 3-form fluxes in chiral supersymmetric type IIB orientifold vacua with D3- and D7-branes. After a general discussion of possible choices of fluxes allowing for stabilizing of a part of the moduli, we determine the resulting effective action including all soft supersymmetry breaking terms. We also extend the computation of our previous work concerning the matter field metrics arising from various open string sectors, in particular focusing on the 1/2 BPS D3/D7-brane configuration. Afterwards, the F-theory lift of our constructions is investigated.
