Title: Diffeomorphisms and orthonormal frames
Authors: Bruno Iochum and Thomas Schucker
Abstract: There is a natural homomorphism of Lie pseudoalgebras from local vector fields to local rotations on a Riemannian manifold. We address the question whether this homomorphism is unique and give a positive answer in the perturbative regime around the flat metric.
