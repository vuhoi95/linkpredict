Title: Supersymmetry and Lorentzian holonomy in various dimensions
Authors: Rafael Hernandez and Konstadinos Sfetsos and Dimitrios Zoakos
Abstract: We present a systematic method for constructing manifolds with Lorentzian holonomy group that are non-static supersymmetric vacua admitting covariantly constant light-like spinors. It is based on the metric of their Riemannian counterparts and the realization that, when certain conditions are satisfied, it is possible to promote constant moduli parameters into arbitrary functions of the light-cone time. Besides the general formalism, we present in detail several examples in various dimensions.
