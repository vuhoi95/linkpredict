Title: Spin, Acceleration and Gravity
Authors: Donato Bini and Christian Cherubini and Bahram Mashhoon
Abstract: The massless field perturbations of the accelerating Minkowski and Schwarzschild spacetimes are studied. The results are extended to the propagation of the Proca field in Rindler spacetime. We examine critically the possibility of existence of a general spin-acceleration coupling in complete analogy with the well-known spin-rotation coupling. We argue that such a direct coupling between spin and linear acceleration does not exist.
