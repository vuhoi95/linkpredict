Title: Thermodynamics of four-dimensional black objects in the warped  compactification
Authors: Hideaki Kudoh and Yasunari Kurita
Abstract: We reinvestigate the thermodynamics of black objects (holes and strings) in four-dimensional braneworld models that are originally constructed by Emparan, Horowitz and Myers based on the anti-de Sitter (AdS) C-metric. After proving the uniqueness of slicing the AdS C-metric, we derive thermodynamic quantities of the black objects by means of the Euclidean formulation and find that we have no necessity of requiring any regularization to calculate their classical action. We show that there exist the Bekenstein-Hawking law and the thermodynamic first law. The thermodynamic mass of the localized black hole on a flat brane is negative, and it differs from the one previously derived. We discuss the thermodynamic stabilities and show that the BTZ black string is more stable than the localized black holes in a canonical ensemble, except for an extreme case. We also find a braneworld analogue of the Hawking-Page transition between the BTZ black string and thermal AdS branes. The localized black holes on a de Sitter brane is discussed by considering Nariai instanton, comparing the study of "black cigar" in the five-dimensional braneworld model.
