Title: Fedosov supermanifolds: II. Normal coordinates
Authors: Bodo Geyer and Peter Lavrov
Abstract: The study of recently introduced Fedosov supermanifolds is continued. Using normal coordinates, properties of even and odd symplectic supermanifolds endowed with a symmetric connection respecting given sympletic structure are studied.
