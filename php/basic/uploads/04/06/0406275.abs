Title: Two-point functions for N=4 Konishi-like operators
Authors: Stefano Maghini and Alberto Santambrogio and Daniela Zanon
Abstract: We compute the two-point function of Konishi-like operators up to one-loop order, in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We work perturbatively in N=1 superspace. We find the expression expected on the basis of superconformal invariance and determine the normalization of the correlator and the anomalous dimension of the operators to order g^2 in the coupling constant.
