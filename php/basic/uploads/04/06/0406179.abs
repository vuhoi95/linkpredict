Title: Supertwistors and Cubic String Field Theory for Open N=2 Strings
Authors: Olaf Lechtenfeld and Alexander D. Popov
Abstract: The known Lorentz invariant string field theory for open N=2 strings is combined with a generalization of the twistor description of anti-self-dual (super) Yang-Mills theories. We introduce a Chern-Simons-type Lagrangian containing twistor variables and derive the Berkovits-Siegel covariant string field equations of motion via the twistor correspondence. Both the purely bosonic and the maximally space-time supersymmetric cases are considered.
