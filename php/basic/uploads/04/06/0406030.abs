Title: Fermi, Majorana and the statistical model of atoms
Authors: E. Di Grezia and S. Esposito
Abstract: We give an account of the appearance and first developments of the statistical model of atoms proposed by Thomas and Fermi, focusing on the main results achieved by Fermi and his group in Rome. Particular attention is addressed to the unknown contribution to this subject by Majorana, anticipating some important results reached later by leading physicists.
