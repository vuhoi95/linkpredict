Title: More on the universality of the Volkov-Akulov action under N = 1  nonlinear supersymmetry
Authors: Kazunari Shima and Motomu Tsuda
Abstract: We discuss further the universality of the Volkov-Akulov (V-A) action of a Nambu-Goldstone (N-G) fermion for the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry (SUSY). We show general relations between the standard V-A action and nonlinear (NL) SUSY actions including apparently (pathological) higher derivatives of the N-G fermion. Composite fields of the N-G fermions are found, which transform homogeneously under NL SUSY transformations of V-A. Consequently, we obtain NL SUSY invariant constraints which connect our NL SUSY actions with the V-A action. The constraints are explicitly solved and we show examples of the NL SUSY actions which are equivalent to the V-A action.
