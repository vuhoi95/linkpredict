Title: MHV Vertices and Fermionic Scattering Amplitudes in Gauge Theory with  Quarks and Gluinos
Authors: Jun-Bao Wu and Chuan-Jie Zhu
Abstract: The Cachazo-Svrcek-Witten approach to perturbative gauge theory is extended to gauge theories with quarks and gluinos. All googly amplitudes with quark-antiquark pairs and gluinos are computed and shown to agree with the previously known results. The computations of the non-MHV or non-googly amplitudes are also briefly discussed, in particular the purely fermionic amplitude with 3 quark-antiquark pairs.
