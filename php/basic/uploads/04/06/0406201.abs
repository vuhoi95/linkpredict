Title: A note on the supersymplectic structure of triplextic formalism
Authors: Bodo Geyer and Peter Lavrov and Armen Nersessian
Abstract: We equip the whole space of fields of the triplectic formalism of Lagrangian quantization with an even supersymplectic structure and clarify its geometric meaning. We also discuss its relation to a closed two-form arising naturally in the superfield approach to the triplectic formalism.
