Title: Inflaton field fluctuations from gauge-invariant metric fluctuations  during inflation
Authors: Mariano Anabitarte and Mauricio Bellini
Abstract: The evolution of the inflaton field fluctuations from gauge-invariant metric fluctuations is discused. In particular, the case of a symmetric $\phi_c$-exponential potential is analyzed.
