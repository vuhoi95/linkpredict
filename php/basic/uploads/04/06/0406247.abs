Title: Universal Correlators from Geometry
Authors: Robbert Dijkgraaf and Annamaria Sinkovics and Mine Temurhan
Abstract: Matrix model correlators show universal behaviour at short distances. We provide a derivation for these universal correlators by inserting probe branes in the underlying effective geometry. We generalize these results to study correlators of branes and their universal behaviour in the Calabi-Yau crystals, where we find a role for a generalized brane insertion.
