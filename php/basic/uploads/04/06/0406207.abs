Title: Dimensional Reduction of ten-dimensional Supersymmetric Gauge Theories  in the N=1, D=4 Superfield Formalism
Authors: P. Manousselis and G. Zoupanos
Abstract: A ten-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theory is written in terms of N=1, D=4 superfields. The theory is dimensionally reduced over six-dimensional coset spaces. We find that the resulting four-dimensional theory is either a softly broken N=1 supersymmetric gauge theory or a non-supersymmetric gauge theory depending on whether the coset spaces used in the reduction are non-symmetric or symmetric. In both cases examples susceptible to yield realistic models are presented.
