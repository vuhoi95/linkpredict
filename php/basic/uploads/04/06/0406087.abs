Title: Classical and quantum time dependent solutions in string theory
Authors: C. Martínez-Prieto and O. Obregón and J. Socorro
Abstract: Using the ontological interpretation of quantum mechanics in a particular sense, we obtain the classical behaviour of the scale factor and two scalar fields, derived from a string effective action for the FRW time dependent model. Besides, the Wheeler-DeWitt equation is solved exactly. We speculate that the same procedure could also be applied to S-branes.
