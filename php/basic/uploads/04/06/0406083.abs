Abstract: Direct and indirect dark matter searches can potentially lead to the discovery of Supersymmetry. In the specific context of heterotic orbifold compactification scenarios, it is even possible to get some clues on the SUSY breaking mechanism of the more fundamental underlying theory. In this paper, we investigate the prospects for indirect detection of neutralino dark matter via gamma-ray (continuum and line) and synchrotron radiation from the Galactic center, in the context of AMSB scenarios in an effective heterotic framework, which constitutes a consistent SUSY model between high energy theory and low energy phenomenology.
