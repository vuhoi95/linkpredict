Title: Curvature of Multiply Warped Products
Authors: Fernando Dobarro and Bulent Unal
Abstract: In this paper, we study Ricci-flat and Einstein Lorentzian multiply warped products. We also consider the case of having constant scalar curvatures for this class of warped products. Finally, after we introduce a new class of spacetimes called as generalized Kasner space-times, we apply our results to this kind of space-times as well as other relativistic space-times, i.e., Reissner-Nordstrom, Kasner space-times, Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli and de Sitter Black hole solutions.
