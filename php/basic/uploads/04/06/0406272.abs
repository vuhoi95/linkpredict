Title: 3D Georgi-Glashow model and confining strings at zero and finite  temperatures
Authors: D. Antonov and M. C. Diamantini
Abstract: In this review, we discuss the confining and finite-temperature properties of the 3D SU(N) Georgi-Glashow model, and of 4D compact QED. At zero temperature, we derive string representations of both theories, thus constructing the SU(N)-version of Polyakov's theory of confining strings. We discuss the geometric properties of confining strings, as well as the appearance of the string theta-term from the field-theoretical one in 4D, and k-string tensions at N larger than 2. In particular, we point out the relevance of negative stiffness for stabilizing confining strings, an effect recently re-discovered in material science. At finite temperature, we present a derivation of the confining-string free energy and show that, at the one-loop level and for a certain class of string models in the large-D limit, it matches that of QCD at large N. This crucial matching is again a consequence of the negative stiffness. In the discussion of the finite-temperature properties of the 3D Georgi-Glashow model, in order to be closer to QCD, we mostly concentrate at the effects produced by some extensions of the model by external matter fields, such as dynamical fundamental quarks or photinos, in the supersymmetric generalization of the model.
