Title: The Circular, Elliptic Three Spin String from the SU(3) Spin Chain
Authors: C. Kristjansen and T. Mansson
Abstract: We complete the description of the circular, elliptic three spin string on AdS_5 x S^5 having three large angular momenta (J_1,J_2,J_3) on S^5 in the language of the integrable SU(3) spin chain. First, we recover the string solution directly from the spin chain sigma model and secondly, we identify the appropriate Bethe root configuration in the so far unexplored region of parameter space.
