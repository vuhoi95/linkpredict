Title: The evolution of the universe from noncompact Kaluza-Klein theory
Authors: Jose Edgar Madriz Aguilar and Mauricio Bellini
Abstract: We develope a 5D mechanism inspired in the Campbell's theorem, to explain the (neutral scalar field governed) evolution of the universe from a initially inflationary expansion that has a change of phase towards a decelerated expansion and thereinafter evolves towards the present day observed celerated (quintessential) expansion.
