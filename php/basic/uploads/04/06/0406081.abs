Title: On The Super Five Brane Hamiltonian
Authors: A. De Castro and A. Restuccia
Abstract: The explicit form of the Wess-Zumino term of the PST super 5-brane Lagrangian in 11 dimensions is obtained. A complete canonical analysis for a gauge fixed PST super 5-brane action reveals the expected mixture of first and second class constraints. The canonical Hamiltonian is quadratic in the antisymmetric gauge field. Finally, we find the light cone gauge Hamiltonian for the theory and its stability properties are commented.
