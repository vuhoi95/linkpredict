Title: Weil-Petersson metric on the universal Teichmuller space II. Kahler  potential and period mapping
Authors: Leon A. Takhtajan and Lee-Peng Teo
Abstract: We study the Hilbert manifold structure on $T_{0}(1)$ -- the connected component of the identity of the Hilbert manifold T(1). We characterize points on $T_{0}(1)$ in terms of Bers and pre-Bers embeddings, and prove that the Grunsky operators $B_{1}$ and $B_{4}$, associated with the points in $T_{0}(1)$ via conformal welding, are Hilbert-Schmidt. We define a ``universal Liouville action'' -- a real-valued function $\SSS_{1}$ on $T_{0}(1)$, and prove that it is a K\"{a}hler potential of the Weil-Petersson metric on $T_{0}(1)$. We also prove that $\SSS_{1}$ is $-\tfrac{1}{12\pi}$ times the logarithm of the Fredholm determinant of associated quasi-circle, which generalizes classical results of Schiffer and Hawley. We define the universal period mapping $\hat{\cP}: T(1)\to\cB(\ell^{2})$ of T(1) into the Banach space of bounded operators on the Hilbert space $\ell^{2}$, prove that $\hat{\cP}$ is a holomorphic mapping of Banach manifolds, and show that $\hat{\cP}$ coincides with the period mapping introduced by Kurillov and Yuriev and Nag and Sullivan. We prove that the restriction of $\hat{\cP}$ to $T_{0}(1)$ is an inclusion of $T_{0}(1)$ into the Segal-Wilson universal Grassmannian, which is a holomorphic mapping of Hilbert manifolds. We also prove that the image of the topological group $S$ of symmetric homeomorphisms of $S^{1}$ under the mapping $\hat{\cP}$ consists of compact operators on $\ell^{2}$.
