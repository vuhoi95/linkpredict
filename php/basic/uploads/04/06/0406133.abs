Title: Twistor-Space Recursive Formulation of Gauge-Theory Amplitudes
Authors: I. Bena and Z. Bern and D. A. Kosower
Abstract: Using twistor space intuition, Cachazo, Svrcek and Witten presented novel diagrammatic rules for gauge-theory amplitudes, expressed in terms of maximally helicity-violating (MHV) vertices. We define non-MHV vertices, and show how to use them to give a recursive construction of these amplitudes. We also use them to illustrate the equivalence of various twistor-space prescriptions, and to determine the associated combinatoric factors.
