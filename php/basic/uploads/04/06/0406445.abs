Title: Lie algebroid morphisms, Poisson Sigma Models, and off-shell closed  gauge symmetries
Authors: Martin Bojowald and Alexei Kotov and Thomas Strobl
Abstract: Chern-Simons gauge theories in 3 dimensions and the Poisson Sigma Model (PSM) in 2 dimensions are examples of the same theory, if their field equations are interpreted as morphisms of Lie algebroids and their symmetries (on-shell) as homotopies of such morphisms. We point out that the (off-shell) gauge symmetries of the PSM in the literature are not globally well-defined for non-parallelizable Poisson manifolds and propose a covariant definition of them as left action of some finite-dimensional Lie algebroid. Our approach allows to avoid complications arising in the infinite dimensional super-geometry of the BV- and AKSZ-formalism. This preprint is a starting point in a series of papers meant to introduce Yang-Mills type gauge theories of Lie algebroids, which include and generalize the standard YM theory, the PSM, and gerbes.
