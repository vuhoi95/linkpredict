Title: Static quark potential and effective string corrections in the (2+1)-d  SU(2) Yang-Mills theory
Authors: M. Caselle and M. Pepe and A. Rago
Abstract: We report on a very accurate measurement of the static quark potential in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in (2+1) dimensions in order to study the corrections to the linear behaviour. We perform numerical simulations at zero and finite temperature comparing our results with the corrections given by the effective string picture in these two regimes. We also check for universal features discussing our results together with those recently published for the (2+1)-d Z(2) and SU(3) pure gauge theories.
