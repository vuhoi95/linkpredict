Title: Transport Theory beyond Binary Collisions
Authors: Margaret E. Carrington and Stanislaw Mrowczynski
Abstract: Using the Schwinger-Keldysh technique, we derive the transport equations for a system of quantum scalar fields. We first discuss the general structure of the equations and then their collision terms. Taking into account up to three-loop diagrams in \phi^3 model and up to four-loop diagrams in \phi^4 model, we obtain the transport equations which include the contributions of multi-particle collisions and particle production processes, in addition to mean-field effects and binary interactions.
