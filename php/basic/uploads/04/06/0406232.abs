Title: Noncommutative 2-Dimensional Models of Gravity
Authors: M. Buric and J. Madore
Abstract: A review is given of some 2-dimensional metrics for which noncommutative versions have been found. They serve partially to illustrate a noncommutative extension of the moving-frame formalism. All of these models suggest that there is an intimate relation between noncommutative geometry on the one hand and classical gravity on the other.
