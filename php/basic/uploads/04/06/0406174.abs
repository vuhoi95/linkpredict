Title: Lorentz invariance and unitarity in UV finite NCQFT
Authors: Anais Smailagic and Euro Spallucci
Abstract: Ultraviolet finite quantum field theory on even dimensional noncommutative spacetime is formulated using coordinate coherent states. 2d spacetime is foliated into families of orthogonal, non commutative, two-planes. Lorentz invariance is recovered if one imposes a single non commutative parameter theta in the theory. Unitarity is checked at the one-loop level and no violation is found. Being UV finite NCQFT does not present any UV/IR mixing.
