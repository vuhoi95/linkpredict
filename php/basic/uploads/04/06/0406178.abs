Title: Noncommutative Standard Modelling
Authors: Valentin V. Khoze and Jonathan Levell
Abstract: We present a noncommutative gauge theory that has the ordinary Standard Model as its low-energy limit. The model is based on the gauge group U(4) x U(3) x U(2) and is constructed to satisfy the key requirements imposed by noncommutativity: the UV/IR mixing effects, restrictions on representations and charges of matter fields, and the cancellation of noncommutative gauge anomalies. At energies well below the noncommutative mass scale our model flows to the commutative Standard Model plus additional free U(1) degrees of freedom which are decoupled due to the UV/IR mixing. Our model also predicts the values of the hypercharges of the Standard Model fields.
