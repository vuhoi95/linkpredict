Title: Static Monopoles and Their Anti-Configurations
Authors: Rosy Teh and Khai-Ming Wong
Abstract: Recently, we have reported on the existence of some monopoles, multimonopole, and antimonopoles configurations. In this paper we would like to present more monopoles, multimonopole, and antimonopoles configurations of the magnetic ansatz of Ref.\cite{kn:9} when the parameters $p$ and $b$ of the solutions takes different serial values. These exact solutions are a different kind of BPS solution. They satisfy the first order Bogomol'nyi equation but possess infinite energy. They can have radial, axial, or rotational symmetry about the z-axis. We classified these serial solutions as (i) the multimonopole at the origin; (ii) the finitely separated 1-monopoles; (iii) the screening solutions of multimonopole and (iv) the axially symmetric monopole solutions. We also give a construction of their anti-configurations with all the magnetic charges of poles in the configurations reversed. Half-integer topological magnetic charge multimonopole also exist in some of these series of solutions.
