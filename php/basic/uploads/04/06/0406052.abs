Title: Gravitational collapse of an isentropic perfect fluid with a linear  equation of state
Authors: Rituparno Goswami and Pankaj S Joshi
Abstract: We investigate here the gravitational collapse end states for a spherically symmetric perfect fluid with an equation of state $p=k\rho$. It is shown that given a regular initial data in terms of the density and pressure profiles at the initial epoch from which the collapse develops, the black hole or naked singularity outcomes depend on the choice of rest of the free functions available, such as the velocities of the collapsing shells, and the dynamical evolutions as allowed by Einstein equations. This clarifies the role that equation of state and initial data play towards determining the final fate of gravitational collapse.
