Title: Algebraic Bethe Ansatz for the Zamolodchikov-Fateev and Izergin-Korepin  models with open boundary conditions
Authors: V. Kurak and A. Lima-Santos
Abstract: We have considered the Zamolodchikov-Fateev and the Izergin-Korepin models with diagonal reflection boundaries. In each case the eigenspectrum of the transfer matrix is determined by application of the algebraic Bethe Ansatz.
