Abstract: In this work quantum physics in noncommutative spacetime is developed. It is based on the work of Doplicher et al. which allows for time-space noncommutativity. The Moyal plane is treated in detail. In the context of noncommutative quantum mechanics, some important points are explored, such as the formal construction of the theory, symmetries, causality, simultaneity and observables. The dynamics generated by a noncommutative Schrodinger equation is studied. We prove in particular the following: suppose the Hamiltonian of a quantum mechanical particle on spacetime has no explicit time dependence, and the spatial coordinates commute in its noncommutative form (the only noncommutativity being between time and a space coordinate). Then the commutative and noncommutative versions of the Hamiltonian have identical spectra.
