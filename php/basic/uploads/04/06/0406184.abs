Title: Quantum Oscillator on $\DC P^n$ in a constant magnetic field
Authors: Stefano Bellucci and Armen Nersessian and Armen Yeranyan
Abstract: We construct the quantum oscillator interacting with a constant magnetic field on complex projective spaces $\DC P^N$, as well as on their non-compact counterparts, i. e. the $N-$dimensional Lobachewski spaces ${\cal L}_N$. We find the spectrum of this system and the complete basis of wavefunctions. Surprisingly, the inclusion of a magnetic field does not yield any qualitative change in the energy spectrum. For $N>1$ the magnetic field does not break the superintegrability of the system, whereas for N=1 it preserves the exact solvability of the system. We extend this results to the cones constructed over $\DC P^N$ and ${\cal L}_N$, and perform the (Kustaanheimo-Stiefel) transformation of these systems to the three-dimensional Coulomb-like systems.
