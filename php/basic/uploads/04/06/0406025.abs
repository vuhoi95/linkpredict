Title: $sl(2|1)^{(2)}$ Gaudin Magnet and its associated Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov  equation
Authors: V. Kurak and A. Lima-Santos
Abstract: The semiclassical limit of the algebraic Bethe Ansatz method is used to solve the theory of Gaudin models for the $sl(2|1)^{(2)}$ R-matrix. We find the spectra and eigenvectors of the $N-1$ independents Gaudin Hamiltonians. We also use the off-shell Bethe Ansatz method to show how the off-shell Gaudin equation solves the associated trigonometric system of Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations.
