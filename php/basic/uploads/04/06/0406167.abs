Title: The conformally invariant Laplace-Beltrami operator and factor ordering
Authors: Michael P. Ryan, Jr. and Alexander V. Turbiner
Abstract: In quantum mechanics the kinetic energy term for a single particle is usually written in the form of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. This operator is a factor ordering of the classical kinetic energy. We investigate other relatively simple factor orderings and show that the {\it only} other solution for a conformally flat metric is the conformally invariant Laplace-Beltrami operator. For non-conformally-flat metrics this type of factor ordering fails, by just one term, to give the conformally invariant Laplace-Beltrami operator.
