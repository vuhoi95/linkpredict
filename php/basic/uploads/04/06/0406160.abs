Title: The nontopological scalar solitons in de Sitter spacetimes
Authors: Hongbo Cheng and Zhengyan Gu
Abstract: In this letter the nontopological scalar solitons with a self-interaction potential are investigated in a static de Sitter spacetime and their field equations are derived. In particular, with series expansion we prove analytically the nonexistence of the solutions under the boundary conditions, which show that some nontopological solitons can not live in the background.
