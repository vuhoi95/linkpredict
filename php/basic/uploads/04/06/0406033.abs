Title: Helicity Basis for Spin 1/2 and 1
Authors: Valeri V. Dvoeglazov and J. L. Quintanar Gonzalez
Abstract: We study the theory of the (1/2,0)+(0,1/2) and (1,0)+(0,1) representations in the helicity basis. The helicity eigenstates are not the parity eigenstates. This is in accordance with the idea of Berestetskii, Lifshitz and Pitaevskii. The behaviour of the helicity eigenstates with respect to the charge conjugation, CP- conjugation is also different comparing with the parity eigenstates.
