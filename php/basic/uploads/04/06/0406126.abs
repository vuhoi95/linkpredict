Title: Brane-Localized Goldstone Fermions in Bulk Supergravity
Authors: Jonathan A. Bagger and Dmitry V. Belyaev
Abstract: We construct the action and transformation laws for bulk five-dimensional AdS supergravity coupled to one or two brane-localized Goldstone fermions. The resulting bulk-plus-brane system gives a model-independent description of brane-localized supersymmetry breaking in the Randall-Sundrum scenario. We explicitly reduce the action and transformation laws to spontaneously broken four-dimensional supergravity.
