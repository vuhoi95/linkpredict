Title: Constraining SUSY GUTS with Cosmology
Authors: Mairi Sakellariadou and Jonathan Rocher
Abstract: Cosmic strings of the GUT scale, generically formed during the SSB of supersymmetric hybrid inflation, are compatible with the most recent CMB data. The strong constraints on the allowed cosmic strings contribution to the measured temperature anisotropies impose limits on the free parameters of the inflationary models, namely the mass scales and the couplings.
