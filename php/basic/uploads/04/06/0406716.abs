Title: Solitons and Quasielectrons in the Quantum Hall Matrix Model
Authors: T. H. Hansson and J. Kailasvuori and A. Karlhede and R. von Unge
Abstract: We show how to incorporate fractionally charged quasielectrons in the finite quantum Hall matrix model.The quasielectrons emerge as combinations of BPS solitons and quasiholes in a finite matrix version of the noncommutative $\phi^4$ theory coupled to a noncommutative Chern-Simons gauge field. We also discuss how to properly define the charge density in the classical matrix model, and calculate density profiles for droplets, quasiholes and quasielectrons.
