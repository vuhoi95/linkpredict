Title: Conformal Coupling of Higher Spin Gauge Fields to a Scalar Field in  $AdS_{4}$ and Generalized Weyl Invariance
Authors: R. Manvelyan and W. Ruehl
Abstract: The higher spin interaction currents for the conformally coupled scalar in $AdS_{4}$ space for both regular and irregular boundary condition corresponding to the free and interacting critical point of the boundary O(N) sigma model are constructed. The explicit form of the linearized interaction of the scalar and spin two and four gauge fields in the $AdS_{D}$ space using Noether's procedure for the corresponding spin two and four linearized gauge and generalized Weyl transformations are obtained.
