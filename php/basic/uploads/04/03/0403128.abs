Title: Spontaneous N=2 -> N=1 Supergravity Breaking in Three Dimensions
Authors: Olaf Hohm and Jan Louis
Abstract: We study models of spontaneous N=2 -> N=1 supergravity breaking in three space-time dimensions and discuss the topological Higgs- and super-Higgs mechanism which generates the masses for the spin-3/2 gravitino multiplet. The resulting N=1 spectrum and its effective action is analysed.
