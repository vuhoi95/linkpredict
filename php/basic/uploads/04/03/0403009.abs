Title: Cosmological Variation of the Fine Structure Constant versus a new  Interaction
Authors: E. J. Angstmann and V. V. Flambaum and S. G. Karshenboim
Abstract: We show why a dynamically varying fine structure constant does not impact on the Webb group's analysis as suggested by Bekenstein. We also provide a limit on the size of a possible correction to the Dirac Hamiltonian caused by a perturbation due to a dynamically varying alpha in hydrogen.
