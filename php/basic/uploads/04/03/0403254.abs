Title: Non-critical supergravity (d>1) and holography
Authors: Stanislav Kuperstein and Jacob Sonnenschein
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the supergravity equations of motion associated with non-critical ($d>1$) type II string theories that incorporate RR forms. Using a superpotential formalism we determine several classes of solutions. In particular we find analytic backgrounds with a structure of $AdS_{p+2}\times S^{d-p-2}$ and numerical solutions that asymptote a linear dilaton with a topology of $R^{1,d-3}\times R \times S^1$. The SUGRA solutions we have found can serve as anti holographic descriptions of gauge theories in a large $N$ limit which is different than the one of the critical gauge/gravity duality. It is characterized by $N\rt \infty$ and $g_{YM}^2 N \sim 1$. We have made the first steps in analyzing the corresponding gauge theory properties like Wilson loops and the glue-ball spectra.
