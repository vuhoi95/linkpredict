Title: Signals of confinement in Green functions of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Jochen Gattnar and Kurt Langfeld and Hugo Reinhardt
Abstract: The vortex picture of confinement is employed to explore the signals of confinement in Yang-Mills Green functions. By using SU(2) lattice gauge theory, it has been well established that the removal of the center vortices from the lattice configurations results in the loss of confinement. The running coupling constant, the gluon and the ghost form factors are studied in Landau gauge for both cases, the full and the vortex removed theory. In the latter case, a strong suppression of the running coupling constant and the gluon form factor at low momenta is observed. At the same time, the singularity of the ghost form factor at vanishing momentum disappears. This observation establishes an intimate correlation between the ghost singularity and confinement. The result also shows that a removal of the vortices generates a theory for which Zwanziger's horizon condition for confinement is no longer satisfied.
