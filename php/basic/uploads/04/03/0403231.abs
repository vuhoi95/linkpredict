Title: Spacetime dynamics and baryogenesis in braneworld
Authors: Tetsuya Shiromizu and Kazuya Koyama
Abstract: We point out that the effective theory for the Randall-Sundrum braneworld models with bulk fields contains the baryon number violation process depending on the spacetime dynamics. Combining to the curvature-current interaction, the net baryon number observed today may be explained. The resultant baryon to entropy ratio is determined by the ratio of the Planck scales in four dimensional and five dimensional spacetime except for the parameter for CP violation.
