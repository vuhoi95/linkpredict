Title: Correlation Functions and AdS/LCFT Correspondence
Authors: S. Moghimi-Araghi and S. Rouhani and M. Saadat
Abstract: Correlation functions of Logarithmic conformal field theory is investigated using the ADS/CFT correspondence and a novel method based on nilpotent weights and 'super fields'. Adding an specific form of interaction, we introduce a perturbative method to calculate the correlation functions.
