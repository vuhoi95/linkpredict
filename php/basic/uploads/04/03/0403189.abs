Title: Schwarzschild black branes from unstable D-branes
Authors: Oren Bergman and Gilad Lifschytz
Abstract: We study systems with a large number of meta-stable Dp-branes, and show that they describe Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild-like black branes, generalizing the results of Danielsson, Guijosa and Kruczenski. The systems are considered in both the open and closed string pictures. We identify the horizon size and its relation to the physics of open and closed strings. From the closed string perspective the region inside the horizon is where the effects of massive closed strings become important.
