Abstract: We study the temperature dependence of the monopole condensate in different Abelian projections of the SU(2) lattice gauge theory. Using the Frohlich-Marchetti monopole creation operator we show numerically that the monopole condensate depends on the choice of the Abelian projection. Contrary to the claims in the current literature we observe that in the Abelian Polyakov gauge and in the field strength gauge the monopole condensate does not vanish at the critical temperature and thus is not an order parameter.
