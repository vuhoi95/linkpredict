Title: Observational constraints on cosmology from modified Friedmann equation
Authors: Zong-Hong Zhu and Masa-Katsu Fujimoto and Xiang-Tao He
Abstract: Recent measurements of type Ia supernovae as well as other concordant observations suggest that the expansion of our universe is accelerating. A dark energy component has usually been invoked as the most feasible mechanism for the acceleration. However, the effects arising from possible extra dimensions can mimic well the role of a dark energy through a modified Friedmann equation. In this work, we investigate some observational constraints on a scenario in which this modification is given by $H^2 = {8\pi G \over 3} (\rho +C\rho^n)$. We mainly focus our attention on the constraints from recent measurements of the dimensionless coordinate distances to type Ia supernovae and Fanaroff-Riley type IIb radio galaxies compiled by Daly and Djorgovski (2003) and the X-ray gas mass fractions in clusters of galaxies published by Allen et al. (2002,2003). We obtain the confidence region on the power index $n$ of the modificative term and the density parameter $\Omega_m$ of the universe from a combined analysis of these databases. It is found that $n=0.06^{+0.22}_{-0.18}$ and $\Omega_m=0.30^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$, at the 95.4% confidence level, which is consistent within the errors with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. These parameter ranges give a universe whose expansion swithes from deceleration to acceleration at a redshift between 0.52 to 0.73.
