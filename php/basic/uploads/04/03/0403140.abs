Title: De Sitter Space With Finitely Many States: A Toy Story
Authors: Maulik K. Parikh and Erik Verlinde
Abstract: The finite entropy of de Sitter space suggests that in a theory of quantum gravity there are only finitely many states. It has been argued that in this case there is no action of the de Sitter group consistent with unitarity. In this note we propose a way out of this if we give up the requirement of having a hermitian Hamiltonian. We argue that some of the generators of the de Sitter group act in a novel way, namely by mixing in- and out-states. In this way it is possible to have a unitary S-matrix that is finite-dimensional and, moreover, de Sitter-invariant. Using Dirac spinors, we construct a simple toy model that exhibits these features.
