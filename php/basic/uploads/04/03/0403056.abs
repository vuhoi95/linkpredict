Title: Sectional Curvature Bounds in Gravity: Regularisation of the  Schwarzschild Singularity
Authors: Frederic P. Schuller and Mattias N. R. Wohlfarth
Abstract: A general geometrical scheme is presented for the construction of novel classical gravity theories whose solutions obey two-sided bounds on the sectional curvatures along certain subvarieties of the Grassmannian of two-planes. The motivation to study sectional curvature bounds comes from their equivalence to bounds on the acceleration between nearby geodesics. A universal minimal length scale is a necessary ingredient of the construction, and an application of the kinematical framework to static, spherically symmetric spacetimes shows drastic differences to the Schwarzschild solution of general relativity by the exclusion of spacelike singularities.
