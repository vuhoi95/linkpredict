Title: A New Infinite Class of Sasaki-Einstein Manifolds
Authors: Jerome P. Gauntlett and Dario Martelli and James F. Sparks and Daniel Waldram
Abstract: We show that for every positive curvature Kahler-Einstein manifold in dimension 2n there is a countably infinite class of associated Sasaki-Einstein manifolds X_{2n+3} in dimension 2n+3. When n=1 we recover a recently discovered family of supersymmetric AdS_5 x X_5 solutions of type IIB string theory, while when n=2 we obtain new supersymmetric AdS_4 x X_7 solutions of D=11 supergravity. Both are expected to provide new supergravity duals of superconformal field theories.
