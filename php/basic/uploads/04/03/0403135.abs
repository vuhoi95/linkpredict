Abstract: The infrared behavior of the gluon and ghost propagators is analyzed in Yang-Mills theories in the presence of dynamical mass generation in the Landau gauge. By restricting the domain of integration in the path-integral to the Gribov region $\Omega $, the gauge propagator is found to be suppressed in the infrared, while the ghost propagator is enhanced.
