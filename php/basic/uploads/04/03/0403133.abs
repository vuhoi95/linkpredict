Title: On Correspondences Between Toric Singularities and (p,q)-webs
Authors: Bo Feng and Yang-Hui He and Francis Lam
Abstract: We study four-dimensional N=1 gauge theories which arise from D3-brane probes of toric Calabi-Yau threefolds. There are some standing paradoxes in the literature regarding relations among (p,q)-webs, toric diagrams and various phases of the gauge theories, we resolve them by proposing and carefully distinguishing between two kinds of (p,q)-webs: toric and quiver (p,q)-webs. The former has a one to one correspondence with the toric diagram while the latter can correspond to multiple gauge theories. The key reason for this ambiguity is that a given quiver (p,q)-web can not capture non-chiral matter fields in the gauge theory. To support our claim we analyse families of theories emerging from partial resolution of Abelian orbifolds using the Inverse Algorithm of hep-th/0003085 as well as (p,q)-web techniques. We present complex inter-relations among these theories by Higgsing, blowups and brane splittings. We also point out subtleties involved in the ordering of legs in the (p,q) diagram.
