Title: A new duality relating density perturbations in expanding and  contracting Friedmann cosmologies
Authors: Latham A. Boyle and Paul J. Steinhardt and Neil Turok
Abstract: For a 4-dimensional spatially-flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe with a scalar field $\phi(x)$, potential $V(\phi)$ and constant equation of state $w=p/\rho$, we show that an expanding solution characterized by $\epsilon=3(1+w)/2$ produces the same scalar perturbations as a contracting solution with $\hat{\epsilon}=1/\epsilon$. The same symmetry applies to both the dominant and subdominant scalar perturbation modes. This result admits a simple physical interpretation and generalizes to $d$ spacetime dimensions if we define $\epsilon \equiv [(2d-5)+(d-1)w]/(d-2)$.
