Title: The covariant entropy bound in gravitational collapse
Authors: Sijie Gao and Jose' P. S. Lemos
Abstract: We study the covariant entropy bound in the context of gravitational collapse. First, we discuss critically the heuristic arguments advanced by Bousso. Then we solve the problem through an exact model: a Tolman-Bondi dust shell collapsing into a Schwarzschild black hole. After the collapse, a new black hole with a larger mass is formed. The horizon, $L$, of the old black hole then terminates at the singularity. We show that the entropy crossing $L$ does not exceed a quarter of the area of the old horizon. Therefore, the covariant entropy bound is satisfied in this process.
