Title: Two basic problems posed by quantum scattering of fundamental particles
Authors: Marijan Ribaric and Luka Sustersic
Abstract: We put forward a finite theory of quantum scattering of fundamental particles without using auxiliary particles. It suggests that to avoid ultraviolet divergencies and model faster-than-light effects it suffices to appropriately change only the free-field Lagrangians while retaining their locality in space-time and Lorentz invariance. Using functions of two independent four-vector variables, we base this finite theory on the path-integral formalism on the four-dimensional space-time and the Lehmann-Symanzik-Zimmermann reduction formula.
