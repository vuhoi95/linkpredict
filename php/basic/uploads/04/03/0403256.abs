Title: Topological B-Model, Matrix Models, $\hat{c}=1$ Strings and Quiver Gauge  Theories
Authors: Harald Ita and Harald Nieder and Yaron Oz and Tadakatsu Sakai
Abstract: We study topological and integrable aspects of $\hat{c}=1$ strings. We consider the circle line theories 0A and 0B at particular radii, and the super affine theories at their self-dual radii. We construct their ground rings, identify them with certain quotients of the conifold, and suggest topological B-model descriptions. We consider the partition functions, correlators and Ward identities, and construct a Kontsevich-like matrix model. We then study all these aspects via the topological B-model description. Finally, we analyse the corresponding Dijkgraaf-Vafa type matrix models and quiver gauge theories.
