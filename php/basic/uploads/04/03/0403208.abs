Title: Enscription of Quantum Texts
Authors: Randall Espinoza and Tom Imbo and Paul Lopata
Abstract: We investigate an entangled deformation of the deterministic quantum cloning process, called enscription, that can be applied to (certain) sets of distinct quantum states which are not necessarily orthogonal, called texts. Some basic theorems on enscribable texts are given, and a relationship to probabilistic quantum cloning is demonstrated.
