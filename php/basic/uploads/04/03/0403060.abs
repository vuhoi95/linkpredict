Abstract: We present a Mathematica package for performing algebraic and numerical computations in cosmological models based on supersymmetric theories. The programs allow for (I) evaluation and study of the properties of a scalar potential in a large class of supergravity models with any number of moduli and arbitrary superpotential, Kahler potential, and D-term; (II) numerical solution of a system of scalar and Friedmann equations for the flat FRW universe, with any number of scalar moduli and arbitrary moduli space metric. We are using here a simple set of first order differential equations which we derived in a Hamiltonian framework. Using our programs we present some new results: (I) a shift-symmetric potential of the inflationary model with a mobile D3 brane in an internal space with stabilized volume; (II) a KKLT-based dark energy model with the acceleration of the universe due to the evolution of the axion partner of the volume modulus.
