Authors: V. Gorini and A. Kamenshchik and U. Moschella and V. Pasquier
Abstract: We review the essential features of the Chaplygin gas cosmological models and provide some examples of appearance of the Chaplygin gas equation of state in modern physics. A possible theoretical basis for the Chaplygin gas in cosmology is discussed. The relation with scalar field and tachyon cosmological models is also considered.
