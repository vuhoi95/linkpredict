Title: Dumping inflaton energy density out of this world
Authors: Kari Enqvist and Anupam Mazumdar and A. PÃ©rez-Lorenzana
Abstract: We argue that a brane world with a warped, infinite extra dimension allows for the inflaton to decay into the bulk so that after inflation, the effective dark energy disappears from our brane. This is achieved by the redshifting of the decay products into infinity of the 5th dimension. As a consequence, all matter and CMB density perturbations could have their origin in the decay of a MSSM flat direction rather than the inflaton. We also discuss a string theoretical model where reheating after inflation may not affect the observable brane.
