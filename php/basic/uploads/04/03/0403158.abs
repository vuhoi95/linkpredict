Title: Vortex Strings and Four-Dimensional Gauge Dynamics
Authors: Amihay Hanany and David Tong
Abstract: We study the low-energy quantum dynamics of vortex strings in the Higgs phase of N=2 supersymmetric QCD. The exact BPS spectrum of the stretched string is shown to coincide with the BPS spectrum of the four-dimensional parent gauge theory. Perturbative string excitations correspond to bound W-bosons and quarks while the monopoles appear as kinks on the vortex string. This provides a physical explanation for an observation by N. Dorey relating the quantum spectra of theories in two and four dimensions.
