Title: Chiral Supersymmetric Standard Model Spectra from Orientifolds of Gepner  Models
Authors: T. P. T. Dijkstra and L. R. Huiszoon and A. N. Schellekens
Abstract: We construct d=4,N=1 orientifolds of Gepner models with just the chiral spectrum of the standard model. We consider all simple current modular invariants of c=9 tensor products of N=2 minimal models. For some very specific tensor combinations, and very specific modular invariants and orientifold projections, we find a large number of such spectra. We allow for standard model singlet (dark) matter and non-chiral exotics. The Chan-Paton gauge group is either U(3) x Sp(2) x U(1) x U(1) or U(3) x U(2) x U(1) x U(1). In many cases the standard model hypercharge U(1) has no coupling to RR 2-forms and hence remains massless; in some of those models the B-L gauge boson does acquire a mass.
