Title: Phase Space Analysis of Quintessence Cosmologies with a Double  Exponential Potential
Authors: Laur Jarv and Thomas Mohaupt and Frank Saueressig
Abstract: We use phase space methods to investigate closed, flat, and open Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmologies with a scalar potential given by the sum of two exponential terms. The form of the potential is motivated by the dimensional reduction of M-theory with non-trivial four-form flux on a maximally symmetric internal space. To describe the asymptotic features of run-away solutions we introduce the concept of a `quasi fixed point.' We give the complete classification of solutions according to their late-time behavior (accelerating, decelerating, crunch) and the number of periods of accelerated expansion.
