Authors: Melanie Becker and Keshav Dasgupta and Anke Knauf and Radu Tatar
Abstract: We construct a duality cycle which provides a complete supergravity description of geometric transitions in type II theories via a flop in M-theory. This cycle connects the different supergravity descriptions before and after the geometric transitions. Our construction reproduces many of the known phenomena studied earlier in the literature and allows us to describe some new and interesting aspects in a simple and elegant fashion. A precise supergravity description of new torsional manifolds that appear on the type IIA side with branes and fluxes and the corresponding geometric transition are obtained. A local description of new G_2 manifolds that are circle fibrations over non-Kahler manifolds is presented.
