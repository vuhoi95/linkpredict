Title: Cyclic Identities Involving Ratios of Jacobi Theta Functions
Authors: Avinash Khare and Arul Lakshminarayan and Uday Sukhatme
Abstract: Identities involving cyclic sums of terms composed from Jacobi elliptic functions evaluated at $p$ equally shifted points were recently found. The purpose of this paper is to re-express these cyclic identities in terms of ratios of Jacobi theta functions, since many physicists prefer using Jacobi theta functions rather than Jacobi elliptic functions.
