Title: An Integrable Model with non-reducible three particle R-Matrix
Authors: J. Ambjorn and Sh. Khachatryan and A. Sedrakyan
Abstract: We define an integrable lattice model which, in the notation of Yang, in addition to the conventional 2-particle $R$-matrices also contains non-reducible 3-particle $R$-matrices. The corresponding modified Yang-Baxter equations are solved and an expression for the transfer matrix is found as a normal ordered exponential of a (non-local) Hamiltonian.
