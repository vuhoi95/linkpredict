Title: The Noncommutative U(N) Kalb-Ramond Theory
Authors: R. Amorim and C. N. Ferreira and C. F. L. Godinho
Abstract: We present the noncommutative extention of the U(N) Cremmer-Scherk-Kalb-Ramond theory, displaying its differential form and gauge structures. The Seiberg-Witten map of the model is also constructed up to $0(\theta^2)$.
