Abstract: In this paper, we construct a closed form of projectors on the integral noncommutative orbifold $T^2/Z_6$ in terms of elliptic functions by $GHS$ construction. After that, we give a general solution of projectors on $% T^{2}/Z_{6}$ and $T^{2}/Z_{3}$ with minimal trace and continuous reduced matrix $M(k,q_{0})$.The projectors constructed by us possess symmetry and manifest covariant forms under $Z_{6}$ rotation. Since projectors correspond to the soliton solutions of field theory on the noncommutative orbifold, we thus present a series of corresponding manifest covariant soliton solutions.
