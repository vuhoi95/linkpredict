Abstract: We study interaction of rotating higher dimensional black holes with a brane in space-times with large extra dimensions. We demonstrate that in a general case a rotating black hole attached to a brane can loose bulk components of its angular momenta. A stationary black hole can have only those components of the angular momenta which are connected with Killing vectors generating transformations preserving a position of the brane. In a final stationary state the null Killing vector generating the black hole horizon is tangent to the brane. We discuss first the interaction of a cosmic string and a domain wall with the 4D Kerr black hole. We then prove the general result for slowly rotating higher dimensional black holes interacting with branes. The characteristic time when a rotating black hole with the gravitational radius $r_0$ reaches this final stationary state is $T\sim r_0^{p-1}/(G\sigma)$, where $G$ is the higher dimensional gravitational coupling constant, $\sigma$ is the brane tension, and $p$ is the number of extra dimensions.
