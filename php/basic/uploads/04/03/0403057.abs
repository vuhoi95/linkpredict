Title: Spacetime Foam, Holographic Principle, and Black Hole Quantum Computers
Authors: Y. Jack Ng and H. van Dam
Abstract: Spacetime foam, also known as quantum foam, has its origin in quantum fluctuations of spacetime. Arguably it is the source of the holographic principle, which severely limits how densely information can be packed in space. Its physics is also intimately linked to that of black holes and computation. In particular, the same underlying physics is shown to govern the computational power of black hole quantum computers.
