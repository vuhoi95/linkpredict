Title: On the properties of the transition matrix in bouncing cosmologies
Authors: Jerome Martin and Patrick Peter
Abstract: We elaborate further on the evolution properties of cosmological fluctuations through a bounce. We show this evolution to be describable either by ``transmission'' and ``reflection'' coefficients or by an effective unitary S-matrix. We also show that they behave in a time reversal invariant way. Therefore, earlier results are now interpreted in a different perspective and put on a firmer basis.
