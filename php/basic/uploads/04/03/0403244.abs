Title: Extended Electrodynamics: A Brief Review
Authors: Stoil Donev and Maria Tashkova
Abstract: This paper presents a brief review of the newly developed \emph{Extended Electrodynamics}. The relativistic and non-relativistic approaches to the extension of Maxwell equations are considered briefly, and the further study is carried out in relativistic terms in Minkowski space-time. The non-linear vacuum solutions are considered and fully described. It is specially pointed out that solitary waves with various, in fact arbitrary, spatial structure and photon-like propagation properties exist. The {\it null} character of all non-linear vacuum solutions is established and extensively used further. Coordinate-free definitions are given to the important quantities {\it amplitude} and {\it phase}. The new quantity, named {\it scale factor}, is introduced and used as a criterion for availability of rotational component of propagation of some of the nonlinear, i.e. nonmaxwellian, vacuum solutions. The group structure properties of the nonlinear vacuum solutions are analyzed in some detail, showing explicitly the connection of the vacuum solutions with some complex valued functions. Connection-curvature interpretations are given and a special attention is paid to the curvature interpretation of the intrinsic rotational (spin) properties of some of the nonlinear solutions. Several approaches to coordinate-free local description and computation of the integral spin momentum are considered. Finally, a large family of nonvacuum spatial soliton-like solutions is explicitly written down, and a procedure to get (3+1) versions of the known (1+1) soliton solutions is obtained.
