Title: Cosmological Scaling Solutions of Multiple Tachyon Fields with Inverse  Square Potentials
Authors: Zong-Kuan Guo and Yuan-Zhong Zhang
Abstract: We investigate cosmological dynamics of multiple tachyon fields with inverse square potentials. A phase-space analysis of the spatially flat FRW models shows that there exists power-law cosmological scaling solutions. We study the stability of the solutions and find that the potential-kinetic-scaling solution is a global attractor. However, in the presence of a barotropic fluid the solution is an attractor only in one region of the parameter space and the tracking solution is an attractor in the other region. We briefly discuss the physical consequences of these results.
