Title: Edge States for quantum Hall droplets in higher dimensions and a  generalized WZW model
Authors: Dimitra Karabali and V. P. Nair
Abstract: We consider quantum Hall droplets on complex projective spaces with a combination of abelian and nonabelian background magnetic fields. Carrying out an analysis similar to what was done for abelian backgrounds, we show that the effective action for the edge excitations is given by a chiral, gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) theory generalized to higher dimensions.
