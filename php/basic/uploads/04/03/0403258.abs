Title: Mixed inflaton and curvaton perturbations
Authors: David Langlois and Filippo Vernizzi
Abstract: A recent variant of the inflationary paradigm is that the ``primordial'' curvature perturbations come from quantum fluctuations of a scalar field, subdominant and effectively massless during inflation, called the ``curvaton'', instead of the fluctuations of the inflaton field. We consider the situation where the primordial curvature perturbations generated by the quantum fluctuations of an inflaton and of a curvaton field are of the same order of magnitude. We compute the curvature perturbation and its spectrum in this case and we discuss the observational consequences.
