Title: Worldline Variational Approximation: A New Approach to the Relativistic  Binding Problem
Authors: K. Barro-Bergfl√∂dt and R. Rosenfelder and M. Stingl
Abstract: We determine the lowest bound-state pole of the density-density correlator in the scalar Wick-Cutkosky model where two equal-mass constituents interact via the exchange of mesons. This is done by employing the worldline representation of field theory together with a variational approximation as in Feynman's treatment of the polaron. Unlike traditional methods based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation, self-energy and vertex corrections are (approximately) included as are crossed diagrams. Only vacuum-polarization effects of the heavy particles are neglected. The well-known instability of the model due to self-energy effects leads to large qualitative and quantitative changes compared to traditional approaches which neglect them. We determine numerically the critical coupling constant above which no real solutions of the variational equations exist anymore and show that it is smaller than in the one-body case due to an induced instability. The width of the bound state above the critical coupling is estimated analytically.
