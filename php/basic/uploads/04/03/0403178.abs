Title: Renormalization group limit-cycles and field theories for elliptic  S-matrices
Authors: Andre LeClair and German Sierra
Abstract: The renormalization group for maximally anisotropic su(2) current interactions in 2d is shown to be cyclic at one loop. The fermionized version of the model exhibits spin-charge separation of the 4-fermion interactions and has Z_4 symmetry. It is proposed that the S-matrices for these theories are the elliptic S-matrices of Zamolodchikov and Mussardo-Penati. The S-matrix parameters are related to lagrangian parameters by matching the period of the renormalization group. All models exhibit two characteristic signatures of an RG limit cycle: periodicity of the S-matrix as a function of energy and the existence of an infinite number of resonance poles satisfying Russian doll scaling.
