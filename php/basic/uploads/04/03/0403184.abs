Title: Linking number from a topologically massive p-form theory
Authors: Marcio A. M. Gomes and R. R. Landim
Abstract: We show that the linking number of two homologically trivial disjoint $p$ and $(D-p-1)$-dimensional submanifolds of a $D$-dimensional manifold can be derived from the topologically massive $BC$ theory in low energy regime.
