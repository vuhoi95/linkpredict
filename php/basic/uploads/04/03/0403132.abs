Title: Asymptotic Quasinormal Frequencies for Black Holes in Non-Asymptotically  Flat Spacetimes
Authors: Vitor Cardoso and Jose Natario and Ricardo Schiappa
Abstract: The exact computation of asymptotic quasinormal frequencies is a technical problem which involves the analytic continuation of a Schrodinger-like equation to the complex plane and then performing a method of monodromy matching at the several poles in the plane. While this method was successfully used in asymptotically flat spacetime, as applied to both the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrom solutions, its extension to non-asymptotically flat spacetimes has not been achieved yet. In this work it is shown how to extend the method to this case, with the explicit analysis of Schwarzschild de Sitter and large Schwarzschild Anti-de Sitter black holes, both in four dimensions. We obtain, for the first time, analytic expressions for the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies of these black hole spacetimes, and our results match previous numerical calculations with great accuracy. We also list some results concerning the general classification of asymptotic quasinormal frequencies in d-dimensional spacetimes.
