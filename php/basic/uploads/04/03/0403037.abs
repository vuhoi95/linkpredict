Title: Geometric phase shift for detection of gravitational radiation
Authors: N V Mitskievich and A I Nesterov
Abstract: An effect of geometrical phase shift is predicted for a light beam propagating in the field of a gravitational wave. Gravitational radiation detection experiments are proposed using this new effect, the corresponding estimates being given.
