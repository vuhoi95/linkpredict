Title: Chiral Symmetry in Light-Cone Field Theory
Authors: F. Lenz and K. Ohta and M. Thies and K. Yazaki
Abstract: An analysis of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in light-cone field theory is presented. The non-locality inherent to light-cone field theory requires revision of the standard procedure in the derivation of Ward-Takahashi identities. We derive the general structure of chiral Ward-Takahashi identities and construct them explicitly for various model field theories. Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relations and relations between fermion propagators and the structure functions of Nambu-Goldstone bosons are discussed and the necessary modifications of the Ward-Takahashi identities due to the axial anomaly are indicated.
