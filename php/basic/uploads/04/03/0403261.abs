Title: Semiclassical spinning strings and confining gauge theories
Authors: F. Bigazzi and A. L. Cotrone and L. Martucci
Abstract: We study multi-charged rotating string states on Type IIB regular backgrounds dual to confining SU(N) gauge theories with (softly broken) {\cal N}=1 supersymmetry, in the infra red regime. After exhibiting the classical energy/charge relations for the folded and circular two-charge strings, we compute in the latter case the one loop sigma-model quantum correction. The classical relation has an expansion in positive powers of the analogous of the BMN effective coupling, while the quantum corrections are non perturbative in nature and are not subleading in the limit of infinite charge. We comment about the dual field theory multi-charged hadrons and the implications of our computation for the AdS/{\cal N}=4 duality.
