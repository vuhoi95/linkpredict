Abstract: We investigate a system described by two real scalar fields coupled with gravity in (4, 1) dimensions in warped spacetime involving one extra dimension. The results show that the parameter which controls the way the two scalar fields interact induces the appearence of thick brane which engenders internal structure, driving the energy density to localize inside the brane in a very specific way.
