Title: Commuting quantum traces for quadratic algebras
Authors: Zoltan Nagy and Jean Avan and Anastasia Doikou and Genevieve Rollet
Abstract: Consistent tensor products on auxiliary spaces, hereafter denoted "fusion procedures", are defined for general quadratic algebras, non-dynamical and dynamical, inspired by results on reflection algebras. Applications of these procedures then yield integer-indexed families of commuting Hamiltonians.
