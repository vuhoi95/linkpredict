Title: Jost-Lehmann-Dyson Representation, Analyticity in Angle Variable and  Upper Bounds in Noncommutative Quantum Field Theory
Authors: M. N. Mnatsakanova and Yu. S. Vernov
Abstract: The existence of Jost-Lehmann-Dyson representation analogue has been proved in framework of space-space noncommutative quantum field theory. On the basis of this representation it has been found that some class of elastic amplitudes admits an analytical continuation into complex \cos\vartheta plane and corresponding domain of analyticity is Martin ellipse. This analyticity combined with unitarity leads to Froissart-Martin upper bound on total cross section.
