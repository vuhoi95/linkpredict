Title: A Note on Partition Functions of Gepner Model Orientifolds
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Timo Weigand
Abstract: In this note we generalize the description of simple current extended Gepner Model orientifolds as presented in hep-th/0401148 to the case of even levels and non-trivial dressings of the parity transformation. We provide a comprehensive list of all the important ingredients for the construction of such orientifolds. Namely we present explicit expressions for the Klein-bottle, annulus and Moebius strip amplitudes and derive the general tadpole cancellation conditions. As an example we construct a supersymmetric Pati-Salam like model.
