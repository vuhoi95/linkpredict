Title: Dirac quasinormal frequencies in Schwarzschild-AdS space-time
Authors: M. Giammatteo and Jiliang Jing
Abstract: We investigate the quasinormal mode frequencies for the massless Dirac field in static four dimensional $AdS$ space-time. The separation of the Dirac equation is achieved for the first time in $AdS$ space. Besides the relevance that this calculation can have in the framework of the $AdS/CFT$ correspondence between M-theory on $AdS_4\times S^7$ and SU(N) super Yang-Mills theory on $M_3$, it also serves to fill in a gap in the literature, which has only been concerned with particles of integral spin $0,1,2$.
