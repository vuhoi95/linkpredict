Title: Resolving the M2-brane
Authors: Chiang-Mei Chen and J. F. Vazquez-Poritz
Abstract: We construct deformed, T^2 wrapped, rotating M2-branes on a resolved cone over Q^{1,1,1} and Q^{1,1,1}/Z_2, as well as on a product of two Eguchi-Hanson instantons. All worldvolume directions of these supersymmetric and regular solutions are fibred over the transverse space. These constitute gravity duals of D=3, N=2 gauge theories. In particular, the deformed M2-brane on a resolved cone over Q^{1,1,1} and the S^1 wrapped M2-brane on a resolved cone over Q^{1,1,1}/Z_2 provide explicit realizations of holographic renormalization group flows in M-theory for which both conformal and Lorentz symmetries are broken in the IR region and restored in the UV limit. These solutions can be dualized to supersymmetric type IIB pp-waves, which are rendered non-singular either by additional flux or a twisted time-like direction.
