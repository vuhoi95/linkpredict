Title: Quantum Horizons
Authors: Hua Bai and Mu-Lin Yan
Abstract: Treating macro-black hole as quantum states, and using Brown-York quaselocal gravitational energy definition and Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we find out the classical horizon with singularity spreads into a quantum horizon in which the space-time is non-commutative and the spread range is determined dynamically. A Quantum Field Theory (QFT) model in curved space with quantum horizon is constructed. By using it, the black hole entropy and the Hawking temperature are calculated successfully. The $\phi-$field mode number is predicted and our quantum horizon model favors to support the Minimal Super-symmetric Standard Model.
