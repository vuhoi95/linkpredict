Title: Transmogrifying Fuzzy Vortices
Authors: Jeff Murugan and Antony Millner
Abstract: We show that the construction of vortex solitons of the noncommutative Abelian-Higgs model can be extended to a critically coupled gauged linear sigma model with Fayet-Illiopolous D-terms. Like its commutative counterpart, this fuzzy linear sigma model has a rich spectrum of BPS solutions. We offer an explicit construction of the degree$-k$ static semilocal vortex and study in some detail the infinite coupling limit in which it descends to a degree$-k$ $\C\Pk^{N}$ instanton. This relation between the fuzzy vortex and noncommutative lump is used to suggest an interpretation of the noncommutative sigma model soliton as tilted D-strings stretched between an NS5-brane and a stack of D3-branes in type IIB superstring theory.
