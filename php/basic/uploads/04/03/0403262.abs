Abstract: We consider configurations of stacks of orientifold planes and D-branes wrapped on a non trivial internal space of the structure {(Gepner model)^{c=3n} x T^{2(3-n)}}/Z_N, for n=1,2,3. By performing simple moddings by discrete symmetries of Gepner models at orienti fold points, consistent with a Z_N orbifold action, we show that projection on D-brane configurations can be achieved, generically leading to chiral gauge theories. Either supersymmetric or non-supersymmetric (tachyon free) models can be obtained. We illustrate the procedure through some explicit examples.
