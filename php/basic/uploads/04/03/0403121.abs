Title: A note on spin chain/string duality
Authors: H. Dimov and R. C. Rashkov
Abstract: Recently a significant progress in matching the anomalous dimensions of certain class of operators in N=4 SYM theory and rotating strings was made. The correspondence was established mainly using Bethe ansatz technique applied to the spin s Heisenberg model. In a recent paper Kruczenski (hep-th/0311203) suggested to solve the Heisenberg model by using of sigme model approach. In this paper we generalize the solutions obtained by Kruczenski and comment on the dual string theory. It turns out that our solutions are related to the so called Neumann-Rosochatius integrable system. We comment on the spin chain solutions and on the string/gauge theory correspondence.
