Title: The SU(3) spin chain sigma model and string theory
Authors: Rafael Hernandez and Esperanza Lopez
Abstract: The ferromagnetic integrable SU(3) spin chain provides the one loop anomalous dimension of single trace operators involving the three complex scalars of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills. We construct the non-linear sigma model describing the continuum limit of the SU(3) spin chain. We find that this sigma model corresponds to a string moving with large angular momentum in the five-sphere in AdS_5xS^5. The energy and spectrum of fluctuations for rotating circular strings with angular momenta along three orthogonal directions of the five-sphere is reproduced as a particular case from the spin chain sigma model.
