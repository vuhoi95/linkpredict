Title: A Singular Conformal Spacetime
Authors: R. Aldrovandi and J. P. Beltran Almeida and J. G. Pereira
Abstract: The infinite cosmological "constant" limit of the de Sitter solutions to Einstein's equation is studied. The corresponding spacetime is a singular, four-dimensional cone-space, transitive under proper conformal transformations, which constitutes a new example of maximally-symmetric spacetime. Grounded on its geometric and thermodynamic properties, some speculations are made in connection with the primordial universe.
