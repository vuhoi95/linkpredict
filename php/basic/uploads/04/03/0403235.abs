Title: M-theory compactification, fluxes and AdS_4
Authors: Andre Lukas and P. M. Saffin
Abstract: We analyze supersymmetric solutions of M-theory based an a seven-dimensional internal space with SU(3) structure and a four-dimensional maximally symmetric space. The most general supersymmetry conditions are derived and we show that a non-vanishing cosmological constant requires the norms of the two internal spinors to differ. We find explicit local solutions with singlet flux and the space being a warped product of a circle, a nearly-Kahler manifold and AdS_4. The embedding of solutions into heterotic M-theory is also discussed.
