Title: Chaotic Inflation on the Brane with Induced Gravity
Authors: E. Papantonopoulos and V. Zamarias
Abstract: We study the slow-roll inflationary dynamics in a self-gravitating induced gravity braneworld model with bulk cosmological constant. For E \gg M_{5}^{3}/M^{2}_{2} we find important corrections to the four-dimensional Friedmann equation which bring the standard chaotic inflationary scenario in closer agreement with recent observations. For \lambda/M^{3}_{5} \ll E \ll M^{3}_{5}/M^{2}_{4} we find five-dimensional corrections to the Friedmann equation, which give the known Randall-Sundrum results of the inflationary parameters.
