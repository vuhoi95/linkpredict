Title: From Super-Yang-Mills Theory to QCD: Planar Equivalence and its  Implications
Authors: A. Armoni and M. Shifman and G. Veneziano
Abstract: We review and extend our recent work on the planar (large N) equivalence between gauge theories with varying degree of supersymmetry. The main emphasis is made on the planar equivalence between N=1 gluodynamics (super-Yang-Mills theory) and a non-supersymmetric "orientifold field theory." We outline an "orientifold" large N expansion, analyze its possible phenomenological consequences in one-flavor massless QCD, and make a first attempt at extending the correspondence to three massless flavors. An analytic calculation of the quark condensate in one-flavor QCD starting from the gluino condensate in N=1 gluodynamics is thoroughly discussed. We also comment on a planar equivalence involving N=2 supersymmetry, on "chiral rings" in non-supersymmetric theories, and on the origin of planar equivalence from an underlying, non-tachyonic type-0 string theory. Finally, possible further directions of investigation, such as the gauge/gravity correspondence in large-N orientifold field theory, are briefly discussed.
