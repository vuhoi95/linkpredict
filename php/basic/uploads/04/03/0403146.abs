Title: On infinite-dimensional representations of the rotation group and Dirac  monopole
Authors: Alexander I. Nesterov and F. Aceves de la Cruz
Abstract: The Dirac monopole problem is studied in details within the framework of infinite-dimensional representations of the rotation group, and a consistent pointlike monopole theory with an arbitrary magnetic charge is deduced.
