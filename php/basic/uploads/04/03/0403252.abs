Title: The Universality of Penrose Limits near Space-Time Singularities
Authors: Matthias Blau and Monica Borunda and Martin O'Loughlin and George Papadopoulos
Abstract: We prove that Penrose limits of metrics with arbitrary singularities of power-law type show a universal leading u^{-2}-behaviour near the singularity provided that the dominant energy condition is satisfied and not saturated. For generic power-law singularities of this type the oscillator frequencies of the resulting homogeneous singular plane wave turn out to lie in a range which is known to allow for an analytic extension of string modes through the singularity. The discussion is phrased in terms of the recently obtained covariant characterisation of the Penrose limit; the relation with null geodesic deviation is explained in detail.
