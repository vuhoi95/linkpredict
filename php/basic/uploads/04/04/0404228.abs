Title: Inflation in Gauged 6D Supergravity
Authors: Robert H. Brandenberger and S. Randjbar-Daemi
Abstract: In this note we demonstrate that chaotic inflation can naturally be realized in the context of an anomaly free minimal gauged supergravity in D=6 which has recently been the focus of some attention. This particular model has a unique maximally symmetric ground state solution, $R^{3,1} \times S^2$ which leaves half of the six-dimensional supersymmetries unbroken. In this model, the inflaton field $\phi$ originates from the complex scalar fields in the D=6 scalar hypermultiplet. The mass and the self couplings of the scalar field are dictated by the D=6 Lagrangian. The scalar potential has an absolute munimum at $\phi = 0$ with no undetermined moduli fields. Imposing a mild bound on the radius of $S^2$ enables us to obtain chaotic inflation. The low eenrgy equations of motion are shown to be consistent for the range of scalar field values relevant for inflation.
