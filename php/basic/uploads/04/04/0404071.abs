Title: New Reducible Membrane Solutions in D=11 Supergravity
Authors: R. Clarkson and A. M. Ghezelbash and R. B. Mann
Abstract: We construct generalized 11D supergravity solutions of fully localized D2/D6 brane intersections. These solutions are obtained by embedding Taub-NUT and/or self-dual geometries lifted to M-theory. We reduce these solutions to ten dimensions, obtaining new D-brane systems in type IIA supergravity. We discuss the limits in which the dynamics of the D2 brane decouples from the bulk for these solutions.
