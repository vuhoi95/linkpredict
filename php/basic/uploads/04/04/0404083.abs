Title: Localizing gravity on exotic thick 3-branes
Authors: Oscar Castillo-Felisola and Alejandra Melfo and Nelson Pantoja and Alba Ramirez
Abstract: We consider localization of gravity on thick branes with a non trivial structure. Double walls that generalize the thick Randall-Sundrum solution, and asymmetric walls that arise from a Z_2-symmetric scalar potential, are considered. We present a new asymmetric solution: a thick brane interpolating between two AdS_5 spacetimes with different cosmological constants, which can be derived from a ``fake supergravity'' superpotential, and show that it is possible to confine gravity on such branes.
