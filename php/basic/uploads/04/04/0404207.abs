Title: Quasi-Thick Codimension 2 Braneworld
Authors: Sugumi Kanno and Jiro Soda
Abstract: We study a codimension 2 braneworld in the Einstein Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We carefully examine the structure of possible singularities in the system which characterize the braneworld through matching conditions. Consequently, we find that the thickness of the brane can be incorporated as the distributional source, which we dub quasi-thickness. On the basis of our formalism, we analyze the linearized gravity and show the conventional Einstein gravity can be recovered on the brane. In the nonlinear regime, however, we find corrections due to the thickness and the bulk geometry. We also point out a possibility that the thickness plays a role of the dark matter/energy in the universe.
