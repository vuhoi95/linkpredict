Title: Anyon wave equations and the noncommutative plane
Authors: Peter A. Horvathy and Mikhail S. Plyushchay
Abstract: The ``Jackiw-Nair'' non-relativistic limit of the relativistic anyon equations provides us with infinite-component wave equations of the Dirac-Majorana-Levy-Leblond type for the ``exotic'' particle, associated with the two-fold central extension of the planar Galilei group. An infinite dimensional representation of the Galilei group is found. The velocity operator is studied, and the observable coordinates describing a noncommutative plane are identified.
