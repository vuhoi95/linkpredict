Title: Approximately self-similar critical collapse in 2+1 dimensions
Authors: Marco Cavaglia and Gerard Clement and Alessandro Fabbri
Abstract: Critical collapse of a self-gravitating scalar field in a (2+1)-dimensional spacetime with negative cosmological constant seems to be dominated by a continuously self-similar solution of the field equations without cosmological constant. However, previous studies of linear perturbations in this background were inconclusive. We extend the continuously self-similar solutions to solutions of the field equations with negative cosmological constant, and analyse their linear perturbations. The extended solutions are characterized by a continuous parameter. A suitable choice of this parameter seems to improve the agreement with the numerical results. We also study the dynamics of the apparent horizon in the extended background.
