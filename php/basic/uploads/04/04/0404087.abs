Title: Loop Corrections to Volume Moduli and Inflation in String Theory
Authors: Marcus Berg and Michael Haack and Boris Kors
Abstract: The recent progress in embedding inflation in string theory has made it clear that the problem of moduli stabilization cannot be ignored in this context. In many models a special role is played by the volume modulus, which is modified in the presence of mobile branes. The challenge is to stabilize this modified volume while keeping the inflaton mass small compared to the Hubble parameter. It is then crucial to know not only how the volume modulus is modified, but also to have control over the dependence of the potential on the inflaton field. We address these questions within a simple setting: toroidal N=1 type IIB orientifolds. We calculate corrections to the superpotential and show how the holomorphic dependence on the properly modified volume modulus arises. The potential then explicitly involves the inflaton, leaving room for lowering the inflaton mass through moderate fine-tuning of flux quantum numbers.
