Title: Solitons on nanotubes and fullerenes as solutions of a modified  non-linear Schroedinger equation
Authors: Yves Brihaye and Betti Hartmann
Abstract: Fullerenes and nanotubes consist of a large number of carbon atoms sitting on the sites of a regular lattice. For pratical reasons it is often useful to approximate the equations on this lattice in terms of the continuous equation. At the moment, the best candidate for such an equation is the modified non-linear Schroedinger equation. In this paper, we study the modified non-linear Schroedinger equation, which arises as continuous equation in a system describing an excitation on a hexagonal lattice. This latter system can e.g. describe electron-phonon interaction on fullerene related structures such as the buckminster fullerene and nanotubes. Solutions of this modified non-linear Schroedinger equation, which have solitonic character, can be constructed using an Ansatz for the wave function, which has time and azimuthal angle dependence introduced previously in the study of spinning boson stars and Q-balls. We study these solutions on a sphere, a disc and on a cylinder. Our construction suggests that non-spinning as well as spinning solutions, which have a wave function with an arbitrary number of nodes, exist. We find that this property is closely related to the series of well-known mathematical functions, namely the Legendre functions when studying the equation on a sphere, the Bessel functions when studying the equation on a disc and the trigonometric functions, respectively, when studying the equation on a cylinder.
