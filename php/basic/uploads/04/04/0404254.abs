Title: Type IIA Orientifolds on General Supersymmetric Z_N Orbifolds
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Joseph P. Conlon and Kerim Suruliz
Abstract: We construct Type IIA orientifolds for general supersymmetric Z_N orbifolds. In particular, we provide the methods to deal with the non-factorisable six-dimensional tori for the cases Z7, Z8, Z8', Z12 and Z12'. As an application of these methods we explicitly construct many new orientifold models.
