Title: Layered Higgs Phase as a Possible Field Localisation on a Brane
Authors: P. Dimopoulos and K. Farakos
Abstract: So far it has been found by using lattice techniques that in the anisotropic five--dimensional Abelian Higgs model, a layered Higgs phase exists in addition to the expected five--dimensional one. The exploration of the phase diagram has shown that the two Higgs phases are separated by a phase transition from the confining phase. This transition is known to be first order. In this paper we explore the possibility of finding a second order transition point in the critical line which separates the first order phase transition from the crossover region. This is shown to be the case only for the four--dimensional Higgs layered phase whilst the phase transition to the five--dimensional broken phase remains first order. The layered phase serves as the possible realisation of four--dimensional spacetime dynamics which is embedded in a five--dimensional spacetime. These results are due to gauge and scalar field localisation by confining interactions along the extra fifth direction.
