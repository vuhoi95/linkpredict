Title: Higher charge calorons with non-trivial holonomy
Authors: Falk Bruckmann and Daniel Nogradi and Pierre van Baal
Abstract: The full ADHM-Nahm formalism is employed to find exact higher charge caloron solutions with non-trivial holonomy, extended beyond the axially symmetric solutions found earlier. Particularly interesting is the case where the constituent monopoles, that make up these solutions, are not necessarily well-separated. This is worked out in detail for charge 2. We resolve the structure of the extended core, which was previously localized only through the singularity structure of the zero-mode density in the far field limit. We also show that this singularity structure agrees exactly with the abelian charge distribution as seen through the abelian component of the gauge field. As a by-product zero-mode densities for charge 2 magnetic monopoles are found.
