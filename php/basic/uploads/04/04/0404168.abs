Title: Dilaton Destabilization at High Temperature
Authors: Wilfried Buchmuller and Koichi Hamaguchi and Oleg Lebedev and Michael Ratz
Abstract: Many compactifications of higher-dimensional supersymmetric theories have approximate vacuum degeneracy. The associated moduli fields are stabilized by non-perturbative effects which break supersymmetry. We show that at finite temperature the effective potential of the dilaton acquires a negative linear term. This destabilizes all moduli fields at sufficiently high temperature. We compute the corresponding critical temperature which is determined by the scale of supersymmetry breaking, the beta-function associated with gaugino condensation and the curvature of the K"ahler potential, T_crit ~ (m_3/2 M_P)^(1/2) (3/\beta)^(3/4) (K'')^(-1/4). For realistic models we find T_crit ~ 10^11-10^12 GeV, which provides an upper bound on the temperature of the early universe. In contrast to other cosmological constraints, this upper bound cannot be circumvented by late-time entropy production.
