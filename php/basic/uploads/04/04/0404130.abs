Title: Monopole Bundles over Fuzzy Complex Projective Spaces
Authors: Ursula Carow-Watamura and Harold Steinacker and Satoshi Watamura
Abstract: We give a construction of the monopole bundles over fuzzy complex projective spaces as projective modules. The corresponding Chern classes are calculated. They reduce to the monopole charges in the N -> infinity limit, where N labels the representation of the fuzzy algebra.
