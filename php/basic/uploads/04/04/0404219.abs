Title: Constraints and Superspin for SuperPoincare Algebras in Diverse  Dimensions
Authors: Andrea Pasqua and Bruno Zumino
Abstract: We generalize to arbitrary dimension the construction of a covariant and supersymmetric constraint for the massless superPoincare algebra, which was given for the eleven-dimensional case in a previous work. We also contrast it with a similar construction appropriate to the massive case. Finally we show that the constraint uniquely fixes the representation of the algebra.
