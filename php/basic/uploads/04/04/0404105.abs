Title: Topology in the Little Higgs Models
Authors: Mark Trodden and Tanmay Vachaspati
Abstract: We investigate the implications of the nontrivial vacuum structure of little Higgs models. In particular, focusing on the littlest Higgs model, we demonstrate the existence of three types of topological defects. One is a global cosmic string that is truly topological. The second is more subtle; a semilocal cosmic string, which may be stable due to dynamical effects. The final defect is a $Z_2$ monopole solution with an unusual structure. We briefly discuss the possible cosmological consequences of such nonperturbative structures, although we note that these depend crucially on the fermionic content of the models.
