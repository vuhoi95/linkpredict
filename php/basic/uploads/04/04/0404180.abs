Title: Gauges in the bulk
Authors: Jihn E. Kim and Gary B. Tupper and Raoul D. Viollier
Abstract: We present a general framework for nonparallel brane worlds and use it to discuss the nonlinear radion problem. By imposing the Einstein frame as a gauge condition we are able to give the effective action for both Minkowski and (A)dS$_{4}$ branes. In particular we find the nonlinear radion does not disappear in the second Randall-Sundrum model.
