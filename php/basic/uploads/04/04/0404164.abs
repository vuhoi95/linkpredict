Title: A Reduced Model of Noncommutative S-brane Spectrum
Authors: H. Garcia-Compean and J. Gonzalez-Beltran
Abstract: CFT construction of S-branes describing the rolling and bouncing tachyons is analyzed in the context of a $\theta$-noncommutative deformation of minisuperspace. Half s-brane and s-brane in the noncommutative minisuperspace are analyzed and exact analytic solutions, involving the noncommutative parameter $\theta$ and compatible with the boundary conditions at infinity, are found. Comparison with the usual commutative minisuperspace is finally performed.
