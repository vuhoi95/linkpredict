Title: The Holographic Dark Energy in a Non-flat Universe
Authors: Qing-Guo Huang and Miao Li
Abstract: We study the model for holographic dark energy in a spatially closed universe, generalizing the proposal in hep-th/0403127 for a flat universe. We provide independent arguments for the choice of the parameter $c=1$ in the holographic dark energy model. On the one hand, $c$ can not be less than 1, to avoid violating the second law of thermodynamics. On the other hand, observation suggests $c$ be very close to 1, it is hard to justify a small deviation of $c$ from 1, if $c>1$.
