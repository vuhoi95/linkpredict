Title: N=2 Superconformal boundary states for free bosons and fermions
Authors: Matthias R. Gaberdiel and Hanno Klemm
Abstract: The most general N=2 superconformal boundary states for the c=3 theory consisting of two (uncompactified) free bosons and fermions are constructed. It is shown that the only N=2 boundary states are the familiar Dirichlet boundary states, as well as the Neumann boundary states with an arbitrary electric field.
