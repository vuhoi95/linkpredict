Title: Cosmic acceleration and extra dimensions: constraints on modifications  of the Friedmann equation
Authors: Oystein Elgaroy and Tuomas Multamaki
Abstract: An alternative to dark energy as an explanation for the present phase of accelerated expansion of the Universe is that the Friedmann equation is modified, e.g. by extra dimensional gravity, on large scales. We explore a natural parametrization of a general modified Friedmann equation, and find that the present supernova type Ia and cosmic microwave background data prefer a correction of the form 1/H over a cosmological constant. We also explore the constraints that can be expected in the future, and find that there are good prospects for distinguishing this model from the standard cosmological constant to very high significance if one combines supernova data with a precise measurement of the matter density.
