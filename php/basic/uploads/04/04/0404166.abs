Title: Linearized gravity on the de Sitter brane in the Einstein Gauss-Bonnet  theory
Authors: Masato Minamitsuji and Misao Sasaki
Abstract: We investigate the linearized gravity on a single de Sitter brane in the anti-de Sitter (AdS) bulk in the Einstein Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) theory. We find that the Einstein gravity is recovered for a high energy brane, i.e., in the limit of the large expansion rate, $H\ell\gg 1$, where $H$ is the de Sitter expansion rate and $\ell$ is the curvature radius of the AdS bulk. We also show that, in the short distance limit $r\ll \min\{\ell,H^{-1}\}$, the Brans-Dicke gravity is obtained, whereas in the large distance limit $r\gg\max\{\ell,H^{-1}\}$, the Brans-Dicke gravity is obtained for $H\ell=O(1)$, and the Einstein gravity is recovered both for $H\ell\gg1$ and $H\ell\ll1$. In the limit $H\ell\to0$, these results smoothly match to the results known for the Minkowski brane.
