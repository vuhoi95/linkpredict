Title: Constructing Nongeometric Vacua in String Theory
Authors: Alex Flournoy and Brian Wecht and Brook Williams
Abstract: In this paper we investigate compactifications of the type II and heterotic string on four-dimensional spaces with nongeometric monodromies. We explicitly construct backgrounds which contain the "Duality Twists" discussed by Dabholkar and Hull. Similar constructions of nongeometric backgrounds have been discussed for type II strings by Hellerman, McGreevy, and Williams. We find that imposing such monodromies projects out many moduli from the resulting vacua and argue that these backgrounds are the spacetime realizations of interpolating asymmetric orbifolds.
