Title: Hamilton-Jacobi quantization of singular Lagrangians with linear  velocities
Authors: Sami I. Muslih and Hosam A. El-Zalan and Eqab M. Rabei
Abstract: In this paper, constrained Hamiltonian systems with linear velocities are investigated by using the Hamilton-Jacobi method. We shall consider the integrablity conditions on the equations of motion and the action function as well in order to obtain the path integral quantization of singular Lagrangians with linear velocities.
