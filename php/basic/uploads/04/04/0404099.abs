Title: New physics at low energies and dark matter-dark energy transmutation
Authors: E. I. Guendelman and A. B. Kaganovich
Abstract: A field theory is proposed where the regular fermionic matter and the dark fermionic matter can be different states of the same "primordial" fermion fields. In regime of the fermion densities typical for normal particle physics, the primordial fermions split into three families identified with regular fermions. When fermion energy density becomes comparable with dark energy density, the theory allows transition to new type of states. The possibility of such Cosmo-Low Energy Physics (CLEP) states is demonstrated by means of solutions of the field theory equations describing FRW universe filled with homogeneous scalar field and uniformly distributed nonrelativistic neutrinos. Neutrinos in CLEP state are drawn into cosmological expansion by means of dynamically changing their own parameters. One of the features of the fermions in CLEP state is that in the late time universe their masses increase as a^{3/2} (a=a(t) is the scale factor). The energy density of the cold dark matter consisting of neutrinos in CLEP state scales as a sort of dark energy; this cold dark matter possesses negative pressure and for the late time universe its equation of state approaches that of the cosmological constant. The total energy density of such universe is less than it would be in the universe free of fermionic matter at all.
