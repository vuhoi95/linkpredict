Title: Gravitational Anomalies in Noncommutative Field Theory
Authors: Sendic Estrada-Jimenez and Hugo Garcia-Compean and Carlos Soto-Campos
Abstract: Gravitational axial and chiral anomalies in a noncommutative space are examined through the explicit perturbative computation of one-loop diagrams in various dimensions. The analysis depend on how gravity is coupled to noncommutative matter fields. Delbourgo-Salam computation of the gravitational axial anomaly contribution to the pion decay into two photons, is studied in detail in this context. In the process we show that the two-dimensional chiral pure gravitational anomaly does not receive noncommutative corrections. Pure gravitational chiral anomaly in 4k+2 dimensions with matter fields being chiral fermions of spin-1/2 and spin-3/2, is discussed and a noncommutative correction is found in both cases. Mixed anomalies are finally considered in both cases.
