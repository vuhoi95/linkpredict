Title: Conservation of the stress tensor in perturbative interacting quantum  field theory in curved spacetimes
Authors: Stefan Hollands and Robert M. Wald
Abstract: We propose additional conditions (beyond those considered in our previous papers) that should be imposed on Wick products and time-ordered products of a free quantum scalar field in curved spacetime. These conditions arise from a simple ``Principle of Perturbative Agreement'': For interaction Lagrangians $L_1$ that are such that the interacting field theory can be constructed exactly--as occurs when $L_1$ is a ``pure divergence'' or when $L_1$ is at most quadratic in the field and contains no more than two derivatives--then time-ordered products must be defined so that the perturbative solution for interacting fields obtained from the Bogoliubov formula agrees with the exact solution. The conditions derived from this principle include a version of the Leibniz rule (or ``action Ward identity'') and a condition on time-ordered products that contain a factor of the free field $\phi$ or the free stress-energy tensor $T_{ab}$. The main results of our paper are (1) a proof that in spacetime dimensions greater than 2, our new conditions can be consistently imposed in addition to our previously considered conditions and (2) a proof that, if they are imposed, then for {\em any} polynomial interaction Lagrangian $L_1$ (with no restriction on the number of derivatives appearing in $L_1$), the stress-energy tensor $\Theta_{ab}$ of the interacting theory will be conserved. Our work thereby establishes (in the context of perturbation theory) the conservation of stress-energy for an arbitrary interacting scalar field in curved spacetimes of dimension greater than 2. Our approach requires us to view time-ordered products as maps taking classical field expressions into the quantum field algebra rather than as maps taking Wick polynomials of the quantum field into the quantum field algebra.
