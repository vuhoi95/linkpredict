Title: Noncommutative Moduli for Multi-Instantons
Authors: Tatiana A. Ivanova and Olaf Lechtenfeld and Helge Mueller-Ebhardt
Abstract: There exists a recursive algorithm for constructing BPST-type multi-instantons on commutative R^4. When deformed noncommutatively, however, it becomes difficult to write down non-singular instanton configurations with topological charge greater than one in explicit form. We circumvent this difficulty by allowing for the translational instanton moduli to become noncommutative as well. This makes possible the ADHM construction of 't Hooft multi-instanton solutions with everywhere self-dual field strengths on noncommutative R^4.
