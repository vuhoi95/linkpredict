Abstract: Black holes arising in the context of scalar-tensor gravity theories, where the scalar field is non-minimally coupled to the curvature term, have zero surface gravity. Hence, it is generally stated that their Hawking temperature is zero, irrespectivelly of their gravitational and scalar charges. The proper analysis of the Hawking temperature requires to study the propagation of quantum fields in the space-time determined by these objects. We study scalar fields in the vicinity of the horizon of these black holes. It is shown that the scalar modes do not form an orthonormal set. Hence, the Hilbert space is ill-definite in this case, and no notion of temperature can be extracted for such objects.
