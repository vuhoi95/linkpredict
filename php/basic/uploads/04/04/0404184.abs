Title: Localization and traces in open-closed topological Landau-Ginzburg  models
Authors: Manfred Herbst and C. I. Lazaroiu
Abstract: We reconsider the issue of localization in open-closed B-twisted Landau-Ginzburg models with arbitrary Calabi-Yau target. Through careful analsysis of zero-mode reduction, we show that the closed model allows for a one-parameter family of localization pictures, which generalize the standard residue representation. The parameter $\lambda$ which indexes these pictures measures the area of worldsheets with $S^2$ topology, with the residue representation obtained in the limit of small area. In the boundary sector, we find a double family of such pictures, depending on parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$ which measure the area and boundary length of worldsheets with disk topology. We show that setting $\mu=0$ and varying $\lambda$ interpolates between the localization picture of the B-model with a noncompact target space and a certain residue representation proposed recently. This gives a complete derivation of the boundary residue formula, starting from the explicit construction of the boundary coupling. We also show that the various localization pictures are related by a semigroup of homotopy equivalences.
