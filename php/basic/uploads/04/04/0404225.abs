Title: ABCD of instantons
Authors: Nikita Nekrasov and Sergey Shadchin
Abstract: We solve N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories for arbitrary classical gauge group, i.e. SU(N), SO(N), Sp(N). In particular, we derive the prepotential of the low-energy effective theory, and the corresponding Seiberg-Witten curves. We manage to do this without resolving singularities of the compactified instanton moduli spaces.
