Title: The Bianchi IX model in Loop Quantum Cosmology
Authors: Martin Bojowald and Ghanashyam Date and Golam Mortuza Hossain
Abstract: The Bianchi IX model has been used often to investigate the structure close to singularities of general relativity. Its classical chaos is expected to have, via the BKL scenario, implications even for the approach to general inhomogeneous singularities. Thus, it is a popular model to test consequences of modifications to general relativity suggested by quantum theories of gravity. This paper presents a detailed proof that modifications coming from loop quantum gravity lead to a non-chaotic effective behavior. The way this is realized, independently of quantization ambiguities, suggests a new look at initial and final singularities.
