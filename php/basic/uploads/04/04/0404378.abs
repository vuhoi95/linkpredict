Title: WMAP constraints on low redshift evolution of dark energy
Authors: H. K. Jassal and J. S. Bagla and T. Padmanabhan
Abstract: The conceptual difficulties associated with a cosmological constant have led to the investigation of alternative models in which the equation of state parameter, $w=p/\rho$, of the dark energy evolves with time. We show that combining the supernova type Ia observations {\it with the constraints from WMAP observations} restricts large variation of $\rho(z)$ at low redshifts. The combination of these two observational constraints is stronger than either one. The results are completely consistent with the cosmological constant as the source of dark energy.
