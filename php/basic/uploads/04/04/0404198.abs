Title: Construction of Non-Abelian Walls and Their Complete Moduli Space
Authors: Youichi Isozumi and Muneto Nitta and Keisuke Ohashi and Norisuke Sakai
Abstract: We present a systematic method to construct exactly all Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) multi-wall solutions in supersymmetric (SUSY) U(N_C) gauge theories in five dimensions with N_F hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation for infinite gauge coupling. The moduli space of these non-Abelian walls is found to be the complex Grassmann manifold SU(N_F)/(SU(N_C)xSU(N_F-N_C)xU(1)) endowed with a deformed metric.
