Title: AdS/CFT correspondence and Geometry
Authors: Ioannis Papadimitriou and Kostas Skenderis
Abstract: In the first part of this paper we provide a short introduction to the AdS/CFT correspondence and to holographic renormalization. We discuss how QFT correlation functions, Ward identities and anomalies are encoded in the bulk geometry. In the second part we develop a Hamiltonian approach to the method of holographic renormalization, with the radial coordinate playing the role of time. In this approach regularized correlation functions are related to canonical momenta and the near-boundary expansions of the standard approach are replaced by covariant expansions where the various terms are organized according to their dilatation weight. This leads to universal expressions for counterterms and one-point functions (in the presence of sources) that are valid in all dimensions. The new approach combines optimally elements from all previous methods and supersedes them in efficiency.
