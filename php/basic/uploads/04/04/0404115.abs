Title: Finite temperature properties of the Dirac operator under local boundary  conditions
Authors: C. G. Beneventano and E. M. Santangelo
Abstract: We study the finite temperature free energy and fermion number for Dirac fields in a one-dimensional spatial segment, under two different members of the family of local boundary conditions defining a self-adjoint Euclidean Dirac operator in two dimensions. For one of such boundary conditions, compatible with the presence of a spectral asymmetry, we discuss in detail the contribution of this part of the spectrum to the zeta-regularized determinant of the Dirac operator and, thus, to the finite temperature properties of the theory.
