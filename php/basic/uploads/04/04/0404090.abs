Title: Extremal limit for charged and rotating 2+1-dimensional black holes and  Bertotti-Robinson geometry
Authors: Jerzy Matyjasek and O. B. Zaslavskii
Abstract: We consider 2+1--dimensional analogues of the Bertotti-Robinson (BR) spacetimes in the sense that the coefficient at the angular part is a constant. We show that such BR-like solutions are either pure static or uncharged rotating. We trace the origin of the inconsistency between a charge and rotation, considering the BR-like spacetime as a result of the limiting transition of a non-extremal black hole to the extremal state. We also find that the quasilocal energy and angular momentum of such BR-like spacetimes calculated within the boundary $l=const$ ($l$ is the proper distance) are constants independent of the position of the boundary.
