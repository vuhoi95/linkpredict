Title: Quantization in a General Light-front Frame
Authors: Ashok Das and Silvana Perez
Abstract: In this paper, we study the question of quantization of quantum field theories in a general light-front frame. We quantize scalar, fermion as well as gauge field theories in a systematic manner carrying out the Hamiltonian analysis carefully. The decomposition of the fields into positive and negative frequency terms needs to be done carefully after which we show that the (anti) commutation relations for the quantum operators become frame independent. The frame dependence is completely contained in the functions multiplying these operators in the field decomposition. We derive the propagators from the vacuum expectation values of the time ordered products of the fields.
