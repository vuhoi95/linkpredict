Title: Brane Decay and Death of Open Strings
Authors: Koji Hashimoto and Seiji Terashima
Abstract: We show how open strings cease to propagate when unstable D-branes decay. The information on the propagation is encoded in BSFT two-point functions for arbitrary profiles of open string excitations. We evaluate them in tachyon condensation backgrounds corresponding to (i) static spatial tachyon kink (= lower dimensional BPS D-brane) and (ii) homogeneous rolling tachyon. For (i) the propagation is restricted to the directions along the tachyon kink, while for (ii) all the open string excitations cease to propagate at late time and are subject to a collapsed light cone characterized by Carrollian contraction of Lorentz group.
