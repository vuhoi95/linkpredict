Title: Braneworld inflation
Authors: Alex Buchel and Ahmad Ghodsi
Abstract: We discuss various realizations of the four dimensional braneworld inflation in warped geometries of string theory. In all models the inflaton field is represented by a Dp probe brane scalar specifying its position in the warped throat of the compactification manifold. We study existing inflationary throat local geometries, and construct a new example. The inflationary brane is either a D3- or a D5-brane of type IIB string theory. In the latter case the inflationary brane is wrapping a two-cycle of the compactification manifold. We discuss some phenomenological aspects of the model where slow-roll conditions are under computational control.
