Title: How classical are TeV-scale black holes?
Authors: Marco Cavaglia and Saurya Das
Abstract: We show that the Hawking temperature and the entropy of black holes are subject to corrections from two sources: the generalized uncertainty principle and thermal fluctuations. Both effects increase the temperature and decrease the entropy, resulting in faster decay and ``less classical'' black holes. We discuss the implications of these results for TeV-scale black holes that are expected to be produced at future colliders.
