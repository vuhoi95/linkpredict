Title: SUSY Intertwining Relations of Third Order in Derivatives
Authors: M. V. Ioffe and D. N. Nishnianidze
Abstract: The general solution of the intertwining relations between a pair of Schr\"odinger Hamiltonians by the supercharges of third order in derivatives is obtained. The solution is expressed in terms of one arbitrary function. Some properties of the spectrum of the Hamiltonian are derived, and wave functions for three energy levels are constructed. This construction can be interpreted as addition of three new levels to the spectrum of partner potential: a ground state and a pair of levels between successive excited states. Possible types of factorization of the third order supercharges are analysed, the connection with earlier known results is discussed.
