Title: Fatgraph expansion for noncritical superstrings
Authors: Anton Kapustin and Arvind Murugan
Abstract: We study the fatgraph expansion for the Complex Matrix Quantum Mechanics (CMQM) with a Chern-Simons coupling. In the double-scaling limit this model is believed to describe Type 0A superstrings in 1+1 dimensions in a Ramond-Ramond electric field. With Euclidean time compactified, we show that the RR electric field acts as a chemical potential for vortices living on the Feynman diagrams of the CMQM. We interpret it as evidence that the CMQM Feynman diagrams discretize the NSR formulation of the noncritical Type 0A superstring. We also study T-duality for the CMQM diagrams and propose that a certain complex matrix model is dual to the noncritical Type 0B superstring.
