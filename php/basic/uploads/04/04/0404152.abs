Title: QCD$_4$ Glueball Masses from AdS-6 Black Hole Description
Authors: C. Wen and H. Yang
Abstract: By using the generalized version of gauge/gravity correspondence, we study the mass spectra of several typical QCD$_4$ glueballs in the framework of AdS$_6$ black hole metric of Einstein gravity theory. The obtained glueball mass spectra are numerically in agreement with those from the AdS$7 \times S^4$ black hole metric of the 11-dimensional supergravity.
