Title: Getting just the Supersymmetric Standard Model at Intersecting Branes on  the Z6-orientifold
Authors: Gabriele Honecker and Tassilo Ott
Abstract: In this paper, globally N=1 supersymmetric configurations of intersecting D6-branes on the Z6-orientifold are discussed, involving also fractional branes. It turns out rather miraculously that one is led almost automatically to just ONE particular class of 5 stack models containing the SM gauge group, which all have the same chiral spectrum. The further discussion shows that these models can be understood as exactly the supersymmetric standard model without any exotic chiral symmetric/antisymmetric matter. The superpartner of the Higgs finds a natural explanation and the hypercharge remains massless. However, the non-chiral spectrum within the model class is very different and does not in all cases allow for a N=2 low energy field theoretical understanding of the necessary breaking U(1)xU(1)->U(1) along the Higgs branch, which is needed in order to get the standard Yukawa couplings. Also the left-right symmetric models belong to exactly one class of chiral spectra, where the two kinds of exotic chiral fields can have the interpretation of forming a composite Higgs. The aesthetical beauty of these models, involving only non-vanishing intersection numbers of an absolute value three, seems to be unescapable.
