Title: Two-time autocorrelation function in phase-ordering kinetics from local  scale-invariance
Authors: Malte Henkel and Alan Picone and Michel Pleimling
Abstract: The time-dependent scaling of the two-time autocorrelation function of spin systems without disorder undergoing phase-ordering kinetics is considered. Its form is shown to be determined by an extension of dynamical scaling to a local scale-invariance which turns out to be a new version of conformal invariance. The predicted autocorrelator is in agreement with Monte-Carlo data on the autocorrelation function of the 2D kinetic Ising model with Glauber dynamics quenched to a temperature below criticality.
