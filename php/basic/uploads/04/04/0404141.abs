Title: BRANECODE: A Program for Simulations of Braneworld Dynamics
Authors: Johannes Martin and Gary N. Felder and Andrei V. Frolov and Lev Kofman and Marco Peloso
Abstract: We describe an algorithm and a C++ implementation that we have written and made available for calculating the fully nonlinear evolution of 5D braneworld models with scalar fields. Bulk fields allow for the stabilization of the extra space. However, they complicate the dynamics of the system, so that analytic calculations (performed within an effective 4D theory) are typically only reliable close to stabilized configurations or when the evolution of the extra space is negligible. In the general case, a numerical study of the 5D equations is necessary, and the algorithm and code we describe are the first ones designed for this task. The program and its full documentation are available on the Web at http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~jmartin/BRANECODE/. In this paper we provide a brief overview of what the program does and how to use it.
