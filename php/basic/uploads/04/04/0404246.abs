Title: D-branes as Defects in the Calabi-Yau Crystal
Authors: Natalia Saulina and Cumrun Vafa
Abstract: We define the notion of A-model Lagrangian D-branes as introducing defects in the Calabi-Yau crystal. The crystal melting in the presence of these defects reproduces all genus string amplitudes as well as leads to additional non-perturbative terms.
