Title: Large-N limit of the two-dimensoinal Yang-Mills theory on surfaces with  boundaries
Authors: M. Alimohammadi and M. Khorrami
Abstract: The large-N limit of the two-dimensional U$(N)$ Yang-Mills theory on an arbitrary orientable compact surface with boundaries is studied. It is shown that if the holonomies of the gauge field on boundaries are near the identity, then the critical behavior of the system is the same as that of an orientable surface without boundaries with the same genus but with a modified area. The diffenece between this effective area and the real area of the surface is obtained and shown to be a function of the boundary conditions (holonomies) only. A similar result is shown to hold for the group SU$(N)$ and other simple groups.
