Title: Decay of de Sitter vacua by thermal activation
Authors: Jaume Garriga and Ariel Megevand
Abstract: Decay of a de Sitter vacuum may proceed through a "static" instanton, representing pair creation of critical bubbles separated by a distance comparable to the Hubble radius -- a process somewhat analogous to thermal activation in flat space. We compare this with related processes recently discussed in the literature.
