Abstract: We study the possible signals of a pion string associated with the QCD chiral phase transition in LHC Pb - Pb collision at energy $ \sqrt{s}=5.5$ TeV. In terms of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism we discuss the production and evolution of the pion string. The pion string is not topologically stable, it decays into neutral pions and sigma mesons which in turn decay into pions. Our results show that all the neutral pions from the pion string are distributed at the low momentum and the ratio of neutral to charged pions from the pion string violates the isospin symmetry. For the momentum spectra of the total pions, the signal from the sigma particle decay which is from the pion string will be affected by the large decay width of the sigma significantly.
