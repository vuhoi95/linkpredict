Title: G_2-structures with torsion from half-integrable nilmanifolds
Authors: Simon Chiossi and Andrew Swann
Abstract: The equations for a G_2-structure with torsion on a product M^7 = N^6 x S^1 are studied in relation to the induced SU(3)-structure on N^6. All solutions are found in the case when the Lee-form of the G_2-structure is non-zero and N^6 is a six-dimensional nilmanifold with half-integrable SU(3)-structure. Special properties of the torsion of these solutions are discussed.
