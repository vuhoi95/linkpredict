Title: New Interpretation of Skyrme Theory
Authors: Y. M. Cho and B. S. Park and P. M. Zhang
Abstract: Based on the proposal that the Skyrme theory is a theory of monopole we provide a new interpretation of Skyrme theory, that the theory can also be viewed as an effective theory of strong interaction which is dual to QCD, where the monopoles (not the quarks) are confined through the Meissner effect. This dual picture leads us to predict the existence of a topological glueball in QCD, a chromoelectric knot which is dual to the chromomagnetic Faddeev-Niemi knot in Skyrme theory, whose mass and decay width are estimated to be around $60 GeV$ and $8 GeV$. As importantly, the existence of the magnetic vortex and the magnetic vortex ring in Skyrme theory strongly indicates that the theory could also be interpreted to describe a very interesting low energy condensed matter physics in a completely different environment. These new interpretations of Skyrme theory puts the theory in a totally new perspective.
