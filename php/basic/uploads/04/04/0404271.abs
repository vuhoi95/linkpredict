Title: Lorentz Violation in Supersymmetric Field Theories
Authors: Stefan Groot Nibbelink and Maxim Pospelov
Abstract: We construct supersymmetric Lorentz violating operators for matter and gauge fields. We show that in the supersymmetric Standard Model the lowest possible dimension for such operators is five, and therefore they are suppressed by at least one power of an ultra--violet energy scale, providing a possible explanation for the smallness of Lorentz violation and its stability against radiative corrections. Supersymmetric Lorentz noninvariant operators do not lead to modifications of dispersion relations at high energies thereby escaping constraints from astrophysical searches for Lorentz violation.
