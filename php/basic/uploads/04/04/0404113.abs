Title: Composite S-Brane Solutions On Product Of Ricci-Flat Spaces
Authors: V. D. Ivashchuk and V. N. Melnikov and A. B. Selivanov
Abstract: A family of generalized $S$-brane solutions with orthogonal intersection rules and $n$ Ricci-flat factor spaces in the theory with several scalar fields and antisymmetric forms is considered. Two subclasses of solutions with power-law and exponential behaviour of scale factors are singled out. These subclasses contain sub-families of solutions with accelerated expansion of certain factor spaces. The solutions depend on charge densities of branes, their dimensions and intersections, dilatonic couplings and the number of dilatonic fields.
