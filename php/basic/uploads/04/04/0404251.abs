Title: Extending the Veneziano-Yankielowicz Effective Theory
Authors: P. Merlatti and F. Sannino
Abstract: We extend the Veneziano Yankielowicz (VY) effective theory in order to account for ordinary glueball states. We propose a new form of the superpotential including a chiral superfield for the glueball degrees of freedom. When integrating it ``out'' we obtain the VY superpotential while the N vacua of the theory naturally emerge. This fact has a counterpart in the Dijkgraaf and Vafa geometric approach. We suggest a link of the new field with the underlying degrees of freedom which allows us to integrate it ``in'' the VY theory. We finally break supersymmetry by adding a gluino mass and show that the Kahler independent part of the ``potential'' has the same form of the ordinary Yang-Mills glueball effective potential.
