Title: Nonlinear Realization of Supersymmetry and Superconformal Symmetry
Authors: T. E. Clark and S. T. Love
Abstract: Nonlinear realizations describing the spontaneous breakown of supersymmetry and R symmetry are constructed using the Goldstino and R axion fields. The associated R current, supersymmetry current and energy-momentum tensor are shown to be related under the nonlinear supersymmetry transformations. Nonlinear realizations of the superconformal algebra carried by these degrees of freedom are also displayed. The divergences of the R and dilatation currents are related to the divergence of the superconformal currents through nonlinear supersymmetry transformations which in turn relates the explicit breakings of these symmetries.
