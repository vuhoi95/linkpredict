Title: Distributions of flux vacua
Authors: Frederik Denef and Michael R. Douglas
Abstract: We give results for the distribution and number of flux vacua of various types, supersymmetric and nonsupersymmetric, in IIb string theory compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds. We compare this with related problems such as counting attractor points.
