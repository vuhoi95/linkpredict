Title: Relativistic Spinor Dynamics Inducing the Extended Lorentz-Force-Like  Equation
Authors: Andreas Bette and Jesus Buitrago
Abstract: The special relativistic dynamical equation of the Lorentz force type can be regarded as a consequence of a succession of space-time dependent infinitesimal Lorentz transformations as shown by one of us \cite{buitrago} and discussed in the introduction below. Such an insight indicates that the Lorentz-force-like equation has an extremely fundamental meaning in physics. In this paper we therefore present a set of dynamical Weyl spinor equations {\em inducing} the extended Lorentz-force-like equation in the Minowski space-time. The term extended refers to the dynamics of some additional degrees of freedom that may be associated with the classical spin namely with the dynamics of three space-like mutually orthogonal four-vectors, all of them orthogonal to the linear four-momentum of the object under consideration.
