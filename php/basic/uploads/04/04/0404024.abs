Title: Massive Relativistic Systems with Spin and the Two Twistor Phase Space
Authors: Andreas Bette and Stanislaw Zakrzewski
Abstract: We show that a two twistor phase space {\`a} priori describing two non localized massless and spinning particles may be decomposed into a product of three independent phase spaces: the (forward) cotangent bundle of the Minkowski space, the cotangent bundle to a circle (electric charge phase space) and the cotangent bundle to the real projective spinor space. Reduction of this 16 dimensional phase space with respect to two mutually commuting conformal scalars (the electric charge and the difference between the two helicities) produces a 12 dimensional extended relativistic phase space\cite{zak} describing a massive spinning particle.
