Title: Rational Lax operators and their quantization
Authors: A. Chervov and L. Rybnikov and D. Talalaev
Abstract: We investigate the construction of the quantum commuting hamiltonians for the Gaudin integrable model. We prove that [Tr L^k(z), Tr L^m(u) ]=0, for k,m < 4 . However this naive receipt of quantization of classically commuting hamiltonians fails in general, for example we prove that [Tr L^4(z), Tr L^2(u) ] \ne 0. We investigate in details the case of the one spin Gaudin model with the magnetic field also known as the model obtained by the "argument shift method". Mathematically speaking this method gives maximal Poisson commutative subalgebras in the symmetric algebra S(gl(N)). We show that such subalgebras can be lifted to U(gl(N)), simply considering Tr L(z)^k, k\le N for N<5. For N=6 this method fails: [Tr L_{MF}(z)^6, L_{MF}(u)^3]\ne 0 . All the proofs are based on the explicit calculations using r-matrix technique. We also propose the general receipt to find the commutation formula for powers of Lax operator. For small power exponents we find the complete commutation relations between powers of Lax operators.
