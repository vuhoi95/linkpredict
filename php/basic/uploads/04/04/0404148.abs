Title: Open inflationary universes in a brane world cosmology
Authors: Sergio del Campo and Ramon Herrera and Joel Saavedra
Abstract: In this paper, we study a type of one-field model for open inflationary universe models in the context of the brane world models. In the scenario of a one-bubble universe model, we determine and characterize the existence of the Coleman-De Lucia instanton, together with the period of inflation after tunneling has occurred. Our results are compared to those found in the Einstein theory of Relativistic Models.
