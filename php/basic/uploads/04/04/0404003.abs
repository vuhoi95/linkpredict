Title: Time and "angular" dependent backgrounds from stationary axisymmetric  solutions
Authors: Octavio Obregon and Hernando Quevedo and Michael P. Ryan
Abstract: Backgrounds depending on time and on "angular" variable, namely polarized and unpolarized $S^1 \times S^2$ Gowdy models, are generated as the sector inside the horizons of the manifold corresponding to axisymmetric solutions. As is known, an analytical continuation of ordinary $D$-branes, $iD$-branes allows one to find $S$-brane solutions. Simple models have been constructed by means of analytic continuation of the Schwarzchild and the Kerr metrics. The possibility of studying the $i$-Gowdy models obtained here is outlined with an eye toward seeing if they could represent some kind of generalized $S$-branes depending not only on time but also on an ``angular'' variable.
