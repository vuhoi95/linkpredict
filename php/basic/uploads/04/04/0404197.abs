Title: The explicit form of the effective action for F1 and D-branes
Authors: Donald Marolf and Luca Martucci and Pedro J. Silva
Abstract: In this work we consider the full interacting effective actions for fundamental strings and D-branes in arbitrary bosonic type II supergravity backgrounds. The explicit form of these actions is given in terms of component fields, up to second order in the fermions. The results take a compact form exhibiting $\kappa$-symmetry, as well as supersymmetry in a background with Killing spinors. Also we give the explicit transformation rules for these symmetries in all cases.
