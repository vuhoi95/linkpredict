Title: Chern-Simons Gravity and Holographic Anomalies
Authors: M. Banados and A. Schwimmer and S. Theisen
Abstract: We present a holographic treatment of Chern-Simons (CS) gravity theories in odd dimensions. We construct the associated holographic stress tensor and calculate the Weyl anomalies of the dual CFT.
