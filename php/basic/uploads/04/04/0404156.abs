Title: Emergence of a 4D World from Causal Quantum Gravity
Authors: J. Ambjorn and J. Jurkiewicz and R. Loll
Abstract: Causal Dynamical Triangulations in four dimensions provide a background-independent definition of the sum over geometries in nonperturbative quantum gravity, with a positive cosmological constant. We present evidence that a macroscopic four-dimensional world emerges from this theory dynamically.
