Title: String Theoretical Interpretation for Finite N Yang-Mills Theory in  Two-Dimensions
Authors: Toshihiro Matsuo and So Matsuura
Abstract: We discuss the equivalence between a string theory and the two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory with SU(N) gauge group for finite N. We find a sector which can be interpreted as a sum of covering maps from closed string world-sheets to the target space, whose covering number is less than N. This gives an asymptotic expansion of 1/N whose large N limit becomes the chiral sector defined by D.Gross and W.Taylor. We also discuss that the residual part of the partition function provides the non-perturbative corrections to the perturbative expansion.
