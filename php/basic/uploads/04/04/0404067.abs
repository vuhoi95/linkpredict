Title: Quantum Gravity Phenomenology and Lorentz Violation
Authors: Ted Jacobson and Stefano Liberati and David Mattingly
Abstract: If quantum gravity violates Lorentz symmetry, the prospects for observational guidance in understanding quantum gravity improve considerably. This article briefly reviews previous work on Lorentz violation (LV) and discusses aspects of the effective field theory framework for parametrizing LV effects. Current observational constraints on LV are then summarized, focusing on effects in QED at order E/M_Planck.
