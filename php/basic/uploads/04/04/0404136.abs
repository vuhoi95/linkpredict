Title: Ising Field Theory on a Pseudosphere
Authors: Benjamin Doyon and Pedro Fonseca
Abstract: We show how the symmetries of the Ising field theory on a pseudosphere can be exploited to derive the form factors of the spin fields as well as the non-linear differential equations satisfied by the corresponding two-point correlation functions. The latter are studied in detail and, in particular, we present a solution to the so-called connection problem relating two of the singular points of the associated Painleve VI equation. A brief discussion of the thermodynamic properties is also presented.
