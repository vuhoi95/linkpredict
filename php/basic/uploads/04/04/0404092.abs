Abstract: We present results for the three-loop universal anomalous dimension of Wilson twist-2 operators in the N=4 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills model. These results are obtained by extracting the most complicated contributions from the three loop non-singlet anomalous dimensions in QCD which were calculated recently. Their singularities at j=1 agree with the predictions obtained from the BFKL equation for N=4 SYM in the next-to-leading order. The asymptotics of universal anomalous dimension at large j is in an agreement with the expectations based on an interpolation between weak and strong coupling regimes in the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence.
