Title: Quantum behavior of a charged particle in an axial magnetic field
Authors: A. Das and J. Frenkel and S. H. Pereira and J. C. Taylor
Abstract: We study some aspects of the quantum theory of a charged particle moving in a time-independent, uni-directional magnetic field. When the field is uniform, we make a few clarifying remarks on the use of angular momentum eigenstates and momentum eigenstates with the diamagnetism of a free electron gas as an example. When the field is non-uniform but weakly varying, we discuss both perturbative and non-perturbative methods for studying a quantum mechanical system. As an application, we derive the quantized energy levels of a charged particle in a Helmholtz coil, which go over to the usual Landau levels in the limit of a uniform field.
