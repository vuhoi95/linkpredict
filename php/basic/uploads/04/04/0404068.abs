Title: Ratios of characteristic polynomials in complex matrix models
Authors: G. Akemann and A. Pottier
Abstract: We compute correlation functions of inverse powers and ratios of characteristic polynomials for random matrix models with complex eigenvalues. Compact expressions are given in terms of orthogonal polynomials in the complex plane as well as their Cauchy transforms, generalizing previous expressions for real eigenvalues. We restrict ourselves to ratios of characteristic polynomials over their complex conjugate.
