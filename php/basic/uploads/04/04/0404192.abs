Title: Dualization of non-Abelian $B\wedgeÏ†$ model
Authors: C. A. S. Almeida and R. R. Landim and D. M. Medeiros
Abstract: In this work we show a dualization process of a non-Abelian model with an antisymmetric tensor gauge field in a three-dimensional space-time. We have constructed a non-Abelian gauge invariant St\"{u}ckelberg-like master action, and a duality between a non-Abelian topologically massive $B\wedge\phi$ model and a non-Abelian massive scalar action, which leads us to a Klein-Gordon-type action when we consider a particular case.
