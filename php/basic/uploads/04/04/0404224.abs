Title: Dark Energy Constraints from the Cosmic Age and Supernova
Authors: Bo Feng and Xiulian Wang and Xinmin Zhang
Abstract: Using the low limit of cosmic ages from globular cluster and the white dwarfs: $t_0 > 12$Gyr, together with recent new high redshift supernova observations from the HST/GOODS program and previous supernova data, we give a considerable estimation of the equation of state for dark energy, with uniform priors as weak as $0.2<\Omega_m<0.4$ or $0.1<\Omega_m h^2<0.16$. We find cosmic age limit plays a significant role in lowering the upper bound on the variation amplitude of dark energy equation of state. We propose in this paper a new scenario of dark energy dubbed Quintom, which gives rise to the equation of state larger than -1 in the past and less than -1 today, satisfying current observations. In addition we've also considered the implications of recent X-ray gas mass fraction data on dark energy, which favors a negative running of the equation of state.
