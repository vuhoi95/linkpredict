Title: On The Classical Dynamics Of Charges In Noncommutative QED
Authors: Amir H. Fatollahi and Hossein Mohammadzadeh
Abstract: One approach for formulating the classical dynamics of charged particles in non-Abelian gauge theories is due to Wong. Following Wong's approach, we derive the classical equations of motion of a charged particle in U(1) gauge theory on noncommutative space, the so-called noncommutative QED. In the present use of the procedure, it is observed that the definition of mechanical momenta should be modified. The derived equations of motion manifest the previous statement about the dipole behavior of charges in noncommutative space.
