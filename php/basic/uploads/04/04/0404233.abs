Title: The Hopf Algebra of Renormalization, Normal Coordinates and Kontsevich  Deformation Quantization
Authors: M. Rosenbaum and J. D. Vergara
Abstract: Using normal coordinates in a Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt basis for the Hopf algebra of renormalization in perturbative quantum field theory, we investigate the relation between the twisted antipode axiom in that formalism, the Birkhoff algebraic decomposition and the universal formula of Kontsevich for quantum deformation.
