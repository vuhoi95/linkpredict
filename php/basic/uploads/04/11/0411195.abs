Title: Rotating Solutions of Non-relativistic String Theory
Authors: Joaquim Gomis and Filippo Passerini
Abstract: We construct classical rotating solutions of Non-relativistic String Theory. The relation among the energy and angular momenta for these solutions is of the type E=J^2. Some of the solutions saturate a BPS bound for the energy, they are 1/4 BPS supersymmetric configurations.
