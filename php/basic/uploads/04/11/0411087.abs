Title: On Isolated Conformal Fixed Points and Noncritical String Theory
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha and Ahmad Ghodsi and Amir E. Mosaffa
Abstract: We search for the gravity description of unidentified field theories at their conformal fixed points by studying the low energy effective action of six dimensional noncritical string theory. We find constant dilaton solutions by solving both the equations of motion and BPS equations. Our solutions include a free parameter provided by a stack of uncharged space filling branes. We find several AdS_p\times S^q solutions with constant radii for AdS_p and S^q. The curvature of the solutions are of the order of the string scale.
