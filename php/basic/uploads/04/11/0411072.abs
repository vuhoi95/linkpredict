Title: Quantum mechanical considerations on algebraic structure of central  molecular chirality
Authors: S. Capozziello and A. Lattanzi
Abstract: The chiral algebra of tetrahedral molecules, derived from Fischer projections, is discussed in the framework of quantum mechanics. A quantum chiral algebra is obtained whose operators, acting as rotations or inversions, commute with the Hamiltonian of the system. It is shown that energy and chirality eigenstates are strictly related through the Heisenberg relations, while chirality operators conserve parity eigenstates.
