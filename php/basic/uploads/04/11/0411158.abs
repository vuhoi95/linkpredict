Title: Massive graviton as a testable cold dark matter candidate
Authors: S. L. Dubovsky and P. G. Tinyakov and I. I. Tkachev
Abstract: We construct a consistent model of gravity where the tensor graviton mode is massive, while linearized equations for scalar and vector metric perturbations are not modified. The Friedmann equation acquires an extra dark-energy component leading to accelerated expansion. The mass of the graviton can be as large as $\sim (10^{15}{cm})^{-1}$, being constrained by the pulsar timing measurements. We argue that non-relativistic gravitational waves can comprise the cold dark matter and may be detected by the future gravitational wave searches.
