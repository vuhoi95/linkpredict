Title: Distributions of nonsupersymmetric flux vacua
Authors: Frederik Denef and Michael R. Douglas
Abstract: We continue the study of the distribution of nonsupersymmetric flux vacua in IIb string theory compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds, as in hep-th/0404116. We show that the basic structure of this problem is that of finding eigenvectors of the matrix of second derivatives of the superpotential, and that many features of the results are determined by features of the generic ensemble of such matrices, the CI ensemble of Altland and Zirnbauer originating in mesoscopic physics. We study some simple examples in detail, exhibiting various factors which can favor low or high scale supersymmetry breaking.
