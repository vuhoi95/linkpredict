Title: Higher spin holography for SYM in d dimensions
Authors: J. F. Morales and H. Samtleben
Abstract: We derive the spectrum of gauge invariant operators for maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories in d dimensions. After subtracting the tower of BPS multiplets, states are shown to fall into long multiplets of a hidden SO(10,2) symmetry dressed by thirty-two supercharges. Their primaries organize into a universal, i.e. d-independent pattern. The results are in perfect agreement with those following from (naive) KK reduction of type II strings on the warped AdS x S near-horizon geometry of Dp-branes.
