Title: On Superspace Chern-Simons-like Terms
Authors: Philip C. Argyres and Adel M. Awad and Gregory A. Braun and F. Paul Esposito
Abstract: We search for superspace Chern-Simons-like higher-derivative terms in the low energy effective actions of supersymmetric theories in four dimensions. Superspace Chern-Simons-like terms are those gauge-invariant terms which cannot be written solely in terms of field strength superfields and covariant derivatives, but in which a gauge potential superfield appears explicitly. We find one class of such four-derivative terms with N=2 supersymmetry which, though locally on the Coulomb branch can be written solely in terms of field strengths, globally cannot be. These terms are classified by certain Dolbeault cohomology classes on the moduli space. We include a discussion of other examples of terms in the effective action involving global obstructions on the Coulomb branch.
