Title: New axially symmetric Yang-Mills-Higgs solutions with negative  cosmological constant
Authors: Eugen Radu and D. H. Tchrakian
Abstract: We construct numerically new axially symmetric solutions of SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs theory in $(3+1)$ anti-de Sitter spacetime. Two types of finite energy, regular configurations are considered: multimonopole solutions with magnetic charge $n>1$ and monopole-antimonopole pairs with zero net magnetic charge. A somewhat detailed analysis of the boundary conditions for axially symmetric solutions is presented. The properties of these solutions are investigated, with a view to compare with those on a flat spacetime background. The basic properties of the gravitating generalizations of these configurations are also discussed.
