Title: Brane Condensation and Confinement
Authors: P. Gaete and C. Wotzasek
Abstract: We study the static quantum potential for a theory of anti-symmetric tensor fields that results from the condensation of topological defects, within the framework of the gauge-invariant but path-dependent variables formalism. Our calculations show that the interaction energy is the sum of a Yukawa and a linear potentials, leading to the confinement of static probe charges.
