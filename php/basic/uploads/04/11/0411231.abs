Title: Aspects of generalized Calogero model
Authors: S. Meljanac and A. Samsarov and M. Milekovic
Abstract: A multispecies model of Calogero type in $D\geq 1$ dimensions is constructed. The model includes harmonic, two-body and three-body interactions. Using the underlying conformal SU(1,1) algebra, we find the exact eigenenergies corresponding to a class of the exact global collective states. Analysing corresponding Fock space, we detect the universal critical point at which the model exhibits singular behaviour.
