Title: Maximal Temperature in Flux Compactifications
Authors: Wilfried Buchmuller and Koichi Hamaguchi and Oleg Lebedev and Michael Ratz
Abstract: Thermal corrections have an important effect on moduli stabilization leading to the existence of a maximal temperature, beyond which the compact dimensions decompactify. In this note, we discuss generality of our earlier analysis and apply it to the case of flux compactifications. The maximal temperature is again found to be controlled by the supersymmetry breaking scale, T_{crit} \sim \sqrt{m_{3/2} M_P}.
