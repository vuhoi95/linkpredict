Title: Spin bits at two loops
Authors: S. Bellucci and P. -Y. Casteill and A. Marrani and C. Sochichiu
Abstract: We consider the Super Yang--Mills/spin system map to construct the SU(2) spin bit model at the level of two loops in Yang--Mills perturbation theory. The model describes a spin system with chaining interaction. In the large $N$ limit the model is shown to be reduced to the two loop planar integrable spin chain.
