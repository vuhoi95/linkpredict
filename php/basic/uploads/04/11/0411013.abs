Title: Open-Closed String Duality from Orbifolded Conifolds
Authors: Seungjoon Hyun and Kyungho Oh
Abstract: We study large N dualities for a class of ${\cal N} = 1$ theories realized on type IIB D5 branes wrapping 2-cycles of local Calabi-Yau threefolds which is obtained from resolving orbifolded conifolds or as effective field theories on D4 branes in type IIA brane configurations. The field theory is $\mathcal{N} =1$ supersymmetric $\prod U(N_{ij})$ Yang-Mills gauge theory. Strong coupling effects are analyzed in the deformed geometry. We propose open-closed string duality via a geometric transition in toric geometry. The T-dual type IIA picture and M-theory lifting are also considered.
