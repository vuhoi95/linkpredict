Title: Skyrmions, instantons, mass and curvature
Authors: Michael Atiyah and Paul Sutcliffe
Abstract: We show that Skyrmions with massless pions in hyperbolic space provide a good approximation to Skyrmions with massive pions in Euclidean space, for a particular relationship between the pion mass and the curvature of hyperbolic space. Using this result we describe how a Skyrmion with massive pions in Euclidean space can be approximated by the holonomy along circles of a Yang-Mills instanton. This is a generalization of the approximation of Skyrmions by the holonomy along lines of an instanton, which is only applicable to massless pions.
