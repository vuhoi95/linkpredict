Title: Exact Scale Invariance of Composite-Field Coupling Constants
Authors: Keiichi Akama and Takashi Hattori
Abstract: We show that the coupling constant of a quantum-induced composite field is scale invariant due to its compositeness condition. It is first demonstrated in next-to-leading order in 1/N in typical models, and then we argue that it holds exactly.
