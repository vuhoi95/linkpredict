Title: Testing Mass Varying Neutrino With Short Gamma Ray Burst
Authors: Hong Li and Zigao Dai and Xinmin Zhang
Abstract: In this paper we study the possibility of probing for the absolute neutrino mass and its variation with short Gamma Ray Burst (GRB). We have calculated the flight time difference between a massive neutrino and a photon in two different approaches to mass varying neutrinos. Firstly we parametrize the neutrino mass as a function of redshift in a model independent way, then we consider two specific models where the neutrino mass varies during the evolution of the Quintessence fields. Our calculations show in general the value of the time delay is changed substantially relative to a constant neutrino mass. Furthermore our numerical results show that the flight time delay in these models is expected to be larger than the duration time of the short GRB, which opens a possibility of testing the scenario of mass varying neutrino with the short GRB.
