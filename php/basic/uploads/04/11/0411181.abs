Title: Giant Gravitons and Fuzzy CP^2
Authors: Bert Janssen and Yolanda Lozano and Diego Rodriguez-Gomez
Abstract: In this article we describe the giant graviton configurations in AdS_m x S^n backgrounds that involve 5-spheres, namely, the giant graviton in AdS_4 x S^7 and the dual giant graviton in AdS_7 x S^4, in terms of dielectric gravitational waves. Thus, we conclude the programme initiated in hep-th/0207199 and pursued in hep-th/0303183 and hep-th/0406148 towards the microscopical description of giant gravitons in AdS_m x S^n spacetimes. In our construction the gravitational waves expand due to Myers dielectric effect onto fuzzy 5-spheres which are described as S^1 bundles over fuzzy CP^2. These fuzzy spheres appear as solutions of the matrix model that comes up as the action for M-theory gravitational waves. The validity of our description is checked by confirming the agreement with the Abelian description in terms of a spherical M5-brane when the number of waves goes to infinity.
