Title: (Anti-)de Sitter Black Hole Thermodynamics and the Generalized  Uncertainty Principle
Authors: Brett Bolen and Marco Cavaglia
Abstract: We extend the derivation of the Hawking temperature of a Schwarzschild black hole via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to the de Sitter and anti-de Sitter spacetimes. The thermodynamics of the Schwarzschild-(anti-)de Sitter black holes is obtained from the generalized uncertainty principle of string theory and non-commutative geometry. This may explain why the thermodynamics of (anti-)de Sitter-like black holes admits a holographic description in terms of a dual quantum conformal field theory, whereas the thermodynamics of Schwarzschild-like black holes does not.
