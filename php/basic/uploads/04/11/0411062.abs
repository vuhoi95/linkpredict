Title: Yang-Mills and some related algebras
Authors: Alain Connes and Michel Dubois-Violette
Abstract: After a short introduction on the theory of homogeneous algebras we describe the application of this theory to the analysis of the cubic Yang-Mills algebra, the quadratic self-duality algebras, their "super" versions as well as to some generalization.
