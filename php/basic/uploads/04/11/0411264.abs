Abstract: We describe an infinite family of quiver gauge theories that are AdS/CFT dual to a corresponding class of explicit horizon Sasaki-Einstein manifolds. The quivers may be obtained from a family of orbifold theories by a simple iterative procedure. A key aspect in their construction relies on the global symmetry which is dual to the isometry of the manifolds. For an arbitrary such quiver we compute the exact R-charges of the fields in the IR by applying a-maximization. The values we obtain are generically quadratic irrational numbers and agree perfectly with the central charges and baryon charges computed from the family of metrics using the AdS/CFT correspondence. These results open the way for a systematic study of the quiver gauge theories and their dual geometries.
