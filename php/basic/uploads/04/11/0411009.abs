Title: Non-critical, near extremal AdS_6 background as a holographic laboratory  of four dimensional YM theory
Authors: S. Kuperstein and J. Sonnenschein
Abstract: We study certain properties of the low energy regime of a theory which resembles four dimensional YM theory in the framework of a non-critical holographic gravity dual. We use for the latter the near extremal $AdS_6$ non-critical SUGRA. We extract the glueball spectra that associates with the fluctuations of the dilaton, one form and the graviton and compare the results to those of the critical near extremal $D4$ model and lattice simulations. We show an area law behavior for the Wilson loop and screening for the 't Hooft loop. The Luscher term is found to be $-{3/24}\frac {\pi}{L}$. We derive the Regge trajectories of glueballs associated with the spinning folded string configurations.
