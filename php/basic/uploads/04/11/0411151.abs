Abstract: Taking as starting point the planar model arising from the dimensional reduction of the Abelian-Higgs Carroll-Field-Jackiw model, we write down and study the extended Maxwell equations and the corresponding wave equations for the potentials. The solutions for these equations correspond to the usual ones for the MCS-Proca system, supplemented with background-dependent correction terms. In the case of a purely timelike background, exact algebraic solutions are presented which possess a similar behavior to the MCS-Proca counterparts near and far from the origin. On the other hand, for a purely spacelike background, only approximate solutions are feasible. They consist of non-trivial analytic expressions with a manifest evidence of spatial anisotropy, which is consistent with the existence of a privileged direction in space. These solutions also behave similarly to the MCS-Proca ones near and far from the origin.
