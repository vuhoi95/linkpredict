Title: Reduced dynamics of Ward solitons
Authors: Maciej Dunajski and Nicholas S. Manton
Abstract: The moduli space of static finite energy solutions to Ward's integrable chiral model is the space $M_N$ of based rational maps from $\CP^1$ to itself with degree $N$. The Lagrangian of Ward's model gives rise to a K\"ahler metric and a magnetic vector potential on this space. However, the magnetic field strength vanishes, and the approximate non--relativistic solutions to Ward's model correspond to a geodesic motion on $M_N$. These solutions can be compared with exact solutions which describe non--scattering or scattering solitons.
