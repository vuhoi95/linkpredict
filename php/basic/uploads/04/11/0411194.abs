Title: Supersymmetric AdS Backgrounds in String and M-theory
Authors: Jerome P. Gauntlett and Dario Martelli and James Sparks and Daniel Waldram
Abstract: We first present a short review of general supersymmetric compactifications in string and M-theory using the language of G-structures and intrinsic torsion. We then summarize recent work on the generic conditions for supersymmetric AdS_5 backgrounds in M-theory and the construction of classes of new solutions. Turning to AdS_5 compactifications in type IIB, we summarize the construction of an infinite class of new Sasaki-Einstein manifolds in dimension 2k+3 given a positive curvature Kahler-Einstein base manifold in dimension 2k. For k=1 these describe new supergravity duals for N=1 superconformal field theories with both rational and irrational R-charges and central charge. We also present a generalization of this construction, that has not appeared elsewhere in the literature, to the case where the base is a product of Kahler-Einstein manifolds.
