Title: Edge solitons in the QHE
Authors: M Hassaine and P. A. Horvathy and J-C. Yera
Abstract: The spacelike reduction of the Chern-Simons Lagrangian yields a modified Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation (jNLS) where in the non-linearity the particle density is replaced by current. When the phase is linear in the position, this latter is an ordinary NLS with time-dependent coefficients which admits interesting solutions. Their arisal is explained by the conformal properties of non-relativistic spacetime. Only the usual travelling soliton is consistent with the jNLS, but the addition of a six-order potential converts it into an integrable equation.
