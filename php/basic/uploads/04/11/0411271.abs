Title: A New Handle on de Sitter Compactifications
Authors: Alex Saltman and Eva Silverstein
Abstract: We construct a large new class of de Sitter (and anti de Sitter) vacua of critical string theory from flux compactifications on products of Riemann surfaces. In the construction, the leading effects stabilizing the moduli are perturbative. We show that these effects self-consistently dominate over standard estimates for further $\alpha^\prime$ and quantum corrections, via tuning available from large flux and brane quantum numbers.
