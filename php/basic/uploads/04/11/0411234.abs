Title: On the Thermodynamics of Goedel Black Holes
Authors: Dietmar Klemm and Luciano Vanzo
Abstract: After a brief review of Goedel-type universes in string theory, we discuss some intriguing properties of black holes immersed in such backgrounds. Among these are the upper bound on the entropy that points towards a finite-dimensional Hilbert space of a holographically dual theory, and the minimum black hole temperature that is reminiscent of the Hawking-Page transition. Furthermore, we discuss several difficulties that are encountered when one tries to formulate a consistent thermodynamics of Goedel black holes, and point out how they may be circumvented.
