Title: Thermodynamics of R-charged Black Holes in AdS(5) From Effective Strings
Authors: Steven S. Gubser and Jonathan J. Heckman
Abstract: It is well known that the thermodynamics of certain near-extremal black holes in asymptotically flat space can be lifted to an effective string description created from the intersection of D-branes. In this paper we present evidence that the semiclassical thermodynamics of near-extremal R-charged black holes in AdS(5)xS(5) is described in a similar manner by effective strings created from the intersection of giant gravitons on the S(5). We also present a free fermion description of the supersymmetric limit of the one-charge black hole, and we give a crude catalog of the microstates of the two and three-charge black holes in terms of operators in the dual conformal field theory.
