Abstract: We prove Noether's direct and inverse second theorems for Lagrangian systems on fiber bundles in the case of gauge symmetries depending on derivatives of dynamic variables of an arbitrary order. The appropriate notions of reducible gauge symmetries and Noether's identities are formulated, and their equivalence by means of certain intertwining operator is proved.
