Title: Isocurvature constraints on gravitationally produced superheavy dark  matter
Authors: Daniel J. H. Chung and Edward W. Kolb and Antonio Riotto and Leonardo Senatore
Abstract: We show that the isocurvature perturbations imply that the gravitationally produced superheavy dark matter must have masses larger than few times the Hubble expansion rate at the end of inflation. This together with the bound on tensor to scalar contribution to the CMB induces a lower bound on the reheating temperature for superheavy dark matter to be about 10^7 GeV. Hence, if the superheavy dark matter scenario is embedded in supergravity models with gravity mediated SUSY breaking, the gravitino bound will squeeze this scenario. Furthermore, the CMB constraint strengthens the statement that gravitationally produced superheavy dark matter scenario prefers a relatively large tensor mode amplitude if the reheating temperature must be less than 10^9 GeV.
