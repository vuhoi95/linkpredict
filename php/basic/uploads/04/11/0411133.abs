Title: A quantum cosmology and discontinuous signature changing classical  solutions
Authors: F. Darabi and A. Rastkar
Abstract: We revisit the classical and quantum cosmology of a universe in which a self interacting scalar field is coupled to gravity with a flat FRW type metric undergoing continuous signature transition. We arrange for quantum cosmologically allowed discontinuity in the classical solutions at the signature changing hypersurface, provided these solutions be dual in some respects. This may be of some importance in the study of early universe within the signature changing scenarios.
