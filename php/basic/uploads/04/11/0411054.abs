Abstract: Exactly solvable model of the quantum isotropic three-dimensional singular oscillator in the relativistic configurational $\vec r$-space is proposed. We have found the radial wavefunctions, which are expressed through the continuous dual Hahn polynomials and energy spectrum for the model under consideration. It is shown that they have the correct non-relativistic limits.
