Title: Topological Open String Amplitudes On Orientifolds
Authors: Vincent Bouchard and Bogdan Florea and Marcos Marino
Abstract: We study topological open string amplitudes on orientifolds without fixed planes. We determine the contributions of the untwisted and twisted sectors as well as the BPS structure of the amplitudes. We illustrate our general results in various examples involving D-branes in toric orientifolds. We perform the computations by using both the topological vertex and unoriented localization. We also present an application of our results to the BPS structure of the coloured Kauffman polynomial of knots.
