Title: A Note on Einstein Sasaki Metrics in D \ge 7
Authors: W. Chen and H. Lu and C. N. Pope and J. F. Vazquez-Poritz
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain new non-singular Einstein-Sasaki spaces in dimensions D\ge 7. The local construction involves taking a circle bundle over a (D-1)-dimensional Einstein-Kahler metric that is itself constructed as a complex line bundle over a product of Einstein-Kahler spaces. In general the resulting Einstein-Sasaki spaces are singular, but if parameters in the local solutions satisfy appropriate rationality conditions, the metrics extend smoothly onto complete and non-singular compact manifolds.
