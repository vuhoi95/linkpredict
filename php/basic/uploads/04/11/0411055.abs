Abstract: Using the Frobenius method, we find high overtones of the Dirac quasinormal spectrum for the Schwarzschild black hole. At high overtones, the spacing for imaginary part of $\omega_{n}$ is equidistant and equals to $\Im{\omega_{n+1}}-\Im{\omega_{n}} =i/8M$, ($M$ is the black hole mass), which is twice less than that for fields of integer spin. At high overtones, the real part of $\omega_{n}$ goes to zero. This supports the suggestion that the expected correspondence between quasinormal modes and Barbero-Immirzi parameter in Loop Quantum Gravity is just a numerical coincidence.
