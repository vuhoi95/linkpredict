Title: Cohomologies of the Poisson superalgebra on (2,n)-superdimensional  spaces
Authors: S. E. Konstein and I. V. Tyutin
Abstract: Cohomology spaces of the Poisson superalgebra realized on smooth Grassmann-valued functions with compact support on R^2 are investigated under suitable continuity restrictions on cochains. The zeroth, first, and second cohomology spaces in the adjoint representation of the Poisson superalgebra are found for the case of a nondegenerate constant Poisson superbracket.
