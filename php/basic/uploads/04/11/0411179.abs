Title: Solitons and excitations in the duality-based matrix model
Authors: I. Andric and L. Jonke and D. Jurman
Abstract: We analyse a specific, duality-based generalization of the hermitean matrix model. The existence of two collective fields enables us to describe specific excitations of the hermitean matrix model. By using these two fields, we construct topologically non-trivial solutions (BPS solitons) of the model. We find the low-energy spectrum of quantum fluctuations around the uniform solution. Furthermore, we construct the wave functional of the ground state and obtain the corresponding Green function.
