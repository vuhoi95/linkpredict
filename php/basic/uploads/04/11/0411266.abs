Title: Topological Gravity, the Hierarchy Problem and Axion Physics
Authors: Carlos Alberto Santos Almeida and Makarius Oliveira Tahim
Abstract: In the last years higher dimensional physics has won importance. Despite the Superstrings, higher dimensional effects, in measurable scales of energy (some TeV), became only possible with Randall-Sundrum's models (RS). In particular, recent studies in neutrino and axion physics have proposed new and interesting questions about neutrino mixings and new scales intermediating the Weak and Planck scales. In this work we discuss field theoretic models that in some aspects are similar to the RS models. Indeed, our models contain domain walls, solitonic-like objects that mimics the branes of the RS models. Applications are discussed ranging from topological field theories in higher dimensions until models containing D=5 space-time torsion in the RS scenario. In particular, we talk about subjects related to topological gravity, the hierarchy problem and axion physics. The topological terms studied are generalizations for $D>4$ of the axion-foton coupling in D=4. Such procedure involves naturally the Kalb-Ramond field. By dimensional reductions we obtain topological terms of the $B\wedge F$ type in D=4 Chern-Simons-like and $B\wedge\partial\phi$ type both in D=3.
