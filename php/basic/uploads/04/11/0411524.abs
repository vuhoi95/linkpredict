Title: Interacting Phantom Energy
Authors: Zong-Kuan Guo and Yuan-Zhong Zhang
Abstract: We investigate the role of a suitable interaction between a matter fluid and a phantom field for the coincidence problem. There exists a stationary scaling solution which is a stable attractor at late times. Furthermore, the cosmic doomsday is avoided in one region of the parameter space.
