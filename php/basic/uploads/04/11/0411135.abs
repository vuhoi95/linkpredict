Title: Mass and angular momenta of Kerr anti-de Sitter spacetimes in  Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory
Authors: Nathalie Deruelle and Yoshiyuki Morisawa
Abstract: We compute the mass and angular momenta of rotating anti-de Sitter spacetimes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory of gravity using a superpotential derived from standard Noether identities. The calculation relies on the fact that the Einstein and Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet vacuum equations are the same when linearized on maximally symmetric backgrounds and uses the recently discovered D-dimensional Kerr-anti-de Sitter solutions to Einstein's equations.
