Title: One-boundary Temperley-Lieb algebras in the XXZ and loop models
Authors: A. Nichols and V. Rittenberg and J. de Gier
Abstract: We give an exact spectral equivalence between the quantum group invariant XXZ chain with arbitrary left boundary term and the same XXZ chain with purely diagonal boundary terms. This equivalence, and a further one with a link pattern Hamiltonian, can be understood as arising from different representations of the one-boundary Temperley-Lieb algebra. For a system of size L these representations are all of dimension 2^L and, for generic points of the algebra, equivalent. However at exceptional points they can possess different indecomposable structures. We study the centralizer of the one-boundary Temperley-Lieb algebra in the 'non-diagonal' spin-1/2 representation and find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. In the exceptional cases the centralizer becomes indecomposable. We show how to get a truncated space of 'good' states. The indecomposable part of the centralizer leads to degeneracies in the three mentioned Hamiltonians.
