Title: Quantum $κ$-Poincaré Algebra from de Sitter Space of Momenta
Authors: J. Kowalski-Glikman and S. Nowak
Abstract: There is a growing number of physical models, like point particle(s) in 2+1 gravity or Doubly Special Relativity, in which the space of momenta is curved, de Sitter space. We show that for such models the algebra of space-time symmetries possesses a natural Hopf algebra structure. It turns out that this algebra is just the quantum $\kappa$-Poincar\'e algebra.
