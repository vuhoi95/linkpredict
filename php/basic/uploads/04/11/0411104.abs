Title: Dilaton Black Holes in de Sitter or Anti-de Sitter Universe
Authors: Chang Jun Gao and Shuang Nan Zhang
Abstract: Poletti and Wiltshire have shown that, with the exception of a pure cosmological constant, the solution of a dilaton black hole in the background of de Sitter or anti-de Sitter universe, does not exist in the presence of one Liouville-type dilaton potential. Here with the combination of three Liouville-type dilaton potentials, we obtain the dilaton black hole solutions in the background of de Sitter or anti-de Sitter universe.
