Title: Gravitational and axial anomalies for generalized Euclidean Taub-NUT  metrics
Authors: Ion I. CotÄƒescu and Sergiu Moroianu and Mihai Visinescu
Abstract: The gravitational anomalies are investigated for generalized Euclidean Taub-NUT metrics which admit hidden symmetries analogous to the Runge-Lenz vector of the Kepler-type problem. In order to evaluate the axial anomalies, the index of the Dirac operator for these metrics with the APS boundary condition is computed. The role of the Killing-Yano tensors is discussed for these two types of quantum anomalies.
