Title: Helicity Basis for Spin 1/2 and 1, and Discrete Symmetry Operations
Authors: Valeri V. Dvoeglazov and J. L. Quintanar Gonzalez
Abstract: We study the theory of the (1/2,0)+(0,1/2) and (1,0)+(0,1) representations of the Lorentz group in the helicity basis. The helicity eigenstates are not the parity eigenstates. This is in accordance with the idea of Berestetskii, Lifshitz and Pitaevskii. The properties of the helicity eigenstates with respect to the charge conjugation and the CP- conjugation are also considered.
