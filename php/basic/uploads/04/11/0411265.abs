Title: Exotic Fluids Made of Open Strings
Authors: Manuel A. Cobas and M. A. R. Osorio and María Suárez
Abstract: We compute the high energy entropy and the equation of state of a gas of open superstrings in the infinite volume limit focusing on the calculation of the number of strings as a function of energy and volume. We do it in the fixed temperature and fixed energy pictures to explicitly proof their equivalence. We find that, at high energy, an effective two dimensional behavior appears for the number of strings. Looking at the equation of state from a ten dimensional point of view, we show that the Hagedorn behavior can be seen as correcting the Zeldovich equation of state ($\rho=p$) that can be found from the two dimensional part of the entropy of the system. By the way, we show that, near the Hagedorn temperature, the equilibrium state obtained by sharing the total energy among open (super)strings of different length is stable.
