Title: Algebraic structure of central molecular chirality starting from Fischer  projections
Authors: S. Capozziello and A. Lattanzi
Abstract: The construction of algebraic structure of central molecular chirality is provided starting from the empirical Fischer projections for tetrahedrons. A matrix representation is given and the algebra of O(4) orthogonal group for rotations and inversions is identified. The result can be generalized to chains of connected tetrahedrons.
