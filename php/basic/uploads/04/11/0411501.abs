Title: Constraints on Oscillating Quintom from Supernova, Microwave Background  and Galaxy Clustering
Authors: Jun-Qing Xia and Bo Feng and Xinmin Zhang
Abstract: We consider in this paper a simple oscillating Quintom model of dark energy which has two free parameters and an equation of state oscillating and crossing -1. For low redshifts the equation of state of this model resembles itself similar to the linearly parameterized dark energy, however differ substantially at large redshifts. We fit our model to the observational data separately from the new high redshift supernova observations from the HST/GOODS program and previous supernova, CMB and galaxy clustering. Our results show that because of the oscillating feature of our model the constraints from observations at large redshifts such as CMB become less stringent.
