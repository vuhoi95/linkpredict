Title: Type IIB Conifold Transitions in Cosmology
Authors: Andre Lukas and Eran Palti and P. M. Saffin
Abstract: We study four-dimensional low energy effective actions for conifold transitions of Calabi-Yau spaces in the context of IIB supergravity. The actions are constucted by examining the mass of D3-branes wrapped on collapsing/expanding three-cycles. We then study the cosmology of the conifold transition, including consequences for moduli stabilization, taking into account the effect of the additional states which become light at the transition. We find, the degree to which the additional states are excited is essential for whether the transition is dynamically realized.
