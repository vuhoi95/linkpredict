Title: Some Phenomenology of Intersecting D-Brane Models
Authors: Gordon L. Kane and Piyush Kumar and Joseph D. Lykken and Ting T. Wang
Abstract: We present some phenomenology of a new class of intersecting D-brane models. Soft SUSY breaking terms for these models are calculated in the u - moduli dominant SUSY breaking approach (in type IIA). In this case, the dependence of the soft terms on the Yukawas and Wilson lines drops out. These soft terms have a different pattern compared to the usual heterotic string models. Phenomenological implications for dark matter are discussed.
