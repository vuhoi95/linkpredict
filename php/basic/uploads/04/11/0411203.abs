Abstract: We consider 1/2 BPS excitations of AdS(5)xS(5) geometries in type IIB string theory that can be mapped into free fermion configurations according to the prescription of Lin, Lunin and Maldacena (LLM). It is shown that whenever the fermionic probability density exceeds one or is negative, closed timelike curves appear in the bulk. A violation of the Pauli exclusion principle in the phase space of the fermions is thus intimately related to causality violation in the dual geometries.
