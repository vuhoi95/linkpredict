Title: D-Brane Dynamics and NS5 Rings
Authors: Steven Thomas and John Ward
Abstract: We consider the classical motion of a probe D-brane moving in the background geometry of a ring of NS5 branes, assuming that the latter are non-dynamical. We analyse the solutions to the Dirac-Born-Infield (DBI) action governing the approximate dynamics of the system. In the near horizon (throat) approximation we find several exact solutions for the probe brane motion. These are compared to numerical solutions obtained in more general cases. One solution of particular interest is when the probe undergoes oscillatory motion through the centre of the ring (and perpendicular to it). By taking the ring radius sufficiently large, this solution should remain stable to any stringy corrections coming from open-strings stretching between the probe and the NS5-branes along the ring.
