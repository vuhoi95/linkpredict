Title: Superanalysis on quantum spaces
Authors: Alexander Schmidt and Hartmut Wachter
Abstract: Attention is focused on antisymmetrised versions of quantum spaces that are of particular importance in physics, i.e. Manin plane, q-deformed Euclidean space in three or four dimensions as well as q-deformed Minkowski space. For each of these quantum spaces we provide q-analogs for elements of superanalysis, i.e. Grassmann integrals, Grassmann exponentials, Grassmann translations and braided products with supernumbers.
