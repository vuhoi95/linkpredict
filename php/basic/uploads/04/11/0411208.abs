Title: Cosmic Acceleration in Massive Half-Maximal Supergravity
Authors: Philippe Brax and Carsten van de Bruck and Anne-Christine Davis
Abstract: We consider massive half-maximal supergravity in (d+3) dimensions and compactify it on a symmetric three space. We find that the static configurations of Minkowski X S^3, obtained by balancing the positive scalar potential for the dilaton and the flux of a three-form through the three-sphere, are unstable. The resulting cosmological evolution breaks supersymmetry and leads to an accelerated expansion in d dimensions.
