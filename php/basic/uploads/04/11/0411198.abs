Title: Cubic supersymmetry and abelian gauge invariance
Authors: G. Moultaka and M. Rausch de Traubenberg and A. Tanasa
Abstract: On the basis of recent results extending non-trivially the Poincar\'e symmetry, we investigate the properties of bosonic multiplets including $2-$form gauge fields. Invariant free Lagrangians are explicitly built which involve possibly $3-$ and $4-$form fields. We also study in detail the interplay between this symmetry and a U(1) gauge symmetry, and in particular the implications of the automatic gauge-fixing of the latter associated to a residual gauge invariance, as well as the absence of self-interaction terms.
