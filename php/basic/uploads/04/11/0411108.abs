Title: Noncommutativity from the symplectic point of view
Authors: Everton M. C. Abreu and Clifford Neves and Wilson Oliveira
Abstract: The great deal in noncommutative (NC) field theories started when it was noted that NC spaces naturally arise in string theory with a constant background magnetic field in the presence of $D$-branes. Besides their origin in string theories and branes, NC field theories have been studied extensively in many branches of physics. In this work we explore how NC geometry can be introduced into a commutative field theory besides the usual introduction of the Moyal product. We propose a systematic new way to introduce NC geometry into commutative systems, based mainly on the symplectic approach. Further, as example, this formalism describes precisely how to obtain a Lagrangian description for the NC version of some systems reproducing well known theories.
