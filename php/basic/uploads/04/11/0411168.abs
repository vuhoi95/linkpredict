Abstract: We study a noncommutative nonrelativistic fermionic field theory in 2+1 dimensions coupled to the Chern-Simons field. We perform a perturbative analysis of model and show that up to one loop the ultraviolet divergences are canceled and the infrared divergences are eliminated by the noncommutative Pauli term.
