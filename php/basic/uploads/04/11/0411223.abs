Title: Noncommutative differential calculus for Moyal subalgebras
Authors: G. Marmo and P. Vitale and A. Zampini
Abstract: We build a differential calculus for subalgebras of the Moyal algebra on R^4 starting from a redundant differential calculus on the Moyal algebra, which is suitable for reduction. In some cases we find a frame of 1-forms which allows to realize the complex of forms as a tensor product of the noncommutative subalgebras with the external algebra Lambda^*.
