Title: The Strong Levinson Theorem for the Dirac Equation
Authors: Alex Calogeracos and Norman Dombey
Abstract: We consider the Dirac equation in one space dimension in the presence of a symmetric potential well. We connect the scattering phase shifts at E=+m and E=-m to the number of states that have left the positive energy continuum or joined the negative energy continuum respectively as the potential is turned on from zero.
