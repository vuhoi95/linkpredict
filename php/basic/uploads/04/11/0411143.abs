Title: Construction of Supergravity Backgrounds with a Dilaton Field
Authors: Noriko Nakayama and Katsuyuki Sugiyama
Abstract: A new class of non-compact Kahler backgrounds accompanied by a non-constant dilaton field is constructed as a supergravity solution. It is interpreted as a complex line bundle over a base manifold comprising of a combination of arbitrary coset spaces, and also includes the case of Calabi-Yau manifolds. The resulting backgrounds have U(1) isometry. We consider N=2 supersymmetric sigma-models on them, and derive a non-Kahlerian solution by U(1) duality transformation, which preserves N=2 supersymmetry.
