Title: Quantum cosmology of the brane universe
Authors: A. Boyarsky and A. Neronov and I. Tkachev
Abstract: We canonically quantize the dynamics of the brane universe embedded into the five-dimensional Schwarzschild-anti-deSitter bulk space-time. We show that in the brane-world settings the formulation of the quantum cosmology, including the problem of initial conditions, is conceptually more simple than in the 3+1-dimensional case. The Wheeler-deWitt equation is a finite-difference equation. It is exactly solvable in the case of a flat universe and we find the ground state of the system. The closed brane universe can be created as a result of decay of the bulk black hole.
