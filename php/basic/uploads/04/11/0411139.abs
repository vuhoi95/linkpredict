Title: Testing the Master Constraint Programme for Loop Quantum Gravity II.  Finite Dimensional Systems
Authors: Bianca Dittrich and Thomas Thiemann
Abstract: This is the second paper in our series of five in which we test the Master Constraint Programme for solving the Hamiltonian constraint in Loop Quantum Gravity. In this work we begin with the simplest examples: Finite dimensional models with a finite number of first or second class constraints, Abelean or non -- Abelean, with or without structure functions.
