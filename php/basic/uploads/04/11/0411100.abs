Title: Quantum Effect and Curvature Strength of Naked Singularities
Authors: Umpei Miyamoto and Hideki Maeda and Tomohiro Harada
Abstract: There are many solutions to the Einstein field equations that demonstrate naked singularity (NS) formation after regular evolution. It is possible, however, that such a quantum effect as particle creation prevents NSs from forming. We investigate the relation between the curvature strength and the quantum effects of NSs in a very wide class of spherical dust collapse. Through a perturbative calculation, we find that if the NS is very strong, the quantum particle creation diverges as the Cauchy horizon is approached, while if the NS is very weak, the creation should be finite. In the context of cosmic censorship, strong NSs will be subjected to the backreaction of quantum effects and may disappear or be hidden behind horizons, while weak NSs will not.
