Title: Model Building and Phenomenology of Flux-Induced Supersymmetry Breaking  on D3-branes
Authors: Fernando Marchesano and Gary Shiu and Lian-Tao Wang
Abstract: We study supersymmetry breaking effects induced on D3-branes at singularities by the presence of NSNS and RR 3-form fluxes. First, we discuss some local constructions of chiral models from D3-branes at singularities, as well as their global embedding in flux compactifications. The low energy spectrum of these constructions contains features of the supersymmetric Standard Model. In these models, both the soft SUSY parameters and the mu-term are generated by turning on the 3-form NSNS and RR fluxes. We then explore some model-independent phenomenological features as, e.g., the fine-tuning problem of electroweak symmetry breaking in flux compactifications. We also comment on other phenomenological features of this scenario.
