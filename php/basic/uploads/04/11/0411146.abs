Title: Notes on Collective Field Theory of Large N Vector Models as Classical  Mechanics on the Siegel Disc
Authors: A. Agarwal and L. Akant
Abstract: We use deformation quantization to construct the large N limits of Bosonic vector models as classical dynamical systems on the Siegel disc and study the relation of this formulation to standard results of collective field theory. Special emphasis is paid to relating the collective potential of the large N theory to a particular cocycle of the symplectic group.
