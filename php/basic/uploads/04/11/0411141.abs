Title: Testing the Master Constraint Programme for Loop Quantum Gravity IV.  Free Field Theories
Authors: Bianca Dittrich and Thomas Thiemann
Abstract: This is the fourth paper in our series of five in which we test the Master Constraint Programme for solving the Hamiltonian constraint in Loop Quantum Gravity. We now move on to free field theories with constraints, namely Maxwell theory and linearized gravity. Since the Master constraint involves squares of constraint operator valued distributions, one has to be very careful in doing that and we will see that the full flexibility of the Master Constraint Programme must be exploited in order to arrive at sensible results.
