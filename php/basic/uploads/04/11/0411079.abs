Title: Speed dependent polarization correlations in QED and entanglement
Authors: E. B. Manoukian and N. Yongram
Abstract: Exact computations of polarizations correlations probabilities are carried out in QED, to the leading order, for initially polarized as well as unpolarized particles. Quite generally they are found to be speed dependent and are in clear violation of Bells inequality of Local Hidden Variables (LHV) theories. This dynamical analysis shows how speed dependent entangled states are generated. These computations, based on QED are expected to lead to new experiments on polarization correlations monitoring speed in the light of Bells theorem. The paper provides a full QED treatment of the dynamics of entanglement.
