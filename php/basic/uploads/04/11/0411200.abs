Title: The Algebra of Transition Matrices for the AdS_5 x S^5 Superstring
Authors: Ashok Das and Jnanadeva Maharana and A. Melikyan and Matsuo Sato
Abstract: We consider integrability properties of the superstring on $AdS_{5}\times S^{5}$ background and construct a new one parameter family of currents which satisfies the vanishing curvature condition. We present the Hamiltonian analysis for the sigma model action and determine the Poisson algebra of the transition matrices. We reveal the generalization of the $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ automorphism analogous to the sigma models defined on a symmetric space coset. A possible regularization scheme for the ambiguities present, which respects the generalized automorphism, is also discussed.
