Title: Changing shapes: adiabatic dynamics of composite solitary waves
Authors: A. Alonso Izquierdo and M. A. Gonzalez Leon and M. de la Torre Mayado and J. Mateos Guilarte
Abstract: We discuss the solitary wave solutions of a particular two-component scalar field model in two-dimensional Minkowski space. These solitary waves involve one, two or four lumps of energy. The adiabatic motion of these composite non-linear non-dispersive waves points to variations in shape.
