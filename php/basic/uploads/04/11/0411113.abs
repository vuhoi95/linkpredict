Abstract: We study an ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory defined on $M^4\times S^1$. The vacuum expectation values for adjoint scalar field in vector multiplet, though important, has been overlooked in evaluating one-loop effective potential of the theory. We correctly take the vacuum expectation values into account in addition to the Wilson line phases to give an expression for the effective potential, and gauge symmetry breaking is discussed. In evaluating the potential, we employ the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism and introduce bare mass for gaugino in order to break supersymmetry. We also obtain masses for the scalars, the adjoint scalar, and the component gauge field for the $S^1$ direction in case of the SU(2) gauge group. We observe that large supersymmetry breaking gives larger mass for the scalar. This analysis is easily applied to the $M^4\times S^1/Z_2$ case.
