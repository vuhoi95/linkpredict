Title: Noncommutative Gauge Theory on the q-Deformed Euclidean Plane
Authors: Frank Meyer and Harold Steinacker
Abstract: In this talk we recall some concepts of Noncommutative Gauge Theories. In particular, we discuss the q-deformed two-dimensional Euclidean Plane which is covariant with respect to the q-deformed Euclidean group. A Seiberg-Witten map is constructed to express noncommutative fields in terms of their commutative counterparts.
