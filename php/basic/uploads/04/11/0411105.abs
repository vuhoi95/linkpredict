Title: Higher Dimensional Dilaton Black Holes with Cosmological Constant
Authors: Chang Jun Gao and Shuang Nan Zhang
Abstract: The metric of a higher-dimensional dilaton black hole in the presence of a cosmological constant is constructed. It is found that the cosmological constant is coupled to the dilaton in a non-trivial way. The dilaton potential with respect to the cosmological constant consists of three Liouville-type potentials.
