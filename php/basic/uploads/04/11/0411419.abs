Title: Root of unity symmetries in the 8 and 6 vertex models
Authors: Klaus Fabricius and Barry M. McCoy
Abstract: We review the recently discovered symmetries of the 8 and 6 vertex models which exist at roots of unity and present their relation with representation theory of affine Lie algebras, Drinfeld polynomials and Bethe vectors.
