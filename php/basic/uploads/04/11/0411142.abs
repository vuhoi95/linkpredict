Title: Testing the Master Constraint Programme for Loop Quantum Gravity V.  Interacting Field Theories
Authors: Bianca Dittrich and Thomas Thiemann
Abstract: This is the final fifth paper in our series of five in which we test the Master Constraint Programme for solving the Hamiltonian constraint in Loop Quantum Gravity. Here we consider interacting quantum field theories, specificlly we consider the non -- Abelean Gauss constraints of Einstein -- Yang -- Mills theory and 2+1 gravity. Interestingly, while Yang -- Mills theory in 4D is not yet rigorously defined as an ordinary (Wightman) quantum field theory on Minkowski space, in background independent quantum field theories such as Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) this might become possible by working in a new, background independent representation.
