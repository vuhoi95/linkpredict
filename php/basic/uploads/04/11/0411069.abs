Title: Aspects of the ODE/IM correspondence
Authors: Patrick Dorey and Clare Dunning and Roberto Tateo
Abstract: We review a surprising correspondence between certain two-dimensional integrable models and the spectral theory of ordinary differential equations. Particular emphasis is given to the relevance of this correspondence to certain problems in PT-symmetric quantum mechanics.
