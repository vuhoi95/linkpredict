Title: Quantum Fluctuations for de Sitter Branes in Bulk AdS(5)
Authors: Wade Naylor and Misao Sasaki
Abstract: The vacuum expectation value of the square of the field fluctuations of a scalar field on a background consisting of {\it two} de Sitter branes embedded in an anti-de Sitter bulk are considered. We apply a dimensional reduction to obtain an effective lower dimensional de Sitter space equation of motion with associated Kaluza-Klein masses and canonical commutation relations. The case of a scalar field obeying a restricted class of mass and curvature couplings, including massless, conformal coupling as a special case, is considered. We find that the local behaviour of the quantum fluctuations suffers from surface divergences as we approach the brane, however, if the field is {\it constrained} to its value on the brane from the beginning then surface divergences disappear. The ratio of $<\phi^2>$ between the Kaluza-Klein spectrum and the lowest eigenvalue mode is found to vanish in the limit that one of the branes goes to infinity.
