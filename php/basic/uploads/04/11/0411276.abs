Title: Superpotentials in IIA compactifications with general fluxes

Abstract: We derive the effective N=1, D=4 supergravity for the seven main moduli of type IIA orientifolds with D6 branes, compactified on T^6/(Z_2xZ_2) in the presence of general fluxes. We illustrate and apply a general method that relates the N=1 effective Kahler potential and superpotential to a consistent truncation of gauged N=4 supergravity. We identify the correspondence between various admissible fluxes, N=4 gaugings and N=1 superpotential terms. We construct explicit examples with different features: in particular, new IIA no-scale models and a model which admits a supersymmetric AdS_4 vacuum with all seven main moduli stabilized.
