Title: An Alternative D$p$-brane Solution of Type IIB Supergravity
Authors: Huan-Xiong Yang and Cong-Kao Wen and Ben-Geng Cai
Abstract: By separating the thermal circle from the extra dimensions, we find a novel exact D$p$-brane solution of Type IIB supergravity, which might provide a scenario for studying the non-perturbative dynamics of QCD$_4$ from the perspective of Type IIB supergravity.
