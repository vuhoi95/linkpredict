Title: Polysymplectic Hamiltonian formalism and some quantum outcomes
Authors: G. Giachetta and L. Mangiarotti and G. Sardanashvily
Abstract: Covariant (polysymplectic) Hamiltonian field theory is formulated as a particular Lagrangian theory on a polysymplectic phase space that enables one to quantize it in the framework of familiar quantum field theory.
