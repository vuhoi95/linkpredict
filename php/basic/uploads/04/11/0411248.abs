Title: On the Lorentz symmetry of the noncommutative chiral bosons
Authors: E. M. C. Abreu and R. Menezes and C. Wotzasek
Abstract: We study issues of Lorentz violation symmetry in the context of the recently proposed theory of noncommutative fields \cite{CCGM}, using the soldering formalism. To this end a noncommutative chiral-boson with a deformed algebra \cite{DGMJ}, used to study these notions in D=2, is properly generalized. We verify, also for this larger group of theories that, although the structure of the Lorentz group is preserved, the velocity of light is scaled by a function of the deformation parameter, as recently claimed. However, we found a sub-set of models where the velocity of propagation is maintained in spite of the presence of the deformed algebra. Effects of a preferred-frame of reference manifest by the presence of birefringence were also studied in the chiral boson framework leading to the scalar sector of the extended Standard Model recently proposed.
