Title: Geometrical approach to central molecular chirality: a chirality  selection rule
Authors: S. Capozziello and A. Lattanzi
Abstract: Chirality is of primary importance in many areas of chemistry and has been extensively investigated since its discovery. We introduce here the description of central chirality for tetrahedral molecules using a geometrical approach based on complex numbers. According to this representation, for a molecule having n chiral centres, it is possible to define an index of chirality. Consequently a chirality selection rule has been derived which allows the characterization of a molecule as achiral, enantiomer or diastereoisomer.
