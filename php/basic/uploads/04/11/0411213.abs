Title: All fundamental fermions fit inside one su(1|5) irreducible  representation
Authors: N. I. Stoilova and J. Van der Jeugt
Abstract: We present the mathematical framework for a unified theory based upon su(1|5). The Lie superalgebra su(1|5) has irreducible representations of dimension 32, in which the 32 fundamental fermions of one generation (leptons and quarks, of left and right chirality, and their antiparticles) can be accommodated. The branching of these su(1|5) representations with respect to its subalgebra su(3) x su(2) x u(1) reproduces precisely the classification of these fundamental fermions according to the gauge group of the Standard Model. Furthermore, a simple construction of the relevant representations is given, and some consequences are discussed.
