Title: On the Vacuum Cherenkov Radiation in Noncommutative Electrodynamics and  the Elusive Effects of Lorentz Violation
Authors: Paolo Castorina and Alfredo Iorio and Dario Zappala'
Abstract: We show that in the framework of noncommutative classical electrodynamics Cherenkov radiation is permitted in vacuum and we explicitly compute its spectrum at first order in the noncommutative parameter. We discuss the phenomenological impact of the merge of this new analysis with the old results of the substantial modification to the spectrum of the synchrotron radiation obtained in P.Castorina, A.Iorio and D.Zappala, Phys. Rev. D 69 (2004)065008. We propose to consider the pulsars' radiation spectrum - due to its very strong magnetic field - to investigate these Lorentz violating effects in astrophysical phenomena.
