Title: How hairy can a black ring be?
Authors: Gary T. Horowitz and Harvey S. Reall
Abstract: It has been shown recently that there is a large class of supersymmetric solutions of five-dimensional supergravity which generalize the supersymmetric black ring solution of Elvang et al. This class involves arbitrary functions. We show that most of these solutions do not have smooth event horizons, so they do not provide examples of black objects with infinite amounts of "hair".
