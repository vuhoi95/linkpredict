Title: Dynamics of Rolling Massive Scalar Field Cosmology
Authors: Pravabati Chingangbam and Tabish Qureshi
Abstract: We study the inflationary consequences of the rolling massive scalar field in the braneworld scenario with a warped metric. We find that in order to fit observational constraints the warp factor must be tuned to be $< 10^{-3}$. We also demonstrate the inflationary attractor behavior of the massive scalar field dynamics both in the standard FRW case as well as in braneworld scenario.
