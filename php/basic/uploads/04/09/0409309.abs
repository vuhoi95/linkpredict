Authors: H. Q. Lu and Z. G. Huang and W. Fang and K. F. Zhang
Abstract: We studied the dilaton cosmology based on Weyl-Scaled induced gravity. The potential of dilaton field is taken as exponential form. An analytical solution of Einstein equation is found. The dilaton can be a candidate for dark energy that can explain the accelerated universe. The structure formation is also considered. We find the the evolutive equation of density perturbation, and its growth is quicker than the one in standard model which is consistent with the constraint from CMBR measurements
