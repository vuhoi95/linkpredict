Title: Setting the quantum integrand of M-theory
Authors: Daniel S. Freed and Gregory W. Moore
Abstract: In anomaly-free quantum field theories the integrand in the bosonic functional integral--the exponential of the effective action after integrating out fermions--is often defined only up to a phase without an additional choice. We term this choice ``setting the quantum integrand''. In the low-energy approximation to M-theory the E(8)-model for the C-field allows us to set the quantum integrand using geometric index theory. We derive mathematical results of independent interest about pfaffians of Dirac operators in 8k+3 dimensions, both on closed manifolds and manifolds with boundary. These theorems are used to set the quantum integrand of M-theory for closed manifolds and for compact manifolds with either temporal (global) or spatial (local) boundary conditions. In particular, we show that M-theory makes sense on arbitrary 11-manifolds with spatial boundary, generalizing the construction of heterotic M-theory on cylinders.
