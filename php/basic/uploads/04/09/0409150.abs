Title: pp Waves of Conformal Gravity with Self-Interacting Source
Authors: Eloy Ayón-Beato and Mokhtar Hassaïne
Abstract: Recently, Deser, Jackiw and Pi have shown that three-dimensional conformal gravity with a source given by a conformally coupled scalar field admits pp wave solutions. In this letter, we consider this model with a self-interacting potential preserving the conformal structure. A pp wave geometry is also supported by this system and, we show that this model is equivalent to topologically massive gravity with a cosmological constant whose value is given in terms of the potential strength.
