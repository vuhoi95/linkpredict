Title: Cotton Blend Gravity $pp$ Waves
Authors: S. Deser and R. Jackiw and S. -Y. Pi
Abstract: We study conformal gravity in d=2+1, where the Cotton tensor is equated to a--necessarily traceless--matter stress tensor, for us that of the improved scalar field. We first solve this system exactly in the $pp$ wave regime, then show it to be equivalent to topologically massive gravity.
