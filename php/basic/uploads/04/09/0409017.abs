Title: Towards Quantum Dielectric Branes: Curvature Corrections in Abelian Beta  Function and Nonabelian Born-Infeld Action
Authors: Pedro Bordalo and Lorenzo Cornalba and Ricardo Schiappa
Abstract: We initiate a programme to compute curvature corrections to the nonabelian BI action. This is based on the calculation of derivative corrections to the abelian BI action, describing a maximal brane, to all orders in F. An exact calculation in F allows us to apply the SW map, reducing the maximal abelian point of view to a minimal nonabelian point of view (replacing 1/F with [X,X] at large F), resulting in matrix model equations of motion. We first study derivative corrections to the abelian BI action and compute the 2-loop beta function for an open string in a WZW (parallelizable) background. This beta function is the first step in the process of computing string equations of motion, which can be later obtained by computing the Weyl anomaly coefficients or the partition function. The beta function is exact in F and computed to orders O(H,H^2,H^3) (H=dB and curvature is R ~ H^2) and O(DF,D^2F,D^3F). In order to carry out this calculation we develop a new regularization method for 2-loop graphs. We then relate perturbative results for abelian and nonabelian BI actions, by showing how abelian derivative corrections yield nonabelian commutator corrections, at large F. We begin the construction of a matrix model describing \a' corrections to Myers' dielectric effect. This construction is carried out by setting up a perturbative classification of the relevant nonabelian tensor structures, which can be considerably narrowed down by the constraint of translation invariance in the action and the possibility for generic field redefinitions. The final matrix action is not uniquely determined and depends upon two free parameters. These parameters could be computed via further calculations in the abelian theory.
