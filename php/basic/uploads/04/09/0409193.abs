Title: A New Mechanism for Radius Stabilization in Warped Supersymmetry
Authors: S. Ichinose and A. Murayama
Abstract: A new mechanism for the radius stabilization is proposed in a 5D super-Yang-Mills model in the warped background of ${AdS}_5$. Dominant 1-loop contribution to the supersymmetric 4D effective potential is estimated to depend on the radion. The minimization of the effective potential incorporating the tree potential and a Fayet-Iliopoulos $D$-term for the gauge group U(1) reveals an interesting case that the radius is stabilized at a length corresponding to an intermediate mass scale $10^{11-13}$ GeV.
