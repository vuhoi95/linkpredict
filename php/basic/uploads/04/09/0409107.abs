Title: The GEMS Approach to Stationary Motions in the Spherically Symmetric  Spacetimes
Authors: Hong-Zhi Chen and Yu Tian and Yi-Hong Gao and Xing-Chang Song
Abstract: We generalize the work of Deser and Levin on the unified description of Hawking radiation and Unruh effect to general stationary motions in spherically symmetric black holes. We have also matched the chemical potential term of the thermal spectrum of the two sides for uncharged black holes.
