Title: On the correlation functions of the domain wall six vertex model
Authors: Omar Foda and Ian Preston
Abstract: We propose an (essentially combinatorial) approach to the correlation functions of the domain wall six vertex model. We reproduce the boundary 1-point function determinant expression of Bogoliubov, Pronko and Zvonarev, then use that as a building block to obtain analogous expressions for boundary 2-point functions. The latter can be used, at least in principle, to express more general boundary (and bulk) correlation functions as sums over (products of) determinants.
