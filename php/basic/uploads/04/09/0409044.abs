Title: Open String Tachyon in Supergravity Solution
Authors: Shinpei Kobayashi and Tsuguhiko Asakawa and So Matsuura
Abstract: We study the tachyon condensation of the D-\bar{D}-brane system with a constant tachyon vev in the context of classical solutions of the Type II supergravity. We find that the general solution with the symmetry ISO(1,p)xSO(9-p) (the three-parameter solution) includes the extremal black p-brane solution as an appropriate limit of the solution with fixing one of the three parameters (c_1). Furthermore, we compare the long distance behavior of the solution with the massless modes of the closed strings from the boundary state of the D-\bar{D}-brane system with a constant tachyon vev. We find that we must fix c_1 to zero and the only two parameters are needed to express the tachyon condensation of the D\={D}-brane system. This means that the parameter $c_1$ does not correspond to the tachyon vev of the D\={D}-brane system.
