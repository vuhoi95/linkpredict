Title: Variations on the Warped Deformed Conifold
Authors: Steven S. Gubser and Christopher P. Herzog and Igor R. Klebanov
Abstract: The warped deformed conifold background of type IIB theory is dual to the cascading $SU(M(p+1))\times SU(Mp)$ gauge theory. We show that this background realizes the (super-)Goldstone mechanism where the U(1) baryon number symmetry is broken by expectation values of baryonic operators. The resulting massless pseudo-scalar and scalar glueballs are identified in the supergravity spectrum. A D-string is then dual to a global string in the gauge theory. Upon compactification, the Goldstone mechanism turns into the Higgs mechanism, and the global strings turn into ANO strings.
