Title: Representation of noncommutative phase space
Authors: Kang Li and Jianhua Wang and Chiyi Chen
Abstract: The representations of the algebra of coordinates and momenta of noncommutative phase space are given. We study, as an example, the harmonic oscillator in noncommutative space of any dimension. Finally the map of Sch$\ddot{o}$dinger equation from noncommutative space to commutative space is obtained.
