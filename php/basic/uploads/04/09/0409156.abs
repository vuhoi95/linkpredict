Title: An Effective Field Theory of Gravity for Extended Objects
Authors: Walter D. Goldberger and Ira Z. Rothstein
Abstract: We present an Effective Field Theory (EFT) formalism which describes the dynamics of non-relativistic extended objects coupled to gravity. The formalism is relevant to understanding the gravitational radiation power spectra emitted by binary star systems, an important class of candidate signals for gravitational wave observatories such as LIGO or VIRGO. The EFT allows for a clean separation of the three relevant scales: r_s, the size of the compact objects, r the orbital radius and r/v, the wavelength of the physical radiation (where the velocity v is the expansion parameter). In the EFT radiation is systematically included in the v expansion without need to separate integrals into near zones and radiation zones. We show that the renormalization of ultraviolet divergences which arise at v^6 in post-Newtonian (PN) calculations requires the presence of two non-minimal worldline gravitational couplings linear in the Ricci curvature. However, these operators can be removed by a redefinition of the metric tensor, so that the divergences at arising at v^6 have no physically observable effect. Because in the EFT finite size features are encoded in the coefficients of non-minimal couplings, this implies a simple proof of the decoupling of internal structure for spinless objects to at least order v^6. Neglecting absorptive effects, we find that the power counting rules of the EFT indicate that the next set of short distance operators, which are quadratic in the curvature and are associated with tidal deformations, do not play a role until order v^10. These operators, which encapsulate finite size properties of the sources, have coefficients that can be fixed by a matching calculation. By including the most general set of such operators, the EFT allows one to work within a point particle theory to arbitrary orders in v.
