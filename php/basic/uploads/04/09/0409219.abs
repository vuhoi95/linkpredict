Title: Non-Relativistic Superbranes
Authors: Joaquim Gomis and Kiyoshi Kamimura and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: Subtleties arising in the non-relativistic limit of relativistic branes are resolved, and a reparametrization-invariant and kappa-symmetric non-relativistic super p-brane action is obtained as a limit of the action for a relativistic super p-brane in a Minkowski vacuum. We give explicit results for the D0-brane, which provides a realization of the super-Bargmann algebra, the IIA superstring and the 11-dimensional supermembrane.
