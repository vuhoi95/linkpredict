Title: On the stability of naked singularities
Authors: Gary W. Gibbons and Sean A. Hartnoll and Akihiro Ishibashi
Abstract: We study the linearised stability of the nakedly singular negative mass Schwarzschild solution against gravitational perturbations. There is a one parameter family of possible boundary conditions at the singularity. We give a precise criterion for stability depending on the boundary condition. We show that one particular boundary condition is physically preferred and show that the spacetime is stable with this boundary condition.
