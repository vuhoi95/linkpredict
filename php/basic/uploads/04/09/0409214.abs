Title: Interacting N-vector order parameters with O(N) symmetry
Authors: Andrea Pelissetto and Ettore Vicari
Abstract: We consider the critical behavior of the most general system of two N-vector order parameters that is O(N) invariant. We show that it may a have a multicritical transition with enlarged symmetry controlled by the chiral O(2)xO(N) fixed point. For N=2, 3, 4, if the system is also invariant under the exchange of the two order parameters and under independent parity transformations, one may observe a critical transition controlled by a fixed point belonging to the mn model. Also in this case there is a symmetry enlargement at the transition, the symmetry being [SO(N)+SO(N)]xC_2, where C_2 is the symmetry group of the square.
