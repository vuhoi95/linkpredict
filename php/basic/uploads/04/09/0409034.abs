Title: Quantum Polarization of D4-branes
Authors: Belkis Cabrera Palmer and Donald Marolf and Pedro J. Silva
Abstract: The low energy effective field theory of type II D4-branes coupled to bulk supergravity fields is used to investigate {\it quantum} effects for D4-branes in the D0 supergravity background. Classically, the D4-branes are unaffected by this background. However, quantum (one-loop) effects are argued to lead to an induced density of D0-brane charge; e.g., D0-multipole moments on the D4-brane. The effect is divergent in field theory, but is expected to be cut-off naturally by stringy corrections.
