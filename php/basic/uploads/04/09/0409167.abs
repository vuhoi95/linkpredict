Title: Quantum Gravity Scenario of Inflation based on the CMB Anisotropies
Authors: Ken-ji Hamada and Tetsuyuki Yukawa
Abstract: Inflationary scenario based on a renormalizable model of conformal gravity is proposed and primordial spectrum is derived. The sharp fall off of the angular power spectra at low multipoles in the COBE and WMAP observations are explained by a dynamical scale of quantum gravity. At this scale, the universe would make a sharp transition from the quantum spacetime with conformal invariance to the classical spacetime.
