Title: Fermions in the harmonic potential and string theory
Authors: Alexey Boyarsky and Vadim V. Cheianov and Oleg Ruchayskiy
Abstract: We explicitly derive collective field theory description for the system of fermions in the harmonic potential. This field theory appears to be a coupled system of free scalar and (modified) Liouville field. This theory should be considered as an exact bosonization of the system of non-relativistic fermions in the harmonic potential. Being surprisingly similar to the world-sheet formulation of c=1 string theory, this theory has quite different physical features and it is conjectured to give space-time description of the string theory, dual to the fermions in the harmonic potential. A vertex operator in this theory is shown to be a field theoretical representation of the local fermion operator, thus describing a D0 brane in the string language. Possible generalization of this result and its derivation for the case of c=1 string theory (fermions in the inverse harmonic potential) is discussed.
