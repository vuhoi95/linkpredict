Title: Supersymmetric Strings and Waves in D=3, N=2 Matter Coupled Gauged  Supergravities
Authors: N. S. Deger and O. Sarioglu
Abstract: We construct new 1/2 supersymmetric solutions in D=3, N=2, matter coupled, U(1) gauged supergravities and study some of their properties. In the most general case they represent a string superposed with gravitational and Chern-Simons electromagnetic waves. The waves are attached to the string and the solution satisfies an electromagnetic self-duality relation. When the sigma model is non-compact it interpolates between an asymptotically Kaigorodov space and a naked singularity. For the compact sigma model there is a regular horizon with the Kaigorodov geometry and asymptotically it is either Minkowskian or a pp-wave. When the sigma manifold is flat our solutions describe either AdS_3 or Kaigorodov space or a pp-wave in AdS_3.
