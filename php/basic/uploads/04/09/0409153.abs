Title: New Two-Dimensional Quantum Models Partially Solvable by  Supersymmetrical Approach
Authors: M. V. Ioffe and P. A. Valinevich
Abstract: New solutions for second-order intertwining relations in two-dimensional SUSY QM are found via the repeated use of the first order supersymmetrical transformations with intermediate constant unitary rotation. Potentials obtained by this method - two-dimensional generalized P\"oschl-Teller potentials - appear to be shape-invariant. The recently proposed method of $SUSY-$separation of variables is implemented to obtain a part of their spectra, including the ground state. Explicit expressions for energy eigenvalues and corresponding normalizable eigenfunctions are given in analytic form. Intertwining relations of higher orders are discussed.
