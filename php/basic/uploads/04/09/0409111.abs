Title: Connecting black holes and black strings
Authors: Hideaki Kudoh and Toby Wiseman
Abstract: Static vacuum spacetimes with one compact dimension include black holes with localised horizons but also uniform and non-uniform black strings where the horizon wraps over the compact dimension. We present new numerical solutions for these localised black holes in 5 and 6-dimensions. Combined with previous 6-d non-uniform string results, these provide evidence that the black hole and non-uniform string branches join at a topology changing solution.
