Title: Unification of Higgs and Maxwell fields in Brane-Kaluza-Klein gravity
Authors: S. Jalalzadeh and H. R. Sepangi
Abstract: The unification of Higgs and electromagnetic fields in the context of higher dimensional gravity is studied. We show that these fields arise from an extra large dimension together with a compact small dimension. The question of the localization of the gauge fields and their relation to junction conditions is also addressed.
