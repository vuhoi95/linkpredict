Title: Chiral Symmetry Breaking in Presence of Strong Quantizing Magnetic  Fields- A Nambu-Jona-Lasino Model with Semi-Classical Approximation
Authors: Sutapa Ghosh and Soma Mandal and Somenath Chakrabarty
Abstract: The breaking of chiral symmetry of light quarks at zero temperature in presence of strong quantizing magnetic field is studied using Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model with Thomas-Fermi type semi-classical formalism. It is found that the dynamically generated light quark mass can never become zero if the Landau levels are populated and increases with the increase of magnetic field strength.
