Title: Entanglement entropy in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model
Authors: J. I. Latorre and R. Orus and E. Rico and J. Vidal
Abstract: We analyze the entanglement entropy in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, which describes mutually interacting spins half embedded in a magnetic field. This entropy displays a singularity at the critical point that we study as a function of the interaction anisotropy, the magnetic field, and the system size. Results emerging from our analysis are surprisingly similar to those found for the one-dimensional XY chain.
