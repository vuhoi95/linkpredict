Title: M theory and Singularities of Exceptional Holonomy Manifolds
Authors: Bobby S. Acharya and Sergei Gukov
Abstract: M theory compactifications on G_2 holonomy manifolds, whilst supersymmetric, require singularities in order to obtain non-Abelian gauge groups, chiral fermions and other properties necessary for a realistic model of particle physics. We review recent progress in understanding the physics of such singularities. Our main aim is to describe the techniques which have been used to develop our understanding of M theory physics near these singularities. In parallel, we also describe similar sorts of singularities in Spin(7) holonomy manifolds which correspond to the properties of three dimensional field theories. As an application, we review how various aspects of strongly coupled gauge theories, such as confinement, mass gap and non-perturbative phase transitions may be given a simple explanation in M theory.
