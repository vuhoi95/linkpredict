Title: Six-Quark Amplitudes from Fermionic MHV Vertices
Authors: Xun Su and Jun-Bao Wu
Abstract: The fermionic extension of the CSW approach to perturbative gauge theory coupled with fermions is used to compute the six-quark QCD amplitudes. We find complete agreement with the results obtained by using the usual Feynman rules.
