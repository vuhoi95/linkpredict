Authors: W. B. Belayev and D. Yu. Tsipenyuk
Abstract: In Klein geometric model of space the mass is manifestation of the quantized charges oscillations in additional compactified dimension. We analyze model in which common in four-dimensional space-time for mass and electric charge of the particle trajectory is disintegrated in five dimensions on movement of the mass along null geodesic line and trajectory of the charge corresponding to the time-like interval in 5D volume. We find relation between five-velocity vector of electric charge and mass. This scheme is regarded to have concern with many worlds theory. Considered approach is applied to the model of rotating space having four-dimensional spherical symmetry. One proposed appearance additional force in included 4D space-time, which may be explanation of the Pioneer-effect. We analyze also possible part of this force in conservation of the substance in Galaxy area.
