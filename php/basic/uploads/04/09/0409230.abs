Title: Fuzzy Supersphere and Supermonopole
Authors: Kazuki Hasebe and Yusuke Kimura
Abstract: It is well-known that coordinates of a charged particle in a monopole background become noncommutative. In this paper, we study the motion of a charged particle moving on a supersphere in the presence of a supermonopole. We construct a supermonopole by using a supersymmetric extension of the first Hopf map. We investigate algebras of angular momentum operators and supersymmetry generators. It is shown that coordinates of the particle are described by fuzzy supersphere in the lowest Landau level. We find that there exist two kinds of degenerate wavefunctions due to the supersymmetry. Ground state wavefunctions are given by the Hopf spinor and we discuss their several properties.
