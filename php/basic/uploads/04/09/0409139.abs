Title: Exact Supersymmetric Solution of Schrodinger Equation for central  confining Potentials by using the Nikiforov-Uvarov Method
Authors: Metin Aktas and Ramazan Sever
Abstract: We present the exact supersymmetric solution of Schrodinger equation with the Morse, Poschl-Teller and Hulthen potentials by using the Nikiforov-Uvarov method. Eigenfunctions and corresponding energy eigenvalues are calculated for the first six excited states. Results are in good agreement with the ones obtained before.
