Title: On the Stratified Classical Configuration Space of Lattice QCD
Authors: S. Charzy≈Ñski and J. Kijowski and G. Rudolph and M. Schmidt
Abstract: The stratified structure of the configuration space $\mb G^N = G \times ... \times G$ reduced with respect to the action of $G$ by inner automorphisms is investigated for $G = SU(3) .$ This is a finite dimensional model coming from lattice QCD. First, the stratification is characterized algebraically, for arbitrary $N$. Next, the full algebra of invariants is discussed for the cases $N = 1$ and $N =2 .$ Finally, for $N = 1$ and $N =2 ,$ the stratified structure is investigated in some detail, both in terms of invariants and relations and in more geometric terms. Moreover, the strata are characterized explicitly using local cross sections.
