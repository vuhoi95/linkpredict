Title: Is brane cosmology predictable?
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: The creation of the inflationary brane universe in 5d bulk Einstein and Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity is considered. We demonstrate that emerging universe is ambigious due to arbitrary function dependence of the junction conditions (or freedom in the choice of boundary terms). We argue that some fundamental physical principle (which may be related with AdS/CFT correspondence) is necessary in order to fix the 4d geometry in unique way.
