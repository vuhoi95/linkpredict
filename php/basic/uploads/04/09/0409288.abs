Title: Double Scaling String Theory of QCD in Two Dimensions
Authors: L. Griguolo and D. Seminara and R. J. Szabo
Abstract: We describe a novel double scaling limit of large N Yang-Mills theory on a two-dimensional torus and its relation to the geometry of the principal moduli spaces of holomorphic differentials.
