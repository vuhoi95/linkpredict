Title: Contemplations on Dirac's equation in quaternionic coordinates
Authors: Dirk Schuricht and Martin Greiter
Abstract: A formulation of Dirac's equation using complex-quaternionic coordinates appears to yield an enormous gain in formal elegance, as there is no longer any need to invoke Dirac matrices. This formulation, however, entails several peculiarities, which we investigate and attempt to interpret.
