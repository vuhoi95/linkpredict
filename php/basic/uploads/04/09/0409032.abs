Title: Supersymmetric Standard Models, Flux Compactification and Moduli  Stabilization
Authors: Mirjam Cvetic and Tao Liu
Abstract: Based on the T-dual constructions of supersymmetric intersecting D6-models on Z_2 x Z_2 orientifolds, whose electroweak sector is parallel with the orientifold planes with Sp(2f)_L x Sp(2f)_R gauge symmetry (hep-th/0407178), we derive and classify Standard Model-like vacua with RR and NSNS fluxes, which stabilize toroidal complex structure moduli and the dilaton. We find consistent four-family (f=4) and two-family (f=2) models with one- and two-units of the quantized flux, respectively. Such models typically possess additional gauge group factors with negative beta functions and may lead, via gaugino condensation, to stabilization of toroidal Kahler moduli. These models have chiral exotics.
