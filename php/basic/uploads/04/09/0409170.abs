Title: Supersymmetry and homogeneity of M-theory backgrounds
Authors: Jos√© Figueroa-O'Farrill and Patrick Meessen and Simon Philip
Abstract: We describe the construction of a Lie superalgebra associated to an arbitrary supersymmetric M-theory background, and discuss some examples. We prove that for backgrounds with more than 24 supercharges, the bosonic subalgebra acts locally transitively. In particular, we prove that backgrounds with more than 24 supersymmetries are necessarily (locally) homogeneous.
