Title: Superconformal Symmetry, The Supercurrent And Non-BPS Brane Dynamics
Authors: T. E. Clark and Muneto Nitta and T. ter Veldhuis
Abstract: The Noether currents associated with the non-linearly realized super-Poincare' symmetries of the Green-Schwarz (Nambu-Goto-Akulov-Volkov) action for a non-BPS p=2 brane embedded in a N=1, D=4 target superspace are constructed. The R symmetry current, the supersymmetry currents, the energy-momentum tensor and the scalar central charge current are shown to be components of a world volume supercurrent. The centrally extended superconformal transformations are realized on the Nambu-Goldstone boson and fermion fields of the non-BPS brane. The superconformal currents form supersymmetry multiplets with the world volume conformal central charge current and special conformal current being the primary components of the supersymmetry multiplets containing all the currents. Correspondingly the superconformal symmetry breaking terms form supersymmetry multiplets the components of which are obtainable as supersymmetry transformations of the primary currents' symmetry breaking terms.
