Title: Some Conjectures on the Limit of Infinite Higgs Mass
Authors: Ruggero Ferrari and Marco Picariello and Andrea Quadri
Abstract: We consider a possible field theory candidate for the electroweak SU(2) x U(1) model where the limit of infinitely sharp Higgs potential is performed. We show that it is possible to formulate such a limit as a Stueckelberg massive non abelian gauge theory.
