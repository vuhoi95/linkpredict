Title: Conformal symmetry of brane world effective actions
Authors: Paul L. McFadden and Neil Turok
Abstract: A simple derivation of the low-energy effective action for brane worlds is given, highlighting the role of conformal invariance. We show how to improve the effective action for a positive- and negative-tension brane pair using the AdS/CFT correspondence.
