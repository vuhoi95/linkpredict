Title: On extra forces from large extra dimensions
Authors: S. Jalalzadeh and B. Vakili and H. R. Sepangi
Abstract: The motion of a classical test particle moving on a 4-dimensional brane embedded in an $n$-dimensional bulk is studied in which the brane is allowed to fluctuate along the extra dimensions. It is shown that these fluctuations produce three different forces acting on the particle, all stemming from the effects of extra dimensions. Interpretations are then offered to describe the origin of these forces and a relationship between the 4 and $n$-dimensional mass of the particle is obtained by introducing charges associated with large extra dimensions.
