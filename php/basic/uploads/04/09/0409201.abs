Title: On quantum symmetries of the non--ADE graph F4
Authors: Robert Coquereaux and Esteban Isasi
Abstract: We describe quantum symmetries associated with the F4 Dynkin diagram. Our study stems from an analysis of the (Ocneanu) modular splitting equation applied to a partition function which is invariant under a particular congruence subgroup of the modular group.
