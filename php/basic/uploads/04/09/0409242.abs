Title: Stability in Asymptotically AdS Spaces
Authors: M. Kleban and M. Porrati and R. Rabadan
Abstract: We discuss two types of instabilities which may arise in string theory compactified to asymptotically AdS spaces: perturbative, due to discrete modes in the spectrum of the Laplacian, and non-perturbative, due to brane nucleation. In the case of three dimensional Einstein manifolds, we completely characterize the presence of these instabilities, and in higher dimensions we provide a partial classification. The analysis may be viewed as an extension of the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound. One interesting result is that, apart from a very special class of exceptions, all Euclidean asymptotically AdS spaces with more than one conformal boundary component are unstable, if the compactification admits BPS branes or scalars saturating the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound. As examples, we analyze quotients of AdS in any dimension and AdS Taub-NUT spaces, and show a space which was previously discussed in the context of AdS/CFT is unstable both perturbatively and non-perturbatively.
