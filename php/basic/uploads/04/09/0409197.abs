Title: Localized gravity in non-compact superstring models
Authors: Emmanuel Kohlprath and Pierre Vanhove
Abstract: We discuss a string-theory-derived mechanism for localized gravity, which produces a deviation from Newton's law of gravitation at cosmological distances. This mechanism can be realized for general non-compact Calabi-Yau manifolds, orbifolds and orientifolds. After discussing the cross-over scale and the thickness in these models we show that the localized higher derivative terms can be safely neglected at observable distances. We conclude by some observations on the massless open string spectrum for the orientifold models.
