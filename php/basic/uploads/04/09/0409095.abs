Title: Structure functions of the 2d O(n) non-linear sigma models
Authors: Janos Balog and Peter Weisz
Abstract: We investigate structure functions in the 2-dimensional (asymptotically free) non-linear O(n) sigma-models using the non-perturbative S-matrix bootstrap program. In particular the exact small (Bjorken) x behavior is derived. Structure functions in the special case of the n=3 model are accurately computed over the whole x range for $-q^2/M^2<10^5$, and some moments are compared with results from renormalized perturbation theory. Some results concerning the structure functions in the 1/n approximation are also presented.
