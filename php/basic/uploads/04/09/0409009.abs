Title: A three-loop test of the dilatation operator in N=4 SYM
Authors: B. Eden and C. Jarczak and E. Sokatchev
Abstract: We compute the three-loop anomalous dimension of the BMN operators with charges J=0 (the Konishi multiplet) and J=1 in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory. We employ a method which effectively reduces the calculation to two loops. Instead of using the superconformal primary states, we consider the ratio of the two-point functions of suitable descendants of the corresponding multiplets. Our results unambiguously select the form of the N=4 SYM dilatation operator which is compatible with BMN scaling. Thus, we provide evidence for BMN scaling at three loops.
