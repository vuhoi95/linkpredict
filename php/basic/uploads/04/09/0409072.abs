Title: Multiple universes, cosmic coincidences, and other dark matters
Authors: Anthony Aguirre and Max Tegmark
Abstract: Even when completely and consistently formulated, a fundamental theory of physics and cosmological boundary conditions may not give unambiguous and unique predictions for the universe we observe; indeed inflation, string/M theory, and quantum cosmology all arguably suggest that we can observe only one member of an ensemble with diverse properties. How, then, can such theories be tested? It has been variously asserted that in a future measurement we should observe the a priori most probable set of predicted properties (the ``bottom-up'' approach), or the most probable set compatible with all current observations (the ``top-down'' approach), or the most probable set consistent with the existence of observers (the ``anthropic'' approach). These inhabit a spectrum of levels of conditionalization and can lead to qualitatively different predictions. For example, in a context in which the densities of various species of dark matter vary among members of an ensemble of otherwise similar regions, from the top-down or anthropic viewpoints -- but not the bottom-up -- it would be natural for us to observe multiple types of dark matter with similar contributions to the observed dark matter density. In the anthropic approach it is also possible in principle to strengthen this argument and the limit the number of likely dark matter sub-components. In both cases the argument may be extendible to dark energy or primordial density perturbations. This implies that the anthropic approach to cosmology, introduced in part to explain "coincidences" between unrelated constituents of our universe, predicts that more, as-yet-unobserved coincidences should come to light.
