Title: Can the string scale be related to the cosmic baryon asymmetry?
Authors: Stephon H. S. Alexander and S. James Gates Jr
Abstract: In a previous work, a mechanism was presented by which baryon asymmetry can be generated during inflation from elliptically polarized gravitons. Nonetheless, the mechanism only generated a realistic baryon asymmetry under special circumstances which requires an enhancement of the lepton number from an unspecified GUT. In this note we provide a stringy embedding of this mechanism through the Green-Schwarz mechanism, demonstrating that if the model-independent axion is the source of the gravitational waves responsible for the lepton asymmetry, one can observationally constrain the string scale and coupling.
