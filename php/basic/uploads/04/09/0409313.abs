Title: Holgraphy and BMS field theory
Authors: Giovanni Arcioni and Claudio Dappiaggi
Abstract: We study the key ingredients of a candidate holographic correspondence in an asymptotically flat spacetimes; in particular we develop the kinematical and the classical dynamical data of a BMS invariant field theory living at null infinity.
