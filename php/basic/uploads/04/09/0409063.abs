Abstract: We address the problem of finding star algebra projectors that exhibit localized time profiles. We use the double Wick rotation method, starting from an Euclidean (unconventional) lump solution, which is characterized by the Neumann matrix being the conventional one for the continuous spectrum, while the inverse of the conventional one for the discrete spectrum. This is still a solution of the projector equation and we show that, after inverse Wick-rotation, its time profile has the desired localized time dependence. We study it in detail in the low energy regime (field theory limit) and in the extreme high energy regime (tensionless limit) and show its similarities with the rolling tachyon solution.
