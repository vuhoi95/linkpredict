Title: Virasoro Symmetry in a 2h-dimensional Model and Its Implications
Authors: P. Furlan and V. B. Petkova
Abstract: The set of two partial differential equations for the Appell hypergeometric function in two variables F_4(a,b,c,a+b-c+2-h,x,y) is shown to arise as a null vector decoupling relation in a 2h-dimensional generalisation of the Coulomb gas model. It corresponds to a level two singular vector of an intrinsic Virasoro algebra.
