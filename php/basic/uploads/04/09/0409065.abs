Title: Gravitating Yang-Mills dyon vortices in 4+1 spacetime dimensions
Authors: Yves Brihaye and Eugen Radu
Abstract: We consider vortex-type solutions in $d=5$ dimensions of the Einstein gravity coupled to a nonabelian SU(2) field posessing a nonzero electric part. After the dimensional reduction, this corresponds to a $d=4$ Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs-U(1)-dilaton model. A general axially symmetric ansatz is presented, and the properties of the spherically symmetric solutions are analysed.
