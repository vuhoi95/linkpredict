Title: Planckian scattering effects and black hole production in low $M_{Pl}$  scenarios
Authors: Kyungsik Kang and Horatiu Nastase
Abstract: We reanalyze the question of black hole creation in high energy scattering via shockwave collisions. We find that string corrections tend to increase the scattering cross-section. We analyze corrections in a more physical setting, of Randall-Sundrum type and of higher dimensionality. We also analyze the scattering inside AdS backgrounds.
