Abstract: We present preliminary simulation results for QED in a non-commutative 4d space-time, which is discretized to a fuzzy lattice. Its numerical treatment becomes feasible after its mapping onto a dimensionally reduced twisted Eguchi-Kawai matrix model. In this formulation we investigate the Wilson loops and in particular the Creutz ratios. This is an ongoing project which aims at non-perturbative predictions for the photon, which can be confronted with phenomenology in order to verify the possible existence of non-commutativity in nature.
