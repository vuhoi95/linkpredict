Title: The special nontopological scalar solitons in anti de Sitter spacetimes
Authors: Hongbo Cheng and Zhengyan Gu
Abstract: In this letter the nontopological scalar solitons are investigated in an anti de Sitter spacetime. We find analytically that the solitons obeying the necessary conditions $m=\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}|\Lambda|^{{1/2}}$ or $m=\sqrt{\frac{2(n+3)(2n+3)}{3}}|\Lambda|^{{1/2}}$ can exist in the background by means of the series expansion.
