Title: Gravitational Forces on the Branes
Authors: R. Arnowitt and J. Dent
Abstract: We examine the gravitational forces in a brane-world scenario felt by point particles on two 3-branes bounding a 5-dimensional AdS space with $S^{1}/Z_2$ symmetry. The particles are treated as perturbations on the vacuum metric and coordinate conditions are chosen so that no brane bending effects occur. We make an ADM type decomposition of the metric tensor and solve Einstein's equations to linear order in the static limit. While no stabilization mechanism is assumed, all the 5D Einstein equations are solved and are seen to have a consistent solution. We find that Newton's law is reproduced on the Planck brane at the origin while particles on the TeV brane a distance $y_2$ from the origin experience an attractive force that has a growing exponential dependence on the brane position.
