Title: E10 Orbifolds
Authors: Jeffrey Brown and Surya Ganguli and Ori J. Ganor and Craig Helfgott
Abstract: We study Z2 orbifolds of M-theory in terms of E10. We find a simple relation between the Z2 action on E10 and the imaginary root that corresponds [hep-th/0401053] to the "twisted sector" branes. We discuss the connection between the Kac-Moody algebra DE10 and the "untwisted" sector, and we demonstrate how DE18 can describe both the untwisted and twisted sectors simultaneously.
