Title: D-Terms, Unification, and the Higgs Mass
Authors: Alexander Maloney and Aaron Pierce and Jay G. Wacker
Abstract: We study gauge extensions of the MSSM that contain non-decoupling D-terms, which contribute to the Higgs boson mass. These models naturally maintain gauge coupling unification and raise the Higgs mass without fine-tuning. Unification constrains the structure of the gauge extensions, limiting the Higgs mass in these models to roughly less than 150 GeV. The D-terms contribute to the Higgs mass only if the extended gauge symmetry is broken at energies of a few TeV, leading to new heavy gauge bosons in this mass range.
