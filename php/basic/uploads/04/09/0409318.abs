Title: Free Energy and Phase Transition of the Matrix Model on a Plane-Wave
Authors: Shirin Hadizadeh and Bojan Ramadanovic and Gordon W. Semenoff and Donovan Young
Abstract: It has recently been observed that the weakly coupled plane wave matrix model has a density of states which grows exponentially at high energy. This implies that the model has a phase transition. The transition appears to be of first order. However, its exact nature is sensitive to interactions. In this paper, we analyze the effect of interactions by computing the relevant parts of the effective potential for the Polyakov loop operator in the finite temperature plane-wave matrix model to three loop order. We show that the phase transition is indeed of first order. We also compute the correction to the Hagedorn temperature to order two loops.
