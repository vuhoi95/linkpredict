Abstract: We review recent results on solitons in supersymmetric (SUSY) non-Abelian gauge theories, focusing on our papers: hep-th/0405194, hep-th/0405129, and hep-th/0404198. We construct the BPS multi-wall solutions in supersymmetric U(N_C) gauge theories in five dimensions with N_F(>N_C) hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation. Exact solutions are obtained with full generic moduli for infinite gauge coupling. Total moduli space of the BPS non-Abelian walls is found to be the complex Grassmann manifold SU(N_F) / [SU(N_C)\times SU(N_F-N_C) \times U(1)]. A 1/4 BPS equation is also studied which gives combinations of vortices, walls and monopoles. The full moduli space of the 1/4 BPS equation is found to be the space of all holomorphic maps from a complex plane to the wall moduli space. Exact solutions of the 1/4 BPS equation are also obtained for infinite gauge coupling.
