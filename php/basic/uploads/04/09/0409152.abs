Title: Non-BPS walls and their stability in 5d SUSY theory
Authors: Minoru Eto and Nobuhito Maru and Norisuke Sakai
Abstract: We review recent work (hep-th/0404114) on non-BPS domain walls in $5d$ SUSY theory. An exact solution of non-BPS multi-walls is found in supersymmetric massive T*(CP1) model in five dimensions. The non-BPS multi-wall solution is found to have no tachyon. The N=1 supersymmetry preserved on the four-dimensional world volume of one wall is broken by the coexistence of the other wall. The supersymmetry breaking is exponentially suppressed as the distance between the walls increases.
