Title: N=2 SuperTime Dependent Oscillator and spontaneous Breaking of  Supersymmetry
Authors: V. P. Akulov and Sultan Catto and \fbox{A. I. Pashnev} and Dubna
Abstract: Using the nonlinear realizations of the N=2 superVirasoro group we construct the action of the N=2 Superconformal Quantum Mechanics(SCQM) with additional harmonic potential.We show that SU(1,1|1) invariance group of this action is nontrivially embedded in the N=2 Super Virasoro group.The generalization for the (super)time dependent oscillator is constructed.In a particular case when the oscillator frequency depends on the proper-time anticommuting coordinates the unusual effect of spontaneous breaking of the supersymmetry takes place: the Masses of bosons and fermions can have different nonzero values.
