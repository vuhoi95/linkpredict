Title: On mysteriously missing T-duals, H-flux and the T-duality group
Authors: Varghese Mathai and Jonathan Rosenberg
Abstract: A general formula for the topology and H-flux of the T-duals of type II string theories with H-flux on toroidal compactifications is presented here. It is known that toroidal compactifications with H-flux do not necessarily have T-duals which are themselves toroidal compactifications. A big puzzle has been to explain these mysterious ``missing T-duals'', and our paper presents a solution to this problem using noncommutative topology. We also analyze the T-duality group and its action, and illustrate these concepts with examples.
