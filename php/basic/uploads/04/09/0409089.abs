Title: Linear Regge trajectories from worldsheet lattice parton field theory
Authors: Tirthabir Biswas and Marc Grisaru and Warren Siegel
Abstract: We show that unlike conventional field theory, the particle field theory of the string's constituents produces in the ladder approximation linear Regge trajectories, in accord with its string theory dual. In this theory propagators are Gaussian and this feature facilitates the perturbative evaluation of scattering amplitudes. We develop general techniques for studying their general asymptotic form. We consider radiative corrections to the ladder Regge trajectory and discover that linearity is lost; however, this may be due to certain approximations we have made.
