Title: A Dynamical Interpretation of Connes' Unimodularity Condition in  Standard Model and Majorana Neutrino
Authors: Katsusada Morita and Yoshitaka Okumura
Abstract: Standard model is minimally extended using the unitary group $G'=U(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)$ of Connes' color-flavor algebra. In place of Connes' unimodularity condition an extra Higgs is assumed to spontaneously break $G'$ down to standard model gauge group. It is shown that the theory becomes anomaly-free only if right-handed neutrino is present in each generation. It is also shown that the extra Higgs gives rise to large Majorana mass of right-handed neutrino and the model contains new vectorial neutral current.
