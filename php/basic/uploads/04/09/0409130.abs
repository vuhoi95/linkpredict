Title: Second-Order Corrections to the Power Spectrum in the Slow-Roll  Expansion with a Time-Dependent Sound Speed
Authors: Hao Wei and Rong-Gen Cai and Anzhong Wang
Abstract: We extend Green's function method developed by Stewart and Gong to calculate the power spectrum of density perturbation in the case with a time-dependent sound speed, and explicitly give the power spectrum and spectral index up to second-order corrections in the slow-roll expansion. The case of tachyon inflation is included as a special case.
