Title: Duality Mechanism by Introduction of Gauge Condensates
Authors: M. A. L. Capri and V. E. R. Lemes
Abstract: In this work, we study the implications of the existence of a gauge condensate to the mechanism of duality, a method based on the existence of these condensates is presented and applied to the study of the dual equivalence between self-dual (SD) and topologically massive Yang-Mills (TMYM) models.
