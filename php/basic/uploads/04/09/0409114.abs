Title: Finite Temperature Gauge Theory from the Transverse Lattice
Authors: S. Dalley and B. van de Sande
Abstract: Numerical computations are performed and analytic bounds are obtained on the excited spectrum of glueballs in SU(infinity) gauge theory, by transverse lattice Hamiltonian methods. We find an exponential growth of the density of states, implying a finite critical (Hagedorn) temperature. It is argued that the Nambu-Goto string model lies in a different universality class.
