Title: Consistent modified gravity: dark energy, acceleration and the absence  of cosmic doomsday
Authors: M. C. B. Abdalla and Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: We discuss the modified gravity which includes negative and positive powers of the curvature and which provides the gravitational dark energy. It is shown that in GR plus the term containing negative power of the curvature the cosmic speed-up may be achieved, while the effective phantom phase (with $w$ less than -1) follows when such term contains the fractional positive power of the curvature. The minimal coupling with matter makes the situation more interesting: even 1/R theory coupled with the usual ideal fliud may describe the (effective phantom) dark energy. The account of $R^2$ term (consistent modified gravity) may help to escape of cosmic doomsday.
