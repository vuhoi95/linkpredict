Title: Topcolor breaking through boundary conditions
Authors: Michio Hashimoto and Deog Ki Hong
Abstract: The nontrivial boundary conditions (BC's) for the Topcolor breaking are investigated in the context of the TeV-scale extra dimension scenario. In the gauge symmetry breaking mechanism via the BC's we do not need to incorporate a dynamical mechanism for the Topcolor breaking into the model. Moreover, the Topcolor breaking can be realized without introducing explicitly a (composite) scalar field. We present a six dimensional model where the top and bottom quarks in the bulk have the Topcolor charge while the other quarks in the bulk do not. We also put the electroweak gauge interaction in the six dimensional bulk. The bottom quark condensation is naturally suppressed owing to the power-like running of the bulk U(1)_Y interaction, so that only the top condensation is expected to take place. We explore such a possibility based on the ladder Schwinger-Dyson equation and show the cutoff to make the model viable.
