Title: Impurity Non-Preserving 3-Point Correlators of BMN Operators from  PP-Wave Holography I : Bosonic Excitations
Authors: S. Dobashi and T. Yoneya
Abstract: As a continuation of our previous works studying the holographic principle in the plane-wave limit, we discuss the 3-point correlation functions of BMN operators with bosonic excitations when impurities are not conserved. We show that our proposal for a holographic mapping between the conformal OPE coefficients of super Yang-Mills theory and the 3-point vertex of the holographic string field theory is valid to the leading order in the large $\mu$ limit. Our results provide for the first time a direct holographic relation for the 3-point correlators of BMN operators including impurity non-preserving processes.
