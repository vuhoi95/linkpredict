Title: A new approach to the analysis of a noncommutative Chern-Simons theory
Authors: Pradip Mukherjee and Anirban Saha
Abstract: A novel approach to the analysis of a noncommutative Chern--Simons gauge theory with matter coupled in the adjoint representation has been discussed. The analysis is based on a recently proposed closed form Seiberg--Witten map which is exact in the noncommutative parameter.
