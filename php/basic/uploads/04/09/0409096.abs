Title: New concept of relativistic invariance in NC space-time: twisted  Poincaré symmetry and its implications
Authors: M. Chaichian and P. Prešnajder and A. Tureanu
Abstract: We present a systematic framework for noncommutative (NC) QFT within the new concept of relativistic invariance based on the notion of twisted Poincar\'e symmetry (with all 10 generators), as proposed in ref. [7]. This allows to formulate and investigate all fundamental issues of relativistic QFT and offers a firm frame for the classification of particles according to the representation theory of the twisted Poincar\'e symmetry and as a result for the NC versions of CPT and spin-statistics theorems, among others, discussed earlier in the literature. As a further application of this new concept of relativism we prove the NC analog of Haag's theorem.
