Title: On uniqueness of charged Kerr-AdS black holes in five dimensions
Authors: Owen Madden and Simon F. Ross
Abstract: We show that the solutions describing charged rotating black holes in five-dimensional gauged supergravities found recently by Cvetic, Lu and Pope [hep-th/0406196,hep-th/0407058] are completely specified by the mass, charges and angular momentum. The additional parameter appearing in these solutions is removed by a coordinate transformation and redefinition of parameters. Thus, the apparent hair in these solutions is unphysical.
