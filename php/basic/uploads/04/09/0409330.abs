Title: Inflation model building in moduli space
Authors: Kenji Kadota and Ewan D. Stewart
Abstract: A self-consistent modular cosmology scenario and its testability in view of future CMB experiments are discussed. Particular attention is drawn to the enhanced symmetric points in moduli space which play crucial roles in our scenario. The running and moreover the running of running for the cosmic perturbation spectrum are also analyzed.
