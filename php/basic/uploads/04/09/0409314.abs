Title: Stability and Thermodynamics of AdS Black Holes with Scalar Hair
Authors: Thomas Hertog and Kengo Maeda
Abstract: Recently a class of static spherical black hole solutions with scalar hair was found in four and five dimensional gauged supergravity with modified, but AdS invariant boundary conditions. These black holes are fully specified by a single conserved charge, namely their mass, which acquires a contribution from the scalar field. Here we report on a more detailed study of some of the properties of these solutions. A thermodynamic analysis shows that in the canonical ensemble the standard Schwarzschild-AdS black hole is stable against decay into a hairy black hole. We also study the stability of the hairy black holes and find there always exists an unstable radial fluctuation, in both four and five dimensions. We argue, however, that Schwarzschild-AdS is probably not the endstate of evolution under this instability.
