Title: Energy from the Bulk through Parametric Resonance
Authors: F. K. Diakonos and E. N. Saridakis and N. Tetradis
Abstract: We demonstrate that energy can be transferred very rapidly from the bulk to the brane through parametric resonance. In a simple realization, we consider a massless bulk field that interacts only with fields localized on the brane. We assume an initial field configuration that has the form of a wave-packet moving towards the brane. During the reflection of the wave-packet by the brane the localized fields can be excited through parametric resonance. The mechanism is also applicable to bulk fields with a potential. The rapid energy transfer can have important cosmological and astrophysical implications.
