Authors: M. C. Abdalla and A. L. Gadelha and Daniel L. Nedel
Abstract: In this letter, an entropy operator for the general unitary SU(1,1) TFD formulation is proposed and used to lead a bosonic system from zero to finite temperature. Namely, considering the closed bosonic string as the target system, the entropy operator is used to construct the thermal vacuum. The behaviour of such a state under the breve conjugation rules is analized and it was shown that the breve conjugation does not affect thermal effects. From this thermal vacuum the thermal energy, the entropy and the free energy of the closed bosonic string are calculated and the apropriated thermal distribution for the system is found after the free energy minimization.
