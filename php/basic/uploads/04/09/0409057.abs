Title: Gauge fixing in Causal Dynamical Triangulations
Authors: Fotini Markopoulou and Lee Smolin
Abstract: We relax the definition of the Ambjorn-Loll causal dynamical triangulation model in 1+1 dimensions to allow for a varying lapse. We show that, as long as the spatially averaged lapse is constant in time, the physical observables are unchanged in the continuum limit. This supports the claim that the time slicing of the model is the result of a gauge fixing, rather than a physical preferred time slicing.
