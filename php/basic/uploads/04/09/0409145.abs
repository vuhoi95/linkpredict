Abstract: Motivated by black hole experiments as a consequence of the TeV-scale gravity arising from modern brane-world scenarios, we study the absorption problem for the massive scalars when the spacetime background is a $(4+n)$-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole. For analytic computation we adopt the near-extreme condition in the spacetime background. It is shown that the low-energy absorption cross section for the s-wave case holds an universality, {\it i.e.} the absorption cross section equals to the area of the black hole horizon divided by a velocity parameter.
