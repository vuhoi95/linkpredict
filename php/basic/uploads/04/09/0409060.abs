Title: Supersymmetric U(N) Gauge Model and Partial Breaking of N=2  Supersymmetry
Authors: Kazuhito Fujiwara and Hiroshi Itoyama and Makoto Sakaguchi
Abstract: Guided by the gauging of U(N) isometry associated with the special Kahler geometry, and the discrete R symmetry, we construct the N=2 supersymmetric action of a U(N) invariant nonabelian gauge model in which rigid N=2 supersymmetry is spontaneously broken to N=1. This generalizes the abelian model considered by Antoniadis, Partouche and Taylor. We shed light on complexity of the supercurrents of our model associated with a broken N=2 supermultiplet of currents, and discuss the spontaneously broken supersymmetry as an approximate fermionic shift symmetry.
