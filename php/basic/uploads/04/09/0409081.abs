Title: Path Integral Approach to Residual Gauge Fixing
Authors: Ashok Das and J. Frenkel and Silvana Perez
Abstract: In this paper we study the question of residual gauge fixing in the path integral approach for a general class of axial-type gauges including the light-cone gauge. We show that the two cases -- axial-type gauges and the light-cone gauge -- lead to very different structures for the explicit forms of the propagator. In the case of the axial-type gauges, fixing the residual symmetry determines the propagator of the theory completely. On the other hand, in the light-cone gauge there is still a prescription dependence even after fixing the residual gauge symmetry, which is related to the existence of an underlying global symmetry.
