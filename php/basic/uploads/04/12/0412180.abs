Title: Conformal entropy for generalised gravity theories as a consequence of  horizon properties
Authors: M. Cvitan and S. Pallua
Abstract: We show that microscopic entropy formula based on Virasoro algebra follows from properties of stationary Killing horizons for Lagrangians with arbitrary dependence on Riemann tensor. The properties used are consequence of regularity of invariants of Riemann tensor on the horizon. Eventual generalisation of these results to Lagrangians with derivatives of Riemann tensor, as suggested by an example treated in the paper, relies on assuming regularity of invariants involving derivatives of Riemann tensor. This assumption however leads also to new interesting restrictions on metric functions near horizon.
