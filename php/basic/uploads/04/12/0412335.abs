Title: Conformal Partial Wave Expansions for N=4 Chiral Four Point Functions
Authors: F. A. Dolan and H. Osborn
Abstract: The conformal partial wave analysis of four point functions of half BPS operators belonging to the SU(4) [0,p,0] representation is undertaken for p=2,3,4. Using the results of N=4 superconformal Ward identities the contributions from protected short and semi-short multiplets are identified in terms of the free field theory. In the large N limit contributions corresponding to long multiplets with twist up to 2p-2 are absent. The anomalous dimensions for twist two singlet multiplets are found to order g^4 and agree with other perturbative calculations. Results for twist four and six are also found.
