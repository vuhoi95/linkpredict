Title: Quasi exactly solvable quantum lattice solitons
Authors: Y. Brihaye and N. Debergh and A. Nininahazwe
Abstract: We extend the exactly solvable Hamiltonian describing $f$ quantum oscillators considered recently by J. Dorignac et al. by means of a new interaction which we choose as quasi exactly solvable. The properties of the spectrum of this new Hamiltonian are studied as function of the new coupling constant. This Hamiltonian as well as the original one are also related to adequate Lie structures.
