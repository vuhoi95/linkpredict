Abstract: Supersymmetric U(Nc) gauge theory with Nf massive hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation is given by the brane configuration made of Nc fractional Dp-branes stuck at the Z_2 orbifold singularity on Nf separated D(p+4)-branes. We show that non-Abelian walls in this theory are realized as kinky fractional Dp-branes interpolating between D(p+4)-branes. Wall solutions and their duality between Nc and Nf - Nc imply extensions of the s-rule and the Hanany-Witten effect in brane dynamics. We also find that the reconnection of fractional D-branes occurs in this system. Diverse phenomena in non-Abelian walls found in field theory can be understood very easily by this brane configuration.
