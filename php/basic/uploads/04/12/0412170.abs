Title: Separation of Spontaneous Chiral Symmetry Breaking and Confinement via  AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: Dongsu Bak and Ho-Ung Yee
Abstract: We analyze, in the framework of AdS/CFT correspondence, the gauge theory phase structure that are supposed to be dual to the recently found non-supersymmetric dilatonic deformations to AdS_5 X S^5 in type IIB string theory. Analyzing the probe D7-brane dynamics in the backgrounds of our interest, which corresponds to the fundamental N=2 hypermultiplet, we show that the chiral bi-fermion condensation responsible for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is not logically related to the phenomenon of confinement.
