Title: Twisted WZW Branes from Twisted REA's
Authors: Jacek Pawelczyk and Harold Steinacker and Rafal R. Suszek
Abstract: Quantum geometry of twisted Wess--Zumino--Witten branes is formulated in the framework of twisted Reflection Equation Algebras. It is demonstrated how the representation theory of these algebras leads to the correct classification and localisation of branes. A semiclassical formula for quantised brane positions is derived and shown to be consistent with earlier string-theoretic analyses.
