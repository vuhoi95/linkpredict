Title: Mechanics of multidimensional isolated horizons
Authors: M. Korzynski and J. Lewandowski and T. Pawlowski
Abstract: Recently a multidimensional generalization of Isolated Horizon framework has been proposed by Lewandowski and Pawlowski (gr-qc/0410146). Therein the geometric description was easily generalized to higher dimensions and the structure of the constraints induced by the Einstein equations was analyzed. In particular, the geometric version of the zeroth law of the black hole thermodynamics was proved. In this work we show how the IH mechanics can be formulated in a dimension--independent fashion and derive the first law of BH thermodynamics for arbitrary dimensional IH. We also propose a definition of energy for non--rotating horizons.
