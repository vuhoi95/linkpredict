Title: The masses of gauge fields in higher spin field theory on the bulk of  $AdS_{4}$
Authors: Ruben Manvelyan and Werner Ruehl
Abstract: A local gauge invariant interaction Lagrangian for two gauge fields of spin $\ell$ and $\ell-2$ $(\ell>2)$ and the scalar field is defined. It gives rise to one-loop corrections to the gauge field propagator. The loop function contains the Goldstone boson propagator for gauge symmetry breaking. The proportionality factor in front of this propagator is the mass squared of the gauge boson.
