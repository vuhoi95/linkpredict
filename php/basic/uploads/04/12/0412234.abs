Title: The Gauge/Gravity Correspondence for Non-Supersymmetric Theories
Authors: P. Di Vecchia and A. Liccardo and R. Marotta and F. Pezzella
Abstract: We review the string construction of the ``orientifold field theories'' and we show that for these theories the gauge/gravity correspondence is only valid for a large number of colours.
