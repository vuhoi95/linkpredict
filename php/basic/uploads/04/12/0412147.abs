Title: Superextension of Jordanian Deformation for U(osp(1|2))and its  Generalizations
Authors: A. Borowiec and J. Lukierski and V. N. Tolstoy
Abstract: We describe Jordanian ``nonstandard'' deformation of U(osp(1|2)) by employing the twist quantization technique. An extension of these results to U(osp(1|4))describing deformed graded D=4 $AdS$ symmetries and to their super-Poincar\'{e} limit is outlined.
