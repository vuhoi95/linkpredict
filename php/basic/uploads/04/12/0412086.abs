Title: The coplanarity of planetary orbits places bounds on dynamical aether
Authors: Daniel Sudarsky and Konstantin G. Zloshchastiev
Abstract: OBITUARY The Article and we have been friends for more than half a year. With it, we shared many experiences, both in planetary dynamics and field theory. This research is something I shall always remember with a smile on my face, and a pain in my heart. Today is a day of sadness and mourning for the loss of our ill-born Article. After more thorough medical examination we came to the conclusion that the precession of planetary orbits cannot be used to bound anything except human fantasy. Yet it can also be viewed as a day of celebration! Why? Because without it, we would never have been touched by the shared experiences on physics's eventful journey. Whilst it will now forever be absent in Arxive, it will be with us always in spirit. As it might have said, "I have a long journey to take, and must bid the company farewell" (Sir Walter Raleigh). I say three things: Gone? - Yes! Forgotten? - Never! Remembered? - Always! by K.G.Z.
