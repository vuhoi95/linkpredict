Title: Quantization of Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond Superstring Model in  10+2-dimensional Spacetime
Authors: Takuya Tsukioka and Yoshiyuki Watabiki
Abstract: We construct a Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond superstring model which is invariant under supersymmetric U(1)_V * U(1)_A gauge transformations as well as the super-general coordinate, the super local Lorentz and the super-Weyl transformations on the string world-sheet. We quantize the superstring model by covariant BRST formulation a la Batalin and Vilkovisky and noncovariant light-cone gauge formulation. Upon the quantizations the model turns out to be formulated consistently in 10+2-dimensional background spacetime involving two time dimensions.
