Title: Supersymmetric AdS(4) compactifications of IIA supergravity
Authors: D. Lust and D. Tsimpis
Abstract: We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for N=1 compactifications of (massive) IIA supergravity to AdS(4) in the language of SU(3) structures. We find new solutions characterized by constant dilaton and nonzero fluxes for all form fields. All fluxes are given in terms of the geometrical data of the internal compact space. The latter is constrained to belong to a special class of half-flat manifolds.
