Title: Dark Energy, Scalar-Tensor Gravity and Large Extra Dimensions
Authors: Kimmo Kainulainen and Daniel Sunhede
Abstract: We explore in detail a dilatonic scalar-tensor theory of gravity inspired by large extra dimensions, where a radion field from compact extra dimensions gives rise to quintessence in our 4-dimensional world. We show that the model can give rise to other types of cosmologies as well, some more akin to $k$-essence and possibly variants of phantom dark energy. In our model the field (or radius) stabilization arises from quantum corrections to the effective 4D Ricci scalar. We then show that various constraints nearly determine the model parameters, and give an example of a quintessence-type cosmology consistent with observations. We show that the upcoming SNAP-experiment would easily distinguish the present model from a constant $\Lambda$ model with an \emph{equal} amount of dark energy, but that the SNAP-data alone will not be able distinguish it from a $\Lambda$ model with about 5% less dark energy.
