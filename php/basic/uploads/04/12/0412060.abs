Title: Chaos of Yang-Mills Field in Class A Bianchi Spacetimes
Authors: Yoshida Jin and Kei-ichi Maeda
Abstract: Studying Yang-Mills field and gravitational field in class A Bianchi spacetimes, we find that chaotic behavior appears in the late phase (the asymptotic future). In this phase, the Yang-Mills field behaves as that in Minkowski spacetime, in which we can understand it by a potential picture, except for the types VIII and IX. At the same time, in the initial phase (near the initial singularity), we numerically find that the behavior seems to approach the Kasner solution. However, we show that the Kasner circle is unstable and the Kasner solution is not an attractor. From an analysis of stability and numerical simulation, we find a Mixmaster-like behavior in Bianchi I spacetime. Although this result may provide a counterexample to the BKL (Belinskii, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz) conjecture, we show that the BKL conjecture is still valid in Bianchi IX spacetime. We also analyze a multiplicative effect of two types of chaos, that is, chaos with the Yang-Mills field and that in vacuum Bianchi IX spacetime. Two types of chaos seem to coexist in the initial phase. However, the effect due to the Yang-Mills field is much smaller than that of the curvature term.
