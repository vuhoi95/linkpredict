Title: Topological mass generation to antisymmetric tensor matter field
Authors: L. Gonzaga and M. S. Cunha and R. R. Landim
Abstract: We propose a mechanism to give mass to tensor matter field which preserve the U(1) symmetry. We introduce a complex vector field that couples with the tensor in a topological term. We also analyze the influence of the kinetic terms of the complex vector in our mechanism.
