Title: The complete one-loop spin chain for N=2 Super-Yang-Mills
Authors: P. Di Vecchia and A. Tanzini
Abstract: We show that the complete planar one-loop mixing matrix of the N=2 Super Yang--Mills theory can be obtained from a reduction of that of the N=4 theory. For composite operators of scalar fields, this yields an anisotropic XXZ spin chain, whose spectrum of excitations displays a mass gap.
