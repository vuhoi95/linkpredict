Title: Some remarks on Gopakumar-Vafa invariants
Authors: A. Schwarz and I. Shapiro
Abstract: We show that Gopakumar-Vafa invariants can be expressed in terms of the cohomology ring of moduli space of D-branes without reference to the sl_2 \times sl_2 action. We also give a simple construction of this action.
