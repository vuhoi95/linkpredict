Title: Finite size effects in quantum field theories with boundary from  scattering data
Authors: Z. Bajnok and L. Palla and G. Takacs
Abstract: We derive a relation between leading finite size corrections for a 1+1 dimensional quantum field theory on a strip and scattering data, which is very similar in spirit to the approach pioneered by Luscher for periodic boundary conditions. The consistency of the results is tested both analytically and numerically using thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz, Destri-de Vega nonlinear integral equation and classical field theory techniques. We present strong evidence that the relation between the boundary state and the reflection factor one-particle couplings, noticed earlier by Dorey et al. in the case of the Lee-Yang model extends to any boundary quantum field theory in 1+1 dimensions.
