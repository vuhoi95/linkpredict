Title: Topological Field Configurations in the Presence of Isospin Chemical  Potential
Authors: M. Loewe and S. Mendizabal and J. C. Rojas
Abstract: We analyze the stability of different topological solutions in Quantum Field Theory when an isospin chemical potential $\mu $ is included. We work in the limit when temperature vanishes. We find that static vortex solutions in $2+1D$ do exist. However, the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole in $3+1D$ is no longer stable, as soon as the chemical potential acquires a finite value. In the case of the Skyrmion, this topological solution still exists for finite $\mu$, up to a certain critical value.
