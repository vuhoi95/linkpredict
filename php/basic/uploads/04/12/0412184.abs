Title: From very-extended to overextended gravity and M-theories
Authors: Francois Englert and Marc Henneaux and Laurent Houart
Abstract: The formulation of gravity and M-theories as very-extended Kac-Moody invariant theories encompasses, for each very-extended algebra G+++, two distinct actions invariant under the overextended Kac-Moody subalgebra G++. The first carries a Euclidean signature and is the generalisation to G++ of the E10-invariant action proposed in the context of M-theory and cosmological billiards. The second action carries various Lorentzian signatures revealed through various equivalent formulations related by Weyl transformations of fields. It admits exact solutions, identical to those of the maximally oxidised field theories and of their exotic counterparts, which describe intersecting extremal branes smeared in all directions but one. The Weyl transformations of G++ relates these solutions by conventional and exotic dualities. These exact solutions, common to the Kac-Moody theories and to space-time covariant theories, provide a laboratory for analysing the significance of the infinite set of fields appearing in the Kac-Moody formulations.
