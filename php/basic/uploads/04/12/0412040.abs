Title: Dual formulations of non-abelian spin models: local representation and  low-temperature asymptotics
Authors: O. Borisenko and V. Kushnir
Abstract: Non-abelian lattice spin models with symmetry group SU(N) or U(N) can be formulated in terms of link variables which are subject to the Bianchi constraints. Using this representation we derive exact and local dual formulation for the partition function of such models on a cubic lattice in arbitrary dimension D. Locality means that the dual action is given by a sum over some subset of hypercubes of the dual lattice and the interaction between dual variables ranges over one given hypercube. Dual variables are in general discrete-valued and live on (D-2)-cell of the dual lattice, in close analogy with the XY model. We use our construction to study in details the dual of SU(2) principal chiral model in two dimensions. We give dual expressions also for two-point correlation function in arbitrary representation and for the free energy of defects. Leading terms of the asymptotic expansion of the dual Boltzmann factor are computed and it is proven that at low temperatures it converges to a certain Gaussian distribution uniformly in all fluctuations of dual variables. This result enables us to define the semiclassical limit of the dual formulation and to determine an analog of the vortex--spin-wave representation for the partition function. Such representation is used to extract leading perturbative contribution to the correlation function which shows power-like decay at weak coupling. We also present some analytical evidences that the low-temperature limit of the dual formulation is completely described by ISO(2)-like approximation of SU(2) matrix elements.
