Title: Correlation functions in a c=1 boundary conformal field theory
Authors: Kristjan R. Kristjansson and Larus Thorlacius
Abstract: We obtain exact results for correlation functions of primary operators in the two-dimensional conformal field theory of a scalar field interacting with a critical periodic boundary potential. Amplitudes involving arbitrary bulk discrete primary fields are given in terms of SU(2) rotation coefficients while boundary amplitudes involving discrete boundary fields are independent of the boundary interaction. Mixed amplitudes involving both bulk and boundary discrete fields can also be obtained explicitly. Two- and three-point boundary amplitudes involving fields at generic momentum are determined, up to multiplicative constants, by the band spectrum in the open-string sector of the theory.
