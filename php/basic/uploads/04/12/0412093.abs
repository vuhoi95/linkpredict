Title: Spacelike boundaries from the c=1 Matrix Model
Authors: Sumit R. Das and Joanna L. Karczmarek
Abstract: We find classical solutions of two dimensional noncritical string theory which give rise to geometries with spacelike boundaries, similar to spacetimes with cosmological event horizons. In the c=1 matrix model, these solutions have a representation as simple time dependent configurations. We obtain the causal structure of the resulting spacetimes. Using the macroscopic loop transform, we probe the form of the tachyon condensate in the asymptotic regions.
