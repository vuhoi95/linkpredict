Title: Chiral Fermions and Quadratic Divergences
Authors: Xavier Calmet and Paul H. Frampton and Ryan M. Rohm
Abstract: In an approach towards naturalness without supersymmetry, renormalization properties of nonsupersymmetric abelian quiver gauge theories are studied. In the construction based on cyclic groups Z_p the gauge group is U(N)^p, the fermions are all in bifundamentals and the construction allows scalars in adjoints and bifundamentals. Only models without adjoint scalars, however, exhibit both chiral fermions and the absence of one-loop quadratic divergences in the scalar propagator.
