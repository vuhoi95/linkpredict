Title: Varying Couplings in Electroweak Theory
Authors: Douglas J. Shaw and John D. Barrow
Abstract: We extend the theory of Kimberly and Magueijo for the spacetime variation of the electroweak couplings in the unified Glashow-Salam-Weinberg model of the electroweak interaction to include quantum corrections. We derive the effective quantum-corrected dilaton evolution equations in the presence of a background cosmological matter density that is composed of weakly interacting and non-weakly-interacting non-relativistic dark-matter components.
