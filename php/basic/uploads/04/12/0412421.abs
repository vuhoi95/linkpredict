Title: Applications of Massive Integrable Quantum Field Theories to Problems in  Condensed Matter Physics
Authors: Fabian H. L. Essler and Robert M. Konik
Abstract: We review applications of the sine-Gordon model, the O(3) non-linear sigma model, the U(1) Thirring model, and the O(N) Gross--Neveu model to quasi one-dimensional quantum magnets, Mott insulators, and carbon nanotubes. We focus upon the determination of dynamical response functions for these problems. These quantities are computed by means of form factor expansions of quantum correlation functions in integrable quantum field theories. This approach is reviewed here in some detail.
