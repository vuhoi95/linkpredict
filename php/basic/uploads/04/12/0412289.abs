Title: Bounds on Cubic Lorentz-Violating Terms in the Fermionic Dispersion  Relation
Authors: O. Bertolami and J. G. Rosa
Abstract: We study the recently proposed Lorentz-violating dispersion relation for fermions and show that it leads to two distinct cubic operators in the momentum. We compute the leading order terms that modify the non-relativistic equations of motion and use experimental results for the hyperfine transition in the ground state of the ${}^9\textrm Be^+$ ion to bound the values of the Lorentz-violating parameters $\eta_1$ and $\eta_2$ for neutrons. The resulting bounds depend on the value of the Lorenz-violating background four-vector in the laboratory frame.
