Title: Flux Vacua and Branes of the Minimal Superstring
Authors: Nathan Seiberg and David Shih
Abstract: We analyze exactly the simplest minimal superstring theory, using its dual matrix model. Its target space is one dimensional (the Liouville direction), and the background fields include a linear dilaton, a possible tachyon condensate, and RR flux. The theory has both charged and neutral branes, and these exhibit new and surprising phenomena. The smooth moduli space of charged branes has different weakly coupled boundaries in which the branes have different RR charges. This new duality between branes of different charges shows that the semiclassical notion of localized charge is not precise in the quantum theory, and that the charges of these branes can fluctuate. Correspondingly, the RR flux in some parts of target space can also fluctuate -- only the net flux at infinity is fixed. We substantiate our physical picture with a detailed semiclassical analysis of the exact answers. Along the way, we uncover new subtleties in super-Liouville theory.
