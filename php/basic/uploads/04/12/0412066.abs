Title: Can we distinguish between h^{SM} and h^0 in split supersymmetry?
Authors: Marco Aurelio Diaz and Pavel Fileviez Perez
Abstract: We investigate the possibility to distinguish between the Standard Model Higgs boson and the lightest Higgs boson in Split Supersymmetry. We point out that the best way to distinguish between these two Higgs bosons is through the decay into two photons. It is shown that there are large differences of several percent between the predictions for \Gamma(h\to\gamma\gamma) in the two models, making possible the discrimination at future photon-photon colliders. Once the charginos are discovered at the next generation of collider experiments, the well defined predictions for the Higgs decay into two photons will become a cross check to identify the light Higgs boson in Split Supersymmetry.
