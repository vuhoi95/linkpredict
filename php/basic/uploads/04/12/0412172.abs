Title: Comments on regularization ambiguities and local gauge symmetries
Authors: R. Casana and B. M. Pimentel
Abstract: We study the regularization ambiguities in an exact renormalized (1+1)-dimensional field theory. We show a relation between the regularization ambiguities and the coupling parameters of the theory as well as their role in the implementation of a local gauge symmetry at quantum level.
