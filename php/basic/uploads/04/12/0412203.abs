Title: Refining the Proof of Planar Equivalence
Authors: A. Armoni and M. Shifman and G. Veneziano
Abstract: We outline a full non-perturbative proof of planar (large-N) equivalence between bosonic correlators in a theory with Majorana fermions in the adjoint representation and one with Dirac fermions in the two-index (anti)symmetric representation. In a particular case (one flavor), this reduces to our previous result - planar equivalence between super-Yang--Mills theory and a non-supersymmetric ``orientifold field theory.'' The latter theory becomes one-flavor massless QCD at N=3.
