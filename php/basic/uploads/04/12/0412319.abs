Title: Instantons in c=0 CSFT
Authors: Robert de Mello Koch and Antal Jevicki and Joao P. Rodrigues
Abstract: Following the recent work of hep-th/0405076 we discuss the emergence of D-brane instanton solutions in c=0 noncritical string theory. Our emphasis is on finding the D-instanton effects in a field theoretic setting. Using the framework of single matrix collective field theory (CSFT) we exhibit the appearance of such solutions. Some subtle issues regarding the form of the field theory equations, the comparison with string equations and the importance of a finite N exclusion principle are also discussed.
