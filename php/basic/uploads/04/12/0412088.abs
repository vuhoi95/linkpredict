Title: Towards Adelic Noncommutative Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Goran S. Djordjevic and Ljubisa Nesic
Abstract: A motivation of using noncommutative and nonarchimedean geometry on very short distances is given. Besides some mathematical preliminaries, we give a short introduction in adelic quantum mechanics. We also recall to basic ideas and tools embedded in q-deformed and noncommutative quantum mechanics. A rather fundamental approach, called deformation quantization, is noted. A few relations between noncommutativity and nonarchimedean spaces as well as similarities between corresponding quantum theories on them are pointed out. An extended Moyal product in a proposed form of adelic noncommutative quantum mechanics is considered. We suggest some question for future investigations.
