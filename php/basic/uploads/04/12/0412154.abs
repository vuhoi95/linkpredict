Title: Higher Order Integrability in Generalized Holonomy
Authors: A. Batrachenko and James T. Liu and Oscar Varela and W. Y. Wen
Abstract: Supersymmetric backgrounds in M-theory often involve four-form flux in addition to pure geometry. In such cases, the classification of supersymmetric vacua involves the notion of generalized holonomy taking values in SL(32,R), the Clifford group for eleven-dimensional spinors. Although previous investigations of generalized holonomy have focused on the curvature \Rm_{MN}(\Omega) of the generalized SL(32,R) connection \Omega_M, we demonstrate that this local information is incomplete, and that satisfying the higher order integrability conditions is an essential feature of generalized holonomy. We also show that, while this result differs from the case of ordinary Riemannian holonomy, it is nevertheless compatible with the Ambrose-Singer holonomy theorem.
