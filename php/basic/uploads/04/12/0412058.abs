Abstract: We present the classification of the most general regular solutions to the boundary Yang-Baxter equations for vertex models associated with non-exceptional affine Lie algebras. Reduced solutions found by applying a limit procedure to the general solutions are discussed. We also present the list of diagonal $K$-matrices. Special cases are considered separately.
