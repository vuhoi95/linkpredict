Title: SUSY-breaking Soft Terms in a MSSM Magnetized D7-brane Model
Authors: A. Font and L. E. Ibanez
Abstract: We compute the SUSY-breaking soft terms in a magnetized D7-brane model with MSSM-like spectrum, under the general assumption of non-vanishing auxiliary fields of the dilaton and Kahler moduli. As a particular scenario we discuss SUSY breaking triggered by ISD or IASD 3-form fluxes.
