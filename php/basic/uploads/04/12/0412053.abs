Title: Linearized self-forces for branes
Authors: Richard A. Battye and Brandon Carter and Andrew Mennim
Abstract: We compute the regularized force density and renormalized action due to fields of external origin coupled to a brane of arbitrary dimension in a spacetime of any dimension. Specifically, we consider forces generated by gravitational, dilatonic and generalized antisymmetric form-fields. The force density is regularized using a recently developed gradient operator. For the case of a Nambu--Goto brane, we show that the regularization leads to a renormalization of the tension, which is seen to be the same in both approaches. We discuss the specific couplings which lead to cancellation of the self-force in this case.
