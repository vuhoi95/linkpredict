Title: On tachyons, gauged linear sigma models, and flip transitions
Authors: David R. Morrison and K. Narayan
Abstract: We study systems of multiple localized closed string tachyons and the phenomena associated with their condensation, in C3/ZN nonsupersymmetric noncompact orbifold singularities using gauged linear sigma model constructions, following hep-th/0406039. Our study reveals close connections between the combinatorics of nonsupersymmetric flip transitions (between topologically distinct resolutions of the original singularity), the physics of tachyons of different degrees of relevance and the singularity structure of the corresponding residual endpoint geometries. This in turn can be used to study the stability of the phases of gauged linear sigma models and gain qualitative insight into the closed string tachyon potential.
