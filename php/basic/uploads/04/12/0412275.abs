Title: MHV Rules for Higgs Plus Multi-Parton Amplitudes
Authors: S. D. Badger and E. W. N. Glover and Valentin V. Khoze
Abstract: We present MHV-rules for constructing perturbative amplitudes for a Higgs boson and an arbitrary number of partons. We give explicit expressions for amplitudes involving a Higgs and three negative helicity partons and any number of positive helicity partons - the NMHV amplitudes. We also present a recursive formulation of MHV rules that incorporates the Higgs, quarks and gluons. The recursion relations are valid for all non-MHV amplitudes. The general results agree numerically with all of the available Higgs + n-parton amplitudes and in some cases provide considerably shorter expressions.
