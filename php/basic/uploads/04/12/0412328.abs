Title: Fourier Mukai Transforms and Applications to String Theory
Authors: Bjorn Andreas and Daniel Hernandez Ruiperez
Abstract: We give an introductory review of Fourier-Mukai transforms and their application to various aspects of moduli problems, string theory and mirror symmetry. We develop the necessary mathematical background for Fourier-Mukai transforms such as aspects of derived categories and integral functors as well as their relative version which becomes important for making precise the notion of fiberwise T-duality on elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds. We discuss various applications of the Fourier-Mukai transform to D-branes on Calabi-Yau manifolds as well as homological mirror symmetry and the construction of vector bundles for heterotic string theory.
