Title: T-duality for principal torus bundles and dimensionally reduced Gysin  sequences
Authors: Peter Bouwknegt and Keith Hannabuss and Varghese Mathai
Abstract: We reexamine the results on the global properties of T-duality for principal circle bundles in the context of a dimensionally reduced Gysin sequence. We will then construct a Gysin sequence for principal torus bundles and examine the consequences. In particular, we will argue that the T-dual of a principal torus bundle with nontrivial H-flux is, in general, a continuous field of noncommutative, nonassociative tori.
