Title: Non-supersymmetric black rings as thermally excited supertubes
Authors: Henriette Elvang and Roberto Emparan and Pau Figueras
Abstract: We construct a seven-parameter family of supergravity solutions that describe non-supersymmetric black rings and black tubes with three charges, three dipoles and two angular momenta. The black rings have regular horizons and non-zero temperature. They are naturally interpreted as the supergravity descriptions of thermally excited configurations of supertubes, specifically of supertubes with two charges and one dipole, and of supertubes with three charges and two dipoles. In order to fully describe thermal excitations near supersymmetry of the black supertubes with three charges and three dipoles a more general family of black ring solutions is required.
