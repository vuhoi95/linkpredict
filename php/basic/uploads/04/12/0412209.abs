Title: Computation of Superpotentials for D-Branes
Authors: Paul S. Aspinwall and Sheldon Katz
Abstract: We present a general method for the computation of tree-level superpotentials for the world-volume theory of B-type D-branes. This includes quiver gauge theories in the case that the D-brane is marginally stable. The technique involves analyzing the A-infinity structure inherent in the derived category of coherent sheaves. This effectively gives a practical method of computing correlation functions in holomorphic Chern-Simons theory. As an example, we give a more rigorous proof of previous results concerning 3-branes on certain singularities including conifolds. We also provide a new example.
