Title: The Holographic Approach to Cosmology
Authors: T. Banks and W. Fischler
Abstract: We review the successes and challenges of the holographic approach to cosmology. The model predicts an exactly scale invariant fluctuation spectrum with long and short distance cut-offs. It can account for the observed fluctuations in the CMB and might explain the low power at large scales. We outline various cosmological histories compatible with holographic initial conditions. This paper is based on talks given by the authors at Cosmo 04 in Toronto, and the 2004 Tamura Symposium in Austin
