Title: The universal envelope of the topological closed string BRST-complex
Authors: Harald Grosse and Karl-Georg Schlesinger
Abstract: We construct a universal envelope for any Poisson- and Gerstenhaber algebra. While the deformation theory of Poisson algebras seems to be partially trivial, results from string- and M-theory suggest a rich deformation theory of Gerstenhaber algebras. We apply our construction in this case to well known questions on the topological closed string BRST-complex. Finally, we find a similar algebraic structure, as for the universal envelope, in the SU(2)-WZW model.
