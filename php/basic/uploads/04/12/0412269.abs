Title: Constraints on the redshift dependence of the dark energy potential
Authors: Joan Simon and Licia Verde and Raul Jimenez
Abstract: We develop a formalism to characterize the redshift evolution of the dark energy potential. Our formalism makes use of quantities similar to the Horizon-flow parameters in inflation and is general enough that can deal with multiscalar quintessence scenarios, exotic matter components, and higher order curvature corrections to General Relativity. We show how the shape of the dark energy potential can be recovered non parametrically using this formalism and we present approximations analogous to the ones relevant to slow-roll inflation. Since presently available data do not allow a non-parametric and exact reconstruction of the potential, we consider a general parametric description. This reconstruction can also be used in other approaches followed in the literature (e.g., the reconstruction of the redshift evolution of the dark energy equation of state w(z)). Using observations of passively evolving galaxies and supernova data we derive constraints on the dark energy potential shape in the redshift range 0.1 < z < 1.8. Our findings show that at the 1sigma level the potential is consistent with being constant, although at the same level of confidence variations cannot be excluded with current data. We forecast constraints achievable with future data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope.
