Title: Free Energy of thick Center Vortices
Authors: Ch. Korn and H. Reinhardt and T. Tok
Abstract: The free energy of thick center vortices is calculated in continuum Yang-Mills theory in one-loop approximation using the proper time regularization. The vortices are represented by Abelian gauge field configurations on the torus which satisfy twisted boundary conditions.
