Title: Worldlines on Orbifolds and the Fayet-Iliopoulos Term
Authors: Felix Bruemmer and Michael G. Schmidt and Zurab Tavartkiladze
Abstract: We adapt ``string-inspired'' worldline techniques to one-loop calculations on orbifolds, in particular on the $S^1/Z_2$ orbifold. Our method also allows for the treatment of brane-localized terms, or bulk-brane couplings. For demonstration, we reproduce the well-known result for the one-loop induced Fayet-Iliopoulos term in rigidly supersymmetric Abelian gauge theory, and generalize it to the case where soft supersymmetry breaking mass terms for the bulk scalar fields are present on the branes.
