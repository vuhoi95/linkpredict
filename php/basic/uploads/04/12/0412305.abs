Title: Noncommutative Quantum Scattering in a Central Field
Authors: Stefano Bellucci and Armen Yeranyan
Abstract: In this paper the problem of noncommutative elastic scattering in a central field is considered. General formulas for the differential cross-section for two cases are obtained. For the case of high energy of an incident wave it is shown that the differential cross-section coincides with that on the commutative space. For the case in which noncommutativity yields only a small correction to the central potential it is shown that the noncommutativity leads to the redistribution of particles along the azimuthal angle, although the whole cross-section coincides with the commutative case.
