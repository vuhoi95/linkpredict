Title: The Yang-Mills vacuum in Coulomb gauge
Authors: D. Epple and C. Feuchter and H. Reinhardt
Abstract: The Yang-Mills Schr\"odinger equation is solved in Coulomb gauge for the vacuum by the variational principle using an ansatz for the wave functional, which is strongly peaked at the Gribov horizon. We find an infrared suppressed gluon propagator, an infrared singular ghost propagator and an almost linearly rising confinement potential. Using these solutions we calculate the electric field of static color charge distributions relevant for mesons and baryons.
