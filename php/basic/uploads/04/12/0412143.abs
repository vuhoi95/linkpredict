Title: $D$-term inflation, cosmic strings, and consistency with cosmic  microwave background measurement
Authors: Jonathan Rocher and Mairi Sakellariadou
Abstract: Standard D-term inflation is studied in the framework of supergravity. D-term inflation produces cosmic strings, however it can still be compatible with CMB measurements without invoking any new physics. The cosmic strings contribution to the CMB data is not constant, nor dominant, contrary to some previous results. Using current CMB measurements, the free parameters (gauge and superpotential couplings, as well as the Fayet-Iliopoulos term) of D-term inflation are constrained.
