Title: Topological String Partition Functions as Equivariant Indices
Authors: Jun Li and Kefeng Liu and Jian Zhou
Abstract: We propose to use the identification of topological string partition functions as equivariant indices on framed moduli spaces of instantons to study the Gopakumar-Vafa conjecture for some local Calabi-Yau geometries.
