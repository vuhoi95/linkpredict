Title: Global embedding of D-dimensional black holes with a cosmological  constant in Minkowskian spacetimes: Matching between Hawking temperature and  Unruh temperature
Authors: Nuno Loureiro Santos and Oscar J. C. Dias and Jos√© P. S. Lemos
Abstract: We study the matching between the Hawking temperature of a large class of static D-dimensional black holes and the Unruh temperature of the corresponding higher dimensional Rindler spacetime. In order to accomplish this task we find the global embedding of the D-dimensional black holes into a higher dimensional Minkowskian spacetime, called the global embedding Minkowskian spacetime procedure (GEMS procedure). These global embedding transformations are important on their own, since they provide a powerful tool that simplifies the study of black hole physics by working instead, but equivalently, in an accelerated Rindler frame in a flat background geometry. We discuss neutral and charged Tangherlini black holes with and without cosmological constant, and in the negative cosmological constant case, we consider the three allowed topologies for the horizons (spherical, cylindrical/toroidal and hyperbolic).
