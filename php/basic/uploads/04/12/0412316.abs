Title: The C Operator in PT-Symmetric Quantum Field Theory Transforms as a  Lorentz Scalar
Authors: Carl M. Bender and Sebastian F. Brandt and Jun-Hua Chen and Qinghai Wang
Abstract: A non-Hermitian Hamiltonian has a real positive spectrum and exhibits unitary time evolution if the Hamiltonian possesses an unbroken PT (space-time reflection) symmetry. The proof of unitarity requires the construction of a linear operator called C. It is shown here that C is the complex extension of the intrinsic parity operator and that the C operator transforms under the Lorentz group as a scalar.
