Title: Multiflavour excited mesons from the fifth dimension
Authors: Angel Paredes and Pere Talavera
Abstract: We study the Regge trajectories and the quark-antiquark energy in excited hadrons composed by different dynamical mass constituents via the gauge/string correspondence. First we exemplify the procedure in a supersymmetric system, D3-D7, in the extremal case. Afterwards we discuss the model dual to large-Nc QCD, D4-D6 system. In the latter case we find the field theory expected gross features of vector like theories: the spectrum resembles that of heavy quarkonia and the Chew-Frautschi plot of the singlet and first excited states is in qualitative agreement with those of lattice QCD. We stress the salient points of including different constituents masses.
