Title: Center Vortex Model for the Infrared Sector of SU(3) Yang-Mills Theory -  Vortex Free Energy
Authors: M. Quandt and H. Reinhardt and M. Engelhardt
Abstract: The vortex free energy is studied in the random vortex world-surface model of the infrared sector of SU(3) Yang-Mills theory. The free energy of a center vortex extending into two spatial directions, which is introduced into Yang-Mills configurations when acting with the 't Hooft loop operator, is verified to furnish an order parameter for the deconfinement phase transition. It is shown to exhibit a weak discontinuity at the critical temperature, corresponding to the weak first order character of the transition.
