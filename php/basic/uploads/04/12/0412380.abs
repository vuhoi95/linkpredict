Title: Stringification of Chiral Dynamics: Wess-Zumino interaction
Authors: A. A. Andrianov and D. Espriu and A. Prats
Abstract: The QCD hadronic string is supplemented with the reparameterization-invariant boundary interaction to background chiral fields associated with pions in a way compatible with the conformal symmetry. It allows the full reconstruction of the P-even part of the Chiral Lagrangian in a good agreement with the phenomenology of P-even meson interactions. The modification of boundary interaction necessary to induce the parity-odd Chiral Dynamics (WZW action) is outlined.
