Title: All Next-to-Maximally-Helicity-Violating One-Loop Gluon Amplitudes in  N=4 Super-Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Zvi Bern and Lance J. Dixon and David A. Kosower
Abstract: We compute the next-to-MHV one-loop n-gluon amplitudes in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory. These amplitudes contain three negative-helicity gluons and an arbitrary number of positive-helicity gluons, and are the first infinite series of amplitudes beyond the simplest, MHV, amplitudes. We also discuss some aspects of their twistor-space structure.
