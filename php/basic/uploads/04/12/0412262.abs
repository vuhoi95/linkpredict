Title: Probability distributions in statistical ensembles with conserved  charges
Authors: J. Cleymans and K. Redlich and L. Turko
Abstract: The probability distributions for charged particle numbers and their densities are derived in statistical ensembles with conservation laws. It is shown that if this limit is properly taken then the canonical and grand canonical ensembles are equivalent. This equivalence is proven on the most general, probability distribution level.
