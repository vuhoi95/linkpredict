Title: Structure Formation With a Long-Range Scalar Dark Matter Interaction
Authors: Adi Nusser and S. S. Gubser and P. J. E. Peebles
Abstract: Numerical simulations show that a long-range scalar interaction in a single species of massive dark matter particles causes voids between the concentrations of large galaxies to be more nearly empty, suppresses accretion of intergalactic matter onto galaxies at low redshift, and produces an early generation of dense dark matter halos. These three effects, in moderation, seem to be improvements over the Lambda CDM model predictions for cosmic structure formation. Because the scalar interaction in this model has negligible effect on laboratory physics and the classical cosmological tests, it offers an observationally attractive example of cosmology with complicated physics in the dark sector, notably a large violation of the weak equivalence principle.
