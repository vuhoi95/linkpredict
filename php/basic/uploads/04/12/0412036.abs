Title: The speed of sound and specific heat in the QCD plasma: hydrodynamics,  fluctuations and conformal symmetry
Authors: Rajiv V. Gavai and Sourendu Gupta and Swagato Mukherjee
Abstract: We report the continuum limits of the speed of sound, c_s, and the specific heat at constant volume, c_v, in quenched QCD at temperatures of 2Tc and 3Tc. At these temperatures, c_s is within 2-sigma of the ideal gas value, whereas c_v differs significantly from the ideal gas. However, both are compatible with results expected in a theory with conformal symmetry. We investigate effective measures of conformal symmetry in the high temperature phase of QCD.
