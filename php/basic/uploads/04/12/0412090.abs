Title: Enlarged Galilean symmetry of anyons and the Hall effect
Authors: P. A. Horvathy and L. Martina and P. Stichel
Abstract: Enlarged planar Galilean symmetry, built of both space-time and field variables and also incorporating the ``exotic'' central extension is introduced. It is used to describe non-relativistic anyons coupled to an electromagnetic field. Our theory exhibits an anomalous velocity relation of the type used to explain the Anomalous Hall Effect. The Hall motions, characterized by a Casimir of the enlarged algebra, become mandatory for some critical value(s) of the magnetic field. The extension of our scheme yields the semiclassical effective model of the Bloch electron.
