Title: Trouble with space-like noncommutative field theory
Authors: V. Gayral and J. M. Gracia-Bondia and F. Ruiz Ruiz
Abstract: It is argued that the one-loop effective action for a space-like noncommutative scalar field theory does not exist. This indicates that such theories are not renormalizable already at one loop order and suggests supersymmetrization and reinvestigating other types of noncommutativity.
