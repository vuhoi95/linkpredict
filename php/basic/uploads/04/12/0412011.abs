Title: Rotating regular solutions in Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory
Authors: Vanush Paturyan and Eugen Radu and D. H. Tchrakian
Abstract: We construct new axially symmetric rotating solutions of Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory. These globally regular configurations possess a nonvanishing electric charge which equals the total angular momentum, and zero topological charge, representing a monopole-antimonopole system rotating around the symmetry axis through their common center of mass.
