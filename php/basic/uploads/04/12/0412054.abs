Title: Integrability in Yang-Mills theory on the light cone beyond leading  order
Authors: A. V. Belitsky and G. P. Korchemsky and D. MÃ¼ller
Abstract: The one-loop dilatation operator in Yang-Mills theory possesses a hidden integrability symmetry in the sector of maximal helicity Wilson operators. We calculate two-loop corrections to the dilatation operator and demonstrate that while integrability is broken for matter in the fundamental representation of the SU(3) gauge group, for the adjoint SU(N_c) matter it survives the conformal symmetry breaking and persists in supersymmetric N=1, N=2 and N=4 Yang-Mills theories.
