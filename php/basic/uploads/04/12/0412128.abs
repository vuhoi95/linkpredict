Title: General Unitary TFD Formulation for Superstrings
Authors: M. C. B. Abdalla and A. L. Gadelha and Daniel L. Nedel
Abstract: A generalization of the Thermo Field Dynamics (TFD) for fermionic degrees of freedom is proposed. Such a generalization follows a previous one where the SU(1,1) thermal group was used to obtain the closed bosonic string at finite temperature. The SU(2) thermal group is introduced to construct a general thermal Bogoliubov transformation to get the type IIB superstring at finite temperature.
