Title: The evolution of cosmic string loops in Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes
Authors: Zhengyan Gu and Hongbo Cheng
Abstract: The equation of cosmic string loops in Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes is derived. Having solved the equation numerically, we find that the loops can expand and exist except for too small ones.
