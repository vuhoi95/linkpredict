Title: Exactly Solvable SFT Inspired Phantom Model
Authors: I. Ya. Aref'eva and A. S. Koshelev and S. Yu. Vernov
Abstract: An exact solution to the Friedmann equations with a string inspired phantom scalar matter field is constructed and the absence of the "Big Rip" singularity is shown explicitly. The notable features of the concerned model are a ghost sign of the kinetic term and a special polynomial form of the effective tachyon potential. The constructed solution is stable with respect to small fluctuations of the initial conditions and special deviations of the form of the potential.
