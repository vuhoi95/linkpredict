Title: Finite density effects in Hosotani mechanism and a vacuum gauge ball
Authors: Yoshinori Cho and Kiyoshi Shiraishi
Abstract: We consider the finite density effects of the fermion with U(1) gauge symmetry in Hosotani mechanism. We construct a vacuum gauge ball, a new kind of non-topological soliton, and investigate their properties numerically. We find the relations between the physical quantities.
