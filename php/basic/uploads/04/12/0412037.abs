Title: Giant Gravitons as Fuzzy Manifolds
Authors: Bert Janssen and Yolanda Lozano and Diego Rodriguez-Gomez
Abstract: Giant gravitons are described microscopically in terms of dielectric gravitational waves expanding into fuzzy manifolds. We review these constructions in AdS_m \times S^n spacetimes, discussing the different fuzzy manifolds that appear in each case.
