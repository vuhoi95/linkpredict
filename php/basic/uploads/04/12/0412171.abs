Title: Uncertainty Relation from Holography Principle
Authors: Jia-Zhong Chen and Duoje Jia
Abstract: We propose that the information and entropy of an isolated system are two sides of one coin in the sense that they can convert into each other by measurement and evolution of the system while the sum of them is identically conserved. The holographic principle is reformulated in the way that this conserved sum is bounded by a quarter of the area A of system boundary. Uncertainty relation is derived from the holographic principle.
