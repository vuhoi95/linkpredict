Title: K-Chameleon and the Coincidence Problem
Authors: Hao Wei and Rong-Gen Cai
Abstract: In this paper we present a hybrid model of k-essence and chameleon, named as k-chameleon. In this model, due to the chameleon mechanism, the directly strong coupling between the k-chameleon field and matters (cold dark matters and baryons) is allowed. In the radiation dominated epoch, the interaction between the k-chameleon field and background matters can be neglected, the behavior of the k-chameleon therefore is the same as that of the ordinary k-essence. After the onset of matter domination, the strong coupling between the k-chameleon and matters dramatically changes the result of the ordinary k-essence. We find that during the matter-dominated epoch, only two kinds of attractors may exist: one is the familiar {\bf K} attractor and the other is a completely {\em new}, dubbed {\bf C} attractor. Once the universe is attracted into the {\bf C} attractor, the fraction energy densities of the k-chameleon $\Omega_{\phi}$ and dust matter $\Omega_m$ are fixed and comparable, and the universe will undergo a power-law accelerated expansion. One can adjust the model so that the {\bf K} attractor do not appear. Thus, the k-chameleon model provides a natural solution to the cosmological coincidence problem.
