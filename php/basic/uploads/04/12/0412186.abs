Title: Radiative corrections to scalar masses in de Sitter space
Authors: T. Brunier and F. Bernardeau and J. -P. Uzan
Abstract: We compute the radiative corrections to the mass of a test boson field in an inflating space-time. The calculations are carried out in case of a boson part of a supersymmetric chiral multiplet. We show that its mass is preserved up to logarithmic divergences both in ultraviolet and infrared domains. Consequences of these results for inflationary models are discussed.
