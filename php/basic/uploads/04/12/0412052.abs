Title: Dirac oscillator with nonzero minimal uncertainty in position
Authors: C. Quesne and V. M. Tkachuk
Abstract: In the context of some deformed canonical commutation relations leading to isotropic nonzero minimal uncertainties in the position coordinates, a Dirac equation is exactly solved for the first time, namely that corresponding to the Dirac oscillator. Supersymmetric quantum mechanical and shape-invariance methods are used to derive both the energy spectrum and wavefunctions in the momentum representation. As for the conventional Dirac oscillator, there are neither negative-energy states for $E=-1$, nor symmetry between the $l = j - {1/2}$ and $l = j + {1/2}$ cases, both features being connected with supersymmetry or, equivalently, the $\omega \to - \omega$ transformation. In contrast with the conventional case, however, the energy spectrum does not present any degeneracy pattern apart from that associated with the rotational symmetry. More unexpectedly, deformation leads to a difference in behaviour between the $l = j - {1/2}$ states corresponding to small, intermediate and very large $j$ values in the sense that only for the first ones supersymmetry remains unbroken, while for the second ones no bound state does exist.
