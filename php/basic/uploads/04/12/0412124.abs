Title: R-charged AdS bubble
Authors: Anindya Biswas and Tanay Kr. Dey and Sudipta Mukherji
Abstract: We construct R-charged adS bubbles in $D =5$, ${\cal N} =8$ supergravity. These bubbles are charecterised by four parameters. The asymptotic boundary of these solutions are deSitter times a circle. By comparing boundary energies, we study the possibility of a transition from certain class of black holes to these bubbles below a critical radius of the boundary circle. We argue that this may occur when four parameters of the bubble satisfy a constraint among themselves.
