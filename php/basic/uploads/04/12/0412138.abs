Title: Scalar perturbations of higher dimensional rotating and ultra-spinning  black holes
Authors: Vitor Cardoso and George Siopsis and Shijun Yoshida
Abstract: We investigate the stability of higher dimensional rotating black holes against scalar perturbations. In particular, we make a thorough numerical and analytical analysis of six-dimensional black holes, not only in the low rotation regime but in the high rotation regime as well. Our results suggest that higher dimensional Kerr black holes are stable against scalar perturbations, even in the ultra-spinning regime.
