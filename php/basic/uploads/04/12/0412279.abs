Title: The Toric Phases of the Y^{p,q} Quivers
Authors: Sergio Benvenuti and Amihay Hanany and Pavlos Kazakopoulos
Abstract: We construct all connected toric phases of the recently discovered $Y^{p,q}$ quivers and show their IR equivalence using Seiberg duality. We also compute the R and global U(1) charges for a generic toric phase of $Y^{p,q}$.
