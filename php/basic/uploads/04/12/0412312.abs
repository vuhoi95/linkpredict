Title: Wilson Line Correlators in N=4 Non-commutative Gauge Theory on S^2 x S^2
Authors: Y. Kitazawa and Y. Takayama and D. Tomino
Abstract: We investigate the Wilson line correlators dual to supergravity multiplets in N=4 non-commutative gauge theory on S^2 x S^2. We find additional non-analytic contributions to the correlators due to UV/IR mixing in comparison to ordinary gauge theory. Although they are no longer BPS off shell, their renormalization effects are finite as long as they carry finite momenta. We propose a renormalization procedure to obtain local operators with no anomalous dimensions in perturbation theory. We reflect on our results from dual supergravity point of view. We show that supergravity can account for both IR and UV/IR contributions.
