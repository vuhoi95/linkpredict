Title: Jordanian Quantum Deformations of D=4 Anti-de-Sitter and Poincare  Superalgebras
Authors: A. Borowiec and J. Lukierski and V. N. Tolstoy
Abstract: We consider a superextension of the extended Jordanian twist, describing nonstandard quantization of anti-de-Sitter ($AdS$) superalgebra $osp(1|4)$ in the form of Hopf superalgebra. The super-Jordanian twisting function and corresponding basic coproduct formulae for the generators of $osp(1|4)$ are given in explicit form. The nonlinear transformation of the classical superalgebra basis not modifying the defining algebraic relations but simplifying coproducts and antipodes is proposed. Our physical application is to interpret the new super-Jordanian deformation of $osp(1|4)$ superalgebra as deformed D=4 $AdS$ supersymmetries. Subsequently we perform suitable contraction of quantum Jordanian $AdS$ superalgebra and obtain new $\kappa$-deformation of D=4 Poincare superalgebra, with the bosonic sector describing the light cone $\kappa$-deformation of Poincare symmetries.
