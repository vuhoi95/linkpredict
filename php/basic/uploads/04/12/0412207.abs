Title: Chaotic Cascades for D-branes on Singularities
Authors: Sebastian Franco and Yang-Hui He and Christopher Herzog and Johannes Walcher
Abstract: We briefly review our work on the cascading renormalization group flows for gauge theories on D-branes probing Calabi-Yau singularities. Such RG flows are sometimes chaotic and exhibit duality walls. We construct supergravity solutions dual to logarithmic flows for these theories. We make new observations about a surface of conformal theories and more complicated supergravity solutions.
