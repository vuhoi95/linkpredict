Title: Quark-Antiquark Bound States in an Extended QCD_2 Model
Authors: Pedro Labrana and Jorge Alfaro and Alexander A. Andrianov
Abstract: We study an extended QCD model in 2D obtained from QCD in 4D by compactifying two spatial dimensions and projecting onto the zero-mode subspace. This system is found to induce a dynamical mass for transverse gluons -- adjoint scalars in QCD(2), and to undergo a chiral symmetry breaking with the full quark propagators yielding non-tachyonic, dynamical quark masses, even in the chiral limit. We construct the hadronic color singlet bound-state scattering amplitudes and study quark-antiquark bound states which can be classified in this model by their properties under Lorentz transformations inherited from 4D.
