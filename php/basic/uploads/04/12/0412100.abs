Authors: Shao-You Zhao and Kang-Jie Shi and Rui-Hong Yue
Abstract: We give the center of the elliptic quantum group in general case. Based on the Dynamic Yang-Baxter Relation and the fusion method, we prove that the center commute with all generators of the elliptic quantum group. Then for a kind of assumed form of these generators, we find that the coefficients of these generators form a new type closed algebra. We also give the center for the algebra.
