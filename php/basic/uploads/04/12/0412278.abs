Title: Further Investigation on Chiral Symmetry Breaking in a Uniform External  Magnetic Field
Authors: P. Jasinski and C. N. Leung
Abstract: We study chiral symmetry breaking in QED when a uniform external magnetic field is present. We calculate higher order corrections to the dynamically generated fermion mass and find them to be small. In so doing we correct an error in the literature regarding the matrix structure of the fermion self-energy.
