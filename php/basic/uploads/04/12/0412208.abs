Title: On Superfield Covariant Quantization in General Coordinates
Authors: D. M. Gitman and P. Yu. Moshin and J. L. Tomazelli
Abstract: We propose a natural extension of the BRST-antiBRST superfield covariant scheme in general coordinates. Thus, the coordinate dependence of the basic scalar and tensor fields of the formalism is extended from the base supermanifold to the complete set of superfield variables.
