Abstract: Brane world gravity looks different for observers on positive and negative tension branes. First we consider the well-known RS1 model with two branes embedded into the AdS_5 space-time and recall the results on the relations between the energy scales for an observer on the negative tension brane, which is supposed to be "our" brane. Then from the point of view of this observer we study energy scales and masses for the radion and graviton excitations in a stabilized brane world model. We argue that there may be several possibilities leading to scales of the order 1-10 TeV or even less for new physics effects on our brane. In particular, an interesting scenario can arise in the case of a "symmetric" brane world with a nontrivial warp factor in the bulk, which however takes equal values on both branes.
