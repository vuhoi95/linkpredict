Title: Designer Gravity and Field Theory Effective Potentials
Authors: Thomas Hertog and Gary T. Horowitz
Abstract: Motivated by the AdS/CFT correspondence, we show that there is a remarkable agreement between static supergravity solutions and extrema of a field theory potential. For essentially any function V, there are boundary conditions in anti de Sitter space so that gravitational solitons exist precisely at the extrema of V and have masses given by the value of V at these extrema. Based on this, we propose new positive energy conjectures. On the field theory side, each function V can be interpreted as the effective potential for a certain operator in the dual field theory.
