Title: Signatures of confinement in Landau gauge QCD
Authors: J. M. Pawlowski and D. F. Litim and S. Nedelko and L. von Smekal
Abstract: We summarise an analysis of the infrared regime of Landau gauge QCD by means of a flow equation approach. The infrared behaviour of gluon and ghost propagators is evaluated. The results provide further evidence for the Kugo-Ojima confinement scenario. We also discuss their relation to results obtained with other functional methods as well as the lattice.
