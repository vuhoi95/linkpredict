Title: Universal Quantum Gate, Yang--Baxterization and Hamiltonian
Authors: Yong Zhang and Louis H. Kauffman and Mo-Lin Ge
Abstract: It is fundamental to view unitary braiding operators describing topological entanglements as universal quantum gates for quantum computation. This paper derives a unitary solution of the Quantum Yang--Baxter equation via Yang--Baxterization and constructs the Hamiltonian responsible for the time-evolution of the unitary braiding operator.
