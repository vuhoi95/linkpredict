Title: A new Rational Conformal Field Theory extension of the fully degenerate  W_{1+\infty}^{(m)}
Authors: Gerardo Cristofano and Vincenzo Marotta and Giuliano Niccoli
Abstract: We found new identities among the Dedekind eta-function, the characters of the W_{m} algebra and those of the level 1 affine Lie algebra su(m)_{1}. They allow to characterize the Z_{m}-orbifold of the m-component free bosons u(1)_{K_{m,p}} (our theory TM) as an extension of the fully degenerate representations of W_{1+infty}^{(m)}. In particular, TM is proven to be a Gamma _{theta}-RCFT extension of the chiral fully degenerate W_{1+infty}^{(m)}.
