Title: D0-branes in Black Hole Attractors
Authors: Davide Gaiotto and Aaron Simons and Andrew Strominger and Xi Yin
Abstract: Configurations of N probe D0-branes in a Calabi-Yau black hole are studied. A large degeneracy of near-horizon bound states are found which can be described as lowest Landau levels tiling the horizon of the black hole. These states preserve some of the enhanced supersymmetry of the near-horizon AdS_2xS^2xCY attractor geometry, but not of the full asymptotically flat solution. Supersymmetric non-abelian configurations are constructed which, via the Myers effect, develop charges associated with higher-dimensional branes wrapping CY cycles. An SU(1,1|2) superconformal quantum mechanics describing D0-branes in the attractor geometry is explicitly constructed.
