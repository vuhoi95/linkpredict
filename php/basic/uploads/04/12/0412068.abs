Title: Matrix oscillator and Laughlin Hall states
Authors: S. Meljanac and A. Samsarov
Abstract: We propose a quantum matrix oscillator as a model that provides the construction of the quantum Hall states in a direct way. A connection of this model to the regularized matrix model introduced by Polychronakos is established . By transferring the consideration to the Bargmann representation with the help of a particular similarity transformation, we show that the quantum matrix oscillator describes the quantum mechanics of electrons in the lowest Landau level with the ground state described by the Laughlin-type wave function. The equivalence with the Calogero model in one dimension is emphasized. It is shown that the quantum matrix oscillator and the finite matrix Chern-Simons model have the same spectrum on the singlet state sector.
