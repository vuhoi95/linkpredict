Title: Heterotic strings on homogeneous spaces
Authors: Dan Israel and Costas Kounnas and Domenico Orlando and P. Marios Petropoulos
Abstract: We construct heterotic string backgrounds corresponding to families of homogeneous spaces as exact conformal field theories. They contain left cosets of compact groups by their maximal tori supported by NS-NS 2-forms and gauge field fluxes. We give the general formalism and modular-invariant partition functions, then we consider some examples such as SU(2)/U(1) ~ S^2 (already described in a previous paper) and the SU(3)/U(1)^2 flag space. As an application we construct new supersymmetric string vacua with magnetic fluxes and a linear dilaton.
