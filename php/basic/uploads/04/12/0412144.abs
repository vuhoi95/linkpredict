Title: Boson-boson effective nonrelativistic potential for higher-derivative  electromagnetic theories in D dimensions
Authors: Antonio Accioly and Marco Dias
Abstract: The problem of computing the effective nonrelativistic potential $U_{D}$ for the interaction of charged scalar bosons within the context of D-dimensional electromagnetism with a cutoff, is reduced to quadratures. It is shown that $U_3$ cannot bind a pair of identical charged scalar bosons; nevertheless, numerical calculations indicate that boson-boson bound states do exist in the framework of three-dimensional higher-derivative electromagnetism augmented by a topological Chern-Simons term.
