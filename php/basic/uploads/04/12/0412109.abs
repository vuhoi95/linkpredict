Title: Effective theory approach to brane world black holes
Authors: Paul L. McFadden and Neil Turok
Abstract: We derive static spherically-symmetric vacuum solutions of the low-energy effective action for the two brane Randall-Sundrum model. The solutions with non-trivial radion belong to a one-parameter family describing traversable wormholes between the branes and a black hole, and were first discovered in the context of Einstein gravity with a conformally-coupled scalar field. From a brane world perspective, a distinctive feature of all the solutions with non-trivial radion is a brane intersection about which the bulk geometry is conical but the induced metrics on the branes are regular. Contrary to earlier claims in the literature, we show these solutions are stable under monopole perturbations.
