Title: How Phase Transitions induce classical behaviour
Authors: R. J. Rivers and F. C. Lombardo
Abstract: We continue the analysis of the onset of classical behaviour in a scalar field after a continuous phase transition, in which the system-field, the long wavelength order parameter of the model, interacts with an environment, of its own short-wavelength modes and other fields, neutral and charged, with which it is expected to interact. We compute the decoherence time for the system-field modes from the master equation and directly from the decoherence functional (with identical results). In simple circumstances the order parameter field is classical by the time the transition is complete.
