Title: Hawking and Page on the brane
Authors: A. Chamblin and A. Karch
Abstract: We show that the Hawking-Page phase transition of a CFT on AdS_{d-1} weakly coupled to gravity has a dual bulk description in terms of a phase transition between a black string and a thermal gas on AdS_{d}. At even lower temperatures the black string develops a Gregory Laflamme instability, which is dual to black hole evaporation in the boundary theory.
