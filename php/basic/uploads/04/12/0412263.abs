Title: The Casimir Energy for a Hyperboloid Facing a Plate in the Optical  Approximation
Authors: O. Schroeder and A. Scardicchio and R. L. Jaffe
Abstract: We study the Casimir energy of a massless scalar field that obeys Dirichlet boundary conditions on a hyperboloid facing a plate. We use the optical approximation including the first six reflections and compare the results with the predictions of the proximity force approximation and the semi-classical method. We also consider finite size effects by contrasting the infinite with a finite plate. We find sizable and qualitative differences between the new optical method and the more traditional approaches.
