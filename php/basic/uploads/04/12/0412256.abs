Title: Instantons for Dynamic Models from B to H
Authors: Juha Honkonen and M. V. Komarova and M. Yu. Nalimov
Abstract: Instanton analysis is applied to models B--H of critical dynamics. It is shown that the static instanton of the massless $\phi^{4}$ model determines the large-order asymptotes of the perturbation expansion of these near-equilibrium dynamic models leading to factorial growth with the order of perturbation theory.
