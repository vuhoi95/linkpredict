Title: Infra-Red Finite, Physical Electron Propagator in 2+1 Dimensions
Authors: Martin Lavelle and Zak Mazumder
Abstract: In this paper we study the infra-red behaviour of a gauge invariant and physically motivated description of a charged particle in 2+1 dimensions. We show that both the mass shift and the wave function renormalisation are infra-red finite on-shell.
