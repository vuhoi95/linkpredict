Abstract: We construct new geon-type black holes in D>3 dimensions for Einstein's theory coupled to gauge fields. A static nondegenerate vacuum black hole has a geon quotient provided the spatial section admits a suitable discrete isometry, and an antisymmetric tensor field of rank 2 or D-2 with a pure F^2 action can be included by an appropriate (and in most cases nontrivial) choice of the field strength bundle. We find rotating geons as quotients of the Myers-Perry(-AdS) solution when D is odd and not equal to 7. For other D we show that such rotating geons, if they exist at all, cannot be continuously deformed to zero angular momentum. With a negative cosmological constant, we construct geons with angular momenta on a torus at the infinity. As an example of a nonabelian gauge field, we show that the D=4 spherically symmetric SU(2) black hole admits a geon version with a trivial gauge bundle. Various generalisations, including both black-brane geons and Yang-Mills theories with Chern-Simons terms, are briefly discussed.
