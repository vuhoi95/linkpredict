Abstract: We exhibit a one-parameter family of regular supersymmetric solutions of type IIB theory that interpolates between Klebanov-Strassler (KS) and Maldacena-Nunez (MN). The solution is obtained by applying the supersymmetry conditions for SU(3)-structure manifolds to an interpolating ansatz proposed by Papadopoulos and Tseytlin. Other than at the KS point, the family does not have a conformally-Ricci-flat metric, neither it has self-dual three-form flux. Nevertheless, the asymptotic IR and UV are that of KS troughout the family, except for the extremal value of the interpolating parameter where the UV solution drastically changes to MN. This one-parameter family of solutions is interpreted as the dual of the baryonic branch of gauge theory, confirming the expecation that the KS solution corresponds to a particular symmetric point in the branch.
