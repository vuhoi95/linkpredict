Title: Asymmetric brane instantons
Authors: Zhang Hongsheng and Guo Zongkuan
Abstract: We investigate all the brane instanton solutions--an Einstein brane inhabiting at different positions in 5-dimensional negative curvature Einstein bulk. We construct a brane instanton model consisting of a brane with asymmetric bulk along two sides of the brane. And the junction condition of the resulting space-time is analyzed in the frame of induced gravity. In spirits of quantum gravity of path integral formulism we calculate the Euclidean actions on three canonical paths and then compare the Euclidean actions of different instantons per unit 4-volume. We also compare the Euclidean actions per unit 4-volume of instantons consisting of a brane gluing a fixed half with other halves possessing different cosmological constants.
