Title: Cosmological Evolution of Interacting Dark Energy Models with Mass  Varying Neutrinos
Authors: Xiao-Jun Bi and Bo Feng and Hong Li and Xinmin Zhang
Abstract: In this paper we consider the cosmological implications of dark energy models with a coupled system of a dynamical scalar field (the quintessence) and the neutrinos. By detailed numerical calculations we study the various possibilities on the evolution and the fates of the universe in this class of models. Our results show that due to the interaction with quintessence, neutrinos could be dominant over the quintessence in the future universe, however would eventually decay away.
