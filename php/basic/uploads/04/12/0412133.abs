Title: Fuzzball geometries and higher derivative corrections for extremal holes
Authors: Stefano Giusto and Samir D. Mathur
Abstract: 2-charge D1-D5 microstates are described by geometries which end in `caps' near r=0; these caps reflect infalling quanta back in finite time. We estimate the travel time for 3-charge geometries in 4-D, and find agreement with the dual CFT. This agreement supports a picture of `caps' for 3-charge geometries. We argue that higher derivative corrections to such geometries arise from string winding modes. We then observe that the `capped' geometries have no noncontractible circles, so these corrections remain bounded everywhere and cannot create a horizon or singularity.
