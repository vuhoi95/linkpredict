Title: A Realization of Matrix KP Hierarchy by Coincident D-brane States
Authors: Hironori Yamaguchi and Satoru Saito
Abstract: We describe the Sato-Wilson type formulation of the KP hierarchy within the framework of closed string theory. A matrix generalization of this formalism is shown to allow natural interpretation of coincident D-branes as a sourse of nonabelian gauge theory.
