Title: Conics on a Generic Hypersurface
Authors: Masao Jinzenji and Iku Nakamura and Yasuki Suzuki
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the contributions from double cover maps to genus 0 degree 2 Gromov-Witten invariants of general type projective hypersurfaces. Our results correspond to a generalization of Aspinwall-Morrison formula to general type hypersurfaces in some special cases.
