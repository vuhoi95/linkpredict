Title: Canonical structure of 3D gravity with torsion
Authors: M. Blagojevic and B. Cvetkovic
Abstract: We study the canonical structure of the topological 3D gravity with torsion, assuming the anti-de Sitter asymptotic conditions. It is shown that the Poisson bracket algebra of the canonical generators has the form of two independent Virasoro algebras with classical central charges. In contrast to the case of general relativity with a cosmological constant, the values of the central charges are different from each other.
