Title: U(N) Gauge Model and Partial Breaking of N=2 Supersymmetry
Authors: Kazuhito Fujiwara and Hiroshi Itoyama and Makoto Sakaguchi
Abstract: We briefly review a construction of N=2 supersymmetric U(N) gauge model in which rigid N=2 supersymmetry is spontaneously broken to N=1. This model generalizes the abelian model considered by Antoniadis, Patouche and Taylor. We discuss the conditions on the vacua of the model with partial supersymmetry breaking.
