Title: Marginal Deformations of N=4 SYM from Open/Closed Twistor Strings
Authors: Manuela Kulaxizi and Konstantinos Zoubos
Abstract: We investigate how the marginal deformations of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (analysed in particular by Leigh and Strassler) arise within B-model topological string theory on supertwistor space CP(3|4). This is achieved by turning on a certain closed string background in the fermionic directions. Through a specific open/closed correlation function, this mode induces a correction to holomorphic Chern-Simons theory, corresponding to the self-dual part of the chiral operator added on the gauge theory side. The effect of the deformation is interpreted as non-anticommutativity between some of the odd coordinates of CP(3|4). Motivated by this, we extend the twistor formalism for calculating MHV amplitudes in N=4 SYM to these N=1 theories by introducing a suitable star product between the wavefunctions. We check that our prescription yields the expected results to linear order in the deformation parameter.
