Title: Noncommutative Decrumpling Inflation and Running of the Spectral Index
Authors: Forough Nasseri and S. A. Alavi
Abstract: We present a new inflation model, known as noncommutative decrumpling inflation, in which space has noncommutative geometry with time variability of the number of spatial dimensions. Within the framework of noncommutative decrumpling inflation, we compute both the spectral index and its running. Our results show that the effects of both time variability of the number of spatial dimensions and noncommutative geometry on the spectral index and its running. Two classes of examples have been studied and comparisons made with the standard slow-roll formulae. We conclude that the effects of noncommutative geometry on the spectral index and its running are much smaller than the effects of time variability of spatial dimensions.
