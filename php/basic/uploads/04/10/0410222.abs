Title: Gravitational radiation from cosmic (super)strings: bursts, stochastic  background, and observational windows
Authors: Thibault Damour and Alexander Vilenkin
Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) signals emitted by a network of cosmic strings are reexamined in view of the possible formation of a network of cosmic superstrings at the end of brane inflation. The reconnection probability $p$ of intersecting fundamental or Dirichlet strings might be much smaller than 1, and the properties of the resulting string network may differ significantly from those of ordinary strings (which have $p=1$). In addition, it has been recently suggested that the typical length of newly formed loops may differ by a factor $\epsilon \ll 1$ from its standard estimate. Here, we analyze the effects of the two parameters $p$ and $\epsilon$ on the GW signatures of strings. We consider both the GW bursts emitted from cusps of oscillating string loops, which have been suggested as candidate sources for the LIGO/VIRGO and LISA interferometers, and the stochastic GW background, which may be detectable by pulsar timing observations. In both cases we find that previously obtained results are \textit{quite robust}, at least when the loop sizes are not suppressed by many orders of magnitude relative to the standard scenario. We urge pulsar observers to reanalyze a recently obtained 17-year combined data set to see whether the large scatter exhibited by a fraction of the data might be due to a transient GW burst activity of some sort, e.g. to a near cusp event.
