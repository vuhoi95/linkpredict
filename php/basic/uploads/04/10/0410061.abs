Title: Wilson Lines in Warped Space: Dynamical Symmetry Breaking and  Restoration
Authors: Kin-ya Oda and Andreas Weiler
Abstract: The dynamics of Wilson lines integrated along a warped extra dimension has been unknown. We study a five dimensional SU(N) pure gauge theory with Randall-Sundrum warped compactification on S^1/Z_2. We clarify the notion of large gauge transformations that are non-periodic on the covering space for this setup. We obtain Kaluza-Klein expansions of gauge and ghost fields for the most general twists and background gauge field configurations, which break the gauge symmetry at classical level in general. We calculate the one-loop effective potential and find that the symmetry corresponding to the subgroup allowing continuous Wilson lines is dynamically restored. The presented method can be directly applied to include extra fields. The connection to dynamical Scherk-Schwarz supersymmetry breaking in warped space is discussed.
