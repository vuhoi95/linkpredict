Authors: N. Bobev and H. Dimov and R. C. Rashkov
Abstract: In this paper we consider pulsating strings in warped $AdS_6\times S^4$ background, which is a vacuum solution of massive type {\bf IIA} superstring. The case of rotating strings in this background was considered in hep-th/0402202 and it was found that the results significantly differs from those considered in $AdS_5\times S^5$. Motivated by this results we study pulsating strings in the warped spherical part of the type {\bf IIA} geometry and compare the results with those obtained in hep-th/0209047, hep-th/0310188 and hep-th/0404012. We conclude with comments on our solutions and the obtained corrections to the energy, expanded to the leading order in lambda.
