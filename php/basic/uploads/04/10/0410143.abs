Abstract: We explore the possibility of baryogenesis without departure from thermal equilibrium. A possible scenario is found, though it contains strong constraints on the size of the $CPT$ violation ($CPTV$) effects and on the role of the $B$ (baryon number) nonconserving interactions which are needed for it.
