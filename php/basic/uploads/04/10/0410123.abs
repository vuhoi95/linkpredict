Title: Dualities, Twists, and Gauge Theories with Non-Constant  Non-Commutativity
Authors: Akikazu Hashimoto and Keith Thomas
Abstract: We study the world volume theory of D3-branes wrapping the Melvin universe supported by background NSNS B-field. In the appropriate decoupling limit, the open string dynamics is that of non-commutative guage field theory with non-constant non-commutativity. We identify this model as a simple Melvin twist of flat D3 branes. Along similar lines, one recognizes the model of Hashimoto and Sethi as being the Melvin null twist, and the model of Dolan and Nappi as being the null Melvin twist, of the flat D3-brane. This construction therefore offers a unified perspective on most of the known explicit constructions of non-commutative gauge theories as a decoupled theory of D-branes in a B-field background. We also describe the world volume theory on the D3-brane in Melvin universe which is decaying via the nucleation of monopole anti-monopole pair.
