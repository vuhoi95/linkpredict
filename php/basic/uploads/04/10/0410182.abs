Title: Wilson Loops and Vertex Operators in Matrix Model
Authors: Satoshi Iso and Hidenori Terachi and Hiroshi Umetsu
Abstract: We systematically construct wave functions and vertex operators in the type IIB (IKKT) matrix model by expanding a supersymmetric Wilson loop operator. They form a massless multiplet of the N=2 type IIB supergravity and automatically satisfy conservation laws.
