Abstract: We discuss Fayet-Iliopoulos terms in the context of five-dimensional supergravity compactified on an orbifold. For this purpose we use our superfield formulation of the off-shell 5D SUGRA. In the case of tuned FI terms, contrary to other claims, we find BPS solutions which ensure that N=1 supersymmetry is unbroken also in warped geometries. As in the rigid case, the FI terms induce odd masses for charged hypermultiplets, leading to the (de)localisation of the KK wave-functions near the fix-point branes. In the case of ungauged U(1)_R symmetry, we present also supersymmetric warped solutions in the presence of non-trivial profiles of charged hyperscalars.
