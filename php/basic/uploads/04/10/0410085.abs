Title: On divergent 3-vertices in noncommutative SU(2)gauge theory
Authors: Maja Buric and Voja Radovanovic
Abstract: We analyze divergencies in 2-point and 3-point functions for noncommutative $\theta$-expanded SU(2)-gauge theory with massless fermions. We show that, after field redefinition and renormalization of couplings, one divergent term remains.
