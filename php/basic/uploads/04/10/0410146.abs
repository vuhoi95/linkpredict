Title: Quasi-local rotating black holes in higher dimension: geometry
Authors: Jerzy Lewandowski and Tomasz Pawlowski
Abstract: With a help of a generalized Raychaudhuri equation non-expanding null surfaces are studied in arbitrarily dimensional case. The definition and basic properties of non-expanding and isolated horizons known in the literature in the 4 and 3 dimensional cases are generalized. A local description of horizon's geometry is provided. The Zeroth Law of black hole thermodynamics is derived. The constraints have a similar structure to that of the 4 dimensional spacetime case. The geometry of a vacuum isolated horizon is determined by the induced metric and the rotation 1-form potential, local generalizations of the area and the angular momentum typically used in the stationary black hole solutions case.
