Title: Spacetime quantization induced by axial currents
Authors: S. Carneiro and M. C. Nemes
Abstract: In the present contribution we show that the introduction of a conserved axial current in electrodynamics can explain the quantization of electric charge, inducing at the same time a dynamical quantization of spacetime.
