Title: Sum rules in the oscillator radiation processes
Authors: R. Casana and G. Flores-Hidalgo and B. M. Pimentel
Abstract: We consider the problem of an harmonic oscillator coupled to a scalar field in the framework of recently introduced dressed coordinates. We compute all the probabilities associated with the decay process of an excited level of the oscillator. Instead of doing direct quantum mechanical calculations we establish some sum rules from which we infer the probabilities associated to the different decay processes of the oscillator. Thus, the sum rules allows to show that the transition probabilities between excited levels follow a binomial distribution.
