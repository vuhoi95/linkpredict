Title: On matrix models for anomalous dimensions of super Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Stefano Bellucci and Corneliu Sochichiu
Abstract: We consider the matrix model approach to the anomalous dimension matrix in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang--Mills theory. We construct the path integral representation for the anomalous dimension density matrix and analyze the resulting action. In particular, we consider the large $N$ limit, which results in a classical field theory. Since the same limit leads to spin chains, we propose to consider the former as an alternative description of the latter. We consider also the limit of small $N$, which corresponds to the restriction to the diagrams of maximal topological genus.
