Title: Higher spin fields from indefinite Kac-Moody algebras
Authors: Sophie de Buyl and Axel Kleinschmidt
Abstract: The emergence of higher spin fields in the Kac-Moody theoretic approach to M-theory is studied. This is based on work done by Schnakenburg, West and the second author. We then study the relation of higher spin fields in this approach to other results in different constructions of higher spin field dynamics. Of particular interest is the construction of space-time in the present set-up and we comment on the various existing proposals.
