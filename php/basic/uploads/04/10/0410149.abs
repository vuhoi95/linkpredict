Title: Massive Tensor Multiplets in N=1 Supersymmetry
Authors: Jan Louis and Waldemar Schulgin
Abstract: We derive the action for a massive tensor multiplet coupled to chiral and vector multiplets as it can appear in orientifold compactifications of type IIB string theory.We compute the potential of the theory and show its consistency with the corresponding Kaluza-Klein reduction of N=1 orientifold compactifications. The potential contains an explicit mass term for the scalar in the tensor multiplet which does not arise from eliminating an auxiliary field. A dual action with an additional massive vector multiplet is derived at the level of superfields.
