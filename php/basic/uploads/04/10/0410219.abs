Title: Covariance of the selfdual vector model
Authors: P. J. Arias and M. Garcia-Nustes
Abstract: The Poisson algebra between the fields involved in the vectorial selfdual action is obtained by means of the reduced action. The conserved charges associated with the invariance under the inhomogeneous Lorentz group are obtained and its action on the fields. The covariance of the theory is proved using the Schwinger-Dirac algebra. The spin of the excitations is discussed.
