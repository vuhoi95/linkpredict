Title: Geometric Kac-Moody Modularity
Authors: Monika Lynker and Rolf Schimmrigk
Abstract: It is shown how the arithmetic structure of algebraic curves encoded in the Hasse-Weil L-function can be related to affine Kac-Moody algebras. This result is useful in relating the arithmetic geometry of Calabi-Yau varieties to the underlying exactly solvable theory. In the case of the genus three Fermat curve we identify the Hasse-Weil L-function with the Mellin transform of the twist of a number theoretic modular form derived from the string function of a non-twisted affine Lie algebra. The twist character is associated to the number field of quantum dimensions of the conformal field theory.
