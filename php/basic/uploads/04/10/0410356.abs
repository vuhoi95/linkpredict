Title: The Cosmological Evolution of Domain Wall Networks
Authors: J. C. R. E. Oliveira and C. J. A. P. Martins and P. P. Avelino
Abstract: We have studied the cosmological evolution of domain wall networks in two, three and four spatial dimensions using high-resolution field theory simulations. The dynamical range and number of our simulations is larger than in previous works, but does not allow us to exclude previous hints of deviations to the naively expected scale-invariant evolution. These results therefore suggest that the approach of domain wall networks to linear scaling is a much slower process than that of cosmic strings, which has been previously characterized in detail.
