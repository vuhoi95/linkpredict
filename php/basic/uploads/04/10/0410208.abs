Title: Superconducting Topological Fluids in Josephson Junction Arrays
Authors: M. Cristina Diamantini and Pasquale Sodano and Carlo A. Trugenberger
Abstract: We argue that the frustrated Josephson junction arrays may support a topologically ordered superconducting ground state, characterized by a non-trivial ground state degeneracy on the torus. This superconducting quantum fluid provides an explicit example of a system in which superconductivity arises from a topological mechanism rather than from the usual Landau-Ginzburg mechanism.
