Title: Elliptic Calabi-Yau Threefolds with Z_3 x Z_3 Wilson Lines
Authors: Volker Braun and Burt A. Ovrut and Tony Pantev and Rene Reinbacher
Abstract: A torus fibered Calabi-Yau threefold with first homotopy group Z_3 x Z_3 is constructed as a free quotient of a fiber product of two dP_9 surfaces. Calabi-Yau threefolds of this type admit Z_3 x Z_3 Wilson lines. In conjunction with SU(4) holomorphic vector bundles, such vacua lead to anomaly free, three generation models of particle physics with a right handed neutrino and a U(1)_{B-L} gauge factor, in addition to the SU(3)_C x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y standard model gauge group. This factor helps to naturally suppress nucleon decay. The moduli space and Dolbeault cohomology of the threefold is also discussed.
