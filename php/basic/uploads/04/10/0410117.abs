Abstract: The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe microwave background data suggest that the primordial spectrum of scalar curvature fluctuations is suppressed at small wavenumbers. We propose a UV/IR mixing effect in small-field inflationary models that can explain the observable deviation in WMAP data from the concordance model. Specifically, in inflationary models where the inflaton couples to an asymptotically free gauge theory, the radiative corrections to the effective inflaton potential can be anomalously large. This occurs for small values of the inflaton field which are of the order of the gauge theory strong coupling scale. Radiative corrections cause the inflaton potential to blow up at small values of the inflaton field. As a result, these corrections can violate the slow-roll condition at the initial stage of the inflation and suppress the production of scalar density perturbations.
