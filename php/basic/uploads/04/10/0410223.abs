Title: Back-Reaction and the Trans-Planckian Problem of Inflation Revisited
Authors: Robert H. Brandenberger and Jerome Martin
Abstract: It has recently been suggested that Planck scale physics may effect the evolution of cosmological fluctuations in the early stages of cosmological inflation in a non-trivial way, leading to an excited state for modes whose wavelength is super-Planck but sub-Hubble. In this case, the issue of how this excited state back-reacts on the background space-time arises. In fact, it has been suggested that such back-reaction effects may lead to tight constraints on the magnitude of possible deviations from the usual predictions of inflation. In this note we discuss some subtle aspects of this back-reaction issue and point out that rather than preventing inflation, the back-reaction of ultraviolet fluctuations may simply lead to a renormalization of the cosmological constant driving inflation.
