Title: The transition of 2-dimensional solitons to 1-dimensional ones on  hexagonal lattices
Authors: Betti Hartmann and Wojtek Zakrzewski
Abstract: We study solitons arising in a system describing the interaction of a two-dimensional discrete hexagonal lattice with an additional electron field (or, in general, an exciton field). We assume that this interaction is electron-phonon-like. In our previous paper [4], we have studied the existence of two-dimensional solitons and have found that these solitons exist only if the electron-phonon coupling constant is sufficiently large. In this paper, we report the results of our investigation for small values of this constant, close to its critical value for the existence of solitons. We find that as the coupling decreases the soliton gets very broad and then becomes effectively one-dimensional.
