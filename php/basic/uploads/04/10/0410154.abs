Title: New hairy black hole solutions with a dilaton potential
Authors: Eugen Radu and D. H. Tchrakian
Abstract: We consider black hole solutions with a dilaton field possessing a nontrivial potential approaching a constant negative value at infinity. The asymptotic behaviour of the dilaton field is assumed to be slower than that of a localized distribution of matter. A nonabelian SU(2) gauge field is also included in the total action. The mass of the solutions admitting a power series expansion in $1/r$ at infinity and preserving the asymptotic anti-de Sitter geometry is computed by using a counterterm subtraction method. Numerical arguments are presented for the existence of hairy black hole solutions for a dilaton potential of the form $V(\phi)=C_1 \exp(2\alpha_1 \phi)+C_2 \exp(2\alpha_2 \phi)+C_3$, special attention being paid to the case of ${\cal N}=4, D=4$ gauged supergravity model of Gates and Zwiebach.
