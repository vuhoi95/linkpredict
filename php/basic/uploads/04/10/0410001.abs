Title: The Dual Meissner Effect and Magnetic Displacement Currents
Authors: Tsuneo Suzuki and Katsuya Ishiguro and Yoshihiro Mori and Toru Sekido
Abstract: The dual Meissner effect is observed without monopoles in quenched $SU (2)$ QCD with Landau gauge-fixing. Magnetic displacement currents which are time-dependent Abelian magnetic fields play a role of solenoidal currents squeezing Abelian electric fields. Monopoles are not always necessary to the dual Meissner effect. The squeezing of the electric flux means the dual London equation and the massiveness of the Abelian electric fields as an asymptotic field. The mass generation of the Abelian electric fields is related to a gluon condensate $<A^a_{\mu}A^a_{\mu}>\neq 0$ of mass dimension 2.
