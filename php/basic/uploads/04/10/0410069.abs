Title: Unified Models of Inflation and Quintessence
Authors: Andro Gonzalez and Tonatiuh Matos and Israel Quiros
Abstract: We apply an extended version of the method developed in reference Int.J.Mod.Phys.D5(1996)71, to derive exact cosmological (flat) Friedmann-Robertson-Walker solutions in RS2 brane models with a perfect fluid of ordinary matter plus a scalar field fluid trapped on the brane. We found new exact solutions, that can serve to unify inflation and quintessence in a common theoretical framework.
