Title: Deformed Supersymmetry in Non(anti)commutative N=2 Supersymmetric U(1)  Gauge Theory
Authors: Takeo Araki and Katsushi Ito and Akihisa Ohtsuka
Abstract: We study N=2 supersymmetric U(1) gauge theory in non(anti)commutative N=2 harmonic superspace with the chirality preserving non-singlet deformation parameter. By solving the Wess-Zumino gauge preserving conditions for the analytic superfield, we construct the deformed N=(1,0) supersymmetry transformation for component fields up to the first order in the deformation parameter.
