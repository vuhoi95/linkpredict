Title: Photon-graviton pair conversion
Authors: A. Kallberg and G. Brodin and M. Marklund
Abstract: We consider the conversion of gravitons and photons as a four-wave mixing process. A nonlinear coupled systems of equations involving two gravitons and two photons is obtained, and the energy exchange between the different degrees of freedom is found. The scattering amplitudes are obtained, from which a crossection for incoherent processes can be found. An analytical example is given, and applications to the early Universe are discussed.
