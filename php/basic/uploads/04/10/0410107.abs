Authors: Vitor Cardoso and Jose' P. S. Lemos and Shijun Yoshida
Abstract: The study of the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the 2+1 dimensional rotating draining bathtub acoustic black hole, the closest analogue found so far to the Kerr black hole, is performed. Both the real and imaginary parts of the quasinormal (QN) frequencies as a function of the rotation parameter B are found through a full non-linear numerical analysis. Since there is no change in sign in the imaginary part of the frequency as B is increased we conclude that the 2+1 dimensional rotating draining bathtub acoustic black hole is stable against small perturbations.
