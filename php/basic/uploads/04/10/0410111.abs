Title: On the classical central charge
Authors: M. Blagojevic and M. Vasilic
Abstract: In the canonical formulation of a classical field theory, symmetry properties are encoded in the Poisson bracket algebra, which may have a central term. Starting from this well understood canonical structure, we derive the related Lagrangian form of the central term.
