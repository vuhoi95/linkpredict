Authors: Yu. P. Solovyov and V. V. Belokurov and E. T. Shavgulidze
Abstract: A nonlocal generalization of quantum field theory in which momentum space is the space of continuous maps of a circle into $\mathbf{R}^4$ is proposed. Functional integrals in this theory are proved to exist. Renormalized quantum field model is obtained as a local limit of the proposed theory.
