Authors: M. Daszkiewicz and K. Imilkowska and J. Kowalski-Glikman and S. Nowak
Abstract: In this paper we recall the construction of scalar field action on $\kappa$-Minkowski space-time and investigate its properties. In particular we show how the co-product of $\kappa$-Poincar\'e algebra of symmetries arises from the analysis of the symmetries of the action, expressed in terms of Fourier transformed fields. We also derive the action on commuting space-time, equivalent to the original one. Adding the self-interaction $\Phi^4$ term we investigate the modified conservation laws. We show that the local interactions on $\kappa$-Minkowski space-time give rise to 6 inequivalent ways in which energy and momentum can be conserved at four-point vertex. We discuss the relevance of these results for Doubly Special Relativity.
