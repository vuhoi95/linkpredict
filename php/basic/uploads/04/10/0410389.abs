Title: The Eigenfunctions of the q-Harmonic Oscillator on the Quantum Line
Authors: Harald Grosse and Stefan Schraml
Abstract: We construct a complete set of eigenfunctions of the q-deformed harmonic oscillator on the quantum line. In particular the eigenfunctions corresponding to the non-Fock part of the spectrum will be constructed.
