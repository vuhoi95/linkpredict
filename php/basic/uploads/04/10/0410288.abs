Title: The supermembrane with central charge as a bundle of D2-D0 branes
Authors: M. P. Garcia del Moral and A. Restuccia
Abstract: We discuss the consistency of the D=11 supermembranes with non zero central charge arising from a nontrivial winding CSNW. The spectrum of its regularized Hamiltonian is discrete and its heat kernel in terms of a Feynman formula may be rigorously constructed. The $N\to\infty$ limit is discussed. Since CSNW is equivalent to a noncommutative supersymmetric gauge theory on a general Riemann surface, its consistency provides a proof that all of them are well defined quantum theories. We interpret the supermembrane with central charge $n$, in the type IIA picture, as a bundle of D2 branes with $n$ units of D0 charge induced by a nonconstant magnetic flux.
