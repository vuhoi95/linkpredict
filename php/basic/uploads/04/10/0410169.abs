Title: Gravitino production from reheating in split supersymmetry
Authors: Rouzbeh Allahverdi and Asko Jokinen and Anupam Mazumdar
Abstract: We discuss gravitino production from reheating in models where the splitting between particle and sparticle masses can be larger than TeV, as naturally arising in the context of split supersymmetry. We show that such a production typically dominates over thermal contributions arising from the interactions of gauginos, squarks and sleptons. We constrain the supersymmetry breaking scale of the relevant sector for a given reheat temperature. However the situation changes when the gravitinos dominate the Universe and decay before nucleosynthesis. We briefly describe prospects for a successful baryogenesis and a viable neutralino dark matter in this case.
