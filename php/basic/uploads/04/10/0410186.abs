Title: Topological mass term in effective Brane-World scenario with torsion
Authors: Nelson R. F. Braga and Cristine N. Ferreira
Abstract: In this work we investigate a braneworld scenario where a Kalb-Ramond field propagates, together with gravity, in a five dimensional AdS slice. The rank-2 Kalb-Ramond field is associated with torsion. We study the compactification of the Kalb-Ramond field to four dimensional space-time without gauge fixing, focusing on the effects of torsion. On the brane the Kalb-Ramond field interacts with $A_{\mu}$-gauge and scalar matter fields. We analyze the propagators of this theory and as an application investigate the consistency of such a model in the presence of a cosmic string configuration. One interesting feature of this model is the presence of topological charge coming from a topological mass term that couples the gauge field $A_{\mu}$ with Kalb-Ramond modes.
