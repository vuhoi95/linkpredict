Title: Remarks on the rolling tachyon BCFT
Authors: Matthias R. Gaberdiel and Michael Gutperle
Abstract: It is shown how the boundary correlators of the Euclidean theory corresponding to the rolling tachyon solution can be calculated directly from Sen's boundary state. The resulting formulae reproduce precisely the expected perturbative open string answer. We also determine the open string spectrum and comment on the implications of our results for the timelike theory.
