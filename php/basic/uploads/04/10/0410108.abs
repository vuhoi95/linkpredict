Title: Noncommutative Riemann Conditions
Authors: Eunsang Kim and Hoil Kim
Abstract: In this paper we study the holomorphic bundles over a noncommutative complex torus. We define a noncommutative abelian variety as a kind of deformation of abelian variety and we show that for a restricted deformation parameter, one can define a noncommutative abelian variety. Also, along the cohomological deformation, we discuss the noncommutative analogue of usual Riemann conditions. This will be done by using the real cohomologies instead of the rational ones.
