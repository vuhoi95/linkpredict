Title: T-duality for the sigma model with boundaries
Authors: Cecilia Albertsson and Ulf Lindstrom and Maxim Zabzine
Abstract: We derive the most general local boundary conditions necessary for T-duality to be compatible with superconformal invariance of the two-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model with boundaries. To this end, we construct a consistent gauge invariant parent action by gauging a U(1) isometry, with and without boundary interactions. We investigate the behaviour of the boundary conditions under T-duality, and interpret the results in terms of D-branes.
