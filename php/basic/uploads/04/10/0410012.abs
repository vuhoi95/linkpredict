Title: Tensor extension of the Poincar√© algebra
Authors: Dmitrij V. Soroka and Vyacheslav A. Soroka
Abstract: A tensor extension of the Poincar\'e algebra is proposed for the arbitrary dimensions. Casimir operators of the extension are constructed. A possible supersymmetric generalization of this extension is also found in the dimensions $D=2,3,4$.
