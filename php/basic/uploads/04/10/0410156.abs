Abstract: We study issues of duality in 3D field theory models over a canonical noncommutative spacetime and obtain the noncommutative extension of the Self-Dual model induced by the Seiberg-Witten map. We apply the dual projection technique to uncover some properties of the noncommutative Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory up to first-order in the noncommutative parameter. A duality between this theory and a model similar to the ordinary self-dual model is estabilished. The correspondence of the basic fields is obtained and the equivalence of algebras and equations of motion are directly verified. We also comment on previous results in this subject.
