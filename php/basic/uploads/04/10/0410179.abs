Title: Abelian homotopy Dijkgraaf-Witten theory
Authors: S. K. Hansen and J. K. Slingerland and P. R. Turner
Abstract: We construct a version of Dijkgraaf-Witten theory based on a compact abelian Lie group within the formalism of Turaev's homotopy quantum field theory. As an application we show that the 2+1-dimensional theory based on U(1) classifies lens spaces up to homotopy type.
