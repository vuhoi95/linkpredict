Title: On High Energy Scattering in Extra Dimensions
Authors: D. I. Kazakov and G. S. Vartanov
Abstract: We analyze the behaviour of the high-energy scattering amplitude within the brane world scenario in extra dimensions. We argue that contrary to the popular opinion based on the Kaluza-Klein approach, the cross-section does not increase with energy, but changes the slope close to the compactification scale and then decreases like in the 4-dimensional theory. A particular example of the quark-antiquark scattering due to the gluon exchange in the bulk is considered.
