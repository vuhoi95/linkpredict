Title: On the Temperature Dependence of the Casimir Effect

Abstract: The temperature dependence of the Casimir force between a real metallic plate and a metallic sphere is analyzed on the basis of optical data concerning the dispersion relation of metals such as gold and copper. Realistic permittivities imply, together with basic thermodynamic considerations, that the transverse electric zero mode does not contribute. This results in observable differences with the conventional prediction, which does not take this physical requirement into account. The results are shown to be consistent with the third law of thermodynamics, as well as being consistent with current experiments. However, the predicted temperature dependence should be detectable in future experiments. The inadequacies of approaches based on {\it ad hoc} assumptions, such as the plasma dispersion relation and the use of surface impedance without transverse momentum dependence, are discussed.
