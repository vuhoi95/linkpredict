Title: Infrared QCD and the Renormalisation Group
Authors: Daniel F. Litim and Jan M. Pawlowski and Sergei Nedelko and Lorenz v. Smekal
Abstract: We study the infrared regime of QCD by means of a Wilsonian renormalisation group. We explain how, in general, the infrared structure of Green functions is deduced in this approach. Our reasoning is put to work in Landau gauge QCD, where the leading infrared terms of the propagators are computed. The results support the Kugo-Ojima scenario of confinement. Possible extensions are indicated.
