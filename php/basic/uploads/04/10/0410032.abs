Title: Spontaneous symmetry breaking of a hyperbolic sigma model in three  dimensions
Authors: T. Spencer and M. R. Zirnbauer
Abstract: Non-linear sigma models that arise from the supersymmetric approach to disordered electron systems contain a non-compact bosonic sector. We study the model with target space H^2, the two-hyperboloid with isometry group SU(1,1), and prove that in three dimensions moments of the fields are finite in the thermodynamic limit. Thus the non-compact symmetry SU(1,1) is spontaneously broken. The bound on moments is compatible with the presence of extended states.
