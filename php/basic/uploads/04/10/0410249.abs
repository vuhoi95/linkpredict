Title: On Dual Formulation for Higher Spin Gauge Fields in $(A)dS_d$
Authors: A. S. Matveev and M. A. Vasiliev
Abstract: We obtain dual actions for spin $s \geq 2$ massless fields in $(A)dS_d$ by solving different algebraic constraints in the same first-order theory. Flat space dual higher spin actions obtained by Boulanger, Cnockaert and Henneaux \cite{BH} by solving differential constraints are shown to result from our formulation in a sort of quasi-classical approximation for the flat limit. The case of $s=2$ is considered in detail.
