Title: Classical/quantum integrability in non-compact sector of AdS/CFT
Authors: V. A. Kazakov and K. Zarembo
Abstract: We discuss non-compact SL(2,R) sectors in N=4 SYM and in AdS string theory and compare their integrable structures. We formulate and solve the Riemann-Hilbert problem for the finite gap solutions of the classical sigma model and show that at one loop it is identical to the classical limit of Bethe equations of the spin (-1/2) chain for the dilatation operator of SYM.
