Title: Gauge Symmetry Breaking with a Large Mass Hierarchy
Authors: Tomoaki Nagasawa and Makoto Sakamoto
Abstract: We propose a higher dimensional scenario to solve the gauge hierarchy problem. In our formulation, a crucial observation is that a supersymmetric structure is hidden in the 4d spectrum of any gauge invariant theories with compact extra dimensions and that the gauge symmetry breaking is directly related to the supersymmetry breaking.
