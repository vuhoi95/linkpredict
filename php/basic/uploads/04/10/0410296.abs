Abstract: Recently, it has been shown that the holomorphic anomaly of unitarity cuts can be used as a tool in determining the one-loop amplitudes in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. It is interesting to examine whether this method can be applied to more general cases. We present results for a non-MHV N=1 supersymmetric one-loop amplitude. We show that the holomorphic anomaly of each unitarity cut correctly reproduces the action on the amplitude's imaginary part of the differential operators corresponding to collinearity in twistor space. We find that the use of the holomorphic anomaly to evaluate the amplitude requires the solution of differential rather than algebraic equations.
