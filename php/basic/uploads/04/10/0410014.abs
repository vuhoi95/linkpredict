Title: A Six Dimensional View on Twistors
Authors: Annamaria Sinkovics and Erik Verlinde
Abstract: We study the twistor formulation of the classical N=4 super Yang-Mills theory on the quadric submanifold of CP(3|3) X CP(3|3). We reformulate the twistor equations in six dimension, where the superconformal symmetry is manifest, and find a connection to complexified AdS5.
