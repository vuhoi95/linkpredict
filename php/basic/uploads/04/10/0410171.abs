Abstract: We compute energies and energy densities of static electromagnetic flux tubes in three and four spacetime dimensions. Our calculation uses scattering data from the potential induced by the flux tube and imposes standard perturbative renormalization conditions. The calculation is exact to one-loop order, with no additional approximation adopted. We embed the flux tube in a configuration with zero total flux so that we can fully apply standard results from scattering theory. We find that upon choosing the same on-shell renormalization conditions, the functional dependence of the energy and energy density on the parameters of the flux tube is very similar for three and four spacetime dimensions. We compare our exact results to those obtained from the derivative and perturbation expansion approximations, and find good agreement for appropriate parameters of the flux tube. This remedies some puzzles in the prior literature.
