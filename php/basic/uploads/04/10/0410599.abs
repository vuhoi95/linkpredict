Title: Generalized Elitzur's Theorem and Dimensional Reduction
Authors: Cristian D. Batista and Zohar Nussinov
Abstract: We extend Elitzur's theorem to systems with symmetries intermediate between global and local. In general, our theorem formalizes the idea of {\it dimensional reduction}. We apply the results of this generalization to many systems that are of current interest. These include liquid crystalline phases of Quantum Hall systems, orbital systems, geometrically frustrated spin lattices, Bose metals, and models of superconducting arrays.
