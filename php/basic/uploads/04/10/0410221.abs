Title: New Vacuum of Bethe Ansatz Solutions in Thirring Model
Authors: T. Fujita and M. Hiramoto and T. Homma and H. Takahashi
Abstract: We find a new vacuum of the Bethe ansatz solutions in the massless Thirring model. This vacuum breaks the chiral symmetry and has the lower energy than the well-known symmetric vacuum energy. Further, we evaluate the energy spectrum of the one particle-one hole ($1p-1h$) states, and find that it has a finite gap. The analytical expressions for the true vacuum as well as for the lowest $1p-1h$ excited state are also found. Further, we examine the bosonization of the massless Thirring model and prove that the well-known procedure of bosonization of the massless Thirring model is incomplete because of the lack of the zero mode in the boson field.
