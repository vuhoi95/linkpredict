Title: A sphaleron for the non-Abelian anomaly
Authors: F. R. Klinkhamer and C. Rupp
Abstract: A self-consistent Ansatz for a new sphaleron of SU(3) Yang-Mills-Higgs theory is presented. With a single triplet of Weyl fermions added, there exists, most likely, one pair of fermion zero modes, which is known to give rise to the non-Abelian (Bardeen) anomaly as a Berry phase. The corresponding SU(3) gauge field configuration could take part in the nonperturbative dynamics of Quantum Chromodynamics.
