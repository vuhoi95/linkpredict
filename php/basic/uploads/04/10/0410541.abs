Title: Cosmological influence of super-Hubble perturbations
Authors: Edward W. Kolb and Sabino Matarrese and Alessio Notari and Antonio Riotto
Abstract: The existence of cosmological perturbations of wavelength larger than the Hubble radius is a generic prediction of the inflationary paradigm. We provide the derivation beyond perturbation theory of a conserved quantity which generalizes the linear comoving curvature perturbation. As a by-product, we show that super-Hubble-radius (super-Hubble) perturbations have no physical influence on local observables e.g., the local expansion rate) if cosmological perturbations are of the adiabatic type.
