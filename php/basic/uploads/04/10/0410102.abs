Title: Shape Invariant Potentials in "Discrete Quantum Mechanics"
Authors: S. Odake and R. Sasaki
Abstract: Shape invariance is an important ingredient of many exactly solvable quantum mechanics. Several examples of shape invariant ``discrete quantum mechanical systems" are introduced and discussed in some detail. They arise in the problem of describing the equilibrium positions of Ruijsenaars-Schneider type systems, which are "discrete" counterparts of Calogero and Sutherland systems, the celebrated exactly solvable multi-particle dynamics. Deformed Hermite and Laguerre polynomials are the typical examples of the eigenfunctions of the above shape invariant discrete quantum mechanical systems.
