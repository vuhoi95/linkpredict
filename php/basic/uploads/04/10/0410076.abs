Title: A Stringy Cloak for a Classical Singularity
Authors: Atish Dabholkar and Renata Kallosh and Alexander Maloney
Abstract: We consider a class of 4D supersymmetric black hole solutions, arising from string theory compactifications, which classically have vanishing horizon area and singular space-time geometry. String theory motivates the inclusion of higher derivative terms, which convert these singular classical solutions into regular black holes with finite horizon area. In particular, the supersymmetric attractor equations imply that the central charge, which determines the radius of the $AdS_2\times S^2$ near horizon geometry, acquires a non-vanishing value due to quantum effects. In this case quantum corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking relation between entropy and area are large. This is the first explicit example where stringy quantum gravity effects replace a classical null singularity by a black hole with finite horizon area.
