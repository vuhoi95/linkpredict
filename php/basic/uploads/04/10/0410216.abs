Title: Dirac Sea for Bosons I -- Formulation of Negative Energy Sea for Bosons
Authors: Holger B. Nielsen and Masao Ninomiya
Abstract: It is proposed to make formulation of second quantizing a bosonic theory by generalizing the method of filling the Dirac negative energy sea for fermions. We interpret that the correct vacuum for the bosonic theory is obtained by adding minus one boson to each single particle negative energy states while the positive energy states are empty. The boson states are divided into two sectors ; the usual positive sector with positive and zero numbers of bosons and the negative sector with negative numbers of bosons. Once it comes into the negative sector it cannot return to the usual positive sector by ordinary interaction due to a barrier. It is suggested to use as a playground model in which the filling of empty fermion Dirac sea and the removal of boson from the negative energy states are not yet performed. We put forward such a naive vacuum world in the present paper. The successive paper will concern a CPT-like Theorem in the naive vacuum world.
