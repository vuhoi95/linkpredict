Abstract: We extend the study of BPS equations in ${\cal N}=1/2$ super Yang-Mills theory to the case of models with gauge symmetry breaking. We first consider an Abelian gauge-Higgs supersymmetric Lagrangian in $d=4$ dimensional Euclidean space obtained by deforming ${\cal N} = 1$ superspace. The supermultiplets include chiral and vector superfields and its bosonic content coincides with that of the Abelian Higgs model where vortex solutions to the BPS equation are known to exist in the undeformed case. We also consider the $d=3$ dimensional reduction of a non-Abelian $d=4$ deformed model and study its deformed BPS equations, showing the existence of new monopole solutions which depend on the deformation parameter.
