Title: Lorentz invariant and supersymmetric interpretation of noncommutative  quantum field theory
Authors: Yoshishige Kobayashi and Shin Sasaki
Abstract: In this paper, using a Hopf-algebraic method, we construct deformed Poincar\'e SUSY algebra in terms of twisted (Hopf) algebra. By adapting this twist deformed super-Poincar\'e algrebra as our fundamental symmetry, we can see the consistency between the algebra and non(anti)commutative relation among (super)coordinates and interpret that symmetry of non(anti)commutative QFT is in fact twisted one. The key point is validity of our new twist element that guarantees non(anti)commutativity of space. It is checked in this paper for N=1 case. We also comment on the possibility of noncommutative central charge coordinate. Finally, because our twist operation does not break the original algebra, we can claim that (twisted) SUSY is not broken in contrast to the string inspired $\mathcal{N}=1/2$ SUSY in N=1 non(anti)commutative superspace.
