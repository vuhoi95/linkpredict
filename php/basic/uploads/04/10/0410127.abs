Title: Primary fields and screening currents of gl(2|2) non-unitary conformal  field theory
Authors: Yao-Zhong Zhang and Xin Liu and Wen-Li Yang
Abstract: The non-semisimple $gl(2|2)_k$ current superalgebra in the standard basis and the corresponding non-unitary conformal field theory are investigated. Infinite families of primary fields corresponding to all finite-dimensional irreducible typical and atypical representations of $gl(2|2)$ and three (two even and one odd) screening currents of the first kind are constructed explicitly in terms of ten free fields.
