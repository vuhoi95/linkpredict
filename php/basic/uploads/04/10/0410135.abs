Title: On the mass of a Kerr-anti-de Sitter spacetime in D dimensions
Authors: Nathalie Deruelle and Joseph Katz
Abstract: We show how to compute the mass of a Kerr-anti-de Sitter spacetime with respect to the anti-de Sitter background in any dimension, using a superpotential which has been derived from standard Noether identities. The calculation takes no account of the source of the curvature and confirms results obtained for black holes via the first law of thermodynamics.
