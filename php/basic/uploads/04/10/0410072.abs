Title: The QCD analytic running coupling and chiral symmetry breaking
Authors: A. V. Nesterenko and J. Papavassiliou
Abstract: We study the dependence on the pion mass of the QCD effective charge by employing the dispersion relations for the Adler D function. This new massive analytic running coupling is compared to the effective coupling saturated by the dynamically generated gluon mass. A qualitative picture of the possible impact of the former coupling on the chiral symmetry breaking is presented.
