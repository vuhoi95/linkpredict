Title: A time-dependent brane in a cosmological background
Authors: Nicolaos Toumbas and Jan Troost
Abstract: We study a moving D-brane in a time-dependent background. There is particle production both because of non-trivial cosmological evolution, and by closed string emission from the brane that gradually decelerates due to a gain in mass. The particular model under study is a D0-brane in an SL(2,R)/U(1) cosmology -- the techniques used extend to other backgrounds.
