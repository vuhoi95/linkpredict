Title: Canonical equivalence between massive spin 1 theories
Authors: Pio J. Arias and Jean C. Perez-Mosquera
Abstract: The model of Cremmer-Scherck and Proca are considered in dimensions greater than 3+1. It is obtained that the Proca model correspond to a gauged fixed version of the Cremmer-Scherck one, and we show their canonical equivalence.
