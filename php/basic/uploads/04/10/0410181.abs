Title: Effective Abelian-Higgs Theory from SU(2) gauge field theory
Authors: V. Dzhunushaliev and D. Singleton and D. Dhokarh
Abstract: In the present work we show that it is possible to arrive at a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) like equation from pure SU(2) gauge theory. This has a connection to the dual superconducting model for color confinement where color flux tubes permanently bind quarks into color neutral states. The GL Lagrangian with a spontaneous symmetry breaking potential, has such (Nielsen-Olesen) flux tube solutions. The spontaneous symmetry breaking requires a tachyonic mass for the effective scalar field. Such a tachyonic mass term is obtained from the condensation of ghost fields.
