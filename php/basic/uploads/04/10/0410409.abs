Abstract: We discuss the demise of flavour tagging due to the loss of the particle-antiparticle identity of neutral B-mesons in the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlated states. Such a situation occurs in cases where the CPT operator is ill-defined, as happens, for example, in quantum gravity models with induced decoherence in the matter sector. The time evolution of the perturbed B0-B0bar initial state, as produced in B-factories, is sufficient to generate new two-body states. For flavour specific decays at equal times, we discuss two definite tests of the two body entanglement: (i) search for the would-be forbidden B0 B0 and B0bar B0bar states; (ii) deviations from the indistinguishable probability between the permuted states B0bar B0 and B0 B0bar.
