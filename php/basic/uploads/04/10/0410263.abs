Title: Perturbative dynamics of fuzzy spheres at large N
Authors: Takehiro Azuma and Keiichi Nagao and Jun Nishimura
Abstract: We clarify some peculiar aspects of the perturbative expansion around a classical fuzzy-sphere solution in matrix models with a cubic term. While the effective action in the large-N limit is saturated at the one-loop level, we find that the ``one-loop dominance'' does not hold for generic observables due to one-particle reducible diagrams. However, we may exploit the one-loop dominance for the effective action and obtain various observables to all orders from one-loop calculation by simply shifting the center of expansion to the ``quantum solution'', which extremizes the effective action. We confirm the validity of this method by comparison with the direct two-loop calculation and with Monte Carlo results in the 3d Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons matrix model. From the all order result we find that the perturbative expansion has a finite radius of convergence.
