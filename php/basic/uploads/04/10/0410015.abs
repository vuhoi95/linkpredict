Title: On polynomial solutions of Heun equation
Authors: N. Gurappa and Prasanta K. Panigrahi
Abstract: By making use of a recently developed method to solve linear differential equations of arbitrary order, we find a wide class of polynomial solutions to the Heun equation. We construct the series solution to the Heun equation before identifying the polynomial solutions. The Heun equation extended by the addition of a term, $- \s/x$, is also amenable for polynomial solutions.
