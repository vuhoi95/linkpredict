Title: Neutrino mixing and cosmological constant
Authors: Massimo Blasone and Antonio Capolupo and Salvatore Capozziello and Sante Carloni and Giuseppe Vitiello
Abstract: We report on the recent result that the non--perturbative vacuum structure associated with neutrino mixing leads to a non--zero contribution to the value of the cosmological constant. Its value is estimated by using the natural cut--off appearing in the quantum field theory formalism for neutrino mixing.
