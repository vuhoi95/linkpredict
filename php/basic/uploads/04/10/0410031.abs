Title: The Cosmology of Generalized Modified Gravity Models
Authors: Sean M. Carroll and Antonio De Felice and Vikram Duvvuri and Damien A. Easson and Mark Trodden and Michael S. Turner
Abstract: We consider general curvature-invariant modifications of the Einstein-Hilbert action that become important only in regions of extremely low space-time curvature. We investigate the far future evolution of the universe in such models, examining the possibilities for cosmic acceleration and other ultimate destinies. The models generically possess de Sitter space as an unstable solution and exhibit an interesting set of attractor solutions which, in some cases, provide alternatives to dark energy models.
