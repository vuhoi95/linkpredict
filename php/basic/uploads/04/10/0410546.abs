Title: Curvature Perturbations from Broken Symmetries
Authors: Edward W. Kolb and Antonio Riotto and Alberto Vallinotto
Abstract: We present a new general mechanism to generate curvature perturbations after the end of the slow-roll phase of inflation. Our model is based on the simple assumption that the potential driving inflation is characterized by an underlying global symmetry which is slightly broken.
