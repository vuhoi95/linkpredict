Title: Historical Mistake in Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
Authors: T. Fujita and M. Hiramoto and H. Takahashi
Abstract: The prediction of a massless boson after the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the classic paper of Nambu and Jona-Lasinio (NJL) is shown to be wrong. Their mistake is due to a carelessly employed perturbative vacuum when evaluating the boson mass by summing up one loop Feynman diagrams. With the proper symmetry broken vacuum, one obtains a finite boson mass depending on the coupling constant $G$.
