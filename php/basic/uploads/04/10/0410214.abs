Title: On Charged Black Holes in Anti-de Sitter Space
Authors: Dominic Brecher and Jianyang He and Moshe Rozali
Abstract: We study the region inside the event horizon of charged black holes in five dimensional asymptotically anti-de Sitter space, using as a probe two-sided correlators which are dominated by spacelike geodesics penetrating the horizon. The spacetimes we investigate include the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole and perturbations thereof. The perturbed spacetimes can be found exactly, enabling us to perform a local scan of the region between the inner and outer horizons. Surprisingly, the two-sided correlators we calculate seem to be geometrically protected from the instability of the inner horizon.
