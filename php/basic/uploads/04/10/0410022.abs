Title: Spin chain sigma models with fermions
Authors: Rafael Hernandez and Esperanza Lopez
Abstract: The complete one-loop planar dilatation operator of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills is isomorphic to the hamiltonian of an integrable PSU(2,2|4) quantum spin chain. We construct the non-linear sigma models describing the continuum limit of the SU(1|3) and SU(2|3) sectors of the complete N=4 chain. We explicitely identify the spin chain sigma model with the one for a superstring moving in AdS_5xS^5 with large angular momentum along the five-sphere.
