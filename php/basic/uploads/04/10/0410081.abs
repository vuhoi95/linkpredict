Title: On Calabi-Yau supermanifolds II
Authors: Martin Rocek and Neal Wadhwa
Abstract: We study when Calabi-Yau supermanifolds M(1|2) with one complex bosonic coordinate and two complex fermionic coordinates are super Ricci-flat, and find that if the bosonic manifold is compact, it must have constant scalar curvature.
