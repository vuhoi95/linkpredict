Title: Discrete regularisation of localised kinetic terms
Authors: Francisco del Aguila and Manuel Perez-Victoria and Jose Santiago
Abstract: We investigate the behaviour of 5d models with general brane kinetic terms by discretising the extra dimension. We show that in the continuum limit the Kaluza-Klein masses and wave functions are in general nonanalytic in the coefficients of brane terms.
