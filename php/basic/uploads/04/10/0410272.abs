Title: Effective Supergravity Actions for Conifold Transitions
Authors: Thomas Mohaupt and Frank Saueressig
Abstract: We construct gauged supergravity actions which describe the dynamics of M-theory on a Calabi-Yau threefold in the vicinity of a conifold transition. The actions explicitly include N charged hypermultiplets descending from wrapped M2-branes which become massless at the conifold point. While the vector multiplet sector can be treated exactly, we approximate the hypermultiplet sector by the non-compact Wolf spaces X(1+N). The effective action is then uniquely determined by the charges of the wrapped M2-branes.
