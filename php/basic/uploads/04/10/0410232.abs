Title: Heterotic SO(32) model building in four dimensions

Abstract: Four dimensional heterotic SO(32) orbifold models are classified systematically with model building applications in mind. We obtain all Z3, Z7 and Z2N models based on vectorial gauge shifts. The resulting gauge groups are reminiscent of those of type-I model building, as they always take the form SO(2n_0)xU(n_1)x...xU(n_{N-1})xSO(2n_N). The complete twisted spectrum is determined simultaneously for all orbifold models in a parametric way depending on n_0,...,n_N, rather than on a model by model basis. This reveals interesting patterns in the twisted states: They are always built out of vectors and anti--symmetric tensors of the U(n) groups, and either vectors or spinors of the SO(2n) groups. Our results may shed additional light on the S-duality between heterotic and type-I strings in four dimensions. As a spin-off we obtain an SO(10) GUT model with four generations from the Z4 orbifold.
