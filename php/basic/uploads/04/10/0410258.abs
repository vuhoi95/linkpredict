Title: Magnetic Monopole in the Loop Representation
Authors: Lorenzo Leal and Alexander Lopez
Abstract: We quantize the electromagnetic field in the presence of a static magnetic monopole, within the loop-representation formalism. We find that the loop-dependent wave functional becomes multivalued, in the sense that it acquires a dependence on the surfaces bounded by the loop. This generalizes what occurs in quantum mechanics in multiply connected spaces. When Dirac's quantization condition holds, this surface-dependence disappears, together with the effect of the monopole on the electromagnetic field.
