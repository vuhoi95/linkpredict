Title: N=4 Super-Yang-Mills Theory, QCD and Collider Physics
Authors: Z. Bern and L. J. Dixon and D. A. Kosower
Abstract: We review how (dimensionally regulated) scattering amplitudes in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory provide a useful testing ground for perturbative QCD calculations relevant to collider physics, as well as another avenue for investigating the AdS/CFT correspondence. We describe the iterative relation for two-loop scattering amplitudes in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory found in C. Anastasiou et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 91:251602 (2003), and discuss recent progress toward extending it to three loops.
