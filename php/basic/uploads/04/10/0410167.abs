Title: k-string tensions in the 4-d SU(N)-inspired dual Abelian-Higgs-type  theory
Authors: Dmitri Antonov and Luigi Del Debbio and Dietmar Ebert
Abstract: The k-string tensions are explored in the 4-d $[U(1)]^{N-1}$-invariant dual Abelian-Higgs-type theory. In the London limit of this theory, the Casimir scaling is found in the approximation when small-sized closed dual strings are disregarded. When these strings are treated in the dilute-plasma approximation, explicit corrections to the Casimir scaling are found. The leading correction due to the deviation from the London limit is also derived. Its N-ality dependence turns out to be the same as that of the first non-trivial correction produced by closed strings. It also turns out that this N-ality dependence coincides with that of the leading correction to the k-string tension, which emerges by way of the non-diluteness of the monopole plasma in the 3-d SU(N) Georgi-Glashow model. Finally, we prove that, in the latter model, Casimir scaling holds even at monopole densities close to the mean one, provided the string world sheet is flat.
