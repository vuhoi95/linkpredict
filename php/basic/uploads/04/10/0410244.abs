Title: Partial Gauge Symmetry Breaking via Bare Mass
Authors: Naoyuki Haba and Kazunori Takenaga and Toshifumi Yamashita
Abstract: We study gauge symmetry breaking patterns in supersymmetric gauge models defined on $M^4\times S^1$. Instead of utilizing the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism, supersymmetry is broken by bare mass terms for gaugino and squarks. Though the matter content is the same, depending on the magnitude of the bare mass, the gauge symmetry breaking patterns are different. We present two examples, in one of which the partial gauge symmetry breaking $SU(3)\to SU(2)\times U(1)$ is realized.
