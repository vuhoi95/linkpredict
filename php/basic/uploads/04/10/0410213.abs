Title: Birth of the Universe from the Landscape of String Theory
Authors: Archil Kobakhidze and Laura Mersini-Houghton
Abstract: We show that a unique, most probable and stable solution for the wavefunction of the universe, with a very small cosmological constant $\Lambda_1 \simeq (\frac{\pi}{l_p N})^2$, can be predicted from the supersymmetric minisuperspace with $N$ vacua, of the landscape of string theory without reffering to the antropic principle. Due to the nearest neighbor tunneling in moduli space lattice, the $N$-fold degeneracy of vacua is lifted and a discrete spectrum of bound state levels over the whole minisuperspace emerges. $SUSY$ is spontaneously broken by these bound states, with discrete nonzero energy levels $\Lambda_s \simeq (\frac{s \pi}{l_p N})^2$, $s = 1,2,..$.
