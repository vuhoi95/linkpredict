Title: Splitting spinning strings in AdS/CFT
Authors: Kasper Peeters and Jan Plefka and Marija Zamaklar
Abstract: We study the semiclassical decay of macroscopic spinning strings in AdS_5 x S^5 through spontaneous splitting of the folded string worldsheet. Based on similar considerations in flat space this decay channel is expected to dominate the full quantum computation. The outgoing strings are uniquely specified by an infinite set of conserved (local) charges with a regular expansion in inverse powers of the initial angular momentum. We compute these charges and determine functional relations between them. Finally, a preliminary discussion of the corresponding calculation in the non-planar sector of the dual gauge theory is presented.
