Title: Equilibrium Positions, Shape Invariance and Askey-Wilson Polynomials
Authors: S. Odake and R. Sasaki
Abstract: We show that the equilibrium positions of the Ruijsenaars-Schneider-van Diejen systems with the trigonometric potential are given by the zeros of the Askey-Wilson polynomials with five parameters. The corresponding single particle quantum version, which is a typical example of "discrete" quantum mechanical systems with a q-shift type kinetic term, is shape invariant and the eigenfunctions are the Askey-Wilson polynomials. This is an extension of our previous study [1,2], which established the "discrete analogue" of the well-known fact; The equilibrium positions of the Calogero systems are described by the Hermite and Laguerre polynomials, whereas the corresponding single particle quantum versions are shape invariant and the eigenfunctions are the Hermite and Laguerre polynomials.
