Title: Homotopy algebras inspired by classical open-closed string field theory
Authors: Hiroshige Kajiura and Jim Stasheff
Abstract: We define a homotopy algebra associated to classical open-closed strings. We call it an open-closed homotopy algebra (OCHA). It is inspired by Zwiebach's open-closed string field theory and also is related to the situation of Kontsevich's deformation quantization. We show that it is actually a homotopy invariant notion; for instance, the minimal model theorem holds. Also, we show that our open-closed homotopy algebra gives us a general scheme for deformation of open string structures (A(infinity)-algebras) by closed strings (L(infinity)-algebras).
