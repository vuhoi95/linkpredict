Title: Testing a string dilaton model with experimental and observational data
Authors: Susana J. Landau and Melina Bersten and Pablo Sisterna and Hector Vucetich
Abstract: We test the prediction of the time variation of the fine structure constant in the string dilaton model proposed by Damour and Polyakov. First, we analize the dependence of all available observational and experimental data with the fine structure constant variation. Furthermore, we obtain the prediction of the time variation of the fine structure constant including the renormalization group correction. Finally, we use the data set to perform a statistical analyisis. This analysis enables us to determine that the the dilaton model is in agreement with most of the data. Finally, constraints on the free parameters of this model are obtained.
