Title: Is the radion a chameleon?
Authors: Ph. Brax and C. van de Bruck and A. -C. Davis
Abstract: The chameleon mechanism is a way to give an effective mass to a light scalar field via field self-interaction and interaction with matter. We study this mechanism in models in which the couplings are field dependent and find that the properties are very different from the case of constant couplings. The consequence of a runaway potential for the radion field in brane world scenarios and whether the radion can play the role of dark energy is investigated. The cosmological evolution during the inflationary epoch, the radiation and the matter dominated epochs are discussed as is the compatibility of the radion field with local tests of gravity.
