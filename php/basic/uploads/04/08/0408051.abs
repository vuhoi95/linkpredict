Title: Infrared Behavior of the Pressure in $g Ï†^3$ Theory Reexamined
Authors: Heron Caldas and A. L. Mota
Abstract: We reinvestigate the infrared behavior of the pressure in the $g \phi^3$ scalar theory in six dimensions. This problem was first studied by Almeida and Frenkel and more recently by Carrington et al., that certified their results under certain approximations. We employ an alternative technique, instead of the approximation methods necessary to truncate the Schwinger-Dyson equations, often considered to calculate the pressure nonperturbatively. A daisy-type sum, implemented through the modified self-consistent resummation (MSCR), is enough to take care of the infrared divergences ensuring the finiteness of the pressure.
