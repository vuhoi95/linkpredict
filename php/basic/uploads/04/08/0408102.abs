Title: Chaining spins from (super)Yang--Mills
Authors: S. Bellucci and P. Y. Casteill and J. F. Morales and C. Sochichiu
Abstract: We review the spin bit model describing anomalous dimensions of the operators of Super Yang--Mills theory. We concentrate here on the scalar sector. In the limit of large $N$ this model coincides with integrable spin chain while at finite N it has nontrivial chain splitting and joining interaction.
