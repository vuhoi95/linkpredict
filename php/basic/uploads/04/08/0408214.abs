Title: Information on the Super Yang-Mills Spectrum
Authors: A. Feo and P. Merlatti and F. Sannino
Abstract: We investigate the spectrum of the lightest states of N=1 Super Yang-Mills. We first study the spectrum using the recently extended Veneziano Yankielowicz theory containing also the glueball states besides the gluinoball ones. Using a simple Kahler term we show that within the effective Lagrangian approach one can accommodate either the possibility in which the glueballs are heavier or lighter than the gluinoball fields. We then provide an effective Lagrangian independent argument which allows, using information about ordinary QCD, to deduce that the lightest states in super Yang-Mills are the gluinoballs. This helps constraining the Kahler term of the effective Lagrangian. Using this information and the effective Lagrangian we note that there is a small mixing among the gluinoball and glueball states.
