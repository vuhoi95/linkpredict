Title: A Mathematical Theory of the Topological Vertex
Authors: Jun Li and Chiu-Chu Melissa Liu and Kefeng Liu and Jian Zhou
Abstract: We have developed a mathematical theory of the topological vertex--a theory that was original proposed by M. Aganagic, A. Klemm, M. Marino, and C. Vafa in hep-th/0305132 on effectively computing Gromov-Witten invariants of smooth toric Calabi-Yau threefolds derived from duality between open string theory of smooth Calabi-Yau threefolds and Chern-Simons theory on three manifolds.
