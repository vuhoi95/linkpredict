Title: A note on non-commutative dynamics of spinning D0 branes
Authors: Duane Loh and Kit Rodolfa and Vatche Sahakian
Abstract: Rotational dynamics is known to polarize D0 branes into higher dimensional fuzzy D$p$-branes: the tension forces between D0 branes provide the centripetal acceleration, and a puffed up spinning configuration stabilizes. In this work, we consider a rotating cylindrical formation of finite height, wrapping a compact cycle of the background space along the axis of rotation. We find an intriguing relation between the angular speed, the geometry of the cylinder, and the scale of non-commutativity; and we point out a critical radius corresponding to the case where the area of the cylinder is proportional to the number of D0 branes - reminiscent of Matrix black holes.
