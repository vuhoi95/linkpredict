Title: Extra force and extra mass from noncompact Kaluza-Klein theory in a  cosmological model
Authors: Jose Edgar Madriz Aguilar and Mauricio Bellini
Abstract: Using the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, we study extra force and extra mass in a recently introduced noncompact Kaluza-Klein cosmological model. We examine the inertial 4D mass $m_0$ of the inflaton field on a 4D FRW bulk in two examples. We find that $m_0$ has a geometrical origin and antigravitational effects on a non inertial 4D bulk should be a consequence of the motion of the fifth coordinate with respect to the 4D bulk.
