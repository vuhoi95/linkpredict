Title: Closed String S-matrix Elements in Open String Field Theory
Authors: Mohammad R. Garousi and G. R. Maktabdaran
Abstract: We study the S-matrix elements of the gauge invariant operators corresponding to on-shell closed strings, in open string field theory. In particular, we calculate the tree level S-matrix element of two ${\it arbitrary}$ closed strings, and the S-matrix element of one closed string and two open strings. By mapping the world-sheet of these amplitudes to the upper half $z$-plane, and by evaluating explicitly the correlators in the ghost part, we show that these S-matrix elements are ${\it exactly}$ identical to the corresponding disk level S-matrix elements in perturbative string theory.
