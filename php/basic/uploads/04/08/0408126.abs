Title: Poisson-Lie T-plurality of three-dimensional conformally invariant sigma  models II: Nondiagonal metrics and dilaton puzzle
Authors: L. Hlavaty and L. Snobl
Abstract: We look for 3-dimensional Poisson-Lie dualizable sigma models that satisfy the vanishing beta-function equations with constant dilaton field. Using the Poisson-Lie T-plurality we then construct 3-dimensional sigma models that correspond to various decompositions of Drinfeld double. Models with nontrivial dilaton field may appear. It turns out that for ``traceless'' dual algebras they satisfy the vanishing beta-function equations as well. In certain cases the dilaton cannot be defined in some of the dual models. We provide an explanation why this happens and give criteria predicting when it happens.
