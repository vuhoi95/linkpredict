Title: D-brane correlators as solutions of Hirota-Miwa equation
Authors: Ryuichi Sato and Satoru Saito
Abstract: We present a tachyon field, which simply connects to the calculus of the tachyon condensation. The tachyon field acts on any bare boundary state: the Neumann or the Dirichlet state, and generates the boundary state suggested by S.P. de Alwis, which leads to the correct ratio between D-brane tensions. On the other hand we generalize the Hirota-Miwa equation to the case where there are two boundaries. We show that correlation functions made from only the integrand of the tachyon field satisfy the generalized Hirota-Miwa equation. Using the formulation based on this evidence, we suggest that the coordinates in which there exist tachyons on an unstable D-brane be identified as the soliton coordinates in integrable systems. We also evaluate these correlation functions, which have not yet been integrated, to obtain the local information about the tachyons on unstable D-branes. We further see how these amplitudes are affected through the tachyon condensation by integrating the correlators over the tachyon momenta and taking the on-shell limit.
