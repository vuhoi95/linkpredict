Title: On Auxiliary Fields in BF Theories
Authors: D. Ghaffor and M. Tahiri
Abstract: We discuss the structure of auxiliary fields for non-Abelian BF theories in arbitrary dimensions. By modifying the classical BRST operator, we build the on-shell invariant complete quantum action. Therefore, we introduce the auxiliary fields which close the BRST algebra and lead to the invariant extension of the classical action.
