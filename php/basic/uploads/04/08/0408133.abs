Title: A Framework for the Landscape
Authors: Ben Freivogel and Leonard Susskind
Abstract: It seems likely that string theory has a landscape of vacua that includes very many metastable de Sitter spaces. However, as emphasized by Banks, Dine and Gorbatov, no current framework exists for examining these metastable vacua in string theory. In this paper we attempt to correct this situation by introducing an eternally inflating background in which the entire collection of accelerating cosmologies is present as intermediate states. The background is a classical solution which consists of a bubble of zero cosmological constant inside de Sitter space, separated by a domain wall. At early and late times the flat space region becomes infinitely big, so an S-matrix can be defined. Quantum mechanically, the system can tunnel to an intermediate state which is pure de Sitter space. We present evidence that a string theory S-matrix makes sense in this background and contains metastable de Sitter space as an intermediate state.
