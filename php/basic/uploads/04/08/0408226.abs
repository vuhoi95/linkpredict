Title: Recovery of Full N=1 Supersymmetry in Non(anti-)commutative Superspace
Authors: Akifumi Sako and Toshiya Suzuki
Abstract: We investigate SUSY of Wess-Zumino models in non(anti-)commutative Euclidean superspaces. Non(anti-)commutative deformations break 1/2 SUSY, then non(anti-)commutative Wess-Zumino models do not have full SUSY in general. However, we can recover full SUSY at specific coupling constants satisfying some relations. We give a general way to construct full SUSY non(anti-)commutative Wess-Zumino models. For a some example, we investigate quantum corrections and $\beta$-functions behavior.
