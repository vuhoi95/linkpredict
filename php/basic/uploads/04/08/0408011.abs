Title: On Non Commutative G2 structure
Authors: A. Belhaj and M. P. Garcia del Moral
Abstract: Using an algebraic orbifold method, we present non-commutative aspects of $G_2$ structure of seven dimensional real manifolds. We first develop and solve the non commutativity parameter constraint equations defining $G_2$ manifold algebras. We show that there are eight possible solutions for this extended structure, one of which corresponds to the commutative case. Then we obtain a matrix representation solving such algebras using combinatorial arguments. An application to matrix model of M-theory is discussed.
