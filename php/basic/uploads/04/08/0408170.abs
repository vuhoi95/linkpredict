Title: The final state and thermodynamics of dark energy universe
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: As it follows from the classical analysis, the typical final state of the dark energy universe where dominant energy condition is violated is finite time, sudden future singularity (Big Rip). For a number of dark energy universes (including scalar phantom and effective phantom theories as well as specific quintessence model) we demonstrate that quantum effects play the dominant role near Big Rip, driving the universe out of future singularity (or, at least, making it milder). As a consequence, the entropy bounds with quantum corrections become well-defined near Big Rip. Similarly, black holes mass loss due to phantom accretion is not so dramatic as it was expected: masses do not vanish to zero due to transient character of phantom evolution stage. Some examples of cosmological evolution for negative, time-dependent equation of state are also considered with the same conclusions. The application of negative entropy (or negative temparature) occurence in the phantom thermodynamics is briefly discussed.
