Title: QCD Dirac Spectra and the Toda Lattice
Authors: K. Splittorff and J. J. M. Verbaarschot
Abstract: We discuss the spectrum of the QCD Dirac operator both at zero and at nonzero baryon chemical potential. We show that, in the ergodic domain of QCD, the Dirac spectrum can be obtained from the replica limit of a Toda lattice equation. At zero chemical potential this method explains the factorization of known results into compact and noncompact integrals, and at nonzero chemical potential it allows us to derive the previously unknown microscopic spectral density.
