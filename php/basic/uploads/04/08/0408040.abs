Title: Chiral symmetry breaking driven by dilaton
Authors: Kazuo Ghoroku and Masanobu Yahiro
Abstract: Dynamical properties of gauge theories with light flavor quarks are studied in a dual supergravity by adding a D7-brane probe into the AdS background deformed by the dilaton. By estimating the vev of flavor quark-bilinear in both the supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric gravity duals, we find spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the case of the non-supersymmetric background. We also study quark-antiquark potential for light quarks to see the quark confinement in the models considered here.
