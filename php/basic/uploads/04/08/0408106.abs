Title: One Ring to Rule Them All ... and in the Darkness Bind Them?
Authors: Iosif Bena and Nicholas P. Warner
Abstract: We construct all eleven-dimensional, three-charge BPS solutions that preserve a fixed, standard set of supersymmetries. Our solutions include all BPS three-charge rotating black holes, black rings, supertubes, as well as arbitrary superpositions of these objects. We find very large families of black rings and supertubes with profiles that follow arbitrary closed curves in the spatial R^4 transverse to the branes. The black rings copiously violate black hole uniqueness. The supertube solutions are completely regular, and generically have small curvature. They also have the same asymptotics as the three-charge black hole; and so they might be mapped to microstates of the D1-D5-p system and used to explain the entropy of this black hole.
