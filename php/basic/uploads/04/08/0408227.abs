Title: AdS/CFT Correspondence and the Reheating of the Brane-Universe
Authors: E. Papantonopoulos and V. Zamarias
Abstract: We present a mechanism for exit from inflation and reheating using the AdS/CFT correspondence. A cosmological evolution is induced on a probe D3-brane as it moves in a black D-brane background of type-0 string theory. If the tachyon field is non zero, inflation is induced on the brane-universe, with the equation of state parameter in the range -1<w<-1/3 depending on the position of the probe brane in the bulk. As the probe brane approaches the horizon of the background black hole, the inflation rate decreases and the value of w gets larger. At some critical distance away from the horizon, inflation ends. When the brane-universe reaches the horizon, the conformal invariance is restored, the background geometry becomes AdS{5}X S{5}, and the brane-universe feels the CFT thermal radiation and reheats.
