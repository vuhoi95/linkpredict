Title: Cosmological Perturbations During Radion Stabilization
Authors: P. R. Ashcroft and C. van de Bruck and A. -C. Davis
Abstract: We consider the evolution of cosmological perturbations during radion stabilization, which we assume to happen after a period of inflation in the early universe. Concentrating on the Randall-Sundrum brane world scenario, we find that if matter is present both on the positive and negative tension branes, the coupling of the radion to matter fields could have significant impact on the evolution of the curvature perturbation and on the production of entropy perturbations. We investigate both the case of a long-lived and short-lived radion and outline similarities and differences to the curvaton scenario.
