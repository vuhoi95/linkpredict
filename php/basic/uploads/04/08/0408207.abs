Title: Berezin Quantization of Gauged WZW and Coset Models
Authors: I. Carrillo-Ibarra and H. Garcia-Compean and W. Herrera-Suarez
Abstract: Gauged WZW and coset models are known to be useful to prove holomorphic factorization of the partition function of WZW and coset models. In this note we show that these gauged models can be also important to quantize the theory in the context of the Berezin formalism. For gauged coset models Berezin quantization procedure also admits a further holomorphic factorization in the complex structure of the moduli space.
