Title: Amplitude ratios for the mass spectrum of the 2d Ising model in the  high-T, H \neq 0 phase
Authors: M. Caselle and P. Grinza and A. Rago
Abstract: We study the behaviour of the 2d Ising model in the symmetric high temperature phase in presence of a small magnetic perturbation. We successfully compare the quantum field theory predictions for the shift in the mass spectrum of the theory with a set of high precision transfer matrix results. Our results rule out a prediction for the same quantity obtained some years ago with strong coupling methods.
