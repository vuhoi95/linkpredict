Title: Noncommutative gauge theories and Lorentz symmetry
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Biswajit Chakraborty and Kuldeep Kumar
Abstract: We explicitly derive, following a Noether-like approach, the criteria for preserving Poincare invariance in noncommutative gauge theories. Using these criteria we discuss the various spacetime symmetries in such theories. It is shown that, interpreted appropriately, Poincare invariance holds. The analysis is performed in both the commutative as well as noncommutative descriptions and a compatibility between the two is also established.
