Title: Scalar Pair Production in the Aharonov-Bohm Potential
Authors: G. Y. Shahin and M. S. Shikakhwa
Abstract: In the framework of QED, scalar pair production by a single linearly polarized high-energy photon in the presence of an external Aharonov-Bohm potential is investigated. The exact scattering solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation in cylindrically symmetric field are constructed and used to write the first order transition amplitude. The matrix elements and the corresponding differential scattering cross-section are calculated. The pair production at both the nonrelativistic and the ultrarelativistic limits is discussed.
