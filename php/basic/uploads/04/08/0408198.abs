Title: The Self-Dual String and Anomalies in the M5-brane
Authors: David S. Berman and Jeffrey A. Harvey
Abstract: We study the anomalies of a charge $Q_2$ self-dual string solution in the Coulomb branch of $Q_5$ M5-branes. Cancellation of these anomalies allows us to determine the anomaly of the zero-modes on the self-dual string and their scaling with $Q_2$ and $Q_5$. The dimensional reduction of the five-brane anomalous couplings then lead to certain anomalous couplings for D-branes.
