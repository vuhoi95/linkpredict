Title: Field Theory on Noncommutative Spacetimes: Quasiplanar Wick Products
Authors: D. Bahns and S. Doplicher and K. Fredenhagen and G. Piacitelli
Abstract: We give a definition of admissible counterterms appropriate for massive quantum field theories on the noncommutative Minkowski space, based on a suitable notion of locality. We then define products of fields of arbitrary order, the so-called quasiplanar Wick products, by subtracting only such admissible counterterms. We derive the analogue of Wick's theorem and comment on the consequences of using quasiplanar Wick products in the perturbative expansion.
