Title: Cosmological dynamics of scalar fields with O(N) symmetry
Authors: Jian-gang Hao and Xin-zhou Li
Abstract: In this paper, we study the cosmological dynamics of scalar fields with O(N) symmetry in general potentials. We compare the phase space of the dynamical systems of the quintessence and phantom and give the conditions for the existence of various attractors as well as their cosmological implications. We also show that the existence of tracking attractor in O(N) phantom models require the potential with $\Gamma<1/2$, which makes the models with exponential potential possess no tracking attractor.
