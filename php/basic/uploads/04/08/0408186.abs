Title: Microscopic Description of Black Rings in AdS/CFT
Authors: Iosif Bena and Per Kraus
Abstract: We discuss some aspects of the recently discovered BPS black ring solutions in terms of the AdS/CFT correspondence. In the type IIB frame in which the black ring carries the charges of the D1-D5-P system, we propose a microscopic description of the rings in the orbifold CFT governing this system. In our proposal, the CFT effectively splits into two parts: one part captures the supertube-like properties of the ring, and the other captures the entropy. We can also understand the black ring entropy by relating the geometry near the ring to BPS black holes in four dimensions, although this latter approach does not directly lead to an identification of black rings in terms of the D1-D5-P CFT.
