Title: Quasinormal modes and classical wave propagation in analogue black holes
Authors: Emanuele Berti and Vitor Cardoso and Jose' P. S. Lemos
Abstract: Many properties of black holes can be studied using acoustic analogues in the laboratory through the propagation of sound waves. We investigate in detail sound wave propagation in a rotating acoustic (2+1)-dimensional black hole, which corresponds to the ``draining bathtub'' fluid flow. We compute the quasinormal mode frequencies of this system and discuss late-time power-law tails. Due to the presence of an ergoregion, waves in a rotating acoustic black hole can be superradiantly amplified. We compute superradiant reflection coefficients and instability timescales for the acoustic black hole bomb, the equivalent of the Press-Teukolsky black hole bomb. Finally we discuss quasinormal modes and late-time tails in a non-rotating canonical acoustic black hole, corresponding to an incompressible, spherically symmetric (3+1)-dimensional fluid flow.
