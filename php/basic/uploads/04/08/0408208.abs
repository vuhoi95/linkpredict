Title: D-branes of Covariant AdS Superstrings -- An Overview --
Authors: Makoto Sakaguchi and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We briefly review a covariant analysis of D-branes of type IIB superstring on the AdS_5xS^5 background from the \kappa-invariance of the Green-Schwarz string action. The possible configurations of D-branes preserving half of supersymmetries are classified in both cases of AdS_5xS^5 and the pp-wave background.
