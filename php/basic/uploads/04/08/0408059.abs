Title: MSSM vacua from Flux Compactifications
Authors: Fernando Marchesano and Gary Shiu
Abstract: We construct the first D = 4 Minkowski string theory vacua of flux compactification which are (i) chiral, (ii) free of NSNS and RR tadpoles, and (iii) N = 1 or N = 0 supersymmetric. In the latter case SUSY is softly broken by the fluxes, with soft terms being generated in the gauge and chiral sectors of the theory. In addition, the low energy spectrum of the theory is MSSM-like, the dilaton/complex structure moduli are stabilized and the supergravity background involves a warped metric.
