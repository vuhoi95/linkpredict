Title: The quantization of exotic states in SU(3) soliton models: A solvable  quantum mechanical analog
Authors: Aleksey Cherman and Thomas D. Cohen and Abhinav Nellore
Abstract: The distinction between the rigid rotor and Callan-Klebanov approaches to the quantization of SU(3) solitons is considered in the context of exotic baryons. A numerically tractable quantum mechanical analog system is introduced to test the reliability of the two quantization schemes. We find that in the equivalent of the large N_c limit of QCD, the Callan-Klebanov approach agrees with a numerical solution of the quantum mechanical analog. Rigid rotor quantization generally does not. The implications for exotic baryons are briefly discussed.
