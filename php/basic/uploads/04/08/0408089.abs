Title: Renormalization flow of Yang-Mills propagators
Authors: Christian S. Fischer and Holger Gies
Abstract: We study Landau-gauge Yang-Mills theory by means of a nonperturbative vertex expansion of the quantum effective action. Using an exact renormalization group equation, we compute the fully dressed gluon and ghost propagators to lowest nontrivial order in the vertex expansion. In the mid-momentum regime, $p^2\sim\mathcal{O}(1)\text{GeV}^2$, we probe the propagator flow with various {\em ans\"atze} for the three- and four-point correlations. We analyze the potential of these truncation schemes to generate a nonperturbative scale. We find universal infrared behavior of the propagators, if the gluon dressing function has developed a mass-like structure at mid-momentum. The resulting power laws in the infrared support the Kugo-Ojima confinement scenario.
