Title: D3-brane from D-instantons in the hybrid formalism of superstring
Authors: Yoshiteru Amemiya and Kenji Araki and So Katagiri
Abstract: A Dp-brane can be regarded as a configuration of infinitely many D(p-2k)-branes in bosonic string. We will show this property of D-branes in the superstring case using the hybrid formalism. It is convenient to study the boundary state for such D-branes to study such property between D-branes. We show that the boundary state for a D3-brane in a constant self-dual gauge field background can be expressed in terms of the boundary state for D-instantons in the hybrid formalism.
