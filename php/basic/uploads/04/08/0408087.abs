Title: Anomalous Polarization-Curvature Interaction in a Gravitational-Wave  Field
Authors: Alexander Balakin and Veronika Kurbanova
Abstract: An exact solution to the dynamic equations for a massive boson traveling in a pp-wave gravitational background under the influence of the force induced by curvature, is presented. We focus on the effect of anomalous polarization-curvature interaction and consider models in which the coupling constant of such an interaction is treated to be either a deterministic quantity or a random variable.
