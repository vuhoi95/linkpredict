Title: Mesons in gauge/gravity dual with large number of fundamental fields
Authors: Johanna Erdmenger and Ingo Kirsch
Abstract: In view of extending gauge/gravity dualities with flavour beyond the probe approximation, we establish the gravity dual description of mesons for a three-dimensional super Yang-Mills theory with fundamental matter. For this purpose we consider the fully backreacted D2/D6 brane solution of Cherkis and Hashimoto in an approximation due to Pelc and Siebelink. The low-energy field theory is the IR fixed point theory of three-dimensional N=4 SU(N_c) super Yang-Mills with N_f fundamental fields, which we consider in a large N_c and N_f limit with N_f/N_c finite and fixed. We discuss the dictionary between meson-like operators and supergravity fluctuations in the corresponding near-horizon geometry. In particular, we find that the mesons are dual to the low-energy limit of closed string states. In analogy to computations of glueball mass spectra, we calculate the mass of the lowest-lying meson and find that it depends linearly on the quark mass.
