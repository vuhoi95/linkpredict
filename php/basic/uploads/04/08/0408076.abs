Title: Microscopic Quantum Mechanics of the p=œÅUniverse
Authors: T. Banks and W. Fischler and L. Mannelli
Abstract: We present a complete quantum mechanical description of a flat FRW universe with equation of state p=\rho. We find a detailed correspondence with our heuristic picture of such a universe as a dense black hole fluid. Features of the geometry are derived from purely quantum input.
