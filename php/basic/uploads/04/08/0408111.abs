Title: Duality in Fuzzy Sigma Models
Authors: A. P. Balachandran and Giorgio Immirzi
Abstract: Nonlinear `sigma' models in two dimensions have BPS solitons which are solutions of self- and anti-self-duality constraints. In this paper, we find their analogues for fuzzy sigma models on fuzzy spheres which were treated in detail by us in earlier work. We show that fuzzy BPS solitons are quantized versions of `Bott projectors', and construct them explicitly. Their supersymmetric versions follow from the work of S. Kurkcuoglu.
