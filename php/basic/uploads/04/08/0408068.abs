Title: Generalized Monopoles in Six-dimensional Non-Abelian Gauge Theory
Authors: Hironobu Kihara and Yutaka Hosotani and Muneto Nitta
Abstract: A spherically symmetric monopole solution is found in SO(5) gauge theory with Higgs scalar fields in the vector representation in six-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The action of the Yang-Mills fields is quartic in field strengths. The solution saturates the Bogomolny bound and is stable.
