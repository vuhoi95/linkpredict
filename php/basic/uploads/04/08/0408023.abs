Title: Extension of Moyal-deformed hierarchies of soliton equations
Authors: Aristophanes Dimakis and Folkert Muller-Hoissen
Abstract: Moyal-deformed hierarchies of soliton equations can be extended to larger hierarchies by including additional evolution equations with respect to the deformation parameters. A general framework is presented in which the extension is universally determined and which applies to several deformed hierarchies, including the noncommutative KP, modified KP, and Toda lattice hierarchy. We prove a Birkhoff factorization relation for the extended ncKP and ncmKP hierarchies. Also reductions of the latter hierarchies are briefly discussed. Furthermore, some results concerning the extended ncKP hierarchy are recalled from previous work.
