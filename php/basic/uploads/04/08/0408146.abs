Title: Non-anticommutative deformation of N=(1,1) hypermultiplets
Authors: Evgeny Ivanov and Olaf Lechtenfeld and Boris Zupnik
Abstract: We study the SO(4)xSU(2) invariant and N=(1,0) supersymmetry-preserving nilpotent (non-anticommutative) Moyal deformation of hypermultiplets interacting with an abelian gauge multiplet, starting from their off-shell formulation in Euclidean N=(1,1) harmonic superspace. The deformed version of a neutral or a charged hypermultiplet corresponds to the `adjoint' or the `fundamental' representation of the deformed U(1) gauge group on the superfields involved. The neutral hypermultiplet action is invariant under N=(2,0) supersymmetry and describes a deformed N=(2,2) gauge theory. For both the neutral and the charged hypermultiplet we present the corresponding component actions and explicitly give the Seiberg-Witten-type transformations to the undeformed component fields. Mass terms for the hypermultiplets can be generated via the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism and Fayet-Iliopoulos term in analogy to the undeformed case.
