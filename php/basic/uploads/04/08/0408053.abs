Title: The Structure of the Ladder Insertion-Elimination Lie algebra
Authors: Igor Mencattini and Dirk Kreimer
Abstract: We continue our investigation into the insertion-elimination Lie algebra of Feynman graphs in the ladder case, emphasizing the structure of this Lie algebra relevant for future applications in the study of Dyson-Schwinger equations. We work out the relation of this Lie algebra to some classical infinite dimensional Lie algebra and we determine its cohomology.
