Title: Asymmetric radiating brane-world
Authors: Laszlo Gergely and Emily Leeper and Roy Maartens
Abstract: At high energies on a cosmological brane of Randall-Sundrum type, particle interactions can produce gravitons that are emitted into the bulk and that can feed a bulk black hole. We generalize previous investigations of such radiating brane-worlds by allowing for a breaking of Z_2-symmetry, via different bulk cosmological constants and different initial black hole masses on either side of the brane. One of the notable features of asymmetry is a suppression of the asymptotic level of dark radiation, which means that nucleosynthesis constraints are easier to satisfy. There are also models where the radiation escapes to infinity on one or both sides, rather than falling into a black hole, but these models can have negative energy density on the brane.
