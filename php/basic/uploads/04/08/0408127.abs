Title: Lorentz-invariant Bell's inequality
Authors: Won Tae Kim and Edwin J. Son
Abstract: We study Bell's inequality in relation to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox in the relativistic regime. For this purpose, a relativistically invariant observable is used in the calculation of the Bell's inequality, which results in the maximally violated Bell's inequality in any reference frames.
