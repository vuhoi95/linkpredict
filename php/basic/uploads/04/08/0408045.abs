Title: Dynamical Origin of Duality between Gauge Theory and Gravity
Authors: Akiko Noguchi and Akio Sugamoto
Abstract: Dynamical origin of duality between gauge theory and gravity is studied using the dual transformation and the formation of graviton as a collective excitation of dual gauge bosons. In this manner, electric-magnetic duality in gauge theory is reduced to the duality between gauge theory and gravity.
