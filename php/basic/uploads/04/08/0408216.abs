Title: Astrophysical Constraints on Scalar Field Models
Authors: O. Bertolami and J. Paramos
Abstract: We use stellar structure dynamics arguments to extract bounds on the relevant parameters of scalar field models: the putative scalar field mediator of a fifth force with a Yukawa potential, the new variable mass particle (VAMP) models, and a phenomenologically viable model to explain the Pioneer anomaly. We consider the polytropic gas model to estimate the effect of these models on the hydrostatic equilibrium equation and fundamental quantities such as the central temperature. The current bound on the solar luminosity is used to constrain the relevant parameters of each model.
