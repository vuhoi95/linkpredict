Title: Mirror symmetry for topological sigma models with generalized Kahler  geometry
Authors: Stefano Chiantese and Florian Gmeiner and Claus Jeschek
Abstract: We consider topological sigma models with generalized Kahler target spaces. The mirror map is constructed explicitly for a special class of target spaces and the topological A and B model are shown to be mirror pairs in the sense that the observables, the instantons and the anomalies are mapped to each other. We also apply the construction to open topological models and show that A branes are mapped to B branes. Furthermore, we demonstrate a relation between the field strength on the brane and a two-vector on the mirror manifold.
