Title: Branes, Quantum Nambu Brackets, and the Hydrogen Atom
Authors: Cosmas Zachos and Thomas Curtright
Abstract: The Nambu Bracket quantization of the Hydrogen atom is worked out as an illustration of the general method. The dynamics of topological open branes is controlled classically by Nambu Brackets. Such branes then may be quantized through the consistent quantization of the underlying Nambu brackets: properly defined, the Quantum Nambu Brackets comprise an associative structure, although the naive derivation property is mooted through operator entwinement. For superintegrable systems, such as the Hydrogen atom, the results coincide with those furnished by Hamiltonian quantization--but the method is not limited to Hamiltonian systems.
