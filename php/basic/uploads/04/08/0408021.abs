Title: Leading order corrections to the cosmological evolution of tensor  perturbations in braneworld
Authors: Tsutomu Kobayashi and Takahiro Tanaka
Abstract: Tensor type perturbations in the expanding brane world of the Randall Sundrum type are investigated. We consider a model composed of slow-roll inflation phase and the succeeding radiation phase. The effect of the presence of an extra dimension through the transition to the radiation phase is studied, giving an analytic formula for leading order corrections.
