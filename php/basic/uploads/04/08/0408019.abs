Title: Self-Adjoint Extensions of the Dirac Hamiltonian with a delta-Sphere  Interaction
Authors: Gabriel Y. H. Avossevou and Jan Govaerts and M. Norbert Hounkonnou
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to make an explicit construction of specific self-adjoint extensions of the Dirac Hamiltonian in the presence of a $\delta$-sphere interaction of finite radius. The exact resolvent kernel of the free Dirac operator is given. This specifies related results that have recently appeared in the literature.
