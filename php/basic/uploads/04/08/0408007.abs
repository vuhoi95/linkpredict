Title: N=4 Superconformal Symmetry for the Covariant Quantum Superstring
Authors: P. A. Grassi and P. van Nieuwenhuizen
Abstract: We extend our formulation of the covariant quantum superstring as a WZNW model with N=2 superconformal symmetry to N=4. The two anticommuting BRST charges in the N=4 multiplet of charges are the usual BRST charge Q_S and a charge Q_V proposed by Dijkgraaf, Verlinde and Verlinde for topological models. Using our recent work on "gauging cosets", we then construct a further charge Q_C which anticommutes with Q_S + Q_V and which is intended for the definition of the physical spectrum.
