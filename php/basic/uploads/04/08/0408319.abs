Title: New Solutions to the Strong CP Problem
Authors: S. D. H. Hsu and F. Sannino
Abstract: We exhibit a solution to the strong CP problem in which ultraviolet physics renders the QCD theta angle physically unobservable. Our models involve new strong interactions beyond QCD and particles charged under both the new interactions and ordinary color.
