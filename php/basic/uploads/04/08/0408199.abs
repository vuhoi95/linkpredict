Title: Casimir Energy in a Conical Wedge and a Conical Cavity
Authors: H. Ahmedov and I. H. Duru
Abstract: Casimir energy for a massless scalar field for a conical wedge and a conical cavity are calculated. The group generated by the images is employed in deriving the Green functions as well as the wave functions and the energy spectrum.
