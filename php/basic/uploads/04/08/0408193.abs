Title: Snyder noncommutative space-time from two-time physics
Authors: Juan M. Romero and Adolfo Zamora
Abstract: We show that the two-time physics model leads to a mechanical system with Dirac brackets consistent with the Snyder noncommutative space. An Euclidean version of this space is also obtained and it is shown that both spaces have a dual system describing a particle in a curved space-time.
