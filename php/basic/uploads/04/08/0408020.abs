Title: Logarithmic Conformal Null Vectors and SLE
Authors: S. Moghimi-Araghi and M. A. Rajabpour and S. Rouhani
Abstract: Formal Loewner evolution is connected to conformal field theory. In this letter we introduce an extension of Loewner evolution, which consists of two coupled equations and connect the martingales of these equations to the null vectors of logarithmic conformal field theory.
