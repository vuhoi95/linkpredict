Title: General Concentric Black Rings
Authors: Jerome P. Gauntlett and Jan B. Gutowski
Abstract: Supersymmetric black ring solutions of five dimensional supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of vector multiplets are constructed. The solutions are asymptotically flat and describe configurations of concentric black rings which have regular horizons with topology $S^1 \times S^2$ and no closed time-like curves at the horizons.
