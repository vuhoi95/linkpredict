Title: Atiyah-Hitchin M-Branes
Authors: A. M. Ghezelbash and R. B. Mann
Abstract: We present new M2 and M5 brane solutions in M-theory based on transverse Atiyah-Hitchin space and other self-dual geometries. One novel feature of these solutions is that they have bolt-like fixed points yet still preserve 1/4 of the supersymmetry. All the solutions can be reduced down to ten dimensional intersecting brane configurations.
