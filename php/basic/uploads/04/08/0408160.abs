Title: Hidden Gauge Symmetries: A New Possibility at the Colliders
Authors: Tianjun Li and S. Nandi
Abstract: We consider a new physics possibility at the colliders: the observation of TeV scale massive vector bosons in the non-adjoint representations under the Standard Model (SM) gauge symmetry. To have a unitary and renormalizable theory, we propose a class of models with gauge symmetry $\prod_i G_i \times SU(3)'_C \times SU(2)'_L \times U(1)'_Y$ where the SM fermions and Higgs fields are singlets under the hidden gauge symmetry $\prod_i G_i$, and such massive vector bosons appear after the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken down to the SM gauge symmetry. We discuss the model with SU(5) hidden gauge symmetry in detail, and comment on the generic phenomenological implications.
