Title: Quantum, higher-spin, local charges in symmetric space sigma models
Authors: J. M. Evans and D. Kagan and N. J. MacKay and C. A. S. Young
Abstract: Potential anomalies are analysed for the local spin-3 and spin-4 classically conserved currents in any two-dimensional sigma model on a compact symmetric space $G/H$, with $G$ and $H$ classical groups. Quantum local conserved charges are shown to exist in exactly those models which also possess quantum non-local (Yangian) charges. The possibility of larger sets of quantum local charges is discussed and shown to be consistent with known S-matrix results and the behaviour of the corresponding Yangian representations.
