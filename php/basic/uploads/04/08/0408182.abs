Title: Warped Supersymmetric Radius Stabilization
Authors: Nobuhito Maru and Nobuchika Okada
Abstract: A simple model of extra-dimensional radius stabilization in a supersymmetric Randall-Sundrum model is presented. In our model, we introduce only a bulk hypermultiplet and source terms on each boundary branes. With an appropriate choice of model parameters, we find that the radius can be stabilized by supersymmetric vacuum conditions. Since the radion mass can be much larger than the gravitino mass and the supersymmetry breaking scale, the radius stability is ensured even with the supersymmetry breaking. We find a parameter region where unwanted scalar masses induced by quantum corrections through the bulk hypermultiplet and a bulk gravity multiplet are suppressed and the anomaly mediation contributions dominate.
