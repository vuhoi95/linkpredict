Title: Superfield description of 5D supergravity on general warped geometry
Authors: Hiroyuki Abe and Yutaka Sakamura
Abstract: We provide a systematic and practical method of deriving 5D supergravity action described by 4D superfields on a general warped geometry, including a non-BPS background. Our method is based on the superconformal formulation of 5D supergravity, but is easy to handle thanks to the superfield formalism. We identify the radion superfield in the language of 5D superconformal gravity, and clarify its appearance in the action. We also discuss SUSY breaking effects induced by a deformed geometry due to the backreaction of the radius stabilizer.
