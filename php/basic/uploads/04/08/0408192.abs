Title: In the Realm of the Geometric Transitions
Authors: Stephon Alexander and Katrin Becker and Melanie Becker and Keshav Dasgupta and Anke Knauf and Radu Tatar
Abstract: We complete the duality cycle by constructing the geometric transition duals in the type IIB, type I and heterotic theories. We show that in the type IIB theory the background on the closed string side is a Kahler deformed conifold, as expected, even though the mirror type IIA backgrounds are non-Kahler (both before and after the transition). On the other hand, the Type I and heterotic backgrounds are non-Kahler. Therefore, on the heterotic side these backgrounds give rise to new torsional manifolds that have not been studied before. We show the consistency of these backgrounds by verifying the torsional equation.
