Title: Superfield Approach to 5D Conformal SUGRA and the Radion

Abstract: We propose that the radion chiral supermultiplet of five dimensional compactified supergravity is obtained by reduction of the graviphoton gauge multiplet to N=1 superfields in the off shell 5D superconformal gravity formalism of Fujita, Kugo and Ohashi. We present a superfield Lagrangian of Chern-Simons type (similar to global SUSY), which reproduces all component couplings of gauge fields and the radion. A hypermultiplet superspace action is also proposed which correctly accounts for the coupling of matter multiplets with gauge and radion superfields. 4D supergravity enters by the coupling to the 4D Weyl multiplet, an even orbifold parity multiplet embedded in the 5D Weyl multiplet. We apply this formalism to a discussion of Fayet-Iliopolous terms, and the gauging of orbifold SUGRA to obtain warped solutions.
