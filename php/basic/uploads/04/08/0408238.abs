Title: Second order reductions of the WDVV Equations related to classical Lie  algebras
Authors: L. K. Hoevenaars and R. Martini
Abstract: We construct second order reductions of the generalized Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde system based on simple Lie algebras. We discuss to what extent some of the symmetries of the WDVV system are preserved by the reduction.
