Title: Integrable Open Spin Chains in Defect Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Oliver DeWolfe and Nelia Mann
Abstract: We demonstrate that the one-loop dilatation generator for the scalar sector of a certain perturbation of N=4 Super Yang-Mills with fundamentals is the Hamiltonian of an integrable spin chain with open boundary conditions. The theory is a supersymmetric defect conformal field theory (dCFT) with the fundamentals in hypermultiplets confined to a codimension one defect. We obtain a K-matrix satisfying a suitably generalized form of the boundary Yang-Baxter equation, study the Bethe ansatz equations and demonstrate how Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions arise in field theory, and match to existing results in the plane wave limit.
