Title: The Universal Equation of State near the Critical Point of QCD
Authors: N. Brouzakis and N. Tetradis
Abstract: We study the universal properties of the phase diagram of QCD near the critical point using the exact renormalization group. For two-flavour QCD and zero quark masses we derive the universal equation of state in the vicinity of the tricritical point. For non-zero quark masses we explain how the universal equation of state of the Ising universality class can be used in order to describe the physical behaviour near the line of critical points. The effective exponents that parametrize the growth of physical quantities, such as the correlation length, are given by combinations of the critical exponents of the Ising class that depend on the path along which the critical point is approached. In general the critical region, in which such quantities become large, is smaller than naively expected.
