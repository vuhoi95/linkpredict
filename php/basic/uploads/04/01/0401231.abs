Title: Berezin integration over anticommuting variables and cyclic cohomology
Authors: G. Grensing and M. Nitschmann
Abstract: Berezin integration over fermionic degrees of freedom as a standard tool of quantum field theory is analysed from the viewpoint of noncommutative geometry. It is shown that among the variety of contradictory integration prescriptions existing in the current literature, there is only one unique minimal set of consistent rules, which is compatible with Connes' normalized cyclic cohomology of the Gra{\ss}mann algebra.
