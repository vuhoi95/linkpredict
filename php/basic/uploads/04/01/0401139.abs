Title: Finite Supersymmetry Transformations
Authors: Nevena Ilieva and Heide Narnhofer and Walter Thirring
Abstract: We investigate simple examples of supersymmetry algebras with real and Grassmann parameters. Special attention is payed to the finite supertransformations and their probability interpretation. Furthermore we look for combinations of bosons and fermions which are invariant under supertransformations. These combinations correspond to states that are highly entangled.
