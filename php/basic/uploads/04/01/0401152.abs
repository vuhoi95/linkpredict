Title: Quantum corrections to mass and central charge of supersymmetric  solitons
Authors: Alfred Scharff Goldhaber and Anton Rebhan and Peter van Nieuwenhuizen and Robert Wimmer
Abstract: We review some recent developments in the subject of quantum corrections to soliton mass and central charge. We consider in particular approaches which use local densities for these corrections, as first discussed by Hidenaga Yamagishi. We then consider dimensional regularization of the supersymmetric kink in 1+1 dimensions and an extension of this method to a 2+1-dimensional gauge theory with supersymmetric abelian Higgs vortices as the solitons.
