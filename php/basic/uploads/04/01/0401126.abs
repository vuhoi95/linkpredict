Title: Amplification of coupling for Yukawa potentials
Authors: S. De Leo and P. Rotelli
Abstract: It is well known that Yukawa potentials permit bound states in the Schrodinger equation only if the ratio of the exchanged mass to bound mass is below a critical multiple of the coupling constant. However, arguments suggested by the Darwin term imply a more complex situation. By numerically studying the Dirac equation with a Yukawa potential we investigate this amplification effect.
