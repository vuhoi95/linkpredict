Title: Generalised zeta-function regularization for scalar one-loop effective  action
Authors: Guido Cognola and Sergio Zerbini
Abstract: The one-loop effective action for a scalar field defined in the ultrastatic space-time where non standard logarithmic terms in the asymptotic heat-kernel expansion are present, is investigated by a generalisation of zeta-function regularisation. It is shown that additional divergences may appear at one-loop level. The one-loop renormalisability of the model is discussed and the one-loop renormalisation group equations are derived.
