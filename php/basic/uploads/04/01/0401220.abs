Title: Goursat's Problem and the Holographic Principle
Authors: Enrique Alvarez and Jorge Conde and Lorenzo Hernandez
Abstract: The whole idea of holography as put forward by Gerard 't Hooft assumes that data on a boundary determine physics in the volume. This corresponds to a Dirichlet problem for euclidean signature, or to a Goursat (characteristic) problem in the lorentzian setting. Is this last aspect of the problem that is explored here for Ricci flat spaces with vanishing cosmological constant.
