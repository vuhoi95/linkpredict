Title: Regular and Black Hole Skyrmions with Axisymmetry
Authors: Noriko Shiiki and Nobuyuki Sawado and Takashi Torii and Kei-ichi Maeda
Abstract: It has been known that a B=2 skyrmion is axially symmetric. We consider the Skyrme model coupled to gravity and obtain static axially symmetric regular and black hole solutions numerically. Computing the energy density of the skyrmion, we discuss the effect of gravity to the energy density and baryon density of the skyrmion.
