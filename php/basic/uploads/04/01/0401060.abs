Title: Brane World Confronts Holography
Authors: Deog Ki Hong and Stephen D. H. Hsu
Abstract: Holography principle imposes a stringent constraint on the scale of quantum gravity $M_*$ in brane-world scenarios, where all matter is confined on the brane. The thermodynamic entropy of astrophysical black holes and sub-horizon volumes during big bang nucleosynthesis exceed the relevant bounds unless $M_* > 10^{(4-6)}$ TeV, so a hierarchy relative to the weak scale is unavoidable. We discuss the implications for extra dimensions as well as holography.
