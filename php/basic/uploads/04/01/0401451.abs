Title: Non perturbative approach to Casimir interactions in periodic geometries
Authors: Rauno Buescher and Thorsten Emig
Abstract: Due to their collective nature Casimir forces can strongly depend on the geometrical shape of the interacting objects. We study the effect of strong periodic shape deformations of two ideal metal plates on their quantum interaction. A non-perturbative approach which is based on a path integral quantization of the electromagnetic field is presented in detail. Using this approach, we compute the force for the specific case of a flat plate and a plate with a rectangular corrugation. We obtain complementary analytical and numerical results which allow us to identify two different scaling regimes for the force as a function of the mean plate distance, corrugation amplitude and wave length. Qualitative distinctions between transversal electric and magnetic modes are revealed. Our results demonstrate the importance of a careful consideration of the non-additivity of Casimir forces, especially in strongly non-planar geometries. Non-perturbative effects due to surface edges are found. Strong deviations from the commonly used proximity force approximation emerge over a wide range of corrugation wave lengths, even though the surface is composed only of flat segments. We compare our results to that of a perturbative approach and a classical optics approximation.
