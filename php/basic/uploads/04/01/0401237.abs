Title: Towards UV Finite Quantum Field Theories from Non-Local Field Operators
Authors: Stefan Denk and Volkmar Putz and Manfred Schweda and Michael Wohlgenannt
Abstract: A non-local toy model whose interaction consists of smeared, non-local field operators is presented. We work out the Feynman rules and propose a power counting formula for arbitrary graphs. Explicit calculations for one loop graphs show that their contribution is finite for sufficient smearing and agree with the power counting formula. UV/IR mixing does not occur.
