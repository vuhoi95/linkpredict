Title: Amenability of the Gauge Group
Authors: Alan Carey and Hendrik Grundling
Abstract: Let G be one of the local gauge groups C(X,U(n)), C^\infty(X,U(n)), C(X,SU(n)) or C^\infty(X,SU(n)) where X is a compact Riemannian manifold. We observe that G has a nontrivial group topology, coarser than its natural topology, w.r.t. which it is amenable, viz the relative weak topology of C(X,M(n)). This topology seems more useful than other known amenable topologies for G. We construct a simple fermionic model containing an action of G, continuous w.r.t. this amenable topology.
