Title: A Perspective on Pentaquarks
Authors: Robert Jaffe and Frank Wilczek
Abstract: Recent discoveries of manifestly exotic, narrow baryon resonances present a fundamental challenge for our theoretical understanding of low-energy QCD. This is a brief survey of their interpretation, emphasizing the possibility that diquark correlations are centrally involved. Many predictions and suggestions for future directions follow from that idea.
