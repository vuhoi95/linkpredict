Title: Truncations driven by constraints: consistency and conditions for  correct upliftings
Authors: Josep M. Pons and Pere Talavera
Abstract: We discuss the mechanism of truncations driven by the imposition of constraints. We show how the consistency of such truncations is controlled, and give general theorems that establish conditions for the correct uplifting of solutions. We show in some particular examples how one can get correct upliftings from 7d supergravities to 10d type IIB supergravity, even in cases when the truncation is not initially consistent by its own.
