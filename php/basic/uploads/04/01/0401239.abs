Title: Black holes in Goedel-type universes with a cosmological constant
Authors: Klaus Behrndt and Dietmar Klemm
Abstract: We discuss supersymmetric black holes embedded in a Goedel-type universe with cosmological constant in five dimensions. The spacetime is a fibration over a four-dimensional Kaehler base manifold, and generically has closed timelike curves. Asymptotically the space approaches a deformation of AdS_5, which suggests that the appearance of closed timelike curves should have an interpretation in some deformation of D=4, N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory. Finally, a Goedel-de Sitter universe is also presented and its causal structure is discussed.
