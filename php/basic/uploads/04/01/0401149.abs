Title: Effective Lagrangians for QCD: Deconfinement and Chiral Symmetry  Restoration
Authors: Agnes Mocsy and Francesco Sannino and Kimmo Tuominen
Abstract: Effective Lagrangians for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) especially suited for understanding deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration at nonzero temperature and matter density are reviewed. These effective theories allow one to study generic properties of phase transitions using non-order parameter fields without loosing the information encoded in the true order parameter. {}For the pure gauge theory we demonstrate that, near the deconfining phase transition, the center group symmetry is naturally linked to the conformal anomaly. Another relevant outcome is that when the theory contains also quarks we can explain the intertwining of chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement for QCD with matter fields either in the fundamental or in the adjoint representation of the gauge group. As a test of our general approach we show our results to be applicable also at non zero baryon chemical potential. We also predict new testable substructures to be present in the phase diagram of quarks in the adjoint representation of the gauge group. Here we provide some new insights on the large $N$ limit of gauge theories by investigating the hadronic world. We propose that the world of infinite $N$ should already be well described when N=6 for QCD with two and three light flavors. Finally, we suggest possible future applications of our results for heavy ions collisions.
