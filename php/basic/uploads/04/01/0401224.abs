Title: BRST Invariant mass term for Chern-Simons
Authors: M. A. L. Capri and V. E. R. Lemes
Abstract: A perturbative analysis of a massive Chern-Simons is presented. The mass term is introduced in a BRST invariant way. With these method we prove that the number of independent renormalisation of massive Chern-Simons is equal to topologically massive Yang-Mills and different from pure Chern-Simons.
