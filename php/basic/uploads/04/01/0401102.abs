Title: Massive Hyper-Kahler Sigma Models and BPS Domain Walls
Authors: Masato Arai and Muneto Nitta and Norisuke Sakai
Abstract: With the non-Abelian Hyper-Kahler quotient by U(M) and SU(M) gauge groups, we give the massive Hyper-Kahler sigma models that are not toric in the N=1 superfield formalism. The U(M) quotient gives N!/[M! (N-M)!] (N is a number of flavors) discrete vacua that may allow various types of domain walls, whereas the SU(M) quotient gives no discrete vacua. We derive BPS domain wall solution in the case of N=2 and M=1 in the U(M) quotient model.
