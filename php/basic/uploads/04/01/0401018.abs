Title: A New Approach to Scale Symmetry Breaking and Confinement
Authors: P. Gaete and E. Guendelman
Abstract: Scale invariant theories which contain (in $4-D$) a four index field strength are considered. The integration of the equations of motion of these $4-index$ field strength gives rise to scale symmetry breaking. The phenomena of mass generation and confinement are possible consequences of this.
