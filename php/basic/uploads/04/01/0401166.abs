Title: $1/N^2$ correction to free energy in hermitian two-matrix model
Authors: B. Eynard and A. Kokotov and D. Korotkin
Abstract: Using the loop equations we find an explicit expression for genus 1 correction in hermitian two-matrix model in terms of holomorphic objects associated to spectral curve arising in large N limit. Our result generalises known expression for $F^1$ in hermitian one-matrix model. We discuss the relationship between $F^1$, Bergmann tau-function on Hurwitz spaces, G-function of Frobenius manifolds and determinant of Laplacian over spectral curve.
