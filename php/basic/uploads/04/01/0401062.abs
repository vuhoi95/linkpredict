Title: Following Weyl on Quantum Mechanics: the contribution of Ettore Majorana
Authors: A. Drago and S. Esposito
Abstract: After a quick historical account of the introduction of the group-theoretical description of Quantum Mechanics in terms of symmetries, as proposed by Weyl, we examine some unpublished papers by Ettore Majorana. Remarkable results achieved by him in frontier research topics as well as in physics teaching point out that the Italian physicist can be well considered as a follower of Weyl in his reformulation of Quantum Mechanics.
