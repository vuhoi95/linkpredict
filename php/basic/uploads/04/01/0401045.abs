Title: PP-waves and softly broken N=1 SYM
Authors: F. Bigazzi and A. L. Cotrone
Abstract: We review the Penrose limit of the Type IIB dual of softly broken N=1 SYM in four dimensions obtained as a deformation of the Maldacena-Nunez background. We extract the string spectrum on the resulting pp-wave background and discuss some properties of the conjectured dual gauge theory hadrons, the so called ``Annulons''.
