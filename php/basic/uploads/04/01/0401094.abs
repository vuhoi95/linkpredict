Abstract: Development of fundamental physics relies on the constancy of various fundamental quantities such as the fine structure constant. Detecting or constraining the possible time variations of these fundamental physical quantities is an important step toward a complete understanding of basic physics. Here we present the results from a detailed many-multiplet analysis performed using high signal-to-noise ratio, high spectral resolution observations of 23 Mg II systems detected toward 18 QSOs in the redshift range 0.4<z<2.3 obtained using UVES at the VLT. We validate our procedure and define the selection criteria that will avoid possible systematics using detail analysis of simulated data set. We show our Voigt profile fitting code recovers the variation in \alpha very accurately when we use single component systems and multiple component systems that are not heavily blended. Spurious detections are frequently seen when we use heavily blended systems or the systems with very weak lines. Thus we avoided heavily blended systems and the systems with Fe II column density < 2x10^12 cm^-2 in the analysis. All steps involved in the analysis are presented in detail. The weighted mean value of the variation in \alpha obtained from our analysis over the redshift range 0.4<z<2.3 is {\Delta\alpha/\alpha} = (-0.06+/-0.06)x10^-5. The median redshift of our sample is 1.55 the 3\sigma upper limit on the time variation of $\alpha$ is -2.5x10^-16 yr^-1< (\Delta\alpha/\alpha\Delta t) <+1.2x10^-16 yr^-1. To our knowledge this is the strongest constraint from quasar absorption line studies till date.
