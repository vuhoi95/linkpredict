Title: Black Brane World from Gravitating Half $Ïƒ$-lump
Authors: Donghyun Kim and Yoonbai Kim and JungJai Lee
Abstract: We study O($N+1$) nonlinear $\sigma$-model in $(p+1+N)$-dimensional curved spacetime with negative cosmological constant, and find a new $\sigma$-lump solution with half-integer winding and divergent energy. When the spatial structure of $N$ extra-dimensions is determined by this global defect, a black $\sigma p$-brane surrounded by the degenerated horizon is formed and its near-horizon geometry is identified as a warp geometry of cigar type.
