Title: Riemann Tensor of the Ambient Universe, the Dilaton and the Newton's  Constant
Authors: Rossen I. Ivanov and Emil M. Prodanov
Abstract: We investigate a four-dimensional world, embedded into a five-dimensional spacetime, and find the five-dimensional Riemann tensor via generalisation of the Gauss (--Codacci) equations. We then derive the generalised equations of the four-dimensional world and also show that the square of the dilaton field is equal to the Newton's constant. We find plausable constant and non-constant solutions for the dilaton.
