Title: On the log correction to the black hole area law
Authors: Amit Ghosh and P. Mitra
Abstract: Various approaches to black hole entropy yield the area law with logarithmic corrections, many involving a coefficient 1/2, and some involving 3/2. It is pointed out here that the standard quantum geometry formalism is not consistent with 3/2 and favours 1/2.
