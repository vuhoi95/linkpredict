Title: General supersymmetric AdS5 black holes
Authors: Jan B. Gutowski and Harvey S. Reall
Abstract: Supersymmetric, asymptotically AdS5, black hole solutions of five dimensional gauged supergravity coupled to arbitrarily many abelian vector multiplets are presented. The general nature of supersymmetric solutions of this theory is discussed. All maximally supersymmetric solutions of this theory (with or without gauging) are obtained.
