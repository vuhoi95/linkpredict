Title: Whether conformal supersymmetry is broken by quantum p-branes with  exotic supersymmetry?
Authors: D. V. Uvarov and A. A. Zheltukhin
Abstract: Classical and quantum symmetries of super $p$-branes preserving exotic 3/4 fraction of $N=1 D=4$ global supersymmetry are studied. Classical realization of the algebra of global and world-volume symmetries is constructed and its quantum generalizations are analyzed. Established is that the status of the conformal supersymmetry $OSp(1|8)$ as a proper quantum symmetry of brane depends both on the choice of its vacuum state and the associated ordering of $\hat{\cal Q}$ and $\hat{\cal P}$ operators.
