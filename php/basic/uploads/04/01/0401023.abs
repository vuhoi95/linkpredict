Title: General form of deformation of Poisson superbracket
Authors: S. E. Konstein and A. G. Smirnov and I. V. Tyutin
Abstract: Continuous formal deformations of the Poisson superbracket defined on compactly supported smooth functions on R^n taking values in a Grassmann algebra are described up to an equivalence transformation. It is shown that there are additional deformations which are different from the standard Moyal bracket.
