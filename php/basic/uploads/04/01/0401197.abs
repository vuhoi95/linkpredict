Title: Correspondence Principle for Black Holes in Plane Waves
Authors: Akikazu Hashimoto and Leopoldo Pando Zayas
Abstract: We compare the entropy as a function of energy of excited strings and black strings in an asymptotically plane wave background at the level of the correspondence principle. For the plane wave supported by the NSNS 3-form flux, neither the entropy formula nor the cross-over scale is affected by the presence of the flux and the correspondence is found to hold. For the plane wave supported by the RR 3-form flux, both the entropy and the cross-over point are modified, but the correspondence is still found to hold.
