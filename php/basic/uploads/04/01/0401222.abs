Authors: N. N. Khuri and Andre Martin and Pierre C. Sabatier and Tai Tsun Wu
Abstract: For a very large class of potentials, $V(\vec{x})$, $\vec{x}\in R^2$, we prove the universality of the low energy scattering amplitude, $f(\vec{k}', \vec{k})$. The result is $f=\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\{1/log k)+O(1/(log k)^2)$. The only exceptions occur if $V$ happens to have a zero energy bound state. Our new result includes as a special subclass the case of rotationally symmetric potentials, $V(|\vec{x}|)$.
