Authors: Vitor Cardoso and Oscar J. C. Dias and Jose' P. S. Lemos
Abstract: We find all the higher dimensional solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell theory that are the topological product of two manifolds of constant curvature. These solutions include the higher dimensional Nariai, Bertotti-Robinson and anti-Nariai solutions, and the anti-de Sitter Bertotti-Robinson solutions with toroidal and hyperbolic topology (Plebanski-Hacyan solutions). We give explicit results for any dimension D>3. These solutions are generated from the appropriate extremal limits of the higher dimensional near-extreme black holes in a de Sitter, and anti-de Sitter backgrounds. Thus, we also find the mass and the charge parameters of the higher dimensional extreme black holes as a function of the radius of the degenerate horizon.
