Authors: J. A. Nieto and M. P. Ryan and O. Velarde and C. M. Yee
Abstract: It is shown that, with the only exception of $n=2$, the Einstein-Hilbert action in $n+D+d$ dimensions, with $n$ times, is invariant under the duality transformation $a\to \frac{1}{a}$ and $b\to \frac{1}{b}$, where $a$ is a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker scale factor in $D$ dimensions and $b$ a Brans-Dicke scalar field in $d$ dimensions respectively. We investigate the $2+D+d$ dimensional cosmological model in some detail.
