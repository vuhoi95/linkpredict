Title: Noncommutative Quantum Mechanics and Seiberg-Witten Map
Authors: Akira Kokado and Takashi Okamura and Takesi Saito
Abstract: In order to overcome ambiguity problem on identification of mathematical objects in noncommutative theory with physical observables, quantum mechanical system coupled to the NC U(1) gauge field in the noncommutative space is reformulated by making use of the unitarized Seiberg-Witten map, and applied to the Aharonov-Bohm and Hall effects of the NC U(1) gauge field. Retaining terms only up to linear order in the NC parameter \theta, we find that the AB topological phase and the Hall conductivity have both the same formulas as those of the ordinary commutative space with no \theta-dependence.
