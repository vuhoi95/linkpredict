Title: Supersymmetric Kaluza-Klein reductions of AdS backgrounds
Authors: José Figueroa-O'Farrill and Joan Simón
Abstract: This paper contains a classification of smooth Kaluza--Klein reductions (by one-parameter subgroups) of the maximally supersymmetric anti de Sitter backgrounds of supergravity theories. We present a classification of one-parameter subgroups of isometries of anti de Sitter spaces, discuss the causal properties of their orbits on these manifolds, and discuss their action on the space of Killing spinors. We analyse the problem of which quotients admit a spin structure. We then apply these results to write down the list of smooth everywhere spacelike supersymmetric quotients of AdS_3 x S^3 (x R^4), AdS_4 x S^7, AdS_5 x S^5 and AdS_7 x S^4, and the fraction of supersymmetry preserved by each quotient. The results are summarised in tables which should be useful on their own. The paper also includes a discussion of supersymmetry of singular quotients.
