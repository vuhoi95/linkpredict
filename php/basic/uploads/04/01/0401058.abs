Title: More on supersymmetric tensionless rotating strings in AdS_5 x S^5
Authors: David Mateos and Toni Mateos and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: Rotating IIB strings in AdS_5 x S^5 become ultra-relativistic, and hence effectively tensionless, in the limit of large angular momentum on S^5. We have shown previously that such tensionless strings may preserve supersymmetry. Here we extend this result to include a class of supersymmetric tensionless strings with arbitrary SO(6) angular momentum. We close with some general comments on tensionless strings in AdS_5 x S^5.
