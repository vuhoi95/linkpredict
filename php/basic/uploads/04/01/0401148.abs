Title: Chiral Supersymmetric Gepner Model Orientifolds
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Timo Weigand
Abstract: We explicitly construct A-type orientifolds of supersymmetric Gepner models. In order to reduce the tadpole cancellation conditions to a treatable number we explicitly work out the generic form of the one-loop Klein bottle, annulus and Moebius strip amplitudes for simple current extensions of Gepner models. Equipped with these formulas, we discuss two examples in detail to provide evidence that in this setting certain features of the MSSM like unitary gauge groups with large enough rank, chirality and family replication can be achieved.
