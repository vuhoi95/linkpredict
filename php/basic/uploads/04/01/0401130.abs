Title: On the Energy-Momentum Density of Gravitational Plane Waves
Authors: T. Dereli and R. W. Tucker
Abstract: By embedding Einstein's original formulation of GR into a broader context we show that a dynamic covariant description of gravitational stress-energy emerges naturally from a variational principle. A tensor $T^G$ is constructed from a contraction of the Bel tensor with a symmetric covariant second degree tensor field $\Phi$ and has a form analogous to the stress-energy tensor of the Maxwell field in an arbitrary space-time. For plane-fronted gravitational waves helicity-2 polarised (graviton) states can be identified carrying non-zero energy and momentum.
