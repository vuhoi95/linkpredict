Title: Fractional flux periodicity of a twisted planar square lattice
Authors: K. Sasaki and Y. Kawazoe and R. Saito
Abstract: We present fractional flux periodicity in the ground state of planar systems made of a square lattice whose boundary is compacted into a torus. The ground-state energy shows a fractional period of the fundamental unit of magnetic flux depending on the twist around the torus axis.
