Title: Boundary regularity of conformally compact Einstein metrics
Authors: Piotr T. Chrusciel and Erwann Delay and John M. Lee and Dale N. Skinner
Abstract: We show that C^2 conformally compact Riemannian Einstein metrics have conformal compactifications that are smooth up to the boundary in dimension 3 and all even dimensions, and polyhomogeneous in odd dimensions greater than 3.
