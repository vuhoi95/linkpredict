Title: On the Field Equations of Kaluza's Theory
Authors: Rossen I. Ivanov and Emil M. Prodanov
Abstract: The field equations of the original Kaluza's theory are analyzed and it is shown that they lead to modification of Einstein's equations. The appearing extra energy-momentum tensor is studied and an example is given where this extra energy-momentum tensor is shown to allow four-dimensional Schwarzschild geometry to accommodate electrostatics. Such deviation from Reissner-Nordstrom geometry can account for the interpretation of Schwarzschild geometry as resulting not from mass only, but from the combined effects of mass and electric charge, even electric charge alone.
