Title: Supersymmetric AdS5 black holes
Authors: Jan B. Gutowski and Harvey S. Reall
Abstract: The first examples of supersymmetric, asymptotically AdS5, black hole solutions are presented. They form a 1-parameter family of solutions of minimal five-dimensional gauged supergravity. Their angular momentum can never vanish. The solutions are obtained by a systematic analysis of supersymmetric solutions with Killing horizons. Other new examples of such solutions are obtained. These include solutions for which the horizon is a homogeneous Nil or SL(2,R) manifold.
