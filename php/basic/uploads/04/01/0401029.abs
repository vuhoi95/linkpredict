Title: A note on fermionic flows of the N=(1|1) supersymmetric Toda lattice  hierarchy
Authors: Olaf Lechtenfeld and Alexander S. Sorin
Abstract: We extend the Sato equations of the N=(1|1) supersymmetric Toda lattice hierarchy by two new infinite series of fermionic flows and demonstrate that the algebra of the flows of the extended hierarchy is the Borel subalgebra of the N=(2|2) loop superalgebra.
