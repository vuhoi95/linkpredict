Abstract: Taking as a starting point a Lorentz non-invariant Abelian-Higgs model defined in 1+3 dimensions, we carry out its dimensional reduction to D=1+2, obtaining a new planar model composed by a Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Proca gauge sector, a massive scalar sector, and a mixing term (involving the fixed background (v^{\mu}) that imposes the Lorentz violation to the reduced model. The propagators of the scalar and massive gauge field are evaluated and the corresponding dispersion relations determined. Based on the poles of the propagators, a causality and unitarity analysis is carried out at tree-level. One then shows that the model is totally causal and unitary.
