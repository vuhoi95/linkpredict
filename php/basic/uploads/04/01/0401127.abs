Title: The Casimir effect for susy solitons
Authors: A. Rebhan and P. van Nieuwenhuizen and R. Wimmer
Abstract: We discuss new insights into the quantum physics of solitons developed since 1997: why quantum corrections to the mass M and the central charge Z of solitons in supersymmetric (susy) field theories in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions are nonvanishing, despite the fact that the zero-point energies of bosons and fermions seem to cancel each other, and the central charge is an integral of a total space derivative which naively seems to get contributions only from regions far removed from the soliton. Crucial are: (1) the requirement that the regularization scheme not only makes calculations finite, but it also should preserve (ordinary) supersymmetry, (2) the renormalization condition that tadpoles vanish in the trivial vacuum, (3) an anomaly in the central charge which is actually needed to saturate the Bogomolnyi bound, (4) the influence of the winding of classical fields on the quantum fields far away from the soliton.
