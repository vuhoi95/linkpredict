Title: Generalizations of Yang-Mills Theory with Nonlinear Constitutive  Equations
Authors: Gerald A. Goldin and Vladimir Shtelen
Abstract: We generalize classical Yang-Mills theory by extending nonlinear constitutive equations for Maxwell fields to non-Abelian gauge groups. Such theories may or may not be Lagrangian. We obtain conditions on the constitutive equations specifying the Lagrangian case, of which recently-discussed non-Abelian Born-Infeld theories are particular examples. Some models in our class possess nontrivial Galilean (c goes to infinity) limits; we determine when such limits exist, and obtain them explicitly.
