Title: Renormalisation of Ï†^4-theory on noncommutative R^4 in the matrix  base
Authors: Harald Grosse and Raimar Wulkenhaar
Abstract: We prove that the real four-dimensional Euclidean noncommutative \phi^4-model is renormalisable to all orders in perturbation theory. Compared with the commutative case, the bare action of relevant and marginal couplings contains necessarily an additional term: an harmonic oscillator potential for the free scalar field action. This entails a modified dispersion relation for the free theory, which becomes important at large distances (UV/IR-entanglement). The renormalisation proof relies on flow equations for the expansion coefficients of the effective action with respect to scalar fields written in the matrix base of the noncommutative R^4. The renormalisation flow depends on the topology of ribbon graphs and on the asymptotic and local behaviour of the propagator governed by orthogonal Meixner polynomials.
