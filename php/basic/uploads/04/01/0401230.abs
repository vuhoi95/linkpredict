Title: BFT Method for Mixed Constrained Systems and Chern-Simons Theory
Authors: M. Monemzadeh and A. Shirzad
Abstract: We show that the BFT embedding method is problematic for mixed systems (systems possessing both first and second class constraints). The Chern-Simons theory as an example is worked out in detail. We give two methods to solve the problem leading to two different types of finite order BFT embedding for Chern-Simons theory.
