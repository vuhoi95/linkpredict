Title: Coordinate noncommutativity in strong non-uniform magnetic fields
Authors: J. Frenkel and S. H. Pereira
Abstract: Noncommuting spatial coordinates are studied in the context of a charged particle moving in a strong non-uniform magnetic field. We derive a relation involving the commutators of the coordinates, which generalizes the one realized in a strong constant magnetic field. As an application, we discuss the noncommutativity in the magnetic field present in a magnetic mirror.
