Authors: A. Coley and R. Milson and V. Pravda and A. Pravdova
Abstract: We discuss the algebraic classification of the Weyl tensor in higher dimensional Lorentzian manifolds. This is done by characterizing algebraically special Weyl tensors by means of the existence of aligned null vectors of various orders of alignment. Further classification is obtained by specifying the alignment type and utilizing the notion of reducibility. For a complete classification it is then necessary to count aligned directions, the dimension of the alignment variety, and the multiplicity of principal directions. The present classification reduces to the classical Petrov classification in four dimensions. Some applications are briefly discussed.
