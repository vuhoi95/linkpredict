Title: The BRST extension of gauge non-invariant Lagrangians
Authors: D. Bashkirov and G. Sardanshvily
Abstract: We show that, in gauge theory of principal connections, any gauge non-invariant Lagrangian can be completed to the BRST-invariant one. The BRST extension of the global Chern-Simons Lagrangian is present.
