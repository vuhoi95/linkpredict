Title: A general formula of the effective potential in 5D SU(N) gauge theory on  orbifold
Authors: Naoyuki Haba and Toshifumi Yamashita
Abstract: We show a general formula of the one loop effective potential of the 5D SU(N) gauge theory compactified on an orbifold, $S^1/Z_2$. The formula shows the case when there are fundamental, (anti-)symmetric tensor and adjoint representational bulk fields. Our calculation method is also applicable when there are bulk fields belonging to higher dimensional representations. The supersymmetric version of the effective potential with Scherk-Schwarz breaking can be obtained straightforwardly. We also show some examples of effective potentials in SU(3), SU(5) and SU(6) models with various boundary conditions, which are reproduced by our general formula.
