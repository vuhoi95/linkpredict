Title: Multi giant graviton systems, SUSY breaking and CFT
Authors: Marco M. Caldarelli and Pedro J. Silva
Abstract: In this article, we describe giant gravitons in AdS_5 x S^5 moving along generic trajectories in AdS_5. The giant graviton dynamics is solved by proving that the D3-brane effective action reduces to that of a massive point particle in AdS_5 and therefore the solutions are in one to one correspondence with timelike geodesics of AdS_5. All these configurations are related via isometries of the background, which induce target space symmetries in the world volume theory of the D-brane. Hence, all these configurations preserve the same amount of supersymmetry as the original giant graviton, i.e. half of the maximal supersymmetry. Multiparticle configurations of two or more giant gravitons are also considered. In particular, a binary system preserving one quarter of the supersymmetries is found, providing a non trivial time-dependent supersymmetric solution. A short study on the dual CFT description of all the above states is given, including a derivation of the exact induced isometry map in the CFT side of the correspondence.
