Title: Fractional spin through quatum (super)Virasoro algebras
Authors: M. Mansour and E. H. Zakkari
Abstract: The splitting of a $Q$-deformed boson, in the $Q\to q=e^{\frac{\QTR{rm}{2\pi i}}{\QTR{rm}{k}}}$ limit, is discussed. The equivalence between a $Q$-fermion and an ordinary one is established. The properties of the quantum (super)Virasoro algebras when their deformation parameter $Q$ goes to a root of unity, are investigated. These properties are shown to be related to fractional supersymmetry and $k$-fermionic spin.
