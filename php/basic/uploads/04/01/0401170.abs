Title: Symplectic Embedding of a Massive Vector-Tensor Theory with Topological  Coupling
Authors: Yong-Wan Kim and Chang-Yeong Lee and Seung-Kook Kim and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: In the symplectic Lagrangian framework we newly embed an irreducible massive vector-tensor theory into a gauge invariant system, which has become reducible, by extending the configuration space to include an additional pair of scalar and vector fields, which give the desired Wess-Zumino action. A comparision with the BFT Hamiltonian embedding approach is also done.
