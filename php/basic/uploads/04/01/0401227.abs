Title: Perturbative dynamics of matrix string for the membrane
Authors: Masashi Hayakawa and Nobuyuki Ishibashi
Abstract: Recently Sekino and Yoneya proposed a way to regularize the world volume theory of membranes wrapped around $S^1$ by matrices and showed that one obtains matrix string theory as a regularization of such a theory. We show that this correspondence between matrix string theory and wrapped membranes can be obtained by using the usual M(atrix) theory techniques. Using this correspondence, we construct the super-Poincare generators of matrix string theory at the leading order in the perturbation theory. It is shown that these generators satisfy 10 dimensional super-Poincar\'e algebra without any anomaly.
