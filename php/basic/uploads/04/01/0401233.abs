Title: Remarks on branes, fluxes, and soft SUSY breaking
Authors: Albion Lawrence and John McGreevy
Abstract: We review recent work identifying soft SUSY-breaking terms in local type II string models with branes and magnetic fluxes. We then make a new observation about the configuration space of D-branes in Calabi-Yau backgrounds, and identify vevs for nonperturbative charged hypermultiplets in Calabi-Yau backgrounds with N=2 Fayet-Iliopoulos terms.
