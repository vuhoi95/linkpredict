Title: Vacuum C-metric and the Gravitational Stark Effect
Authors: Donato Bini and Christian Cherubini and Bahram Mashhoon
Abstract: We study the vacuum C-metric and its physical interpretation in terms of the exterior spacetime of a uniformly accelerating spherically - symmetric gravitational source. Wave phenomena on the linearized C-metric background are investigated. It is shown that the scalar perturbations of the linearized C-metric correspond to the gravitational Stark effect. This effect is studied in connection with the Pioneer anomaly.
