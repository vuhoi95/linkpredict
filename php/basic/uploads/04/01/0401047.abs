Title: Gravitational collapse in braneworld models with curvature corrections
Authors: G. Kofinas and E. Papantonopoulos
Abstract: We study the collapse of a homogeneous braneworld dust cloud in the context of the various curvature correction scenarios, namely, the induced-gravity, the Gauss-Bonnet, and the combined induced-gravity and Gauss-Bonnet. In accordance to the Randall-Sundrum model, and contrary to four-dimensional general relativity, we show in all cases that the exterior spacetime on the brane is non-static.
