Title: Phase shifts and resonances in the Dirac equation
Authors: Piers Kennedy and Richard L. Hall and Norman Dombey
Abstract: We review the analytic results for the phase shifts delta_{l}(k) in non-relativistic scattering from a spherical well. The conditions for the existence of resonances are established in terms of time-delays. Resonances are shown to exist for p-waves (and higher angular momenta) but not for s-waves. These resonances occur when the potential is not quite strong enough to support a bound p-wave of zero energy. We then examine relativistic scattering by spherical wells and barriers in the Dirac equation. In contrast to the non-relativistic situation, s-waves are now seen to possess resonances in scattering from both wells and barriers. When s-wave resonances occur for scattering from a well, the potential is not quite strong enough to support a zero momentum s-wave solution at E = m. Resonances resulting from scattering from a barrier can be explained in terms of the `crossing' theorem linking s-wave scattering from barriers to p-wave scattering from wells. A numerical procedure to extract phase shifts for general short range potentials is introduced and illustrated by considering relativistic scattering from a Gaussian potential well and barrier.
