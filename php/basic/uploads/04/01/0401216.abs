Title: The Green's Function of the Supersymmetric D=1 Heat Equation
Authors: S. Andrea and A. Restuccia and A. Sotomayor
Abstract: A rigorous treatment is given of the Green's function of the N=1 supersymmetric heat equation in one spatial dimension with a distribution initial value. The asymptotic expansion of the supersymmetric Green's function as t tends to 0+ is also derived. The coefficients of the expansion generate all the members of the supersymmetric N=1 KdV hierarchy.
