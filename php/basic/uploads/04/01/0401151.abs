Title: Ghost-Free de Sitter Supergravities as Consistent Reductions of String  and M-theory
Authors: M. Cvetic and G. W. Gibbons and C. N. Pope
Abstract: We study properties of supergravity theories with non-compact gaugings, and their higher-dimensional interpretations via consistent reductions on the inhomogeneous non-compact hyperboloidal spaces {\cal H}^{p,q}. The gauged supergravities are free of ghosts, despite the non-compactness of the gauge groups. We give a general discussion of the existence of stationary points in the scalar potentials of such supergravities. These are of interest since they can be associated with de Sitter vacuum configurations. We give explicit results for consistent reductions on {\cal H}^{p,q} in various examples, derived from analytic continuation of previously-known consistent sphere reductions. In addition we also consider black hole and cosmological solutions, for specific examples of non-compact gaugings in D=4,5,7.
