Title: Constraint and Super Yang-Mills Equations on the Deformed Superspace  R^(4|16)_\hbar
Authors: Christian Saemann and Martin Wolf
Abstract: It has been known for quite some time that the N=4 super Yang-Mills equations defined on four-dimensional Euclidean space are equivalent to certain constraint equations on the Euclidean superspace R^(4|16). In this paper we consider the constraint equations on a deformed superspace R^(4|16)_\hbar a la Seiberg and derive the deformed super Yang-Mills equations. In showing this, we propose a super Seiberg-Witten map.
