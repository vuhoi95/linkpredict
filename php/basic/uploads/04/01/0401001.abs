Abstract: We construct the fermionic sector and supersymmetry transformation rules of a variant N=(1,1) supergravity theory obtained by generalized Kaluza-Klein reduction from seven dimensions. We show that this model admits both (Minkowski)_4 x S^2 and (Minkowski)_3 x S^3 vacua. We perform a consistent Kaluza-Klein reduction on S^2 and obtain D=4, N=2 supergravity coupled to a vector multiplet, which can be consistently truncated to give rise to D=4, N=1 supergravity with a chiral multiplet.
