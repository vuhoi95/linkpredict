Title: Nonanticommutative superspace and N= 1/2 WZ model
Authors: M. T. Grisaru and S. Penati and A. Romagnoni
Abstract: In these proceedings we review the main results concerning superspace geometries with nonanticommutative spinorial variables and field theories formulated on them. In particular, we report on the quantum properties of the WZ model formulated in the N=1/2 nonanticommutative superspace.
