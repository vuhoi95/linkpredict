Title: Electric/magnetic reciprocity in premetric electrodynamics with and  without magnetic charge, and the complex electromagnetic field
Authors: Friedrich W. Hehl and Yuri N. Obukhov
Abstract: We extend an axiomatic approach to classical electrodynamics, which we developed recently, to the case of non-vanishing magnetic charge. Then two axioms, namely those of the existence of the Lorentz force (Axiom 2) and of magnetic flux conservation (Axiom 3) have to be generalized. Electric/magnetic reciprocity constitutes a guiding principle for this undertaking. The extension of the axioms can be implemented at a premetric stage, i.e., when metric and connection of spacetime don't play a role. Complex Riemann-Silberstein fields of the form $(E\pm i {\cal H},{\cal D}\pm i B)$ have a natural place in the theory, independent of the Hodge duality mapping defined by any particular metric.
