Title: Yangian Symmetry in D=4 Superconformal Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: L. Dolan and C. R. Nappi and E. Witten
Abstract: We will discuss an integrable structure for weakly coupled superconformal Yang-Mills theories, describe certain equivalences for the Yangian algebra, and fill a technical gap in our previous study of this subject.
