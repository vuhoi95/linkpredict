Title: Regular and Periodic Tachyon Kinks
Authors: D. Bazeia and R. Menezes and J. G. Ramos
Abstract: We search for regular tachyon kinks in an extended model, which includes the tachyon action recently proposed to describe the tachyon field. The extended model that we propose adds a new contribution to the tachyon action, and seems to enrich the present scenario for the tachyon field. We have found stable tachyon kinks of regular profile, which may appropriately lead to the singular kink found by Sen sometime ago. Also, under specific conditions we may find periodic array of kink-antikink configurations.
