Title: Strong Coupling vs. 4-D Locality in Induced Gravity
Authors: M. Porrati and J. -W. Rombouts
Abstract: We re-examine the problem of strong coupling in a regularized version of DGP (or ``brane-induced'') gravity. We find that the regularization of ref. hep-th/0304148 differs from DGP in that it does not exhibit strong coupling or ghosts up to cubic order in the interactions. We suggest that the nonlocal nature of the theory, when written in terms of the 4-D metric, is a plausible reason for this phenomenon. Finally, we briefly discuss the possible behavior of the model at higher-order in perturbation theory.
