Title: What is Quantum Theory of Gravity?
Authors: Djordje Minic and Chia-Hsiung Tze
Abstract: We present a line by line derivation of canonical quantum mechanics stemming from the compatibility of the statistical geometry of distinguishable observations with the canonical Poisson structure of Hamiltonian dynamics. This viewpoint can be naturally extended to provide a conceptually novel, non-perturbative formulation of quantum gravity. Possible observational implications of this new approach are briefly mentioned.
