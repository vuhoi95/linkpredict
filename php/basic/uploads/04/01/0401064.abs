Title: Bitwistor Formulation Of The Spinning Particle
Authors: S. Fedoruk and V. G. Zima
Abstract: A twistorial formulation of a particle of arbitrary spin has been constructed. Equations of the twistor formulation are obtained for massive and massless spinning particles. The twistor space of the massive particle is formed by two twistors and two complex scalars. In the massive case, integral transformations relating twistor fields with usual space-time fields have been constructed.
