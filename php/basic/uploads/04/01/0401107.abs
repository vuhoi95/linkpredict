Title: Selfdual spin 2 in 2+1 dimensions revisited
Authors: Pio J. Arias and Rolando Gaitan D.
Abstract: Lagrangian constraints of the spin 2 selfdual theory in a 2+1 flat space-time are studied and the one degree of freedom reduced action is obtained. From this formulation, the quantum operator algebra is computed and the spin contribution on transformation generators is explored.
