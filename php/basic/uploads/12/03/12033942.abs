Title: On meson melting in the quark medium
Authors: K. Bitaghsir Fadafan and E. Azimfard
Abstract: We consider a heavy quark-antiquark $(q\bar{q})$ pair as a heavy meson in the medium composed of light quarks and gluons. By using the AdS/CFT correspondence, the properties of this system are investigated. In particular, we study the inter-quark distance and it is shown that the mechanism of melting in the quark-gluon plasma and in the hadronic phase are the same. It is found that by considering finite coupling corrections, the inter-quark distance of a heavy meson decreases. As a result a heavy meson like $J/ \psi$ will melt at higher temperatures. By considering rotating heavy mesons, we discuss melting of exited states like $\chi_c$ and $\psi'$.
