Title: Four-Dimensional SCFTs from M5-Branes
Authors: Ibrahima Bah and Christopher Beem and Nikolay Bobev and Brian Wecht
Abstract: We engineer a large new set of four-dimensional N=1 superconformal field theories by wrapping M5-branes on complex curves. We present new supersymmetric AdS_5 M-theory backgrounds which describe these fixed points at large N, and then directly construct the dual four-dimensional CFTs for a certain subset of these solutions. Additionally, we provide a direct check of the central charges of these theories by using the M5-brane anomaly polynomial. This is a companion paper which elaborates upon results reported in arXiv:1112:5487.
