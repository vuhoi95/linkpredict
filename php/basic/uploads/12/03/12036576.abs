Title: Black hole tidal charge constrained by strong gravitational lensing
Authors: Zsolt Horváth and László Á. Gergely
Abstract: Spherically symmetric brane black holes have tidal charge, which modifies both weak and strong lensing characteristics. Even if lensing measurements are in agreement with a Schwarzschild lens, the margin of error of the detecting instrument allows for a certain tidal charge. In this paper we derive the respective constraint on the tidal charge of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the center of our galaxy, from the radius of the first relativistic Einstein ring, emerging in strong lensing. We find that even if general relativistic predictions are confirmed by high precision strong lensing measurements, SMBHs could have a much larger tidal charge, than the Sun or neutron stars.
