Title: Galileons as Wess-Zumino Terms
Authors: Garrett Goon and Kurt Hinterbichler and Austin Joyce and Mark Trodden
Abstract: We show that the galileons can be thought of as Wess-Zumino terms for the spontaneous breaking of space-time symmetries. Wess-Zumino terms are terms which are not captured by the coset construction for phenomenological Lagrangians with broken symmetries. Rather they are, in d space-time dimensions, d-form potentials for (d+1)-forms which are non-trivial co-cycles in Lie algebra cohomology of the full symmetry group relative to the unbroken symmetry group. We introduce the galileon algebras and construct the non-trivial (d+1)-form co-cycles, showing that the presence of galileons and multi-galileons in all dimensions is counted by the dimensions of particular Lie algebra cohomology groups. We also discuss the DBI and conformal galileons from this point of view, showing that they are not Wess-Zumino terms, with one exception in each case.
