Title: SFT on separated D-branes and D-brane translation
Authors: Joanna L. Karczmarek and Matheson Longton
Abstract: We discuss novel properties of the string field and the Open String Field Theory action arising in a system with multiple D-branes, then use the level truncation scheme to study marginal deformations and tachyon condensation in a system with two parallel but separated branes. We find string fields corresponding to D-brane decay combined with a finite change in the distance between the two D-branes. Using D-brane separation as a yardstick, we are able to continuously control the spacetime displacement of the D-branes and find that our solutions exist only for a finite range of this displacement. Thus, at least in level truncation, Open String Field Theory seems unable to describe the entire CFT moduli space.
