Title: T-duality of current algebras and their quantization
Authors: Pedram Hekmati and Varghese Mathai
Abstract: In this paper we show that the T-duality transform of Bouwknegt, Evslin and Mathai applies to determine isomorphisms of certain current algebras and their associated vertex algebras on topologically distinct T-dual spacetimes compactified to circle bundles with $H$-flux.
