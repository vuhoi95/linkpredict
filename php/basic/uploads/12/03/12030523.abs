Title: Traversable Wormholes and Time Machines in non-minimally coupled  curvature-matter $f(R)$ theories
Authors: Orfeu Bertolami and Ricardo Zambujal Ferreira
Abstract: We obtain traversable wormhole and time machine solutions of the field equations of an alternative of gravity with non-minimally curvature-matter coupling. Our solutions exhibit a non-trivial redshift function and allow for matter that satisfy the dominant energy condition.
