Title: Anomalous charged fluids in 1+1d from equilibrium partition function
Authors: Sachin Jain and Tarun Sharma
Abstract: In this note we explore the constraints imposed by the existence of equilibrium partition on parity violating charged fluids in 1+1 dimensions at zero derivative order. We write the equilibrium partition function consistent with 1+1 dimensional CPT invariance and which reproduces the correct anomaly in the charge current. The constraints on constitutive relations obtained in this way matches precisely with those obtained using the second law of thermodynamics.
