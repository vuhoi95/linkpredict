Title: Gauge-invariant correlation functions in light-cone superspace
Authors: Sudarshan Ananth and Stefano Kovacs and Sarthak Parikh
Abstract: We initiate a study of correlation functions of gauge-invariant operators in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory using the light-cone superspace formalism. Our primary aim is to develop efficient methods to compute perturbative corrections to correlation functions. This analysis also allows us to examine potential subtleties which may arise when calculating off-shell quantities in light-cone gauge. We comment on the intriguing possibility that the manifest N=4 supersymmetry in this approach may allow for a compact description of entire multiplets and their correlation functions.
