Title: Nambu-Sigma model and effective membrane actions
Authors: Branislav Jurco and Peter Schupp
Abstract: We propose an effective action for a p'-brane with open p-branes ending on it. The action has dual descriptions similar to the commutative and non-commutative ones of the DBI action for D-branes and open strings. The Poisson structure governing the non-commutativity of the D-brane is replaced by a Nambu structure and the open-closed string relations are generalized to the case of p'-branes utilizing a novel Nambu sigma model description of p-branes. In the case of an M5-brane our action interpolates between M5-actions already proposed in the literature and matrix model like actions involving Nambu structures.
