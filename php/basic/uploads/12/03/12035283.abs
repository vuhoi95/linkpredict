Title: Proof of Consistency of Nonlinear Massive Gravity in the Stuckelberg  Formulation
Authors: S. F. Hassan and Angnis Schmidt-May and Mikael von Strauss
Abstract: We address some recent concerns about the absence of the Boulware-Deser ghost in the Stuckelberg formulation of nonlinear massive gravity. First we provide general arguments for why any ghost analysis in the Stuckelberg formulation has to agree with existing consistency proofs that have been carried out without using Stuckelberg fields. We then demonstrate the absence of the ghost at the completely nonlinear level in the Stuckelberg formulation of the minimal massive gravity action. The constraint that removes the ghost field and the associated secondary constraint that eliminates its conjugate momentum are computed explicitly, confirming the consistency of the theory in the Stuckelberg formulation.
