Title: Ultra-high energy particle collisions in a regular spacetime without  blackholes or naked singularities
Authors: Mandar Patil and Pankaj S. Joshi
Abstract: We investigate here the particle acceleration and collisions with extremely large center of mass energies in a perfectly regular spacetime containing neither singularity nor an event horizon. The ultra-high energy collisions of particles near the event horizon of extremal Kerr blackhole, and also in many other examples of extremal blackholes have been investigated and reported recently. We studied an analogous particle acceleration process in the Kerr and Reissner-Nordstrom spacetimes without horizon, containing naked singularities. Further to this, we show here that the particle acceleration and collision process is in fact independent of blackholes and naked singularities, and can happen in a fully regular spacetime containing neither of these. We derive the conditions on the general static spherically symmetric metric for such a phenomena to happen. We show that in order to have ultra-high energy collisions it is necessary for the norm of the timelike Killing vector to admit a maximum with a vanishingly small but a negative value. This is also a condition implying the presence of a surface with extremely large but nevertheless finite value of the redshift or blueshift. Conditions to have ultrahigh energy collisions and regular center imply the violation of strong energy condition near the center while the weak energy condition is respected in the region around the center. Thus the central region is surrounded by a dark energy fluid. Both the energy conditions are respected at the location where the high energy collisions take place. As a concrete example we then investigate the acceleration process in the spacetime geometry derived by Bardeen which is sourced by a non-liner self-gravitating magnetic monopole.
