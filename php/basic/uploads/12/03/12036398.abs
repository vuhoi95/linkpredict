Title: Nambu-Jona-Lasinio Model and Deconstructed Dimension
Authors: Nahomi Kan and Koichiro Kobayashi and Kiyoshi Shiraishi
Abstract: The Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with the mass matrix which appears in a deconstruction model is investigated. We consider two models. In Model A, a mass matrix belonging to a type used in dimensional deconstruction is introduced. In Model B, the four-fermion interaction has a structure of the matrix of the type of dimensional deconstruction. In these models, we find that generation of a dynamical fermion mass spectrum occurs in a strong coupling case.
