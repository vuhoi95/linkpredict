Title: Multiple Membranes in M-theory
Authors: Jonathan Bagger and Neil Lambert and Sunil Mukhi and Constantinos Papageorgakis
Abstract: We review developments in the theory of multiple, parallel membranes in M-theory. After discussing the inherent difficulties pertaining to a maximally supersymmetric lagrangian formulation with the appropriate field content and symmetries, we discuss how introducing the concept of 3-algebras allows for such a description. Different choices of 3-algebras lead to distinct classes of 2+1 dimensional theories with varying degrees of supersymmetry. We then describe how these are equivalent to a type of conventional superconformal Chern-Simons gauge theories at level k, coupled to bifundamental matter. Analysing the physical properties of these theories leads to the identification of a certain subclass of models with configurations of M2-branes in Z_k orbifolds of M-theory. In addition these models give rise to a whole new sector of the gauge/gravity duality in the form of an AdS_4/CFT_3 correspondence. We also discuss mass deformations, higher derivative corrections as well as the possibility of extracting information about M5-brane physics.
