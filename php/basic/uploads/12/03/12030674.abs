Title: Holographic fermions in charged dilaton black branes
Authors: Wei-Jia Li and Jian-Pin Wu
Abstract: By imposing the relativistic boundary term and Lorentz violating that in the dilatonic black brane with a Lifshitz like IR geometry and $AdS_4$ boundary, we study the properties of the spectral functions of the fermions. We find that in the two fixed points, there are emergent Fermi-surface structures and many properties seem to be in agreement with that of Fermi liquid. Especially, the low energy behavior exhibits a linear dispersion relation. In addition, we also find that a holographic flat band also emerges in this background of the dilatonic black brane.
