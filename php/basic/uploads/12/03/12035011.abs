Title: The Pauli equation with complex boundary conditions
Authors: D. Kochan and D. Krejcirik and R. Novak and P. Siegl
Abstract: We consider one-dimensional Pauli Hamiltonians in a bounded interval with possibly non-self-adjoint Robin-type boundary conditions. We study the influence of the spin-magnetic interaction on the interplay between the type of boundary conditions and the spectrum. A special attention is paid to PT-symmetric boundary conditions with the physical choice of the time-reversal operator T.
