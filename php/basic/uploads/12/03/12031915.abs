Title: Collinear and Soft Limits of Multi-Loop Integrands in N=4 Yang-Mills
Authors: John Golden and Marcus Spradlin
Abstract: It has been argued in arXiv:1112.6432 that the planar four-point integrand in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory is uniquely determined by dual conformal invariance together with the absence of a double pole in the integrand of the logarithm in the limit as a loop integration variable becomes collinear with an external momentum. In this paper we reformulate this condition in a simple way in terms of the amplitude itself, rather than its logarithm, and verify that it holds for two- and three-loop MHV integrands for n>4. We investigate the extent to which this collinear constraint and a constraint on the soft behavior of integrands can be used to determine integrands. We find an interesting complementarity whereby the soft constraint becomes stronger while the collinear constraint becomes weaker at larger n. For certain reasonable choices of basis at two and three loops the two constraints in unison appear strong enough to determine MHV integrands uniquely for all n.
