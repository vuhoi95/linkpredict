Title: Complete type IIA superstring action on IIA plane wave background
Authors: Jaemo Park and Hyeonjoon Shin
Abstract: We construct the type IIA Green-Schwarz superstring action on a ten-dimensional IIA plane wave background with 24 supersymmetries keeping the full 32 fermionic coordinates. Starting from the symmetry superalgebra for the maximally supersymmetric eleven dimensional plane wave background, we obtain the eleven dimensional superfields. The Kaluza-Klein reduction leads to the ten dimensional superfields for the IIA plane wave background, from which the type IIA superstring action is constructed. We show that the superstring action reduces correctly to the previously known light-cone gauge fixed action upon imposing the light-cone $\kappa$-symmetry fixing condition.
