Title: Elliptic hypergeometric integrals and 't Hooft anomaly matching  conditions
Authors: V. P. Spiridonov and G. S. Vartanov
Abstract: Elliptic hypergeometric integrals describe superconformal indices of 4d supersymmetric field theories. We show that all 't Hooft anomaly matching conditions for Seiberg dual theories can be derived from $SL(3,\mathbb{Z})$-modular transformation properties of the kernels of dual indices.
