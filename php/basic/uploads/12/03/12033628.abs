Title: Second Order Corrections to the Magnetic Moment of Electron at Finite  Temperature
Authors: Samina S. Masood and Mahnaz Q. Haseeb
Abstract: Magnetic moment of electron at finite temperature is directly related to the modified electron mass in the background heat bath. Magnetic moment of electron gets modified when it couples with the magnetic field at finite temperature through its temperature dependent physical mass. We show that the magnetic moment of electron becomes a complicated function of temperature and even change its temperature dependent behavior around the energies for primordial nucleosynthesis. We calculate the self-mass induced thermal contributions to the magnetic moment of electron, up to the two loop level, for temperatures valid around the era of primordial nucleosynthesis. A comparison of thermal behavior of the magnetic moment is also quantitatively studied in detail, around the temperatures below and above nucleosynthesis temperature range.
