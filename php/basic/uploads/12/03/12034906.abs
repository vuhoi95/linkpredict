Authors: Jianbo Lu and Lina Ma and Molin Liu and Yabo Wu
Abstract: Time variable cosmological constant (TVCC) of holographic origin with interaction in Brans-Dicke theory is discussed in this paper. We investigate some characters for this model, and show the evolutions of deceleration parameter and equation of state (EOS) for dark energy. It is shown that in this scenario an accelerating universe can be obtained and the evolution of EOS for dark energy can cross over the boundary of phantom divide. In addition, a geometrical diagnostic method, jerk parameter is applied to this model to distinguish it with cosmological constant.
