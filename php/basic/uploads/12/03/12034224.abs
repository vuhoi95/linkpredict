Title: Non-abelian Action for Multiple Five-Branes with Self-Dual Tensors
Authors: Chong-Sun Chu and Sheng-Lan Ko
Abstract: We construct an action for non-abelian 2-form in 6-dimensions. Our action consists of a non-abelian generalization of the abelian action of Perry and Schwarz for a single five-brane. It admits a self-duality equation on the field strength as the equation of motion. It has a modified 6d Lorentz symmetry. On dimensional reduction on a circle, our action gives the standard 5d Yang-Mills action plus higher order corrections. Based on these properties, we propose that our theory describes the gauge sector of multiple M5-branes in flat space.
