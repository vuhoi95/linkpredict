Title: On the classical equivalence of monodromy matrices in squashed sigma  model
Authors: Io Kawaguchi and Takuya Matsumoto and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We proceed to study the hybrid integrable structure in two-dimensional non-linear sigma models with target space three-dimensional squashed spheres. A quantum affine algebra and a pair of Yangian algebras are realized in the sigma models and, according to them, there are two descriptions to describe the classical dynamics 1) the trigonometric description and 2) the rational description, respectively. For every description, a Lax pair is constructed and the associated monodromy matrix is also constructed. In this paper we show the gauge-equivalence of the monodromy matrices in the trigonometric and rational description under a certain relation between spectral parameters and the rescalings of sl(2) generators.
