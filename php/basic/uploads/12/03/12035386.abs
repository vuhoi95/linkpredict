Title: Matrix Theory for Baryons: An Overview of Holographic QCD for Nuclear  Physics
Authors: Sinya Aoki and Koji Hashimoto and Norihiro Iizuka
Abstract: We provide, for non-experts, a brief overview of holographic QCD and a review of a recent proposal of matrix-description of multi-baryon systems in holographic QCD. Based on the matrix model, we derive the baryon interaction at short distances in multi-flavor holographic QCD. We show that there is a very universal repulsive core of inter-baryon forces for generic number of flavors. This is consistent with a recent lattice QCD analysis for N_f = 2, 3 where repulsive core looks universal. We also provide a comparison of our results with the lattice QCD and the operator product expansion (OPE) analysis.
