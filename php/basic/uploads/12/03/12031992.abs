Title: Microcausality of spin-induced noncommutative theories
Authors: Jia-Hui Huang and Weijian Wang
Abstract: In this brief report, the microcausility of quantum field theory on spin-induced noncom- mutative spacetime is discussed. It is found that for spacelike seperation the microcausality is not obeyed by the theory generally. It means that Lorentz covariance can not guaran- tee microcausality in quantum field thoery. We also give some comments about quantum field thoeries on such noncommutative spacetime and the relations between noncommutative spacetime and causality.
