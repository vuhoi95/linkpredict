Title: $κ$-Poincaré phase space: speed of massless particles and  relativity of spacetime locality
Authors: Giacomo Rosati and Niccolo Loret and Giovanni Amelino-Camelia
Abstract: The study of phase-space constructions based on the properties of the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e Hopf algebra has been a very active area, mostly because of its possible applications in the phenomenology of Planck-scale-induced momentum dependence of the speed of ultrarelativistic particles. We here summarize, with emphasis on the emerging relativity of spacetime locality, some results relevant for this research program that were recently reported in arXiv:1006.2126 (PhysRevLett106,071301) arXiv:1102.4637 (PhysLettB700,150) and arXiv:1107.1724 .
