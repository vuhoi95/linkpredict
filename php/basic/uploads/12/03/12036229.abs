Title: Dual composition of odd-dimensional models
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Sarmishtha Kumar
Abstract: A general way of interpreting odd dimensional models as a doublet of chiral models is discussed. Based on the equations of motion this dual composition is illustrated. Examples from quantum mechanics, field theory and gravity are considered. Specially the recently advocated topologically massive gravity is analysed in some details.
