Title: Quantization of a gauge theory on a curved noncommutative space
Authors: M. Buric and M. Dimitrijevic and V. Radovanovic and M. Wohlgenannt
Abstract: We study quantization of a gauge analogon of the Grosse-Wulkenhaar model: we find divergent one-loop contributions to the 1-point and 2-point Green functions. We obtain that five counterterms are necessary for renormalization and that all divergences are logarithmic.
