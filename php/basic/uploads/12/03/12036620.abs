Title: Holographic Entanglement Entropy in Insulator/Superconductor Transition
Authors: Rong-Gen Cai and Song He and Li Li and Yun-Long Zhang
Abstract: We investigate the behaviors of entanglement entropy in the holographical insulator/superconductor phase transition. We calculate the holographic entanglement entropy for two kinds of geometry configurations in a completely back-reacted gravitational background describing the insulator/superconductor phase transition. The non-monotonic behavior of the entanglement entropy is found in this system. In the belt geometry case, there exist four phases characterized by the chemical potential and belt width.
