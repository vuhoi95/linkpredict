Title: Higher Spin Black Holes from CFT
Authors: Matthias R. Gaberdiel and Thomas Hartman and Kewang Jin
Abstract: Higher spin gravity in three dimensions has explicit black holes solutions, carrying higher spin charge. We compute the free energy of a charged black hole from the holographic dual, a 2d CFT with extended conformal symmetry, and find exact agreement with the bulk thermodynamics. In the CFT, higher spin corrections to the free energy can be calculated at high temperature from correlation functions of W-algebra currents.
