Title: He-McKellar-Wilkens effect and Scalar Aharonov-Bohm effect for a neutral  particle based on the Lorentz symmetry violation
Authors: K. Bakke and E. O. Silva and H. Belich
Abstract: In this contribution, we discuss the He-McKellar-Wilkens effect and the Scalar Aharonov-Bohm effect for neutral particles based on the Lorentz symmetry violation background, by showing that the background of the Lorentz symmetry violation yields abelian quantum phases for a neutral particle. We also study the nonrelativistic bound states for a neutral particle interacting with a Coulomb-like potential based on the Lorentz symmetry violation background given by a fixed vector field parallel to the radial direction.
