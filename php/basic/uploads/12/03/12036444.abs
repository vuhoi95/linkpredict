Title: Comment on "Geometrothermodynamics of a Charged Black Hole of String  Theory"
Authors: C. S. Lopez-Monsalvo and F. Nettel and A. Sanchez
Abstract: We comment on the conclusions found by Larra\~naga and Mojica regarding the consistency of the Geoemtrothermodynamics programme to describe the critical behaviour of a Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger charged black hole. We argue that making the appropriate choice of metric for the thermodynamic phase space and, most importantly, considering the homogeneity of the thermodynamic potential we obtain consistent results for such a black hole.
