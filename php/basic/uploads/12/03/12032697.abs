Title: Berry Curvature, Triangle Anomalies, and the Chiral Magnetic Effect in  Fermi Liquids
Authors: Dam Thanh Son and Naoki Yamamoto
Abstract: In a three-dimensional Fermi liquid, quasiparticles near the Fermi surface may possess a Berry curvature. We show that if the Berry curvature has a nonvanishing flux through the Fermi surface, the particle number associated with this Fermi surface has a triangle anomaly in external electromagnetic fields. We show how Landau's Fermi liquid theory should be modified to take into account the Berry curvature. We show that the "chiral magnetic effect" also emerges from the Berry curvature flux.
