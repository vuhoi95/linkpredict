Title: Longitudinal Rescaling of Quantum Chromodynamics
Authors: Axel Cort√©s Cubero and Peter Orland
Abstract: We examine the effect of quantum longitudinal rescaling of coordinates, on the action of quantum chromodynamics (with quarks) to one loop. We use an aspherical Wilsonian integration (previously applied to the pure Yang-Mills theory and to quantum electrodynamics). Quantum fluctuations produce anomalous powers of the rescaling parameter in the coefficients of the rescaled action. Our results are valid for small rescalings only, because perturbation theory breaks down for large rescalings.
