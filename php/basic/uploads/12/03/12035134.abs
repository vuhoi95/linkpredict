Title: The Metric of Yang-Mills Orbit Space on the Lattice
Authors: M. Laufer and P. Orland
Abstract: We find coordinates, the metric tensor, the inverse metric tensor and the Laplace-Beltrami operator for the orbit space of Hamiltonian SU(2) gauge theory on a finite, rectangular lattice. This is done using a complete axial gauge fixing. The Gribov problem can be completely solved, with no remaining gauge ambiguities.
