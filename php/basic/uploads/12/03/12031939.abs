Title: Supersymmetric holography on AdS3
Authors: Constantin Candu and Matthias R. Gaberdiel
Abstract: The proposed duality between Vasiliev's supersymmetric higher spin theory on AdS3 and the 't Hooft limit of the 2d superconformal Kazama-Suzuki models is analysed in detail. In particular, we show that the partition functions of the two theories agree in the large N limit.
