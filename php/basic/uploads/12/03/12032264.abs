Title: Gauge-flation trajectories in Chromo-Natural Inflation
Authors: Peter Adshead and Mark Wyman
Abstract: We provide a detailed discussion of the multifield trajectories and inflationary dynamics of the recently proposed model of Chromo-Natural inflation, which allows for slow roll inflation on a steep potential with the aid of classical non-Abelian gauge fields. We show that slow roll inflation can be achieved across a wide range of the parameter space. We demonstrate that Chromo-Natural Inflation includes trajectories that match those found in Gauge-flation and describe how the theories are related.
