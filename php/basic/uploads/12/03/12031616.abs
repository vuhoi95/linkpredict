Title: Integrability on the Master Space
Authors: Antonio Amariti and Davide Forcella and Alberto Mariotti
Abstract: It has been recently shown that every SCFT living on D3 branes at a toric Calabi-Yau singularity surprisingly also describes a complete integrable system. In this paper we use the Master Space as a bridge between the integrable system and the underlying field theory and we reinterpret the Poisson manifold of the integrable system in term of the geometry of the field theory moduli space.
