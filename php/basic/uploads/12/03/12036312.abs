Title: Chiral Vortical Effect in Superfluid
Authors: V. P. Kirilin and A. V. Sadofyev and V. I. Zakharov
Abstract: We consider rotating superfluid pionic liquid, with superfluidity being induced by isospin chemical potential. The rotation is known to result in a chiral current flowing along the axis of the rotation. We argue that in case of superfluidity the chiral current is realized on fermionic zero modes propagating along vortices. The current evaluated in this way differs by a factor of two from the standard one. The reason is that the chiral charge is carried by zero modes which propagate with speed of light, and thus the liquid cannot be described by a single (local) velocity, like it is assumed in standard derivations.
