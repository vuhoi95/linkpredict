Title: Noncommutative Dirac oscillator in an external magnetic field
Authors: Bhabani Prasad Mandal and Sumit Kumar Rai
Abstract: We show that (2+1) dimensional noncommutative Dirac oscillator in an external magnetic field is mapped onto the same but with reduced angular frequency in absence of magnetic field. We construct the relativistic Landau levels by solving corresponding Dirac equation in (2+1) dimensional noncommutative phase space. We observe that lowest Landau levels are exactly same as in commutative space and independent of non-commutative parameter. All the Landau levels become independent of noncommutative parameter for a critical value of the magnetic field. Several other interesting features along with the relevance of such models in the study of atomic transitions in a radiation field have been discussed.
