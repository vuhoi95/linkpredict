Title: Photon-Graviton Amplitudes from the Effective Action
Authors: F. Bastianelli and O. Corradini and J. M. Davila and C. Schubert
Abstract: We report on the status of an ongoing effort to calculate the complete one-loop low-energy effective actions in Einstein-Maxwell theory with a massive scalar or spinor loop, and to use them for obtaining the explicit form of the corresponding M-graviton/N-photon amplitudes. We present explicit results for the effective actions at the one-graviton four-photon level, and for the amplitudes at the one-graviton two-photon level. As expected on general grounds, these amplitudes relate in a simple way to the corresponding four-photon amplitudes. We also derive the gravitational Ward identity for the 1PI one-graviton -- N photon amplitude.
