Title: Fluctuation of Dirac operator and equivalence principle
Authors: Mathieu Marciante and Thomas Sch√ºcker
Abstract: General Relativity formulated with Noncommutative geometry allows one to obtain, via the fluctuation of Dirac operator, an exact equivalence principle: generation of curvature and torsion from flat space. The fluctuation method presented in this report is applied on two examples.
