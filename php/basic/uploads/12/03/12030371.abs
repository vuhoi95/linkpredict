Title: Supersymmetric Gauge Theories on the Five-Sphere
Authors: Kazuo Hosomichi and Rak-Kyeong Seong and Seiji Terashima
Abstract: We construct Euclidean 5d supersymmetric gauge theories on the five-sphere with vector and hypermultiplets. The SUSY transformation and the action are explicitly determined from the standard Noether procedure as well as from off-shell supergravity. Using localization techniques, the path-integral is shown to be restricted to the integration over a generalization of instantons on CP^2 and the Coulomb moduli.
