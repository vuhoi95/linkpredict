Authors: Peter I. Slavov and Stoytcho S. Yazadjiev
Abstract: In the present paper we investigate the Hawking radiation of asymptotically non-flat dyonic black holes in 4D Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity in semi-classical approximation. We show that the problem allows an exact analytical treatment and we compute exactly the semi-classical radiation spectrum of both non-extremal and extremal black holes under consideration. In the high frequency regime we find that the Hawking temperature does not agree with the surface gravity when the magnetic charge is nonzero. Even more surprisingly the Hawking temperature is independent of the black hole intrinsic characteristics, as the mass and magnetic charge, and depends only on the linear dilaton background parameter.
