Title: Anisotropic hydrodynamics, holography and the chiral magnetic effect
Authors: Ilmar Gahramanov and Tigran Kalaydzhyan and Ingo Kirsch
Abstract: We discuss a possible dependence of the chiral magnetic effect (CME) on the elliptic flow coefficient v2. We first study this in a hydrodynamic model for a static anisotropic plasma with multiple anomalous U(1) currents. In the case of two charges, one axial and one vector, the CME formally appears as a first-order transport coefficient in the vector current. We compute this transport coefficient and show its dependence on v2. We also determine the CME-coefficient from first-order corrections to the dual AdS background using the fluid-gravity duality. For small anisotropies, we find numerical agreement with the hydrodynamic result.
