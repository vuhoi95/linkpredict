Authors: Kentaro Tanabe and Tetsuya Shiromizu and Shunichiro Kinoshita
Abstract: We define the angular momentum at null infinity in higher dimensions. The asymptotic symmetry at null infinity becomes the Poincare group in higher dimensions. This fact implies that the angular momentum can be defined without any ambiguities such as supertranslation in four dimensions. Indeed we can show that the angular momentum in our definition is transformed covariantly with respect to the Poincare group.
