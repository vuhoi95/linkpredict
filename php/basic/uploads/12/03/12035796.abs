Title: Dark Matter density and the Higgs mass in LVS String Phenomenology
Authors: Senarath de Alwis and Kevin Givens
Abstract: The Large Volume Scenario for getting a non-supersymmetric vacuum in type IIB string theory leads, through the Weyl anomaly and renormalization group running, to an interesting phenomenology. However, for gravitino masses below 500 TeV there are cosmological problems and the resulting Higgs mass is well below 124 GeV. Here we discuss the phenomenology and cosmology for gravitino masses which are $\gtrsim$ 500 TeV. We find that not only is the cosmological modulus problem alleviated and the right value for dark matter density obtained, but also the Higgs mass is in the 122-125 GeV range. However the spectrum of SUSY particles will be too heavy to be observed at the LHC.
