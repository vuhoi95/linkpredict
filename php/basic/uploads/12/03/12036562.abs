Abstract: Compactifications in duality covariant constructions such as generalised geometry and double field theory have proven to be suitable frameworks to reproduce gauged supergravities containing non-geometric fluxes. However, it is a priori unclear whether these approaches only provide a reformulation of old results, or also contain new physics. To address this question, we classify the T- and U-duality orbits of gaugings of (half-)maximal supergravities in dimensions seven and higher. It turns out that all orbits have a geometric supergravity origin in the maximal case, while there are non-geometric orbits in the half-maximal case. We show how the latter are obtained from compactifications of double field theory.
