Title: Thermal Effective Lagrangian of Static Gravitational Fields
Authors: F T Brandt and J B Siqueira
Abstract: We compute the effective Lagrangian of static gravitational fields interacting with thermal fields. Our approach employs the usual imaginary time formalism as well as the equivalence between the static and space-time independent external gravitational fields. This allows to obtain a closed form expression for the thermal effective Lagrangian in $d$ space-time dimensions.
