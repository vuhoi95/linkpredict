Title: Hawking Radiation and Non-equilibrium Quantum Critical Current Noise
Authors: Julian Sonner and Andrew G. Green
Abstract: The dynamical scaling of quantum critical systems in thermal equilibrium may be inherited in the driven steady-state, leading to universal out-of-equilibrium behaviour. This attractive notion has been demonstrated in just a few cases. We demonstrate how holography - a mapping between the quantum critical system and a gravity dual - provides an illuminating perspective and new results. Non-trivial out-of-equilibrium universality is particularly apparent in current noise, which is dual to Hawking radiation in the gravitational system. We calculate this in a 2-dimensional system driven by a strong in-plane electric field and deduce a universal scaling function interpolating between previously established equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium current noise. Since this applies at all fields, out-of-equilibrium experiments no longer require very high fields for comparison with theory.
