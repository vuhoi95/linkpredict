Title: Supersymmetric Extension of the Quantum Spherical Model
Authors: Pedro R. S. Gomes and P. F. Bienzobaz and M. Gomes
Abstract: In this work, we present a supersymmetric extension of the quantum spherical model, both in components and also in the superspace formalisms. We find the solution for short/long range interactions through the imaginary time formalism path integral approach. The existence of critical points (classical and quantum) is analyzed and the corresponding critical dimensions are determined.
