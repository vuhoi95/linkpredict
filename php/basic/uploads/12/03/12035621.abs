Title: Slavnov determinants, Yang-Mills structure constants, and discrete KP
Authors: O Foda and M Wheeler
Abstract: Using Slavnov's scalar product of a Bethe eigenstate and a generic state in closed XXZ spin-1/2 chains, with possibly twisted boundary conditions, we obtain determinant expressions for tree-level structure constants in 1-loop conformally-invariant sectors in various planar (super) Yang-Mills theories. When certain rapidity variables are allowed to be free rather than satisfy Bethe equations, these determinants become discrete KP tau-functions.
