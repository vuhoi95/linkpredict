Title: Affine Quantization and the Initial Cosmological Singularity
Authors: MichaÃ«l Fanuel and Simone Zonetti
Abstract: The Affine Coherent State Quantization procedure is applied to the case of a FRLW universe in the presence of a cosmological constant. The quantum corrections alter the dynamics of the system in the semiclassical regime, providing a potential barrier term which avoids all classical singularities, as already suggested in other models studied in the literature. Furthermore the quantum corrections are responsible for an accelerated cosmic expansion. This work intends to explore some of the implications of the recently proposed "Enhanced Quantization" procedure in a simplified model of cosmology.
