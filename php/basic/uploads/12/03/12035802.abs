Title: The Three Faces of a Fixed Point

Abstract: It has been argued that the only mathematically precise quantum descriptions of gravitating systems are from vantage points which allow an unbounded amount of information to be gathered. For an eternally inflating universe that means a hat, i.e., the asymptotic future of a flat FRW universe. The boundary of the hat (the place where it enters the bulk geometry) is the seat of the FRW/CFT duality. In this paper we discuss the perturbative and non-perturbative fixed points of FRW/CFT as seen from the three regions which share this boundary. Perturbatively, there is nothing universal about the FRW duality; there is a separate construction for each possible initial vacuum. We explain how bubble collisions induce a non-perturbative flow to a universal fixed point which contains information about the entire landscape. We also argue that there is a duality between the landscape of de Sitter vacua and a discretuum of very low-dimension relevant operators in the FRW/CFT spectrum. In principle this provides us with a precise definition of unstable de Sitter vacua. Along the way we show that BPS domain walls play a special role in reinforcing the "persistence of memory" and breaking the symmetries of the hat.
