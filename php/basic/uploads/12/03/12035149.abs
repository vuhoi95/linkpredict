Title: Tensor gauge field localization on a string-like defect
Authors: L. J. S. Sousa and W. T. Cruz and C. A. S. Almeida
Abstract: This work is devoted to the study of tensor gauge fields on a string-like defect in six dimensions. This model is very successful in localizing fields of various spins only by gravitational interaction. Due to problems of field localization in membrane models we are motivated to investigate if a string-like defect localizes the Kalb-Ramond field. In contrast to what happens in Randall-Sundrum and thick brane scenarios we find a localized zero mode without the addition of other fields in the bulk. Considering the local string defect we obtain analytical solutions for the massive modes. Also, we take the equations of motion in a supersymmetric quantum mechanics scenario in order to analyze the massive modes. The influence of the mass as well as the angular quantum number in the solutions is described. An additional analysis on the massive modes is performed by the Kaluza-Klein decomposition, which provides new details about the KK masses.
