Abstract: We propose a mechanism to create a vorton or three-dimensional skyrmion in phase-separated two-component BECs with the order parameters Psi_1 and Psi_2 of the two condensates. We consider a pair of a domain wall (brane) and an anti-domain wall (anti-brane) stretched by vortices (strings), where the Psi_2 component with a vortex winding is sandwiched by two domains of the Psi_1 component. The vortons appear when the domain wall pair annihilates. Experimentally, this can be realized by preparing the phase separation in the order Psi_1, Psi_2 and Psi_1 components, where the nodal plane of a dark soliton in Psi_1 component is filled with the Psi_2 component with vorticity. By selectively removing the filling Psi_2 component gradually with a resonant laser beam, the collision of the brane and anti-brane can be made, creating vortons.
