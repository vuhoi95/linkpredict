Title: Stable phantom-divide crossing in two scalar models with matter
Authors: Rio Saitou and Shin'ichi Nojiri
Abstract: We construct cosmological models with two scalar fields, which has the structure as in the ghost condensation model or k-essence model. The models can describe the stable phantom crossing, which should be contrasted with one scalar tensor models, where the infinite instability occurs at the crossing the phantom divide. We give a general formulation of the reconstruction in terms of the e-foldings N by including the matter although in the previous two scalar models, which are extensions of the scalar tensor model, it was difficult to give a formulation of the reconstruction when we include matters. In the formulation of the reconstruction, we start with a model with some arbitrary functions, and find the functions which generates the history in the expansion of the universe. We also give general arguments for the stabilities of the models and the reconstructed solution. The viability of a model is also investigated by comparing the observational data.
