Title: Separable and non-separable multi-field inflation and large  non-Gaussianity
Authors: Anupam Mazumdar and Lingfei Wang
Abstract: In this paper we provide a general framework based on $\delta N$ formalism to estimate the cosmological observables pertaining to the cosmic microwave background radiation for non-separable potentials, and for generic \emph{end of inflation} boundary conditions. We provide analytical and numerical solutions to the relevant observables by decomposing the cosmological perturbations along the curvature and the isocurvature directions, \emph{instead of adiabatic and entropy directions}. We then study under what conditions large bi-spectrum and tri-spectrum can be generated through phase transition which ends inflation. In an illustrative example, we show that large $f_{NL}\sim {\cal O}(80)$ and $\tau_{NL}\sim {\cal O}(20000)$ can be obtained for the case of separable and non-separable inflationary potentials.
