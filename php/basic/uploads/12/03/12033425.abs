Title: Meson Thermalization in Various Dimensions
Authors: Mohammad Ali-Akbari and Hajar Ebrahim
Abstract: In gauge/gravity duality framework the thermalization of mesons in strongly coupled (p+1)-dimensional gauge theories is studied for a general Dp-Dq system, q>=p, using the flavour Dq-brane as a probe. Thermalization corresponds to the horizon formation on the flavour Dq-brane. We calculate the thermalization time-scale due to a time-dependent change in the baryon number chemical potential, baryon injection in the field theory. We observe that for such a general system it has a universal behaviour depending only on the t'Hooft coupling constant and the two parameters which describe how we inject baryons into the system. We show that this universal behaviour is independent of the details of the theory whether it is conformal and/or supersymmetric.
