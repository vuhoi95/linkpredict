Title: Eliminating ambiguities for quantum corrections to strings moving in  $AdS_4\times \mathbb{CP}^3$
Authors: Cristhiam Lopez-Arcos and Horatiu Nastase
Abstract: We apply a physical principle, previously used to eliminate ambiguities in quantum corrections to the 2 dimensional kink, to the case of spinning strings moving in $AdS_4\times \mathbb{CP}^3$, thought of as another kind of two dimensional soliton. We find that this eliminates the ambiguities and selects the result compatible with AdS/CFT, providing a solid foundation for one of the previous calculations, which found agreement. The method can be applied to other classical string "solitons".
