Title: Very special relativity as particle in a gauge field and two-time  physics
Authors: Juan M. Romero and Eric Escobar and Etelberto Vazquez
Abstract: The action for a $(3+1)$-dimensional particle in very special relativity is studied. It is proved that massless particles only travel in effective $(2+1)$-dimensional space-time. It is remarkable that this action can be written as an action for a relativistic particle in a background gauge field and it is shown that this field causes the dimensional reduction. A new symmetry for this system is found. Furthermore, a general action with restored Lorentz symmetry is proposed for this system. It is shown that this new action contains very special relativity and two-time physics.
