Title: Non-Universal Anomalies in Heterotic String Constructions
Authors: Christoph LÃ¼deling and Fabian Ruehle and Clemens Wieck
Abstract: We investigate anomalies on heterotic orbifolds and their blowups. We give a simple example of an orbifold blowup which contains anomalous U(1) symmetries that are canceled by axions which couple non-universally to the different gauge groups, thus clarifying some confusion which recently arose in the literature concerning anomaly universality. We argue that non-universal axionic couplings are the general case, and that the couplings are only universal in the case of orbifolds. We comment on the consequences of this non-universality for discrete R symmetries. We furthermore investigate the origin of discrete (R and non-R) symmetries on smooth Calabi-Yau manifolds.
