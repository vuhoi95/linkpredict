Abstract: Recently, a new quantum model - two-dimensional generalization of the Scarf II - was completely solved analytically by SUSY method for the integer values of parameter. Now, the same integrable model, but with arbitrary values of parameter, will be studied by means of supersymmetrical intertwining relations. The Hamiltonian does not allow the conventional separation of variables, but the supercharge operator does allow, leading to the partial solvability of the model. This approach, which can be called as the first variant of SUSY-separation, together with shape invariance of the model, provides analytical calculation of the part of spectrum and corresponding wave functions (quasi-exact-solvability). The model is shown to obey two different variants of shape invariance which can be combined effectively in construction of energy levels and wave functions.
