Title: Three Spin Spiky Strings in beta-deformed Background
Authors: Kamal L. Panigrahi and Pabitra M. Pradhan and Pratap K. Swain
Abstract: We study rigidly rotating strings in $\beta$-deformed $AdS_5\times S^5$ background with one spin along AdS$_5$ and two angular momenta along $S^5$. We find the spiky string solutions and present the dispersion relation among various charges in this background. We further generalize the result to the case of four angular momenta along $AdS_5 \times S_{\gamma}^5$.
