Title: A toy model based analysis on the effect of the Lee-Wick partners in the  evolution of the early universe
Authors: Kaushik Bhattacharya and Suratna Das
Abstract: In the present article the thermodynamic results of the Lee-Wick partner infested universe have been applied in a toy model where there is one Lee-Wick partner to each of the standard model particle and more over the longitudinal degrees of freedom of the massive partners of the standard massless gauge bosons are neglected at high temperatures. For practical purposes, the chiral fermionic sector of Lee-wick theories requires two Lee-Wick partners per fermion which opens up the possibility for a negative energy density of the early universe. A toy Lee-Wick model with one fermionic partner relaxes such oddities and hence easy to deal with. In a similar way, the longitudinal degrees of freedom of the massive gauge boson partners also have the potential to yield negative energy densities and thus those will be neglected in a toy model study. In such a toy model one can analytically calculate the time-temperature relation in the very early radiation dominated universe which shows interesting new physics. The article also tries to point out how a Lee-Wick particle dominated early cosmology transforms into the standard cosmological model. Based on the results of this toy model analysis a brief discussion on the more realistic model, which can accommodate two Lee-Wick partners for each standard fermionic field and the longitudinal degree of freedom of partners of the gauge fields, is presented. It has been shown that such an universe is mostly very difficult to attain but there are certain conditions where one can indeed think of such an universe which can evolve into the standard cosmological universe in a short time duration.
