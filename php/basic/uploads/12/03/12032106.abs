Title: Boundary conditions for SU(2) Yang-Mills on $AdS_4$
Authors: Dileep P. Jatkar and Jae-Hyuk Oh
Abstract: We consider SU(2) Yang-Mills theory on $AdS_4$ by imposing various boundary conditions, which correspond to non-trivial deformations of its boundary $CFT$. We obtain classical solutions of Yang-Mills fields up to the first subleading order correction by using small amplitude expansion of the gauge field without considering gravitational back reaction. We also consider SU(2) Yang-Mills instanton solution in $AdS_4$ bulk, and propose a boundary action. It turns out that the boundary theory is the Chern Simons theory with a non-local deformation which has the form similar to the Wilson line. In the limit of the deformation parameter $\rho \rightarrow \infty$, this non-local deformation is suppressed and the boundary theory becomes pure Chern Simons. For large but finite values of $\rho$, this non-local deformation can be treated perturbatively within the Chern-Simon theory.
