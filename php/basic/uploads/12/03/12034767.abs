Title: Complex time evolution in geometric quantization and generalized  coherent state transforms
Authors: William D. Kirwin and José M. Mourão and João P. Nunes
Abstract: For the cotangent bundle $T^{*}K$ of a compact Lie group $K$, we study the complex-time evolution of the vertical tangent bundle and the associated geometric quantization Hilbert space $L^{2}(K)$ under an infinite-dimensional family of Hamiltonian flows. For each such flow, we construct a generalized coherent state transform (CST), which is a unitary isomorphism between $L^{2}(K)$ and a certain weighted $L^{2}$-space of holomorphic functions. For a particular set of choices, we show that this isomorphism is naturally decomposed as a product of a Heisenberg-type evolution (for complex time $-\tau$) within $L^{2}(K)$, followed by a polarization--changing geometric quantization evolution (for complex time $+\tau$). In this case, our construction yields the usual generalized Segal--Bargmann transform of Hall. We show that the infinite-dimensional family of Hamiltonian flows can also be understood in terms of Thiemann's "complexifier" method (which generalizes the construction of adapted complex structures). We will also investigate some properties of the generalized CSTs, and discuss how their existence can be understood in terms of Mackey's generalization of the Stone-von Neumann theorem.
