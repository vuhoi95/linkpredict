Authors: Luke Barclay and Ruth Gregory and Susha Parameswaran and Gianmassimo Tasinato and Ivonne Zavala
Abstract: We compute string theoretic black hole solutions having Lifshitz asymptotics with a general dynamical exponent z>1. We start by constructing solutions in a flux compactification of six dimensional supergravity, then uplift them to massive type IIA supergravity. Alongside the Lifshitz black holes we study the simpler anti-de Sitter solutions, of which there are a 1-parameter family in this supergravity, and compare and contrast their properties. The black holes are characterized by a two-form and scalar charge, and we numerically explore their configuration space and thermodynamical aspects.
