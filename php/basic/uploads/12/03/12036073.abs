Title: Casimir scaling in gauge theories with a gap. Deformed QCD as a toy  model
Authors: Evan Thomas and Ariel R. Zhitnitsky
Abstract: We study a Casimir-like behaviour in a "deformed QCD". We demonstrate that for the system defined on a manifold of size L the difference Delta E between the energies of a system in a non-trivial background and Minkowski space-time geometry exhibits the Casimir-like scaling Delta E \sim L^{-1}, despite the presence of a mass gap in the system, in contrast with naive expectation Delta E \sim \exp(-m L), which would normally originate from any physical massive propagating degrees of freedom consequent to conventional dispersion relations. The Casimir-like behaviour in our system comes instead from a non-dispersive ("contact") term which is not related to any physical propagating degrees of freedom, such that the naive argument is simply not applicable. These ideas can be explicitly tested in weakly coupled deformed QCD. We comment on profound consequences for cosmology of this effect if it persists in real strongly coupled QCD.
