Title: N=1/2 Global SUSY: R-Matrix Approach
Authors: C. Gonera and M. Wodzislawski
Abstract: R-matrix method is used to construct supersymmetric extensions of theta - Euclidean group preserving N = 1/2 supersymmetry and its three- parameter generalization. These quantum symmetry supergroups can be considered as global counterparts of appropriately twisted Euclidean superalgebras. The corresponding generalized global symmetry transformations act on deformed superspaces as the usual ones do on undeformed spaces. However, they depend on non(anti)commuting parameters satisfying (anti)commutation relations defined by relevant R matrix.
