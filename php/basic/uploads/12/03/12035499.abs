Title: Canonical approach to Courant brackets for D-branes
Authors: Machiko Hatsuda and Tetsuji Kimura
Abstract: We present an extension of the Courant bracket to the ones for Dp-branes by analyzing Hamiltonians and local superalgebras. Contrast to the basis of the bracket for a fundamental string which consists of the momentum and the winding modes, the ones for Dp-branes contain higher rank R-R coupling tensors. We show that the R-R gauge transformation rules are obtained by these Courant brackets for Dp-branes where the Dirac-Born-Infeld gauge field and the "two-vierbein field" play an essential role. Canonical analysis of the worldvolume theories naturally gives the basis of the brackets and the target space backgrounds keeping T-duality manifest at least for NS-NS sector. In a D3-brane analysis S-duality is manifest as a symmetry of interchanging the NS-NS coupling and the R-R coupling.
