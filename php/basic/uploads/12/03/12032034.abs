Title: On the non-local heat kernel expansion
Authors: A. Codello and O. Zanusso
Abstract: We propose a novel derivation of the non-local heat kernel expansion, first studied by Barvinsky, Vilkovisky and Avramidi, based on simple diagrammatic equations satisfied by the heat kernel. For Laplace-type differential operators we obtain the explicit form of the non-local heat kernel form factors to second order in the curvature. Our method can be generalized easily to the derivation of the non-local heat kernel expansion of a wide class of differential operators.
