Title: A non-renormalization theorem for chiral primary 3-point functions
Authors: Marco Baggio and Jan de Boer and Kyriakos Papadodimas
Abstract: In this note we prove a non-renormalization theorem for the 3-point functions of 1/2 BPS primaries in the four-dimensional N = 4 SYM and chiral primaries in two dimensional N =(4,4) SCFTs. Our proof is rather elementary: it is based on Ward identities and the structure of the short multiplets of the superconformal algebra and it does not rely on superspace techniques. We also discuss some possible generalizations to less supersymmetric multiplets.
