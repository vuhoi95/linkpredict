Title: Domain Wall Brane in Eddington Inspired Born-Infeld Gravity
Authors: Yu-Xiao Liu and Ke Yang and Heng Guo and Yuan Zhong
Abstract: Recently, inspired by Eddington's theory, an alternative gravity called Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity was proposed by Ba$\tilde{\text{n}}$ados and Ferreira. It is equivalent to Einstein's general relativity in vacuum, but deviates from it when matter is included. Interestingly, it seems that the cosmological singularities are prevented in this theory. Based on the new theory, we investigate a thick brane model with a scalar field presenting in the five-dimensional background. A domain wall solution is obtained, and further, we find that at low energy the four-dimensional Einstein gravity is recovered on the brane. Moreover, the stability of gravitational perturbations is ensured in this model.
