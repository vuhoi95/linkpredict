Title: A Note on the Collision of Reissner-Nordstr√∂m Gravitational Shock  Waves in AdS
Authors: Alvaro Duenas-Vidal and Miguel A. Vazquez-Mozo
Abstract: We study the collision of two Reissner-Nordstr\"om gravitational shock waves in AdS and show that the charge completely prevents the formation of marginally trapped surfaces of the Penrose type with topology S^(D-2), independently of the energy and the value of the impact parameter. In the case of head-on collisions, a numerical analysis shows that no trapped surfaces with topology S^1 \times S^(D-3) form either.
