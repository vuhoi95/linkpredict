Title: On the spectra of the quantized action-variables of the compactified  Ruijsenaars-Schneider system
Authors: L. Feher and C. Klimcik
Abstract: A simple derivation of the spectra of the action-variables of the quantized compactified Ruijsenaars-Schneider system is presented. The spectra are obtained by combining Kahler quantization with the identification of the classical action-variables as a standard toric moment map on the complex projective space. The result is consistent with the Schrodinger quantization of the system worked out previously by van Diejen and Vinet.
