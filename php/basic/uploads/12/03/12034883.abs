Abstract: In the presence of uniform D-instanton charges, quarks can be confined although gluons are not, because baryon vertices are allowed due to the net repulsive force on the on the probe D-branes. Since there is no scale in the geometry itself apart from the horizon size, there is no Hawking-Page transition. As a consequence, the D7 brane embedding can encode the effect of the the finite temperature as well as finite baryon density even for low temperature. The probe D-brane embedding, however, undergoes a chiral phase transition according to the temperature and density parameter. We studied such phase transitions and calculated the constituent quark mass, chiral condensation and the binding energy of baryons as function of the density. The baryon vertex melting is identified as the quark deconfinement. We draw phase diagram according to these transitions.
