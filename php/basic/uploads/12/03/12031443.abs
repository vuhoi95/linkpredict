Authors: Niklas Beisert and Song He and Burkhard U. W. Schwab and Cristian Vergu
Abstract: We compute the one-loop expectation value of light-like polygonal Wilson loops in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory in full superspace. When projecting to chiral superspace we recover the known results for tree-level next-to-maximally-helicity-violating (NMHV) scattering amplitude. The one-loop MHV amplitude is also included in our result but there are additional terms which do not immediately correspond to scattering amplitudes. We finally discuss different regularizations and their Yangian anomalies.
