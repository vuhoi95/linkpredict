Title: Reheating in nonminimal derivative coupling model
Authors: H. Mohseni Sadjadi and Parviz Goodarzi
Abstract: We consider a model with nonminimal derivative coupling of inflaton to gravity. The reheating process during rapid oscillation of the inflaton is studied and the reheating temperature is obtained. Behaviors of the inflaton and produced radiation in this era are discussed.
