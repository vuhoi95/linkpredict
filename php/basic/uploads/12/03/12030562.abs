Title: New Relations for Three-Dimensional Supersymmetric Scattering Amplitudes
Authors: Till Bargheer and Song He and Tristan McLoughlin
Abstract: We provide evidence for a duality between color and kinematics in three-dimensional supersymmetric Chern-Simons matter theories. We show that the six-point amplitude in the maximally supersymmetric, N=8, theory can be arranged so that the kinematic factors satisfy the fundamental identity of three-algebras. We further show that the four- and six-point N=8 amplitudes can be "squared" into the amplitudes of N=16 three-dimensional supergravity, thus providing evidence for a hidden three-algebra structure in the dynamics of the supergravity.
