Title: Spin induced multipole moments for the gravitational wave amplitude from  binary inspirals to 2.5 Post-Newtonian order
Authors: Rafael A. Porto and Andreas Ross and Ira Z. Rothstein
Abstract: Using the NRGR effective field theory formalism we calculate the remaining source multipole moments necessary to obtain the spin contributions to the gravitational wave amplitude to 2.5 Post-Newtonian (PN) order. We also reproduce the tail contribution to the waveform linear in spin at 2.5PN arising from the nonlinear interaction between the current quadrupole and the mass monopole.
