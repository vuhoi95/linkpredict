Title: On Loops in Inflation III: Time Independence of zeta in Single Clock  Inflation
Authors: Guilherme L. Pimentel and Leonardo Senatore and Matias Zaldarriaga
Abstract: Studying loop corrections to inflationary perturbations, with particular emphasis on infrared factors, is important to understand the consistency of the inflationary theory, its predictivity and to establish the existence of the slow-roll eternal inflation phenomena and its recently found volume bound. In this paper we prove that the zeta correlation function is time-independent at one-loop level in single clock inflation. While many of the one-loop diagrams lead to a time-dependence when considered individually, the time-dependence beautifully cancels out in the overall sum. We identify two subsets of diagrams that cancel separately due to different physical reasons. The first cancellation is related to the change of the background cosmology due to the renormalization of the stress tensor. It results in a cancellation between the non-1PI diagrams and some of the diagrams made with quartic vertices. The second subset of diagrams that cancel is made up of cubic operators, plus the remaining quartic ones. We are able to write the sum of these diagrams as the integral over a specific three-point function between two very short wavelengths and one very long one. We then apply the consistency condition for this three-point function in the squeezed limit to show that the sum of these diagrams cannot give rise to a time dependence. This second cancellation is thus a consequence of the fact that in single clock inflation the attractor nature of the solution implies that a long wavelength zeta perturbation is indistinguishable from a trivial rescaling of the background, and so results in no physical effect on short wavelength modes.
