Title: Another Mass Gap in the BTZ Geometry?
Authors: Sean Stotyn and Robert B. Mann
Abstract: We attempt the construction of perturbative rotating hairy black holes and boson stars, invariant under a single helical Killing field, in 2+1-dimensions to complete the perturbative analysis in arbitrary odd dimension recently put forth in \cite{Stotyn:2011ns}. Unlike the higher dimensional cases, we find evidence for the non-existence of hairy black holes in 2+1-dimensions in the perturbative regime, which is interpreted as another mass gap, within which the black holes cannot have hair. The boson star solutions face a similar impediment in the background of a conical singularity with a sufficiently high angular deficit, most notably in the zero-mass BTZ background where boson stars cannot exist at all. We construct such boson stars in the AdS_3 background as well as in the background of conical singularities of periodicities \pi,2\pi/3,\pi/2.
