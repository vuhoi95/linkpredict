Title: Soft Gravitons Screen Couplings in de Sitter Space
Authors: Hiroyuki Kitamoto and Yoshihisa Kitazawa
Abstract: The scale invariance of the quantum fluctuations in de Sitter space leads to the appearance of de Sitter symmetry breaking infra-red logarithms in the graviton propagator. We investigate physical effects of soft gravitons on the local dynamics of matter fields well inside the cosmological horizon. We show that the IR logarithms do not spoil Lorentz invariance in scalar and Dirac field theory. The leading IR logarithms can be absorbed by a time dependent wave function renormalization factor in the both cases. In the interacting field theory with $\lambda \phi^4$ and Yukawa interaction, we find that the couplings become time dependent with definite scaling exponents. We argue that the relative scaling exponents of the couplings are gauge invariant and physical as we can use the evolution of a coupling as a physical time.
