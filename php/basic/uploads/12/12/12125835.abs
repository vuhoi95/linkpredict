Title: Acausality of Massive Gravity
Authors: S. Deser and A. Waldron
Abstract: We show, by analyzing its characteristics, that the ghost-free, 5 degree of freedom, Wess--Zumino massive gravity model admits superluminal shock wave solutions and thus is acausal. Ironically, this pathology arises from the very constraint that removes the (sixth) Boulware-Deser ghost mode.
