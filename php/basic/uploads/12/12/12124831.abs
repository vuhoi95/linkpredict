Abstract: We work out the exact in string coupling and perturbatively exact in \alpha' result for the vector multiplet moduli K\"ahler potential in a specific N=2 compactification of F-theory. The well-known correction cubic in \alpha' is absent, but there is a rich structure of corrections at all even orders in \alpha'. Moreover, each of these orders independently displays an SL(2,Z) invariant set of corrections in the string coupling. This generalizes earlier findings to the case of a non-trivial elliptic fibration. Our results pave the way for the analysis of quantum corrections in the more complicated N=1 context, and may have interesting implications for the study of moduli stabilization in string theory.
