Title: Relative quantum field theory
Authors: Daniel S. Freed and Constantin Teleman
Abstract: We highlight the general notion of a relative quantum field theory, which occurs in several contexts. One is in gauge theory based on a compact Lie algebra, rather than a compact Lie group. This is relevant to the maximal superconformal theory in six dimensions.
