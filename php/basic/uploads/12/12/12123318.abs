Abstract: The off-shell representation theory of 4D, $\mathcal{N}=1$ supermultiplets can be categorized in terms of distinct irreducible graphical representations called adinkras as part of a larger effort we call supersymmetry `genomics.' Recent evidence has emerged pointing to the existence of three such fundamental adinkras associated with distinct equivalence classes of a Coxeter group. A partial description of these adinkras is given in terms of two types, termed cis-and trans-adinkras (the latter being a degenerate doublet) in analogy to cis/trans isomers in chemistry. Through a new and simple procedure that uses adinkras, we find the irreducible off-shell adinkra representations of 4D, $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity, in the old-minimal, non-minimal, and conformal formulations. This procedure uncovers what appears to be a selection rule useful to reverse engineer adinkras to higher dimensions. We categorize the supergravity representations in terms of the number of cis-($n_c$) and trans-($n_t$) adinkras in the representation and synthesize our new results with our previous supersymmetry genomics results into a group theoretic framework.
