Title: Unfolding Physics from the Algebraic Classification of Spinor Fields
Authors: J. M. Hoff da Silva and Rold√£o da Rocha
Abstract: After reviewing the Lounesto spinor field classification, according to the bilinear covariants associated to a spinor field, we call attention and unravel some prominent features involving unexpected properties about spinor fields under such classification. In particular, we pithily focus on the new aspects --- as well as current concrete possibilities. They mainly arise when we deal with some non-standard spinor fields concerning, in particular, their applications in physics.
