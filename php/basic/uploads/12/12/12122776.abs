Title: Counterterms in Gravity in the Light-Front Formulation and a D=2  Conformal-like Symmetry in Gravity
Authors: Anders K. H. Bengtsson and Lars Brink and Sung-Soo Kim
Abstract: In this paper we discuss gravity in the light-front formulation (light-cone gauge) and show how possible counterterms arise. We find that Poincare invariance is not enough to find the three-point counterterms uniquely. Higher-spin fields can intrude and mimic three-point higher derivative gravity terms. To select the correct term we have to use the remaining reparametrization invariance that exists after the gauge choice. We finally sketch how the corresponding programme for N=8 Supergravity should work.
