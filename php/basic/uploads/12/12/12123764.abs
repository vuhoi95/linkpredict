Title: Vacuum spherically symmetric solutions in $f(T)$ gravity
Authors: K. Atazadeh and Misha Mousavi
Abstract: Spherically symmetric static vacuum solutions have been built in $f(T)$ models of gravity theory. We apply some conditions on the metric components; then the new vacuum spherically symmetric solutions are obtained. Also, by extracting metric coefficients we determine the analytical form of $f(T)$.
