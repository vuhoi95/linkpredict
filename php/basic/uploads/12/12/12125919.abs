Title: Higher-derivative massive actions from dimensional reduction
Authors: Euihun Joung and Karapet Mkrtchyan
Abstract: A procedure to obtain higher-derivative free massive actions is proposed. It consists in dimensional reduction of conventional two-derivative massless actions, where solutions to constraints bring in higher derivatives. We apply this procedure to derive the arbitrary dimensional generalizations of (linearized) New Massive Gravity and New Topologically Massive Gravity.
