Title: The renormalization of fluctuating branes, the Galileon and asymptotic  safety
Authors: A. Codello and N. Tetradis and O. Zanusso
Abstract: We consider the renormalization of d-dimensional hypersurfaces (branes) embedded in flat (d+1)-dimensional space. We parametrize the truncated effective action in terms of geometric invariants built from the extrinsic and intrinsic curvatures. We study the renormalization-group running of the couplings and explore the fixed-point structure. We find evidence for an ultraviolet fixed point similar to the one underlying the asymptotic-safety scenario of gravity. We also examine whether the structure of the Galileon theory, which can be reproduced in the nonrelativistic limit, is preserved at the quantum level.
