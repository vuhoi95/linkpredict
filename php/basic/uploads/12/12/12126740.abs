Title: de Sitter Entropy from a lower dimensional black hole
Authors: Cesar Arias and Rodrigo Aros and Nelson Zamorano
Abstract: An alternative method to compute the entropy of de Sitter spacetime for dimensions higher than or equal to five is presented. It is shown that de Sitter entropy may be obtained from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a lower-dimensional black hole. This result follows from the existence of a one-to-one correspondence between de Sitter and a spacetime containing a black hole localized on a p-brane. Under this correspondence and due to the holographic principle, the entropy of a five-dimensional de Sitter space may be obtained from that of a BTZ black hole localized on a 2-brane. For dimensions higher than five, de Sitter entropy is identified with the entropy of a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole localized on a (d-3)-brane.
