Title: On chromoelectric (super)conductivity of the Yang-Mills vacuum
Authors: M. N. Chernodub and Jos Van Doorsselaere and Tigran Kalaydzhyan and Henri Verschelde
Abstract: We argue that in the Copenhagen (``spaghetti'') picture of the QCD vacuum the chromomagnetic flux tubes exhibit chromoelectric superconductivity. We show that the superconducting chromoelectric currents in the tubes may be induced by the topological charge density.
