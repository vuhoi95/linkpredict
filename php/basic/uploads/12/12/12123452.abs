Title: Fermions via spinor-valued one-forms
Authors: Alexander Torres-Gomez and Kirill Krasnov
Abstract: Spinor-valued one-forms (Rarita-Schwinger fields) are normally used in the context of supergravity, where they describe spin 3/2 particles (gravitinos). Indeed, when decomposed into irreducible representations of the Lorentz group such a field contains both a spin 1/2 and a spin 3/2 component, and the Rarita-Schwinger Lagrangian is designed to make only the spin 3/2 propagate. We point out that the opposite construction is also possible, and give a spinor-valued one-form field Lagrangian that describes a propagating spin 1/2 particle.
