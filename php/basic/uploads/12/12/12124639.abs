Title: Duality and Couplings of 3-Form-Multiplets in N=1 Supersymmetry
Authors: Kai Groh and Jan Louis and Jason Sommerfeld
Abstract: In this paper we study 3-form gauge fields in four-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric theories. We give the sigma model action together with its Poincare dual action for massless and massive 3-forms. The resulting target space geometries are Kahler where the respective field variables and superspace couplings are related by a Legendre transformation.
