Title: Modelling black holes with angular momentum in loop quantum gravity
Authors: Ernesto Frodden and Alejandro Perez and Daniele Pranzetti and Christian Roeken
Abstract: We construct a SU(2) connection formulation of Kerr isolated horizons. As in the non-rotating case, the model is based on a SU(2) Chern-Simons theory describing the degrees of freedom on the horizon. The presence of a non-vanishing angular momentum modifies the admissibility conditions for spin network states. Physical states of the system are in correspondence with open intertwiners with total spin matching the angular momentum of the spacetime.
