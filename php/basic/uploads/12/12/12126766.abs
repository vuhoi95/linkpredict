Title: Geometric algebra techniques in flux compactifications
Authors: Calin-Iuliu Lazaroiu and Elena-Mirela Babalic and Ioana-Alexandra Coman
Abstract: We study `constrained generalized Killing (s)pinors', which characterize supersymmetric flux compactifications of supergravity theories. Using geometric algebra techniques, we give conceptually clear and computationally effective methods for translating supersymmetry conditions into differential and algebraic constraints on collections of differential forms. In particular, we give a synthetic description of Fierz identities, which are an important ingredient of such problems. As an application, we show how our approach can be used to efficiently recover results pertaining to N=1 compactifications of M-theory on eight-manifolds.
