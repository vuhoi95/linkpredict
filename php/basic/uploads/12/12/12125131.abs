Title: Noncommutative field theories on $R^3_Î»$: Towards UV/IR mixing  freedom
Authors: Patrizia Vitale and Jean-Christophe Wallet
Abstract: We consider the noncommutative space $\mathbb{R}^3_\lambda$, a deformation of the algebra of functions on $\mathbb{R}^3$ which yields a "foliation" of $\mathbb{R}^3$ into fuzzy spheres. We first construct a natural matrix base adapted to $\mathbb{R}^3_\lambda$. We then apply this general framework to the one-loop study of a two-parameter family of real-valued scalar noncommutative field theories with quartic polynomial interaction, which becomes a non-local matrix model when expressed in the above matrix base. The kinetic operator involves a part related to dynamics on the fuzzy sphere supplemented by a term reproducing radial dynamics. We then compute the planar and non-planar 1-loop contributions to the 2-point correlation function. We find that these diagrams are both finite in the matrix base. We find no singularity of IR type, which signals very likely the absence of UV/IR mixing. We also consider the case of a kinetic operator with only the radial part. We find that the resulting theory is finite to all orders in perturbation expansion.
