Title: Holographic quantum critical points in Lifshitz space-time
Authors: M. Reza Mohammadi Mozaffar and Ali Mollabashi
Abstract: We study a minimally coupled charged scalar field in a charged Lifshitz background. For z=2, we find an analytic expression for the corresponding low energy retarded Green's function. Unlike the RN-AdS case, the position of the superfluid surfaces depends on the charge of the scalar field only through the IR scaling dimension. We show that by increasing the dynamical exponent, the dual theory becomes more stable. We also show that the background could suffer from an instability of the IR geometry leading to a bifurcating critical point. It also allows the existence of scalar hair, causing hybridized critical point. We have investigated stable an unstable regions in the parameter space.
