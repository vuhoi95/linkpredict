Title: Fusion of Superalgebras and D=3, N=4 Quiver Gauge Theories
Authors: Fa-Min Chen and Yong-Shi Wu
Abstract: For further investigating the underlying structures of the D=3, N=4 Chern-Simons-matter (CSM) theories, we suggest a new concept and procedure for "fusing" two superalgebras into a single new superalgebra. The starting superalgebras may be those used in the previous construction of the double-symplectic 3-algebras in the N=4 CSM theories: The bosonic parts of these two superalgebras share at least one simple factor or U(1) factor. We are able to provide two different methods to do the "fusion". Several explicit examples are presented to demonstrate the "fusion" procedure. We also generalize the "fusion" procedure so that more than two superaglebras can be fused into a single one, provided some conditions are satisfied. It is shown that two or more N=4 theories with different gauge groups may be associated with the same "fused" superalgebra.
