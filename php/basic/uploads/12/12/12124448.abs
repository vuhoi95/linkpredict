Title: Coupled scalar fields Oscillons and Breathers in some Lorentz Violating  Scenarios
Authors: A. de Souza Dutra and R. A. C. Correa
Abstract: In this work we discuss the impact of the breaking of the Lorentz symmetry on the usual oscillons, the so-called flat-top oscillons, and the breathers. Our analysis is performed by using a Lorentz violation scenario rigorously derived in the literature. We show that the Lorentz violation is responsible for the origin of a kind of deformation of the configuration, where the field configuration becomes oscillatory in a localized region near its maximum value. Furthermore, we show that the Lorentz breaking symmetry produces a displacement of the oscillon along the spatial direction, the same feature is present in the case of breathers. We also show that the effect of a Lorentz violation in the flat-top oscillon solution is responsible by the shrinking of the flat-top. Furthermore, we find analytically the outgoing radiation, this result indicates that the amplitude of the outgoing radiation is controlled by the Lorentz breaking parameter, in such away that this oscillon becomes more unstable than its symmetric counterpart, however, it still has a long living nature.
