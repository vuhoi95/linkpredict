Title: The Superconformal Index of Class S Theories of Type D
Authors: Madalena Lemos and Wolfger Peelaers and Leonardo Rastelli
Abstract: We consider the superconformal index of class S theories of type D, which arise by compactification of the (2,0) D_n theories on a punctured Riemann surface C. We also allow for the presence of twist lines on C associated to the Z_2 outer automorphism of D_n. For a two-parameter slice (p=0, q, t) in the space of superconformal fugacities, we determine the 2d TQFT that computes the index.
