Title: CPT-conserved effective mass Hamiltonians through first and higher order  charge operator C in a supersymmetric framework
Authors: B. Bagchi and A. Banerjee and A. Ganguly
Abstract: This paper examines the features of a generalized position-dependent mass Hamiltonian in a supersymmetric framework in which the constraints of pseudo-Hermiticity and CPT are naturally embedded. Different representations of the charge operator are considered that lead to new mass-deformed superpotentials which are inherently PT-symmetric. The qualitative spectral behavior of the Hamiltonian is studied and several interesting consequences are noted.
