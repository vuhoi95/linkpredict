Title: Strongly Coupled Gauge Theories: High and Low Temperature Behavior of  Non-local Observables
Authors: Willy Fischler and Sandipan Kundu
Abstract: We explore the high and low temperature behavior of non-local observables in strongly coupled gauge theories that are dual to AdS. We develop a systematic expansion for equal time two-point correlation, spatial Wilson loops and entanglement entropy at finite temperature using the AdS/CFT correspondence, leading to analytic expressions for these observables at high and low temperature limits. This approach enables the identification of the contributions of different regions of the bulk geometry to these gauge theory observables.
