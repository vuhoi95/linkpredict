Title: Deconstructing (2,0) Proposals
Authors: N. Lambert and C. Papageorgakis and M. Schmidt-Sommerfeld
Abstract: We examine the relationships between three proposals for the six-dimensional (2,0) theory: the DLCQ of hep-th/9707079, hep-th/9712117, the deconstruction prescription of hep-th/0110146, and the five-dimensional maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills proposal of 1012.2880, 1012.2882. We show that hep-th/0110146 gives a deconstruction of five-dimensional maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills. The proposal of hep-th/9707079, hep-th/9712117 uses a subset of the degrees of freedom of five-dimensional Yang-Mills and we show that compactification of it on a circle of finite radius agrees with the DLCQ arising from the proposal of 1012.2880, 1012.2882 or from the deconstruction proposal of hep-th/0110146.
