Title: Superembedding Formalism and Supertwistors
Authors: Zuhair U. Khandker and Daliang Li
Abstract: We establish a correspondence between superembedding and supertwistor methods for constructing 4D N = 1 SCFT correlation functions by deriving a simple relation between tensors used in the two methods. Our discussion applies equally to 4D CFTs by simply reducing all formulas to the N = 0 case.
