Title: Emergent Higgs from hidden dimensions
Authors: Ryuichiro Kitano and Yuichiro Nakai
Abstract: The Higgs mechanism well describes the electroweak symmetry breaking in nature. We consider a possibility that the microscopic origin of the Higgs field is UV physics of QCD. We construct a UV complete model of a higher dimensional Yang-Mills theory as a deformation of a deconstructed (2,0) theory in six dimensions, and couple the top and bottom (s)quarks to it. We see that the Higgs fields appear as magnetic degrees of freedom. The model can naturally explain the masses of the Higgs boson and the top quark. The rho meson-like resonances with masses such as 1 TeV are predicted.
