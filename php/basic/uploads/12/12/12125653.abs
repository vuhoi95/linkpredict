Title: Finite BRST Transformations for the Bagger-Lambert-Gustavasson Theory
Authors: Mir Faizal and Bhabani P Mandal and Sudhaker Upadhyay
Abstract: In this paper we analyse the Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson (BLG) theory in $\mathcal{N} =1$ superspace. Furthermore, we will construct the BRST transformations for this theory. These BRST transformations will be integrated out to obtain the finite field dependent version of BRST (FFBRST) transformations. We will also analyse the effect of the FFBRST transformations on the effective action. We will thus show that the FFBRST transformations can be used to relate generating functionals of the BLG theory in two different gauges.
