Title: Symmetry breaking in nonuniform noncommutative $λφ^4$ theory at  finite temperature
Authors: J. M. Hernández and C. Ramírez and M. Sánchez
Abstract: We consider the 2PI Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis effective action at finite temperature for a noncommutative real scalar field theory in 4 dimensions, with noncommutativity among space and time variables. By means of a Rayleig-Ritz variation, we study the solutions of a stripe type nonuniform background, which depends on space and time, and hence on temperature. The analysis in the first approximation shows that such solutions appear in the planar limit, as already known, but also under normal noncommutativity, in an anisotropic region which has not been considered. Further we show that the transition from the uniform ordered phase to the non uniform one is first order.
