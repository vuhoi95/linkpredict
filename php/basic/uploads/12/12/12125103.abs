Title: Color-Kinematics Duality and the Regge Limit of Inelastic Amplitudes
Authors: Agustin Sabio Vera and Eduardo Serna Campillo and Miguel A. Vazquez-Mozo
Abstract: We investigate tree-level five-point amplitudes in scalar-QCD expressed in terms of Sudakov variables and find the equivalent "gravitational" counterparts using the color-kinematics duality proposed by Bern, Carrasco, and Johannson. Taking the multi-Regge limit in the gravitational amplitudes, we show that those pieces in the coupling of two reggeized gravitons to one on-shell graviton directly stemming from the double copy of the vertex for two reggeized gluons to one on-shell gluon are universal and properly reproduced by the duality.
