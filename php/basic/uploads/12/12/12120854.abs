Title: The heterotic MiniLandscape and the 126 GeV Higgs boson
Authors: Marcin Badziak and Sven Krippendorf and Hans Peter Nilles and Martin Wolfgang Winkler
Abstract: The MSSM candidates arising from the heterotic MiniLandscape feature a very constrained supersymmetry breaking pattern. This includes a fully predictable gaugino mass pattern, which is compressed compared to the CMSSM, and an inverted sfermion hierarchy due to distinct geometric localisation, featuring stops as light as 1 TeV. The observed Higgs mass sets a lower bound m_{gluino} > 1.2 TeV on the gluino mass. The electroweak fine-tuning is reduced by a UV relation between the scalar mass of the two heavy families and the gluino mass. While large parts of the favoured parameter space escape detection at the LHC, the prospects to test the MiniLandscape models with future dark matter searches are very promising.
