Title: On the gravity dual of strongly coupled charged plasma
Authors: Grzegorz Plewa and Michal Spalinski
Abstract: Locally asymptotically AdS solutions of Einstein equations coupled with a vector field with a weakly curved boundary metric are found within the fluid-gravity gradient expansion up to second order in gradients. This geometry is dual to 1+3 dimensional hydrodynamics with a conserved current in a weakly curved background. The causal structure of the bulk geometry is determined and it is shown that the black brane singularity is shielded by an event horizon.
