Title: Horava-Lifshitz gravity with detailed balance
Authors: Daniele Vernieri and Thomas P. Sotiriou
Abstract: Horava-Lifshitz gravity with "detailed balance" but without the projectability assumption is discussed. It is shown that detailed balance is quite efficient in limiting the proliferation of couplings in Horava-Lifshitz gravity, and that its implementation without the projectability assumption leads to a theory with sensible dynamics. However, the (bare) cosmological constant is restricted to be large and negative.
