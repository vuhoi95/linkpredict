Title: Cosmological Perturbation in f(T) Gravity Revisited
Authors: Keisuke Izumi and Yen Chin Ong
Abstract: We perform detailed investigation of cosmological perturbations in f(T) theory of gravity coupled with scalar field. Our work emphasizes on the way to gauge fix the theory and we examine all possible modes of perturbations up to second order. The analysis includes pseudoscalar and pseudovector modes in addition to the usual scalar, vector, and tensor modes. We find no gravitational propagating degree of freedom in the scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, as well as pseudovector modes. In addition, we find that the scalar and tensor perturbations have exactly the same form as their counterparts in usual general relativity with scalar field, except that the factor of reduced Planck mass squared $M_{\text{pl}}^2 \equiv 1/(8\pi G)$ that occurs in the latter has now been replaced by an effective time-dependentgravitational coupling $-2 (df/dT)|_{T=T_0}$, with $T_0$ being the background torsion scalar. The absence of extra degrees of freedom of f(T) gravity at second order linear perturbation indicates that f(T) gravity is highly nonlinear. Consequently one cannot conclusively analyze stability of the theory without performing nonlinear analysis that can reveal the propagation of the extra degrees of freedom.
