Title: Holography as Cutoff: a proposal for measure of inflationary universes
Authors: FÃ¡bio Novaes and Bruno Carneiro da Cunha
Abstract: We propose the holographic principle as a dynamical cutoff for any quantum theory of gravity with a geometric description at low energies, incorporating ideas of effective field theory. We illustrate the proposal by revisiting the problem of defining a measure for homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes coupled to a scalar field and conclude by discussing the implications to the inflationary model.
