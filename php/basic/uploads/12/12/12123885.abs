Title: Mass of the Electroweak Monopole
Authors: Y. M. Cho and Kyoungtae Kimm and J. H. Yoon
Abstract: We present finite energy analytic monopole and dyon solutions whose size is fixed by the electroweak scale. Our result shows that genuine electroweak monopole whose mass is around 6.7 TeV could exist, which could be detected at LHC.
