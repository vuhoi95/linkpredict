Title: Scalar Field Cosmology -- Improving the Cosmological Evolutional  Scenario
Authors: Orest Hrycyna and Marek Szydlowski
Abstract: We study evolution of cosmological models filled with the scalar field and barotropic matter. We consider the scalar field minimally and non-minimally coupled to gravity. We demonstrated the growth of degree of complexity of evolutional scenario through the description of matter content in terms of the scalar field. In study of all evolutional paths for all initial conditions methods of dynamical systems are used. Using linearized solutions we present simple method of derivation corresponding form of the Hubble function of the scale factor $H(a)$.
