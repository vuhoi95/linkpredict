Title: Large N anomalous dimensions for large operators in Leigh-Strassler  deformed SYM
Authors: Robert de Mello Koch and Jeff Murugan and Nkululeko Nokwara
Abstract: We study the large N anomalous dimensions of operators in a Leigh-Strassler deformation of N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. The operators that we study have a bare dimension of order N (so that the large N limit is not captured by planar diagrams) and are AdS/CFT dual to giant gravitons. The diagonalization of the dilatation operator factorizes into two problems. One of these problems is solved using a double coset ansatz. The second problem is equivalent to a set of decoupled harmonic oscillators.
