Title: Discrete R Symmetries and Anomalies
Authors: Michael Dine and Angelo Monteux
Abstract: We comment on aspects of discrete anomaly conditions focussing particularly on $R$ symmetries. We review the Green-Schwarz cancellation of discrete anomalies, providing a heuristic explanation why, in the heterotic string, only the "model-independent dilaton" transforms non-linearly under discrete symmetries; this argument suggests that, in other theories, multiple fields might play a role in anomaly cancellations, further weakening any anomaly constraints at low energies. We provide examples in open string theories of non-universal discrete anomalies at low energies. We then consider the fact that $R$ symmetries are necessarily broken at low energies. We exhibit dynamical models, in which fields charged under the Standard Model gauge group (for example, a doublet and a triplet) gain roughly equal masses, but where the doublet and the triplet possess different discrete charges and the low-energy anomaly conditions fail.
