Title: Asymptotic Safety and Black Hole Thermodynamics
Authors: D. Becker and M. Reuter
Abstract: We present recent results on the non-perturbative renormalization group flow of Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) on spacetime manifolds with boundaries. As an application, novel quantum gravity corrections to the thermodynamics of black holes are discussed.
