Title: Discovering Minimal Universal Extra Dimensions (MUED) at the LHC
Authors: Alexander Belyaev and Matthew Brown and Jesús Moreno and Chloé Papineau
Abstract: In this work we discuss our consistent implementation of the minimal model of Universal Extra Dimensions in CalcHEP. We pay special attention to the gauge invariance issues that arise due to the incorporation of 5D quantum corrections. After validating the implementation we perform a complete study of the tri-lepton signature, including a realistic estimate of the backgrounds, for the present LHC energy and luminosity. We also derive the expected LHC discovery reach for different luminosities, at centre-of-mass energies of both 7 TeV and 8 TeV.
