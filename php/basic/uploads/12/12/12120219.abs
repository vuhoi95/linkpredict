Abstract: We provide a status report on the advances in blocking-inspired supersymmetric actions. This is done at the example of interacting supersymmetric quantum mechanics as well as the Wess-Zumino model. We investigate in particular the implications of a nontrivial realisation of translational symmetry on the lattice in this approach. We also discuss the locality of symmetry generators.
