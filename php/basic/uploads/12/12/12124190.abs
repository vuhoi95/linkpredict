Title: Conformally Lifshitz solutions from Horava-Lifshitz Gravity
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha and Hossein Yavartanoo
Abstract: We show that the IR action of the healthy non-projectable Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity and its small modification exhibit asymptotically Lifshitz and hyperscaling violating solutions, respectively. The model may also have an AdS$_2\times R^d$ vacuum solution. By making use of our results, one may wonder that within the context of HL gravity the Lifshitz fixed point might be treated as a CFT deformed by the time component of a vector operator.
