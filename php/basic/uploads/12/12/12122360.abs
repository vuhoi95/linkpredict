Title: Generalized Semi-Holographic Universe
Authors: Hui Li and Hongsheng Zhang and Yi Zhang
Abstract: We study the semi-holographic idea in context of decaying dark components. The energy flow between dark energy and the compensating dark matter is thermodynamically generalized to involve a particle number variable dark component with non-zero chemical potential. It's found that, unlike the original semi-holographic model, no cosmological constant is needed for a dynamical evolution of the universe. A transient phantom phase appears while a non-trivial dark energy-dark matter scaling solution keeps at late time, which evades the big-rip and helps to resolve the coincidence problem. For reasonable parameters, the deceleration parameter is well consistent with current observations. The original semi-holographic model is extended and it also suggests that the concordance model may be reconstructed from the semi-holographic idea.
