Title: Study of Gauge Symmetry of Some Field Theoretical Models Through the  Lagrangian Formulation
Authors: Safia Yasmin and Anisur Rahaman
Abstract: Study of gauge symmetry is carried over the different interacting and noninteracting field theoretical models through a prescription based on lagrangian formulation. It is found that the prescription is capable of testing whether a given model posses a gauge symmetry or not. It can successfully formulate the gauge transformation generator in all the cases whatever subtleties are involved in it. It is found that the prescription has the ability to show a direction how to extend the phase space using auxiliary fields to restore the gauge invariance of a theory. Like the usual phase space the prescription is found to be equally powerful in the extended phase space of a theory.
