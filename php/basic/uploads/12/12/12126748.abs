Title: Non-Abelian Gauge Groups and Hypermultiplets in Projective Superspaces
Authors: Masato Arai and Shin Sasaki
Abstract: We construct off-shell superconformal actions of hypermultiplets coupled with non-Abelian gauge multiplets in three-dimensional N = 3 and N = 4 projective superspaces. We establish the explicit embeddings of the N = 2 vector and adjoint chiral superfields, that constitute the N = 4 gauge multiplets, into the tropical multiplets. We also construct the action in the four-dimensional N = 2 projective superspace.
