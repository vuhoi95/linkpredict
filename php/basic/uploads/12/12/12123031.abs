Title: Nonextremal Kerr/CFT on a stretched horizon
Authors: Ee Chang-Young and Myungseok Eune
Abstract: We study the conformal symmetry described by $SL(2,R)_L \times SL(2,R)_R$ in the nonextremal Kerr black hole case. We calculate the central charges $c_{L,R}$ separately on a stretched horizon by the Hamiltonian gravity. In order to get two sets of conformal symmetry, we consider two Killing vectors each of which depends on either one of the two independent coordinates separated in the spirit of point-splitting from the angular coordinate of the corotating frame at the horizon. Then, we obtain the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy by the Cardy formula.
