Title: On renormalization of Poisson-Lie T-plural sigma models
Authors: Ladislav Hlavaty and Josef Navratil and Libor Snobl
Abstract: Covariance of the one-loop renormalization group equations with respect to Poisson-Lie T-plurality of sigma models is discussed. The role of ambiguities in renormalization group equations of Poisson-Lie sigma models with truncated matrices of parameters is investigated.
