Title: Dynamics of the Bianchi I model with non-minimally coupled scalar field  near the singularity
Authors: Orest Hrycyna and Marek Szydlowski
Abstract: Dynamical systems methods are used to study the evolution of the Bianchi I model with a scalar field. We show that inclusion of the non-minimal coupling term between the scalar field and the curvature changes evolution of the model compared with the minimally coupled case. In the model with the non-minimally coupled scalar field there is a new type of singularity dominated by the non-minimal coupling term. We examine the impact of the non-minimal coupling on the anisotropy evolution and demonstrate the existence of its minimal value in the generic case.
