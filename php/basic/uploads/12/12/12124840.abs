Title: On Non-Abelian T-Duality and new N=1 backgrounds
Authors: Georgios Itsios and Carlos Nunez and Konstadinos Sfetsos and Daniel C. Thompson
Abstract: We study the action of non-Abelian T-duality in the context of N=1 geometries with well understood field theory duals. In the conformal case this gives rise to a new solution that contains an AdS_5 X S^2 piece. In the case of non-conformal geometries we obtain a new background in massive IIA supergravity that presents similar behaviour to the cascade of Seiberg dualities. Some physical observables are discussed.
