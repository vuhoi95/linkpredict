Title: Recurrence relations of Kummer functions and Regge string scattering  amplitudes
Authors: Jen-Chi Lee and Yoshihiro Mitsuka
Abstract: We discover an infinite number of recurrence relations among Regge string scattering amplitudes \cite{bosonic,RRsusy} of different string states at arbitrary mass levels in the open bosonic string theory. As a result, all Regge string scattering amplitudes can be algebraically solved up to multiplicative factors. Instead of decoupling zero-norm states in the fixed angle regime, the calculation is based on recurrence relations and addition theorem of Kummer functions of the second kind. These recurrence relations among Regge string scattering amplitudes are dual to linear relations or symmetries among high-energy fixed angle string scattering amplitudes discovered previously.
