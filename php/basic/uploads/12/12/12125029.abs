Abstract: We extend a previous analysis of flavor-changing fermion-graviton vertices, by adding the one-loop SM corrections to the flavor diagonal fermion-graviton interactions. Explicit analytical expressions taking into account fermion masses for the on-shell form factors are computed and presented. The infrared safety of the fermion-graviton vertices against radiative corrections of soft photons and gluons is proved, by extending the ordinary infrared cancellation mechanism between real and virtual emissions to the gravity case. These results can be easily generalized to fermion couplings with massive gravitons, graviscalar, and dilaton fields, with potential phenomenological implications to new physics scenarios with low gravity scale.
