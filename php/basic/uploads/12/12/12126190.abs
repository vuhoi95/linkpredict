Title: Lattice Radial Quantization: 3D Ising
Authors: Richard Brower and George Fleming and Herbert Neuberger
Abstract: Lattice radial quantization is introduced as a nonperturbative method intended to numerically solve Euclidean conformal field theories that can be realized as fixed points of known Lagrangians. As an example, we employ a lattice shaped as a cylinder with a 2D Icosahedral cross-section to discretize dilatations in the 3D Ising model. Using this method, we obtain the preliminary estimate eta=0.034(10).
