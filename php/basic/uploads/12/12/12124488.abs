Abstract: In this letter we obtain an exact solution for cylindrically symmetric modified Gauss Bonnet gravity. This metric is a generalization of the vacuum solution of the Levi-Civita in the general relativity. It describes an isotropic perfect fluid one parameter family of the gravitational configurations which can be interpreted as the exterior metric of a cosmic string. By setting the Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter to zero, we recover the vacuum solution in the Einstein gravity as well.
