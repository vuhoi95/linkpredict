Title: On a path integral representation of the Nekrasov instanton partition  function and its Nekrasov--Shatashvili limit
Authors: Franco Ferrari and Marcin PiÄ…tek
Abstract: In this work we study the Nekrasov--Shatashvili limit of the Nekrasov instanton partition function of Yang--Mills field theories with ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetry and gauge group SU(N). The theories are coupled with fundamental matter. A path integral expression of the full instanton partition function is derived. It is checked that in the Nekrasov--Shatashvili (thermodynamic) limit the action of the field theory obtained in this way reproduces exactly the equation of motion used in the saddle-point calculations.
