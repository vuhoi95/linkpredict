Title: Holographic thermalization of mutual and tripartite information in 2d  CFTs
Authors: Alice Bernamonti and Neil Copland and Ben Craps and Federico Galli
Abstract: We discuss the concepts of mutual and tripartite information by referring to simple intuitive examples, and describe their use as probes of thermalization in holographic models. We then review our computation of these quantities in a simple time dependent model, in which energy injection in a strongly coupled field theory is modeled by a shell of null dust falling into 3d anti-de Sitter space. We complete those results with a discussion of the possible equilibrium phases of the tripartite information.
