Title: Augmented Superfield Approach to Non-Yang-Mills Symmetries of Jackiw-Pi  Model: Novel Observations
Authors: Saurabh Gupta and R. Kumar
Abstract: We derive the off-shell nilpotent and absolutely anticommuting Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) as well as anti-BRST symmetry transformations corresponding to the non-Yang-Mills symmetry transformations of (2 + 1)- dimensional Jackiw-Pi (JP) model within the framework of "augmented" superfield formalism. The Curci-Ferrari restriction, which is a hallmark of non-Abelian 1-form gauge theories, does not appear in this case. One of the novel features of our present investigation is the derivation of proper (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations corresponding to the auxiliary field \rho that can not be derived by any conventional means.
