Title: Curci-Ferrari Type Condition in Hamiltonian Formalism: A Free Spinning  Relativistic Particle
Authors: A. Shukla and T. Bhanja and R. P. Malik
Abstract: The Curci-Ferrari (CF)-type of restriction emerges in the description of a free spinning relativistic particle within the framework of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism when the off-shell nilpotent and absolutely anticommuting (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations for this system are derived from the application of horizontality condition (HC) and its supersymmetric generalization (SUSY-HC) within the framework of superfield formalism. We show that the above CF-condition, which turns out to be the secondary constraint of our present theory, remains time-evolution invariant within the framework of Hamiltonian formalism. This time-evolution invariance (i) physically justifies the imposition of the (anti-)BRST invariant CF-type condition on this system, and (ii) mathematically implies the linear independence of BRST and anti-BRST symmetries of our present theory.
