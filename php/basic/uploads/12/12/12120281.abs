Title: Holographic Vortex Liquids and Superfluid Turbulence
Authors: Allan Adams and Paul M. Chesler and Hong Liu
Abstract: Superfluid turbulence, often referred to as quantum turbulence, is a fascinating phenomenon for which a satisfactory theoretical framework is lacking. Holographic duality provides a systematic new approach to studying quantum turbulence by mapping the dynamics of certain quantum theories onto the dynamics of classical gravity. We use this gravitational description to numerically construct turbulent flows in a holographic superfluid in two spatial dimensions. We find that the superfluid kinetic energy spectrum obeys the Kolmogorov -5/3 scaling law, as it does for turbulent flows in normal fluids. We trace this scaling to a direct energy cascade by injecting energy at long wavelengths and watching it flow to a short-distance scale set by the vortex core size, where dissipation by vortex annihilation and vortex drag becomes efficient. This is in sharp contrast with the inverse energy cascade of normal fluid turbulence in two dimensions. We also demonstrate that the microscopic dissipation spectrum has a simple geometric interpretation.
