Title: On hvLif-like solutions in gauged Supergravity
Authors: Pablo Bueno and W. Chemissany and C. S. Shahbazi
Abstract: We perform a thorough investigation of Lifshitz-like metrics with hyperscaling violation (hvLif) in four-dimensional theories of gravity coupled to an arbitrary number of scalars and vector fields, obtaining new solutions, electric, magnetic and dyonic, that include the known ones as particular cases. After establishing some general results on the properties of purely hvLif solutions, we apply the previous formalism to the case of \mathcal{N}=2, d=4 Supergravity in the presence of Fayet-Iliopoulos terms, obtaining particular solutions to the t^3-model, and explicitly embedding some of them in Type-IIB String Theory.
