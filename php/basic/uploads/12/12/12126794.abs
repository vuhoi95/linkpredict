Title: Static post-Newtonian limits in non-projectable Ho≈ôava-Lifshitz  gravity with an extra U(1) symmetry
Authors: Kai Lin and Anzhong Wang
Abstract: In this paper, we study static post-Newtonian limits in non-projectable Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity with an extra U(1) symmetry. After obtaining all static spherical solutions in the infrared, we apply them to the solar system tests, and obtain the Eddington-Robertson-Schiff parameters in terms of the coupling constants of the theory. These parameters are well consistent with observations for the physically viable coupling constants. In contrast to the projectable case, this consistence is achieved without taking the gauge field and Newtonian prepotential as part of the metric.
