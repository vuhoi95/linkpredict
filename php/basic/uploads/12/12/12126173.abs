Title: The supersymmetric Penrose transform in six dimensions
Authors: L. J. Mason and R. A. Reid-Edwards
Abstract: We give a supersymmetric extension to the six-dimensional Penrose transform and give an integral formula for the on-shell (0, 2) supermultiplet. The relationship between super fields on space-time and twistor space is clarified and the space-time superfield constraint equations are derived from the geometry of supertwistor space. We also explain the extension to more general (0,n) supermultiplets and give twistor actions for these theories.
