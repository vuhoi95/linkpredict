Title: Self-tuning Horava-Lifshitz's Universe
Authors: D. Bazeia and F. A. Brito and F. G. Costa
Abstract: In this paper we show that by considering a slightly modified Horava-Lifshitz gravity one can find self-tuning cosmological scenarios. Since in the proposed model the cosmological constant cancels out, then regardless of its value it cannot produce any gravitational effect. As a consequence this removes the gravitational effect of the vacuum energy on the expansion of the Universe. Accelerating scenarios, however, can be found through the presence of conventional and non-conventional fluids.
