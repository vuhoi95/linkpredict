Title: NLO corrections to the gluon induced forward jet vertex from the high  energy effective action
Authors: Grigorios Chachamis and Martin Hentschinski and Jose Daniel Madrigal and Agustin Sabio Vera
Abstract: We determine both real and virtual next-to-leading order corrections to the gluon induced forward jet vertex, from the high energy effective action proposed by Lipatov. For these calculations we employ the same regularization and subtraction formalism developed in our previous work on the quark-initiated vertex. We find agreement with previous results in the literature.
