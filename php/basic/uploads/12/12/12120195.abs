Title: Transmission amplitudes from Bethe ansatz equations
Authors: Anastasia Doikou and Nikos Karaiskos
Abstract: We consider the Heisenberg spin chain in the presence of integrable spin defects. Using the Bethe ansatz methodology, we extract the associated transmission amplitudes, that describe the interaction between the particle-like excitations displayed by the models and the spin impurity. In the attractive regime of the XXZ model, we also derive the breather's transmission amplitude. We compare our findings with earlier relevant results in the context of the sine-Gordon model.
