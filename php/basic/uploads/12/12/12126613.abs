Title: Higher-Derivative Wess-Zumino Model in Three Dimensions
Authors: E. A. Gallegos and C. R. Senise Jr. and A. J. da Silva
Abstract: We deform the well-known three dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ Wess-Zumino model by adding higher derivative operators (Lee-Wick operators) to its action. The effects of these operators are investigated both at the classical and quantum levels.
