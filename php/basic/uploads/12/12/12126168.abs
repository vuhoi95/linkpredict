Title: An algebraic approach to BCJ numerators
Authors: Chih-Hao Fu and Yi-Jian Du and Bo Feng
Abstract: One important discovery in recent years is that the total amplitude of gauge theory can be written as BCJ form where kinematic numerators satisfy Jacobi identity. Although the existence of such kinematic numerators is no doubt, the simple and explicit construction is still an important problem. As a small step, in this note we provide an algebraic approach to construct these kinematic numerators. Under our Feynman-diagram-like construction, the Jacobi identity is manifestly satisfied. The corresponding color ordered amplitudes satisfy off-shell KK-relation and off-shell BCJ relation similar to the color ordered scalar theory. Using our construction, the dual DDM form is also established.
