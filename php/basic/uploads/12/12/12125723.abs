Title: Passing the boundary between the parity breaking medium and vacuum by  vector particles
Authors: A. A. Andrianov and S. S. Kolevatov
Abstract: The electrodynamics supplemented with a Chern-Simons (CS) action (Carrol-Field-Jackiw electrodynamics) in a half space is studied. The passage of photons and/or massive vector mesons through a boundary between the CS medium and the vacuum of conventional Maxwell electrodynamics is investigated. Effects of reflection from a boundary (up to the total one) are revealed when vector particles escape to vacuum and income from vacuum passing the boundary. Both the space-like and time-like CS vectors are considered.
