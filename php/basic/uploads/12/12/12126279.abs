Title: New Massive Gravity on de Sitter Space and Black Holes at the Special  Point
Authors: Gregory Gabadadze and Gaston Giribet and Alberto Iglesias
Abstract: We study New Massive Gravity on de Sitter background and discuss several interrelated properties: The appearance of an enhanced symmetry point at linearized level where the theory becomes partially massless; its absence at full nonlinear level, and its relation with the existence of static black hole solutions and their hair parameter.
