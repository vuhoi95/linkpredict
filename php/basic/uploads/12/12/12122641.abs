Abstract: We present a simple toy model corresponding to a network of frustrated topological defects of domain walls or cosmic strings that exist previous to the standard slow-roll inflationary era of the universe. Such a network (i) can produce a slower inflationary era than that of the standard scenario if it corresponds to a network of frustrated domain walls or (ii) can induce a vanishing universal acceleration; i.e., the universe would expand at a constant speed, if it corresponds to a network of frustrated cosmic strings red. Those features are phenomenologically modeled by a Chaplygin gas that can interpolate between a network of frustrated topological defects and a de Sitter-like or a power-law inflationary era. We show that this scenario can alleviate the quadruple anomaly of the cosmic microwave background spectrum. Using the method of the Bogoliubov coefficients, we obtain the spectrum of the gravitational waves as would be measured today for the whole range of frequencies. We comment on the possible detection of this spectrum by the planned detectors like BBO and DECIGO.
