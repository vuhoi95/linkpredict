Title: On stability of power-law solution in multidimensional Gauss-Bonnet  cosmology
Authors: D. M. Chirkov and A. V. Toporensky
Abstract: We consider dynamics of a flat anisotropic multidimensional cosmological model in Gauss-Bonnet gravity in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic field. In particular, we find conditions under which the known power-law vacuum solution can be an attractor for the case with non-zero magnetic field. We also describe a particular class of numerical solution in $(5+1)$-dimensional case which does not approach the power-law regime.
