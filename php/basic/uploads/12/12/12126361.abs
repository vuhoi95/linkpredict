Abstract: In this work, we propose a CPT-even and Lorentz-violating dimension-five nonminimal coupling between fermionic and gauge fields, involving the CTP-even and Lorentz-violating gauge tensor of the SME. This nonminimal coupling modifies the Dirac equation, whose nonrelativistic regime is governed by a Hamiltonian which induces new effects, such as an electric-Zeeman-like spectrum splitting and an anomalous-like contribution to the electron magnetic moment, between others. Some of these new effects allows to constrain the magnitude of this nonminimal coupling in 1 part in 10^16.
