Title: New Transport Properties of Anisotropic Holographic Superfluids
Authors: Johanna Erdmenger and Daniel Fernandez and Hansj√∂rg Zeller
Abstract: We complete the analysis of transport phenomena in p-wave superfluids within gauge/gravity duality, using the SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills model with backreaction. In particular, we analyze the fluctuation modes of helicity zero in addition to the helicity one and two modes studied earlier. We compute a further transport coefficient, associated to the first normal stress difference, not previously considered in the holographic context. In the unbroken phase this is related to a minimally coupled scalar on the gravity side. Moreover we find transport phenomena related to the thermoelectric and piezoelectric effects, in particular in the direction of the condensate, as well as the flexoelectric effect. These are similar to phenomena observed in condensed matter systems.
