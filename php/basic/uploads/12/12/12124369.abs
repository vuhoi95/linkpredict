Title: Discrete Symmetries/Discrete Theories
Authors: Milton Bose and Michael Dine
Abstract: Dynamical, metastable supersymmetry breaking appears to be a generic phenomena in supersymmetric field theories. It's simplest implementation is within the so-called "retrofitted O'Raifeartaigh Models". While seemingly flexible, model building in these theories is significantly constrained. In gauge-mediated versions, if the approximate $R$ symmetry of the theory is spontaneously broken, the messenger scale is fixed; if explicitly broken by retrofitted couplings, a very small dimensionless number is required; if supergravity corrections are responsible for the symmetry breaking, at least two moderately small couplings are required, and there is a large range of possible messenger scales. In gravity mediated versions, achieving $m_{3/2} \approx M_Z$ is a problem of discrete tuning. With plausible assumptions, one can't achieve this to better than a factor of 100, perhaps accounting for a {\it little hierarchy} and the surprisingly large value of the Higgs mass.
