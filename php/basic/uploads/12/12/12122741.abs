Title: Lifshitz field theories with SDiff symmetries
Authors: C. Adam and C. Naya and J. Sanchez-Guillen and A. Wereszczynski
Abstract: We consider Lifshitz field theories with a dynamical critical exponent z equal to the dimension of space d and with a large group of base space symmetries, concretely space coordinate transformations with unit determinant ("Special Diffeomorphisms"). The field configurations of the theories considered may have the topology of skyrmions, vortices or monopoles, although we focus our detailed investigations on skyrmions. The resulting Lifshitz field theories have a BPS bound and exact soliton solutions saturating the bound, as well as time-dependent topological Q-ball solutions. Finally, we investigate the U(1) gauged versions of the Lifshitz field theories coupled to a Chern-Simons gauge field, where the BPS bound and soliton solutions saturating the bound continue to exist.
