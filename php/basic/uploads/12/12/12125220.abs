Abstract: Using a superfield generalization of the tadpole method, we study the one-loop effective potential for a Wess Zumino model modified by a higher-derivative term, inspired by the Lee-Wick model. The one-loop K\"{a}hlerian potential is also obtained by other methods and compared with the effective potential.
