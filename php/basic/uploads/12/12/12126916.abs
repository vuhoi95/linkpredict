Title: Partition functions, mapping class groups and Drinfeld doubles
Authors: Jens Fjelstad and Jurgen Fuchs and Christoph Schweigert and Carl Stigner
Abstract: Higher genus partition functions of two-dimensional conformal field theories have to be invariants under linear actions of mapping class groups. We illustrate recent results [4,6] on the construction of such invariants by concrete expressions obtained for the case of Drinfeld doubles of finite groups. The results for doubles are independent of the characteristic of the underlying field, and the general results do not require any assumptions of semisimplicity.
