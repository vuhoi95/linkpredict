Title: One-Loop Radiative Corrections to the QED Casimir Energy
Authors: Reza Moazzemi and Amirhosein Mojavezi
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate one-loop radiative corrections to the Casimir energy in the presence of two perfectly conducting parallel plates for QED theory within the renormalized perturbation theory. In fact, there are three contributions for radiative corrections to the Casimir energy, up to order $\alpha$. Only the two-loop diagram, which is of order $\alpha$, has been computed by Bordag et. al (1985), approximately. Here, up to this order, we consider corrections due to two one-loop terms, i.e., photonic and fermionic loop corrections resulting from renormalized QED Lagrangian, more precisely. Our results show that only the fermionic loop has a very minor correction and the correction of photonic loop vanishes.
