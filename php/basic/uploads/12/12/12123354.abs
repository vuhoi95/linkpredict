Title: Production of Prompt Photons and Dileptons in Rapid Holographic  Thermalization
Authors: Berndt Muller and Di-Lun Yang
Abstract: We study the lightlike and timelike R-current correlators in the AdS-Vaidya spacetime, which are associated with the production of prompt photons and dileptons from a nonequilibrium, rapidly thermalizing, and strongly coupled plasma in the AdS/CFT correspondence. In particular, we focus on the photon production. We find that the amplitude of the photon-emission spectrum increases during the thermalization of the medium. Also, the time-dependent emission rate for hard photons has an oscillatory pattern and thermalizes faster than soft photons.
