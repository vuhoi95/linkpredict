Title: The Lienard-Wiechert field of accelerated massless charges
Authors: Francesco Azzurli and Kurt Lechner
Abstract: We determine for the first time the electromagnetic field generated by a generic massless accelerated charge, solving exactly Maxwell's equations. This result may shed new light on the possible existence of such particles in nature.
