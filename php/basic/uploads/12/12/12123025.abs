Title: Supersymmetric Proca-Yang-Mills System
Authors: Ergin Sezgin and Linus Wulff
Abstract: We determine the off-shell N=1 supersymmetry transformation rules for a tensor-Yang-Mills system in which the tensor field transforms in a nontrivial representation of the Yang-Mills group, and there is an additional vector multiplet in the same representation. We then show that this system describes a massive tensor multiplet coupled to Yang-Mills in which the additional vector multiplet is eaten by the tensor field. Next, we construct an action which consists of four separately off-shell supersymmetric pieces and find that integrating out the auxiliary fields gives rise to an infinite number of higher order couplings of the scalar field belonging to the tensor multiplet. We describe the dualization of the massive tensor to a massive vector, thereby ending up with an on-shell supersymmetric nonabelian massive vector multiplet coupled to an off-shell Yang-Mills multiplet which we refer to as the supersymmetric Proca-Yang-Mills system. This description of massive vectors is contrasted with the standard one obtained through the Higgs mechanism.
