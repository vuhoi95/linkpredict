Title: Near commuting multi-matrix models
Authors: Denjoe O'Connor and Veselin G. Filev
Abstract: We investigate the radial extent of the eigenvalue distribution for Yang-Mills type matrix models. We show that, a three matrix Gaussian model with complex Myers coupling, to leading order in strong coupling is described by commuting matrices whose joint eigenvalue distribution is uniform and confined to a ball of radius R=(3Pi/2g)^(1/3). We then study, perturbatively, a 3-component model with a pure commutator action and find a radial extent broadly consistent with numerical simulations.
