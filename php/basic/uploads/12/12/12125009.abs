Title: Higgs diphoton rate enhancement from supersymmetric physics beyond the  MSSM
Authors: Marcus Berg and Igor Buchberger and D. M. Ghilencea and Christoffer Petersson
Abstract: We show that supersymmetric "new physics" beyond the MSSM can naturally accommodate a Higgs mass near 126 GeV and enhance the signal rate in the Higgs to diphoton channel, while the signal rates in all the other Higgs decay channels coincide with Standard Model expectations, except possibly the Higgs to Z-photon channel. The "new physics" that corrects the relevant Higgs couplings can be captured by two supersymmetric effective operators. We provide a simple example of an underlying model in which these operators are simultaneously generated. The scale of "new physics" that generates these operators can be around 5 TeV or larger, and outside the reach of the LHC.
