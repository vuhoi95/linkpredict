Title: Holographic Friedmann Equation and $\cal{N}=$4 SYM theory
Authors: Kazuo Ghoroku and Akihiro Nakamura
Abstract: According to the AdS/CFT correspondence, the ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory has been studied by solving the dual supergravity. In solving the bulk Einstein equation, we find that it could be related to the 4D Friedmann equation, which is solved by using the cosmological constant and the energy density of the matters on the boundary, and they are dynamically decoupled from the SYM theory. We call this combination of the bulk Einstein equations and the 4D Friedmann equation as holographic Friedmann equations (HFE). Solving the HFE, it is shown how the 4D decoupled matters and the cosmological constant control the dynamical properties of the SYM theory, quark confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, and baryon stability. From their effect on the SYM, the matters are separated to two groups. Our results would give important information in studying the cosmological development of our universe.
