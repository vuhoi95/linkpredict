Title: Delay Equations of the Wheeler-Feynman Type
Authors: D. -A. Deckert and D. DÃ¼rr and N. Vona
Abstract: We present an approximate model of Wheeler-Feynman electrodynamics for which uniqueness of solutions is proved. It is simple enough to be instructive but close enough to Wheeler-Feynman electrodynamics such that we can discuss its natural type of initial data, constants of motion and stable orbits with regard to Wheeler-Feynman electrodynamics.
