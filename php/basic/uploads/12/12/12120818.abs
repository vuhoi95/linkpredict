Title: Kink mass quantum shifts from SUSY quantum mechanics
Authors: Alberto Alonso-Izquierdo and Juan Mateos Guilarte and Mikhail S. Plyushchay
Abstract: In this paper a new version of the DHN (Dashen-Hasslacher-Neveu) formula, which is used to compute the one-loop order kink mass correction in (1+1)-dimensional scalar field theory models, is constructed. The new expression is written in terms of the spectral data coming from the supersymmetric partner operator of the second-order small kink fluctuation operator and allows us to compute the kink mass quantum shift in new models for which this calculation was out of reach by means of the old formula.
