Title: CSW-like Expansion for Einstein Gravity
Authors: Brenda Penante and Sayeh Rajabi and Grigory Sizov
Abstract: Using the recent formula presented by He and Cachazo-Mason-Skinner for the link representation of tree-level N=8 supergravity amplitudes, we derived a CSW-like expansion for the Next-to-MHV 6- and 7-graviton amplitudes by using the global residue theorem; a technique introduced originally for Yang-Mills amplitudes. We analytically checked the equivalence of one of the CSW terms and its corresponding Risager's diagram. For the remaining 6-graviton and all 7-graviton terms, we numerically checked the agreement with Risager's expansion. We showed that the conditions for the absence of contributions at infinity of the global residue theorem are satisfied for any number of particles. This means that our technique and Risager's should disagree starting at twelve particles where Risager's method is known to fail.
