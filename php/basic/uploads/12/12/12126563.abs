Title: Three-point correlators of twist-2 operators in N=4 SYM at Born  approximation
Authors: Vladimir Kazakov and Evgeny Sobko
Abstract: We calculate two different types of 3-point correlators involving twist-2 operators in the leading weak coupling approximation and all orders in N_c in N=4 SYM theory. Each of three operators in the first correlator can be any component of twist-2 supermultiplet, though the explicit calculation was done for a particular component which is an SU(4) singlet. It is calculated in the leading, Born approximation for arbitrary spins j_1,j_2,j_3. The result significantly simplifies when at least one of the spins is large or equal to zero and the coordinates are restricted to the 2d plane spanned by two light-rays. The second correlator involves two twist-2 operators Tr X\nabla^{j_1}X +..., Tr Z\nabla^{j_2}Z+... and one Konishi operator Tr[\bar Z,\bar X]^2. It vanishes in the lowest g^0 order and is computed at the leading g^2 approximation.
