Title: Non-Abelian tensor gauge fields and new topological invariants
Authors: George Georgiou and George Savvidy
Abstract: In this article we shall consider the tensor gauge fields which are possible to embed into the existing framework of generalized YM theory and therefore allows to construct the gauge invariant and metric independent forms in 2n+4 and 2n+2 dimensions. These new forms are analogous to the Pontryagin-Chern-Simons densities in YM gauge theory and to the corresponding series of densities in 2n+3 dimensions constructed recently in arXiv:1205.0027.
