Title: All the Stationary Vacuum States of De Sitter Space
Authors: Maulik Parikh and Prasant Samantray
Abstract: We obtain all the stationary vacua of de Sitter space by classifying the inequivalent timelike isometries of the de Sitter group. Besides the static vacuum, de Sitter space also admits a family of rotating vacua, which we use to obtain Kerr-de Sitter solutions in various dimensions. By writing the metric in a coordinate system adapted to the rotating Hamiltonian, we show that empty de Sitter space admits not only an observer-dependent horizon but also an observer-dependent ergosphere.
