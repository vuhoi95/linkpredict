Title: Recursion Relations for Tree-level Amplitudes in the SU(N) Non-linear  Sigma Model
Authors: Karol Kampf and Jiri Novotny and Jaroslav Trnka
Abstract: It is well-known that the standard BCFW construction cannot be used for on-shell amplitudes in effective field theories due to bad behavior for large shifts. We show how to solve this problem in the case of the SU(N) non-linear sigma model, i.e. non-renormalizable model with infinite number of interaction vertices, using scaling properties of the semi-on-shell currents, and we present new on-shell recursion relations for all on-shell tree-level amplitudes in this theory.
