Authors: Pietro Galli and Tomas Ortin and Jan Perz and Carlos S. Shahbazi
Abstract: We apply the H-FGK formalism to the study of some properties of the general class of black holes in N=2 supergravity in four dimensions that correspond to the harmonic and hyperbolic ansatze and obtain explicit extremal and non-extremal solutions for the t^3 model with and without a quantum correction. Not all solutions of the corrected model (quantum black holes), including in particular a solution with a single q_1 charge, have a regular classical limit.
