Title: The string tension for Large N gauge theory from smeared Wilson loops
Authors: Antonio Gonz√°lez-Arroyo and Masanori Okawa
Abstract: Using smeared Creutz ratios we extract the string tension for SU(N) pure gauge theory and $N$=3,4,5,6,8. We employ these results to extrapolate to large N. The same methodology is applied to the single-site Twisted Eguchi Kawai model. The corresponding string tension matches perfectly within errors with the extrapolated one, providing strong evidence in favour of the twisted reduction framework. Interesting results are also obtained on the behaviour of Creutz ratios for large sizes.
