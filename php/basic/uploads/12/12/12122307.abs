Title: Two critical phenomena in the exactly soluble quantized Schwarzschild  black hole
Authors: Edwin J. Son and Wontae Kim
Abstract: We study thermodynamic quantities and phase transitions of a spherically symmetric Schwarzschild black hole by taking into account the back reaction through the conformal anomaly of matter fields, and show that there exists an additional phase transition to the conventional Hawking-Page phase transition. The small black hole is more probable than the hot flat space above a second critical temperature, while it is less probable than the hot flat space in the classical Schwarzschild black hole. However, the unstable small black hole eventually should decay into the stable large black hole because the conformal anomaly does not change its thermodynamic stability.
