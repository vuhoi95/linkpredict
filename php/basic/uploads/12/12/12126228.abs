Title: From the Holomorphic Wilson Loop to `d log' Loop-Integrands of  Super-Yang-Mills Amplitudes
Authors: Arthur E. Lipstein and Lionel Mason
Abstract: The S-matrix for planar N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory can be computed as the correlation function for a holomorphic polygonal Wilson loop in twistor space. In an axial gauge, this leads to the construction of the all-loop integrand via MHV diagrams in twistor space. We show that at MHV, this formulation leads directly to expressions for loop integrands in d log form; i.e., the integrand is a product of exterior derivatives of logarithms of rational functions. For higher MHV degree, it is in d log form multiplied by delta functions. The parameters appearing in the d log form arise geometrically as the coordinates of insertion points of propagators on the holomorphic Wilson loop or on MHV vertices. We discuss a number of examples at one and two loops and give a preliminary discussion of the evaluation of the 1-loop MHV amplitude.
