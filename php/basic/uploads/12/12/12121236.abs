Title: Correlators in the Simplest Gauge-String Duality
Authors: Rajesh Gopakumar and Roji Pius
Abstract: In this note we compare planar correlators such as $< \prod_i^n Tr M^{2k_i} >$ in the Gaussian matrix model with corresponding genus zero correlators of the A-model topological string theory on $P^1$. We find a simple relation between them which provides additional evidence for the duality between the two theories, as proposed in arXiv:1104.2386.
