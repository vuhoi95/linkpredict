Title: Study on the mechanical system related to Hahn's discrete time  derivative
Authors: Won Sang Chung and Min Jung
Abstract: In this paper, we use the quantum variational calculus related to Hahn's discrete time derivative construct the deformed version for the classical mechanics related to the Hahn's calculus. We deal with the deformed dynamics such as the motion with constant velocity and the motion with constant acceleration. Moreover, we extend our work to the motion of a body in a resisting medium by using the new identity for an infinite ($q,w$)-series, where the retarding force is assumed to be proportional to the deformed average velocity.
