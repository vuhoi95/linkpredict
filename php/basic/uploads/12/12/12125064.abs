Title: A note on the Holst action, the time gauge, and the Barbero-Immirzi  parameter
Authors: Marc Geiller and Karim Noui
Abstract: In this note, we review the canonical analysis of the Holst action in the time gauge, with a special emphasis on the Hamiltonian equations of motion and the fixation of the Lagrange multipliers. This enables us to identify at the Hamiltonian level the various components of the covariant torsion tensor, which have to be vanishing in order for the classical theory not to depend upon the Barbero-Immirzi parameter. We also introduce a formulation of three-dimensional gravity with an explicit phase space dependency on the Barbero-Immirzi parameter as a potential way to investigate its fate and relevance in the quantum theory.
