Abstract: For particle collision near rapidly rotating Kerr black holes, the center-of-mass energy can be arbitrarily high if the angular momentum of either of the colliding particles is fine-tuned. Recently, it has been shown that particles which are produced by such a particle collision and escape to infinity cannot be very massive nor very energetic. For electrically charged black holes there is a similar phenomenon, where the center-of-mass energy for the collision of charged particles near the horizon can be arbitrarily high. One might expect that there would exist a similar bound on the energy and mass of particles that are produced by such a particle collision and escape to infinity. In this paper, however, we see that this expectation is not the case. We explicitly show that superheavy and highly energetic charged particles produced by the collision near maximally charged black holes can escape to infinity at least within classical theory if the backreaction and self-force of the particle can be neglected.
