Title: Generalized sine-Gordon models and quantum braided groups
Authors: Francois Delduc and Marc Magro and Benoit Vicedo
Abstract: We determine the quantized function algebras associated with various examples of generalized sine-Gordon models. These are quadratic algebras of the general Freidel-Maillet type, the classical limits of which reproduce the lattice Poisson algebra recently obtained for these models defined by a gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten action plus an integrable potential. More specifically, we argue based on these examples that the natural framework for constructing quantum lattice integrable versions of generalized sine-Gordon models is that of affine quantum braided groups.
