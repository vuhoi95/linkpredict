Title: Supersymmetric AdS_6 via T-duality
Authors: Yolanda Lozano and Eoin O Colgain and Diego Rodriguez-Gomez and Konstadinos Sfetsos
Abstract: We present a new supersymmetric AdS_6 solution of type IIB supergravity with SU(2) isometry. Through the AdS/CFT correspondence, this has potentially very interesting implications for 5d fixed point theories. This solution is the result of a non-Abelian T-duality on the known supersymmetric AdS_6 solution of massive IIA. The SU(2) R-symmetry is untouched, leading to sixteen supercharges and preserved supersymmetry.
