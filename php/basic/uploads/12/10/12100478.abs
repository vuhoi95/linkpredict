Title: Adinkra (In)Equivalence From Coxeter Group Representations: A Case Study
Authors: Isaac Chappell II and S. James Gates Jr and T. Hubsch
Abstract: Using a Mathematica code, we present a straightforward numerical analysis of the 384-dimensional solution space of signed permutation 4x4 matrices, which in sets of four provide representations of the GR(4,4) algebra, closely related to the N=1 (simple) supersymmetry algebra in 4-dimensional spacetime. Following after ideas discussed in previous papers about automorphisms and classification of adinkras and corresponding supermultiplets, we make a new and alternative proposal to use equivalence classes of the (unsigned) permutation group S4 to define distinct representations of higher dimensional spin bundles within the context of adinkras. For this purpose, the definition of a dual operator akin to the well-known Hodge star is found to partition the space of these GR(4,4) representations into three suggestive classes.
