Title: Killing vectors in higher dimensional spacetimes with constant scalar  curvature invariants
Authors: David McNutt and Nicos Pelavas and Alan Coley
Abstract: We study the existence of a non-spacelike isometry, \zeta, in higher dimensional Kundt spacetimes with constant scalar curvature invariants (CSI). We present the particular forms for the null or timelike Killing vectors and a set of constraints for the metric functions in each case. Within the class of N dimensional CSI Kundt spacetimes, admitting a non-spacelike isometry, we determine which of these can admit a covariantly constant null vector that also satisfy \zeta_{[a;b]} = 0.
