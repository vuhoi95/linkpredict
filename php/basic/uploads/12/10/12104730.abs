Title: Shock waves as branes with throats
Authors: J. Rizos and N. Tetradis
Abstract: We discuss the properties of a class of exact dynamical solutions of the DBI action in various dimensions. They can be interpreted as shock waves of the nonlinear theory. They can also describe two parallel branes connected by a throat within a Minkowski bulk. We analyze issues related to the conservation of energy in these systems. We also discuss possible applications in particle physics and cosmology.
