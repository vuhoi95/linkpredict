Title: Gauged Lifshitz model with Chern-Simons term
Authors: Gustavo Lozano and Fidel A. Schaposnik and Gianni Tallarita
Abstract: We present a gauged Lifshitz Lagrangian including second and forth order spatial derivatives of the scalar field and a Chern-Simons term, and study non-trivial solutions of the classical equations of motion. While the coefficient beta of the forth order term should be positive in order to guarantee positivity of the energy, the coefficient alpha of the quadratic one need not be. We investigate the parameter domains finding significant differences in the field behaviors. Apart from the usual vortex field behavior of the ordinary relativistic Chern-Simons-Higgs model, we find in certain parameter domains oscillatory solutions reminiscent of the modulated phases of Lifshitz systems.
