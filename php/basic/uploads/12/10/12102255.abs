Title: Equivalent D=3 Supergravity Amplitudes from Double Copies of  Three-Algebra and Two-Algebra Gauge Theories
Authors: Yu-tin Huang and Henrik Johansson
Abstract: We show that three-dimensional supergravity amplitudes can be obtained as double copies of either three-algebra super-Chern-Simons matter theory or that of two-algebra super-Yang-Mills theory, when either theory is organized to display the color-kinematics duality. We prove that only helicity-conserving four-dimensional gravity amplitudes have nonvanishing descendants when reduced to three dimensions; implying the vanishing of odd-multiplicity S-matrix elements, in agreement with Chern-Simons matter theory. We explicitly verify the double-copy correspondence at four and six points for N=12,10,8 supergravity theories and discuss its validity for all multiplicity.
