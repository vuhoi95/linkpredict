Authors: Shinya Tomizawa and Shun'ya Mizoguchi
Abstract: Using the SL(2,R)-duality in a dimensionally reduced spacetime in (the bosonic sector of) five-dimensional minimal supergravity, we construct general Kaluza-Klein black hole solutions which carry six independent charges, its mass, angular momentum along four dimensions, electric and magnetic charges of the Maxwell fields in addition to Kaluza-Klein electric and magnetic monopole charges.
