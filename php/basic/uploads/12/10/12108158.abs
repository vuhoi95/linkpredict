Title: Kinetic theory with Berry curvature from quantum field theories
Authors: Dam Thanh Son and Naoki Yamamoto
Abstract: A kinetic theory can be modified to incorporate triangle anomalies and the chiral magnetic effect by taking into account the Berry curvature flux through the Fermi surface. We show how such a kinetic theory can be derived from underlying quantum field theories. Using the new kinetic theory, we also compute the parity-odd correlation function that is found to be identical to the result in the perturbation theory in the next-to-leading order hard dense loop approximation.
