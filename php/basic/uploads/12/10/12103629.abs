Abstract: We consider a model of $F(R)$ gravity in which exponential and power corrections to Einstein-$\Lambda$ gravity are included. We show that this model has 4-dimensional Eguchi-Hanson type instanton solutions in Euclidean space. We then seek solutions to the five dimensional equations for which space-time contains a hypersurface corresponding to the Eguchi-Hanson space. We obtain analytic solutions of the $F(R)$ gravitational field equations, and by assuming certain relationships between the model parameters and integration constants, find several classes of exact solutions. Finally, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the solutions and compute the second derivative of the $F(R)$ function with respect to the Ricci scalar to confirm Dolgov-Kawasaki stability.
