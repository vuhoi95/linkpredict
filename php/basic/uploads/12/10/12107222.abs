Title: Solvable model for quantum gravity
Authors: Jack Gegenberg and Viqar Husain
Abstract: We study a type of geometric theory with a non-dynamical one-form field. Its dynamical variables are an $su(2)$ gauge field and a triad of $su(2)$ valued one-forms. Hamiltonian decomposition reveals that the theory has a true Hamiltonian, together with spatial diffeomorphism and Gauss law constraints, which generate the only local symmetries. Although perturbatively non-renormalizable, the model provides a test bed for the non-perturbative quantization techniques of loop quantum gravity.
