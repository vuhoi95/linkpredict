Title: A Scattering Approach to the Dynamical Casimir Effect
Authors: Mohammad F. Maghrebi and Ramin Golestanian and Mehran Kardar
Abstract: We develop a unified scattering approach to dynamical Casimir problems which can be applied to both accelerating boundaries, as well as dispersive objects in relative motion. A general (trace) formula is derived for the radiation from accelerating boundaries. Applications are provided for objects with different shapes in various dimensions, and undergoing rotational or linear motion. Within this framework, photon generation is discussed in the context of a modulated optical mirror. For dispersive objects, we find general results solely in terms of the scattering matrix. Specifically, we discuss the vacuum friction on a rotating object, and the friction on an atom moving parallel to a surface.
