Title: NLO Corrections to the kernel of the BKP-equations
Authors: J. Bartels and V. S. Fadin and L. N. Lipatov and G. P. Vacca
Abstract: We present results for the NLO kernel of the BKP equations for composite states of three reggeized gluons in the Odderon channel, both in QCD and in N=4 SYM. The NLO kernel consists of the NLO BFKL kernel in the color octet representation and the connected $3\to3$ kernel, computed in the tree approximation.
