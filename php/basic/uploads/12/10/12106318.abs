Title: Braneworld solutions from scalar field in bimetric theory
Authors: D. Bazeia and F. A. Brito and F. G. Costa
Abstract: We investigate the presence of braneworld solutions in a bimetric theory, with gravity and the scalar field coupling differently. We consider a non-standard model, with a Cuscuton-like scalar field, and we show how to generate braneworld solutions in this new scenario. In particular, we found no gravitational instabilities for the braneworld solutions.
