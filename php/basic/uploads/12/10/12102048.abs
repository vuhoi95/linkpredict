Title: Comment on "What the information loss is {\it not}"
Authors: Qing-yu Cai and Baocheng Zhang and Ming-sheng Zhan and Li You
Abstract: A recent article by Mathur attempts a "precise formulation" for the paradox of black hole information loss [S. D. Mathur, arXiv:1108.0302v2 (hep-th)]. We point out that a key component of the above work, which refers to entangled pairs inside and outside of the horizon and their associated entropy gain or information loss during black hole evaporation, is a presumptuous false outcome not backed by the very foundation of physics. The very foundation of Mathur's above work is thus incorrect. We further show that within the framework of Hawking radiation as tunneling the so-called small corrections are sufficient to resolve the information loss problem.
