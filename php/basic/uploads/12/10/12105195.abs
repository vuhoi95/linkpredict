Title: Confinement in Anti-de Sitter Space
Authors: Ofer Aharony and Micha Berkooz and David Tong and Shimon Yankielowicz
Abstract: Four dimensional gauge theories in anti-de Sitter space, including pure Yang-Mills theory, exhibit a quantum phase transition between a deconfined phase and a confined phase as the gauge coupling is varied. We explore various mechanisms by which this may occur, both in a fixed background and in the presence of gravity. We also make a number of observations on the dynamics of four dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories in anti-de Sitter space.
