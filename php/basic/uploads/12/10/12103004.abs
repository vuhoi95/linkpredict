Title: Phenomenology of Quantum Gravity and its Possible Role in Neutrino  Anomalies
Authors: Mario A. Acero and Yuri Bonder
Abstract: New phenomenological models of Quantum Gravity have suggested that a Lorentz-Invariant discrete spacetime structure may become manifest through a nonstandard coupling of matter fields and spacetime curvature. On the other hand, there is strong experimental evidence suggesting that neutrino oscillations cannot be described by simply considering neutrinos as massive particles. In this manuscript we motivate and construct one particular phenomenological model of Quantum Gravity that could account for the so-called neutrino anomalies.
