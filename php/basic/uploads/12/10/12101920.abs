Title: Gravitational Radiation in Noncommutative Gravity
Authors: A. Jahan and N. Sadeghnezhad
Abstract: The gravitational radiation power of a binary system in a noncommutative space is derived and it's rate of the period decrease is calculated to first order in noncommutativity parameter. By comparing the theoretical results with the observational data of the binary pulsar PSR 1913+16, we find a bound on the noncommutativity parameter.
