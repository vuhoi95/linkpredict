Title: The quasi-normal modes of quantum criticality
Authors: William Witczak-Krempa and Subir Sachdev
Abstract: We study charge transport of quantum critical points described by conformal field theories in 2+1 spacetime dimensions. The transport is described by an effective field theory on an asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime, expanded to fourth order in spatial and temporal gradients. The presence of a horizon at non-zero temperatures implies that this theory has quasi-normal modes with complex frequencies. The quasi-normal modes determine the poles and zeros of the conductivity in the complex frequency plane, and so fully determine its behavior on the real frequency axis, at frequencies both smaller and larger than the absolute temperature. We describe the role of particle-vortex or S-duality on the conductivity, specifically how it maps poles to zeros and vice versa. These analyses motivate two sum rules obeyed by the quantum critical conductivity: the holographic computations are the first to satisfy both sum rules, while earlier Boltzmann-theory computations satisfy only one of them. Finally, we compare our results with the analytic structure of the O(N) model in the large-N limit, and other CFTs.
