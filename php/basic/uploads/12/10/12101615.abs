Title: Dirac equation in non-Riemannian geometries
Authors: J. B. Formiga and C. Romero
Abstract: We present the Dirac equation in a geometry with torsion and non-metricity balancing generality and simplicity as much as possible. In doing so, we use the vielbein formalism and the Clifford algebra. We also use an index-free formalism which allows us to construct objects that are totally invariant. It turns out that the previous apparatuses not only make possible a simple deduction of the Dirac equation but also allow us to exhibit some details that is generally obscure in the literature.
