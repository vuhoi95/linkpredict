Title: Degenerate horizons, Einstein metrics, and Lens space bundles
Authors: Hari K. Kunduri and James Lucietti
Abstract: We present a new infinite class of near-horizon geometries of degenerate horizons, satisfying Einstein's equations for all odd dimensions greater than five. The symmetry and topology of these solutions is compatible with those of black holes. The simplest examples give horizons of spatial topology S^3xS^2 or the non-trivial S^3-bundle over S^2. More generally, the horizons are Lens space bundles associated to certain principal torus-bundles over Fano Kaehler-Einstein manifolds. We also consider the classification problem for Einstein metrics on such Lens space bundles and derive a family which unifies all the known examples (Sasakian and non-Sasakian).
