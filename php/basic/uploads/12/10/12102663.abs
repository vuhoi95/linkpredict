Title: Higgs-Dilaton Lagrangian from Spectral Regularization
Authors: M. A. Kurkov and Fedele Lizzi
Abstract: In this letter we calculate the full Higgs-Dilaton action describing the Weyl anomaly using the bosonic spectral action. This completes the work we started in our previous paper (JHEP 1110 (2011) 001). We also clarify some issues related to the dilaton and its role as collective modes of fermions under bosonization.
