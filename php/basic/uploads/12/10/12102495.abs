Title: Scale-dependent bias with higher order primordial non-Gaussianity: Use  of the Integrated Perturbation Theory
Authors: Shuichiro Yokoyama and Takahiko Matsubara
Abstract: We analytically derive a more accurate formula for the power spectrum of the biased objects with the primordial non-Gaussianity parameterized not only by the non-linearity parameter fNL, but also by gNL and tauNL which characterize the trispectrum of the primordial curvature perturbations. We adopt the integrated perturbation theory which was constructed in Matsubara (2011). We discuss an inequality between fNL and tauNL in the context of the scale-dependent bias, by introducing a stochasticity parameter. We also mention higher order loop corrections into the scale-dependency of the bias parameter.
