Title: Spontaneous R-symmetry breaking from the renormalization group flow
Authors: Antonio Amariti and David Stone
Abstract: We propose a mechanism of R-symmetry breaking in four-dimensional DSB models based on the RG properties of the coupling constants. By constraining the UV sector, we generate new hierarchies amongst the couplings that allow a spontaneously broken R-symmetry in models with pure chiral fields of R-charges R = 0 and R = 2 only. The result is obtained by a combination of one- and two-loop effects, both at the origin of field space and in the region dominated by leading log potentials.
