Title: A One-Loop Test of Quantum Supergravity
Authors: Sayantani Bhattacharyya and Alba Grassi and Marcos Marino and Ashoke Sen
Abstract: The partition function on the three-sphere of ABJM theory and its generalizations has, at large N, a universal, subleading logarithmic term. Inspired by the success of one-loop quantum gravity for computing the logarithmic corrections to black hole entropy, we try to reproduce this universal term by a one-loop calculation in Euclidean eleven-dimensional supergravity on AdS_4 \times X_7. We find perfect agreement between the results of ABJM theory and the eleven dimensional supergravity.
