Title: Geons and Spin-2 Condensates in the AdS Soliton
Authors: Gavin S. Hartnett and Gary T. Horowitz
Abstract: We construct geons starting with gravitational perturbations of the AdS soliton. Previous studies of a charged scalar field in the soliton background showed a holographic insulator/superconductor transition at a critical chemical potential. We explore the possibility that dimensional reduction of the geon could model a transition to a d-wave superconductor. We find that although one does get a charged spin-2 condensate, it has higher free energy than the state without the condensate, so there is no phase transition.
