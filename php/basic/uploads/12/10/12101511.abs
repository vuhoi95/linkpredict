Title: Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering and Higgs Production Using the Pomeron  in AdS
Authors: Richard C. Brower and Miguel S. Costa and Marko DjuriÄ‡ and Chung-I Tan
Abstract: In the past decade overwhelming evidence has emerged for a conjectured duality between a wide class of gauge theories in d dimensions and string theories on asymptotically AdS_{d+1} spaces. We apply this duality to scattering processes that occur via Pomeron exchange. First we develop the Pomeron in string theory, as done by Brower, Polchinski, Strassler and Tan, showing that it naturally emerges as the Regge Trajectory of the AdS graviton. Next we apply the AdS Pomeron to the study of Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS), and see that our model gives good results when compared to HERA data. We then show how we can extend our results to double Pomeron exchange, and apply it to developing a formalism for the study of double diffractive Higgs production.
