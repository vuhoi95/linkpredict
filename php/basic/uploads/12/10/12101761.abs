Title: Smoking guns of a bounce in modified theories of gravity through the  spectrum of the gravitational waves
Authors: Mariam Bouhmadi-Lopez and Joao Morais and Alfredo B. Henriques
Abstract: We present an inflationary model preceded by a bounce in a metric theory a l\'{a} $f(R)$ where $R$ is the scalar curvature of the space-time. The model is asymptotically de Sitter such that the gravitational action tends asymptotically to a Hilbert-Einstein action, therefore modified gravity affects only the early stages of the universe. We then analyse the spectrum of the gravitational waves through the method of the Bogoliubov coefficients by two means: taking into account the gravitational perturbations due to the modified gravitational action in the $f(R)$ setup and by simply considering those perturbations inherent to the standard Hilbert-Einstein action. We show that there are distinctive (oscillatory) signals on the spectrum for very low frequencies; i.e. corresponding to modes that are currently entering the horizon.
