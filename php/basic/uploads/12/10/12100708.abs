Title: The phase structure of black D1/D5 (F/NS5) system in canonical ensemble
Authors: J. X. Lu and Ran Wei and Jianfei Xu
Abstract: In this paper, we explore means which can be used to change qualitatively the phase structure of charged black systems. For this, we consider a system of black D1/D5 (or its S-dual F/NS5). We find that the delocalized charged black D-strings (F-strings) alone share the same phase structure as the charged black D5 branes (NS5-branes), having no van der Waals-Maxwell liquid-gas type. However, when the two are combined to form D1/D5 (F/NS5), the resulting phase diagram has been changed dramatically to a richer one, containing now the above liquid-gas type. The effect of adding the charged D-strings (F-strings) on the phase structure can also be effectively described as a slight increase of the transverse dimensions to the original D5 (NS5). This may be viewed as a connection between a brane charge and a fraction of spatial dimension at least in a thermodynamical sense.
