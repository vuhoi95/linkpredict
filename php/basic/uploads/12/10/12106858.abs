Title: Observations on entanglement entropy in massive QFT's
Authors: Aitor Lewkowycz and Robert C. Myers and Michael Smolkin
Abstract: We identify various universal contributions to the entanglement entropy for massive free fields. As well as the `area' terms found in [1], we find other geometric contributions of the form discussed in [2]. We also compute analogous contributions for a strongly coupled field theory using the AdS/CFT correspondence. In this case, we find the results for strong and weak coupling do not agree.
