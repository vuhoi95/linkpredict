Title: Cyclic Universe with an Inflationary Phase from a Cosmological Model  with Real Gas Quintessence
Authors: Rossen I. Ivanov and Emil M. Prodanov
Abstract: Phase-plane stability analysis of a dynamical system describing the Universe as a two-fraction fluid containing baryonic dust and real virial gas quintessence is presented. Existence of a stable periodic solution experiencing inflationary periods is shown. A van der Waals quintessence model is revisited and cyclic Universe solution again found.
