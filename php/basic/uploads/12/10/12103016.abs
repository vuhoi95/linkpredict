Title: Refined Topological Strings on Local $\mathbb{P}^2$
Authors: Amer Iqbal and Can Kozcaz
Abstract: We calculate the refined topological string partition function of the Calabi-Yau threefold which is the total space of the canonical bundle on $\mathbb{P}^2$ (the local $\mathbb{P}^2$). The refined topological vertex formalism can not be directly applied to local $\mathbb{P}^2$ therefore we use the properties of the refined Hopf link to define a new two legged vertex which together with the refined vertex gives the partition function of the local $\mathbb{P}^2$.
