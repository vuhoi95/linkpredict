Title: Quantum chaos in the perfect fluid: spectrum of initial fluctuations in  the little bang
Authors: Kevin Dusling and Thomas Epelbaum and Francois Gelis and Raju Venugopalan
Abstract: We outline how unstable quantum fluctuations decohere classical fields in heavy ion collisions, leading to an equation of state and hydrodynamics. Explicit numerical realization of this framework in a scalar $\phi^4$ theory demonstrates that anomalously low values of $\eta/s$ can be generated.
