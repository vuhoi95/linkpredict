Title: On Limit Cycles in Supersymmetric Theories
Authors: Jean-François Fortin and Benjamín Grinstein and Christopher W. Murphy and Andreas Stergiou
Abstract: Contrary to popular belief conformality does not require zero beta functions. This follows from the work of Jack and Osborn, and examples in non-supersymmetric theories were recently found by some of us. In this note we show that such examples are absent in unitary N=1 supersymmetric four-dimensional field theories. More specifically, we show to all orders in perturbation theory that the beta-function vector field of such theories does not admit limit cycles. A corollary of our result is that unitary N=1 supersymmetric four-dimensional theories cannot be superscale-invariant without being superconformal.
