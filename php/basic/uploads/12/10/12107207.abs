Title: Does Elko Spinor Field Imply the Existence of an Axis of Locality?
Authors: Edmundo Capelas de Oliveira and Waldyr Alves Rodrigues Jr
Abstract: In this paper we show that the statement in Ahluwalia, Lee, and Schritt (2011) that the existence of elko spinor fields implies in an axis of locality is equivocated. The anticommutator {{\Lambda}(x,t),{\Pi}(x,t} is strictly local.
