Title: Wedge modules for two-parameter quantum groups
Authors: Naihuan Jing and Lili Zhang and Ming Liu
Abstract: The Yang-Baxterization R(z) of the trigonometric R-matrix is computed for the two-parameter quantum affine algebra of type A. Using the fusion procedure we construct all fundamental representations of the quantum algebra as wedge products of the natural representation.
