Title: Thermodynamical second-order hydrodynamic coefficients
Authors: Guy D. Moore and Kiyoumars A. Sohrabi
Abstract: Transport coefficients in non-conformal second-order hydrodynamics can be classified as either dynamical or thermodynamical. We derive Kubo formuale for the thermodynamical coefficients and compute them at leading perturbative order in a theory with general matter content. We also discuss how to approach their evaluation on the lattice.
