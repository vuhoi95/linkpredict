Title: The finite 't Hooft coupling correction on the jet quenching parameter  in a $\mathcal N=4$ Super Yang-Mills Plasma
Authors: Zi-qiang Zhang and Defu Hou and Hai-cang Ren
Abstract: We derive the quadratic action of the fluctuations around the classical world sheet underlying the jet quenching from AdS/CFT. After obtaining the correspondence partition function, the expansion of the jet quenching parameter of $\mathcal N=4$ super symmetric Yang-Mills theory is carried out to the sub-leading term in the large 't Hooft coupling $\lambda$ at a nonzero temperature. The strong coupling corresponds to the semi-classical expansion of the string-sigma model, the gravity dual of the Wilson loop operator, with the sub-leading term expressed in terms of functional determinants of fluctuations. The contribution of these determinants are evaluated numerically. We find the jet quenching parameter is reduced due to world sheet fluctuations by a factor $(1-1.97\lambda^{-1/2}) $
