Title: Non-Gaussianity in the inflating curvaton
Authors: Seishi Enomoto and Kazunori Kohri and Tomohiro Matsuda
Abstract: Inflating curvaton can create curvature perturbation when the curvaton density is slowly varying. Using the delta-N formalism, we discuss the evolution of the curvature perturbation during curvaton inflation and find analytic formulation of the non-Gaussianity parameter. We first consider the inflating curvaton with sufficiently long inflationary expansion. Then we compare the result with short curvaton inflation.
