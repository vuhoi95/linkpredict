Title: Radion Inflation in Higher-Dimensional Gravity Theory
Authors: Yuichi Fukazawa and Takeo Inami and Yoji Koyama
Abstract: We study a radion model for inflation and density perturbation identifying the scalar field arising from the five-dimensional gravity on $M_4 x S^1$ with the inflaton. The inflaton potential arising from 5D graviton and matter one-loop effects is shown to possess the desirable slow-roll property. This radion model contains only a small number of parameters and there is an ample parameter region which reproduces (without fine-tuning) all precision astrophysical data.
