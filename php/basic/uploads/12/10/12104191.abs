Title: Supersymmetry and BPS States on D4-brane in Large C-field Background
Authors: Chen-Te Ma and Chi-Hsien Yeh
Abstract: In this paper, we continue our previous study of the low energy effective theory for D4-brane in the large C-field background. The gauge field part of the effective action was found in an earlier work. In this paper, we focus on the matter field part of the action and the supersymmetry transformation. Moreover, we calculate the central charges of super algebra and extensively study BPS solutions of this effective theory. The BPS states considered in this paper include light-like gauge field configurations, the F1 ending on D4 solution, tilted D4-brane, BPS solution with two types of magnetic charges (D2 ending on D4), holomorphic embedding of D4-brane and the intersection of two D4-branes along a 2-brane.
