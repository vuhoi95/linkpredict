Title: BCJ duality and the double copy in the soft limit
Authors: S. Oxburgh and C. D. White
Abstract: We examine the structure of infrared singularities in QCD and quantum General Relativity, from the point of view of the recently conjectured double copy property which relates scattering amplitudes in non-Abelian gauge theories with gravitational counterparts. We show that IR divergences in both theories are consistent with the double copy procedure, to all orders in perturbation theory, thus providing all loop-level evidence for the conjecture. We further comment on the relevance, or otherwise, to the so-called dipole formula, a conjecture for the complete structure of IR singularities in QCD.
