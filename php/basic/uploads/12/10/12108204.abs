Title: On Noncommutative Effects in Entropic Gravity
Authors: C. M. Gregory and A. Pinzul
Abstract: We analyze the question of possible quantum corrections in the entropic scenario of emergent gravity. Using a fuzzy sphere as a natural quasiclassical approximation for the spherical holographic screen, we analyze whether it is possible to observe such corrections to Newton's law in principle. The main outcome of our analysis is that without the complete knowledge of quantum dynamics of the microscopical degrees of freedom, any Plank scale correction cannot be trusted. Some perturbative corrections might produce reliable predictions well below the Plank scale.
