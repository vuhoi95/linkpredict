Title: Deformed Seiberg-Witten Curves for ADE Quivers
Authors: Francesco Fucito and Jose F. Morales and Daniel Ricci Pacifici
Abstract: We derive Seiberg-Witten like equations encoding the dynamics of N=2 ADE quiver gauge theories in presence of a non-trivial Omega-background along a two dimensional plane. The epsilon-deformed prepotential and the chiral correlators of the gauge theory are extracted from difference equations that can be thought as a non-commutative (or quantum) version of the Seiberg-Witten curves for the quiver.
