Title: Holographic superconductors in the AdS black hole with a magnetic charge
Authors: M. R. Setare and D. Momeni and R. Myrzakulov and Muhammad Raza
Abstract: In this work we study the analytical properties of a 2+1 dimensional magnetically charged holographic superconductor in $AdS_4$. We obtain the critical chemical potential $\mu_c$ analytically, using the Sturm-Liouville variational approach. Also, the obtained analytic result can be used to back up the numerical computations in the holographic superconductor in the probe limit.
