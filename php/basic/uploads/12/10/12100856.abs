Title: Hyperbolic Multi-Monopoles With Arbitrary Mass
Authors: Lesley M. Sibner and Robert J. Sibner
Abstract: On a complete manifold, such as Euclidean 3-space or hyperbolic 3-space, the limit at infinity of the norm of the Higgs field is called the mass of the monopole. We show the existence, on hypebolic 3-space, of monopoles with given magnetic charge and arbitrary mass. Previously, aside from charge one monopoles, existence was known only for monopoles with integral mass (since these arise from U(1) invariant instantons on Euclidean 4-space). The method of proof is based on Taubes' gluing procedure, using well-separated, explicit, charge one monopoles. The analysis is carried out in a weighted Sobolev space and necessitates eliminating the possibility of point spectra.
