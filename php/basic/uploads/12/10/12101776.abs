Title: A note on on-shell recursion relation of string amplitudes
Authors: Yung-Yeh Chang and Bo Feng and Chih-Hao Fu and Jen-Chi Lee and Yihong Wang and Yi Yang
Abstract: In the application of on-shell recursion relation to string amplitudes, one challenge is the sum over infinite intermediate on-shell string states. In this note, we show how to sum these infinite states explicitly by including unphysical states to make complete Fock space.
