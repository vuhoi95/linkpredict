Title: On finite-dimensional representations of two-parameter quantum affine  algebras
Authors: Naihuan Jing and Honglian Zhang
Abstract: A notion of Drinfeld polynomials is introduced for modules of two-parameter quantum affine algebras. Finite dimensional representations are then characterized by sets of $l$-tuples of pairs of Drinfeld polynomials with certain conditions.
