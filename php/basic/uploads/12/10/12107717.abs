Authors: Abdelmalek Abdesselam and Ajay Chandra and Gianluca Guadagni
Abstract: In this short note we announce the construction of scale invariant non-Gaussian generalized stochastic processes over three dimensional p-adic space. The construction includes that of the associated squared field and our result shows this squared field has a dynamically generated anomalous dimension which rigorously confirms a prediction made more than forty years ago, in an essentially identical situation, by Kenneth G. Wilson. We also prove a mild form of universality for the model under consideration.
