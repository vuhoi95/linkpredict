Title: Twinlike models for kinks and compactons in flat and warped spacetime
Authors: D. Bazeia and A. S. Lob√£o Jr and R. Menezes
Abstract: This work deals with the presence of twinlike models in scalar field theories. We show how to build distinct scalar field theories having the same extended solution, with the same energy density and the very same linear stability. Here, however, we start from a given but generalized scalar field theory, and we construct the corresponding twin model, which also engenders generalized dynamics. We investigate how the twinlike models arise in flat and in curved spacetime. In the curved spacetime, we consider a braneword model with the warp factor controlling the spacetime geometry with a single extra dimension of infinite extent. In particular, we study linear stability in the flat and curved spacetime, and in the case of curved spacetime, in both the gravity and the scalar field sectors, for the two braneworld models.
