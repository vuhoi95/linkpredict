Title: The Quantum Deformed Mirror TBA II
Authors: Gleb Arutyunov and Marius de Leeuw and Stijn J. van Tongeren
Abstract: We discuss the description of generic excited states in the quantum deformed AdS_5 x S^5 mirror thermodynamic Bethe ansatz and derive the associated Y-system. This Y-system shows an interesting new feature; it depends explicitly on the excited state under consideration. Similarly, it also depends on twisted boundary conditions. We construct the asymptotic solution of these TBA and Y-system equations by deriving the twisted transfer matrix for the quantum deformed Hubbard model and finding the deformed mirror bound state dressing phase. This asymptotic construction is insensitive to the precise nature of the deformation, and thereby provides a nontrivial check of the interesting new features which arise precisely at roots of unity.
