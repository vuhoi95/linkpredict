Title: Explosive particle production in non-commutative inflation
Authors: Hideki Perrier and Ruth Durrer and Massimiliano Rinaldi
Abstract: We consider a model of inflation which has recently been proposed in the literature and where inflation is induced by corrections to the energy density coming from the non-commutativity of spacetime. We show that the very rapid inflationary expansion typical of this model is responsible for a burst of particle production which ends inflation and leads to a radiation-dominated phase. We analytically estimate the energy density of these particles and we confront the results with more precise numerical calculations. We estimate the number of inflationary e-folds before the back-reaction of the radiation energy density overcomes the non-commutative effects and terminate inflation naturally.
