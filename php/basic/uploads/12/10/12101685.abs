Abstract: Two-point Feynman parameter integrals, with at most one mass and containing local operator insertions in $4+\ep$-dimensional Minkowski space, can be transformed to multi-integrals or multi-sums over hyperexponential and/or hypergeometric functions depending on a discrete parameter $n$. Given such a specific representation, we utilize an enhanced version of the multivariate Almkvist--Zeilberger algorithm (for multi-integrals) and a common summation framework of the holonomic and difference field approach (for multi-sums) to calculate recurrence relations in $n$. Finally, solving the recurrence we can decide efficiently if the first coefficients of the Laurent series expansion of a given Feynman integral can be expressed in terms of indefinite nested sums and products; if yes, the all $n$ solution is returned in compact representations, i.e., no algebraic relations exist among the occurring sums and products.
