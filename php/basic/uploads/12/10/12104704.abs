Title: An off-shell formulation for internally gauged D=5, N=2 supergravity  from superconformal methods
Authors: Frederik Coomans and Mehmet Ozkan
Abstract: We use the superconformal method to construct a new formulation for pure off-shell D=5, N=2 Poincar\'e supergravity and present its internal gauging. The main difference between the traditional formulation and our new formulation is the choice of the Dilaton Weyl Multiplet as the background Weyl Multiplet and the choice of a Linear compensating Multiplet. We do not introduce an external vector multiplet to gauge the theory, but instead use the internal vector of the Dilaton Weyl Multiplet. We show that the corresponding on-shell theory is Einstein-Maxwell supergravity. We believe that this gauging method can be applied in more complicated scenarios such as the inclusion of off-shell higher derivative invariants.
