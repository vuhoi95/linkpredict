Title: Formation of scalar hair on Gauss-Bonnet solitons and black holes
Authors: Yves Brihaye and Betti Hartmann and Sardor Tojiev
Abstract: We discuss the formation of scalar hair on Gauss-Bonnet solitons and black holes in 5-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time. We present new results on the static case and point out further details. We find that the presence of the Gauss-Bonnet term has an influence on the pattern of soliton solutions for small enough values of the electric charge. We also discuss rotating Gauss-Bonnet black holes with and without scalar hair.
