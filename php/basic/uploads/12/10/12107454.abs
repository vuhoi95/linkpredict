Title: N=1 superconformal blocks with Ramond fields from AGT correspondence
Authors: Alexander Belavin and Baur Mukhametzhanov
Abstract: We use AGT correspondence between N=2 SUSY Yang-Mills theory on ${\mathbb R}^4/{\mathbb Z}_2$ and two-dimensional CFT model with the algebra $ {\cal H} \oplus \hat{sl}(2)_2 \oplus \text{NSR}$ to obtain the explicit expressions for 4-point NSR conformal blocks including Ramond fields in terms of Nekrasov partition functions and correlation functions of $\hat{sl}(2)_2$ WZW model.
