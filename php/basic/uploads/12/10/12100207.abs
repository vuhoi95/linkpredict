Title: Confluence of apparent singularities in multi-indexed orthogonal  polynomials: the Jacobi case
Authors: C. -L. Ho and R. Sasaki and K. Takemura
Abstract: The multi-indexed Jacobi polynomials are the main part of the eigenfunctions of exactly solvable quantum mechanical systems obtained by certain deformations of the P\"oschl-Teller potential (Odake-Sasaki). By fine-tuning the parameter(s) of the P\"oschl-Teller potential, we obtain several families of explicit and global solutions of certain second order Fuchsian differential equations with an apparent singularity of characteristic exponent -2 and -1. They form orthogonal polynomials over $x\in(-1,1)$ with weight functions of the form $(1-x)^\alpha(1+x)^\beta/\{(ax+b)^4q(x)^2\}$, in which $q(x)$ is a polynomial in $x$.
