Title: Turbulent flows for relativistic conformal fluids in 2+1 dimensions
Authors: Federico Carrasco and Luis Lehner and Robert C. Myers and Oscar Reula and Ajay Singh
Abstract: We demonstrate that relativistic conformal hydrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions displays a turbulent behaviour which cascades energy to longer wavelengths on both flat and spherical manifolds. Our motivation for this study is to understand the implications for gravitational solutions through the AdS/CFT correspondence. The observed behaviour implies gravitational perturbations of the corresponding black brane/black hole spacetimes (for sufficiently large scales/temperatures) will display a similar cascade towards longer wavelengths.
