Title: Global mirror symmetry for invertible simple elliptic singularities
Authors: Todor Milanov and Yefeng Shen
Abstract: A simple elliptic singularity of type $E_N^{(1,1)}$ ($N=6,7,8$) can be described in terms of a marginal deformation of an invertible polynomial $W$. In the papers \cite{KS} and \cite{MR} the authors proved a mirror symmetry statement for some particular choices of $W$ and used it to prove quasi-modularity of Gromov-Witten invariants for certain elliptic orbifold $\mathbb{P}^1$s. However, the choice of the polynomial $W$ and its marginal deformation $\phi_{\mu}$ are not unique. In this paper, we investigate the global mirror symmetry phenomenon for the one-parameter family $W+\sigma\phi_{\mu}$. In each case the mirror symmetry is governed by a certain system of hypergeometric equations. We conjecture that the Saito-Givental theory of $W+\sigma\phi_{\mu}$ at any special limit $\sigma$ is mirror to either the Gromov-Witten theory of an elliptic orbifold $\mathbb{P}^1$ or the Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten theory of an invertible simple elliptic singularity with diagonal symmetries, and the limits are classified by the Milnor number of the singularity and the $j$-invariant at the special limit. We prove the conjecture when $W$ is a Fermat polynomial. We also prove that the conjecture is true at the Gepner point $\sigma=0$ in all other cases.
