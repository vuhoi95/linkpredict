Authors: Charlotte Kristjansen and Gordon W. Semenoff and Donovan Young
Abstract: We compute the one-point functions of chiral primary operators in the non-supersymmetric defect conformal field theory that is dual to the IIB string theory on $AdS_5\times S^5$ background with a probe D7 brane with internal gauge field flux, both in perturbative Yang-Mills theory and in the string theory dual. The former is expected to be accurate at weak coupling whereas the latter should be accurate in the planar strong coupling limit of the gauge theory. We consider the distinct cases where the D7 brane has geometry $AdS_4\times S^4$ with an instanton bundle of the worldvolume gauge fields on $S^4$ and $AdS_4\times S^2\times S^2$ with Dirac monopole bundles on each $S^2$. The gauge theory computation and the string theory computation can be compared directly in the planar limit and then a subsequent limit where the worldvolume flux is large. We find that there is exact agreement between the two in the leading order.
