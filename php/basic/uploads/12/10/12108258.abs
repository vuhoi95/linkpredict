Authors: B. Basu-Mallick and Tanaya Bhattacharyya and Diptiman Sen
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a novel procedure for constructing clusters of bound particles in the case of a quantum integrable derivative delta-function Bose gas in one dimension. It is shown that clusters of bound particles can be constructed for this Bose gas for some special values of the coupling constant, by taking the quasi-momenta associated with the corresponding Bethe state to be equidistant points on a single circle in the complex momentum plane. We also establish a connection between these special values of the coupling constant and some fractions belonging to the Farey sequences in number theory. This connection leads to a classification of the clusters of bound particles associated with the derivative delta-function Bose gas and allows us to study various properties of these clusters like their size and their stability under the variation of the coupling constant.
