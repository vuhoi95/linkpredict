Title: Quantum black holes in Type-IIA String Theory
Authors: Pablo Bueno and Rhys Davies and C. S. Shahbazi
Abstract: We study black hole solutions of Type-IIA Calabi-Yau compactifications in the presence of perturbative quantum corrections. We define a class of black holes that only exist in the presence of quantum corrections and that, consequently, can be considered as purely quantum black holes. The regularity conditions of the solutions impose the topological constraint h^{1,1}>h^{2,1} on the Calabi-Yau manifold, defining a class of admissible compactifications, which we prove to be non-empty for h^{1,1}=3 by explicitly constructing the corresponding Calabi-Yau manifolds, new in the literature.
