Title: No Line on the Horizon: On Uniform Acceleration and Gluonic Fields at  Strong Coupling
Authors: J. Antonio Garcia and Alberto Guijosa and Eric J. Pulido
Abstract: We study a few assorted questions about the behavior of strings on anti-de Sitter spacetime (AdS), or equivalently, `flux tubes' in strongly-coupled conformal field theories (CFTs). For the case where the `flux tube' is sourced by a uniformly accelerated quark (or, more generally, a quark that asymptotes to uniform acceleration in the remote past), we point out that the dual string embedding known heretofore terminates unphysically at the worldsheet horizon, and identify the correct continuation, which is found to encode a gluonic shock wave. For arbitrary quark motion, we show that, contrary to common understanding, the worldsheet horizon does not in general represent a dividing line between the portions of the string respectively dual to the quark and to the gluonic radiation emitted by it.
