Authors: Peter M. Lavrov and Alexander A. Reshetnyak
Abstract: We review the study of influence of the so-called soft BRST symmetry breaking within the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism introduced in our papers [JHEP 1110 (2011) 043, arXiv:1108.4820 [hep-th], MPLA 27 (2012) 1250067, arXiv:1201.4720 [hep-th]] on gauge dependence of the effective action and vacuum expectation values of gauge invariant operators. We derive the Ward identities for generating functionals of Green's functions for a given theory with soft BRST symmetry breaking term being added to the quantum action and investigate theirs gauge dependence. It is strongly argued that gauge theories with a soft breaking of BRST symmetry are inconsistent within the BV formalism because of the gauge-dependence of $S$-matrix. The application to the Gribov-Zwanziger action (enlarging SU(N) Yang-Mills gauge theory by means of not gauge-invariant horizon function) for the one-parameter family of $R_\xi$ gauges with use of the new form of the Hermitian augmented Faddeev-Popov operator (being by Faddeev-Popov operator for transverse components of Yang--Mills fields) is considered.
