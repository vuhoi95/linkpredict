Abstract: We study a new family of models of the sine-Gordon type, starting from the sine-Gordon model, including the double sine-Gordon, the triple one, and so on. The models appears as deformations of the starting model, with the deformation controlled by two parameters, one very small, used to control a linear expansion on it, and the other, which specifies the particular model in the family of models. We investigate the presence of topological defects, showing how the solutions can be constructed explicitly from the topological defects of the sine-Gordon model itself. In particular, we delve into the double sine-Gordon model in a braneworld scenario with a single extra dimension of infinite extent, showing that a stable gravity scenario is admissible. Also, we briefly show that the deformation procedure can be used iteratively, leading to a diversity of possibilities to construct families of models of the sine-Gordon type.
