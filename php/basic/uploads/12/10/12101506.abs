Title: New spinorial particle model in tensorial space-time and interacting  higher spin fields
Authors: Sergey Fedoruk and Jerzy Lukierski
Abstract: The Maxwell-covariant particle model is formulated in tensorial extended D=4 space-time (x_mu, z_{mu nu}) parametrized by ten-dimensional coset of D=4 Maxwell group, with added auxiliary Weyl spinors lambda_alpha, y^alpha. We provide the Hamiltonian quantization of the model and demonstrate that first class constraints modify the known equations obtained for massless higher spin fields in flat tensorial space-time. We obtain the Maxwell-covariant field equations for new infinite dimensional spin multiplets. The component fields assigned to different spin values are linked by couplings proportional to rescaled electromagnetic coupling constant \tilde e = em, where m is the mass-like parameter introduced in our model. We discuss briefly the geometry of our tensorial space-time with constant torsion and its relation with the presence of constant electromagnetic background.
