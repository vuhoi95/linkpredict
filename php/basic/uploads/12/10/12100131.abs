Authors: D. Martinez and M. Salazar-Ramirez and R. D. Mota and V. D. Granados
Abstract: We study the Dirac-Kepler problem plus a Coulomb-type scalar potential by generalizing the Lippmann-Johnson operator to D spatial dimensions. From this operator, we construct the supersymmetric generators to obtain the energy spectrum for discrete excited eigenstates and the radial spinor for the SUSY ground state
