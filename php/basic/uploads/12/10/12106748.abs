Title: The relativistic correction of the quarkonium melting temperature with a  holographic potential
Authors: Yan Wu and Defu Hou and Hai-cang Ren
Abstract: The relativistic correction of the AdS/CFT implied heavy quark potential is examined within the framework of the potential model. For the typical range of the coupling strength appropriate to heavy-ion collisions, we find the correction is significant in size and lowers the dissociation temperature of quarkonia.
