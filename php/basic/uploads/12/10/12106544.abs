Title: QFT in the flat chart of de Sitter space
Authors: Yusuke Korai and Takahiro Tanaka
Abstract: We study the correlators for interacting quantum field theory in the flat chart of de Sitter space at all orders in perturbation. The correlators are calculated in the in-in formalism which are often applied to the calculations in the cosmological perturbation. It is shown that these correlators are de Sitter invariant. They are compared with the correlators calculated based on the Euclidean field theory. We then find that these two correlators are identical. This correspondence has been already shown graph by graph but we give an alternative proof of it by direct calculation.
