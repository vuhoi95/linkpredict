Title: Fermion condensation around a Coulomb impurity in a Weyl semimetal and  in a narrow band gap semiconductor as manifestations of the Landau  zero-charge problem
Authors: Eugene B. Kolomeisky and Joseph P. Straley
Abstract: A Coulomb impurity placed in an undoped Weyl semimetal spontaneously surrounds itself with a cloud of condensed Weyl fermions. We find that the ground-state of this system exhibits an experimentally accessible Landau zero-charge effect: the fermion condensate completely screens out the impurity charge. In a narrow band gap semiconducor this effect manifests itself in the near universality of observable charge of a highly-charged recombination center.
