Abstract: We study the AGT-like conjectured relation of a four-dimensional gauge theory on the direct product of a three-sphere and a circle to two-dimensional q-deformed Yang-Mills theory on a Riemann surface by using a five-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on the direct product of the three-sphere and the Riemann surface, following the conjectured relation of the six-dimensional N=(2,0) theory on the circle to the five-dimensional Yang-Mills theory. Our results are in perfect agreement with both of the conjectures.
