Title: U(1) Gauge Field in 6D Space-Time With Compact Noncommutative  Dimensions: A Coherent State Approach
Authors: M. Nasseri and A. Jahan and M. Souri
Abstract: We consider the U(1) gauge field defined over a six dimensional space-time with extra dimensions compactified on a noncommutative toroidal orbifold, within the context of coherent state approach to the noncommutative spaces. We demonstrate that the fuzzines of extra dimensions can lead to the canceling of the part of electrostatic interaction mediated by the massive KK modes.
