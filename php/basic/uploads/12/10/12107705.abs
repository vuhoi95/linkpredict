Title: From Schurs to Giants in ABJ(M)
Authors: Pawel Caputa and Badr Awad Elseid Mohammed
Abstract: In this work we consider various correlators with Schur polynomials in ABJ(M) models that on the dual gravity side should correspond to processes involving giant gravitons. Our analysis imposes several constraints on the physics of the probe branes on AdS4xCP3 as well as sheds more light on giant graviton solutions in this background with additional NS B-field. Our main tool is a formula that we derive for extremal n-point functions of the single trace chiral primary operators in the free field theory limit. The formula expresses the correlators in terms of the two-point function of Schur polynomials labeled by hook diagrams and is valid for a large class of gauge theories. In particular, in N = 4 SYM, it proves the conjecture of Beisert et al.
