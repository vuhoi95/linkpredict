Title: Neutral Massive Spin 1/2 Particles Emission in a Rindler Spacetime
Authors: Pietro Longhi and Roberto Soldati
Abstract: The Unruh effect for the rate of emission and absorption of neutral massive Majorana spinor particles -- the most plausible consituents of Dark Matter -- in a Rindler spacetime is thoroughly investigated. The corresponding Bogolyubov coefficients are explicitly calculated and the consistency with Fermi-Dirac statistics and the Pauli principle is actually verified.
