Title: Fake Supersymmetry and Extremal Black Holes
Authors: Seungjoon Hyun and Jaehoon Jeong and Sang-Heon Yi
Abstract: We derive the BPS type of first order differential equations for the rotating black hole solutions in the three-dimensional Einstein gravity coupled minimally with a self-interacting scalar field, using fake supersymmetry formalism. It turns out that the formalism is not complete and should be augmented by an additional equation to imply the full equations of motion. We identify this additional equation as a constraint by using an effective action method. By computing the renormalized boundary stress tensor, we obtain the mass and angular momentum of the black hole solutions of these first order equations and confirm that they saturate the BPS bound.
