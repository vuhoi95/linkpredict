Title: Full-hierarchy Quiver Theories of Electroweak Symmetry Breaking and  Fermion Masses
Authors: Gustavo Burdman and Nayara Fonseca and Leonardo de Lima
Abstract: We consider quiver theories in four dimensions with a large ultra-violet cutoff. These theories require that an ordered set of vacuum expectation values for the link fields develops dynamically and can be obtained from the coarse deconstruction of extra-dimensional theories in an AdS background. These full-hierarchy quiver theories form a large class which include AdS$_5$ models as a limit, but which have a distinctive phenomenology. As an example, in this paper we show that fermions can be introduced in a way that can at the same time generate the fermion mass hierarchy and have flavor violation consistent with experimental bounds, when the mass scale of the color-octect gauge excitation is above $3 {\rm TeV}$. We also show that electroweak precision constraints are satisfied by this mass scale, without the need to extend the gauge sector to protect against custodial violation.
