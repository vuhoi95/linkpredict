Title: Gauge theories and gravity
Authors: R. F. Sobreiro and A. A. Tomaz and V. J. Vasquez Otoya
Abstract: Pure gauge theories for de Sitter, anti de Sitter and orthogonal groups, in four-dimensional Euclidean spacetime, are studied. It is shown that, if the theory is asymptotically free and a dynamical mass is generated, then an effective geometry may be induced and a gravity theory emerges.
