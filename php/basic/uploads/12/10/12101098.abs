Abstract: We extract exact charged black-hole solutions with flat transverse sections in the framework of D-dimensional Maxwell-f(T) gravity, and we analyze the singularities and horizons based on both torsion and curvature invariants. Interestingly enough, we find that in some particular solution subclasses there appear more singularities in the curvature scalars than in the torsion ones. This difference disappears in the uncharged case, or in the case where f(T) gravity becomes the usual linear-in-T teleparallel gravity, that is General Relativity. Curvature and torsion invariants behave very differently when matter fields are present, and thus f(R) gravity and f(T) gravity exhibit different features and cannot be directly re-casted each other.
