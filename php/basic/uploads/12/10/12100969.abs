Title: A Possible Higher Order Correction to the chiral Vortical Conductivity  in a Gauge Field Plasma
Authors: Defu Hou and Hui Liu and Hai-cang Ren
Abstract: The two loop contributions to the chiral vortical conductivity are considered. The Kubo formula together with the anomalous Ward identity of the axial vector current suggest that there may be a nonzero correction to the coefficient of the $T^2$ term of the conductivity.
