Title: Skyrmions up to Baryon Number 108
Authors: D. T. J. Feist and P. H. C. Lau and N. S. Manton
Abstract: The Skyrme crystal is built up of repeating units similar to the cubic Skyrmion of baryon number 4. Using this as guide, we construct new Skyrmion solutions in the massive pion case, with various baryon numbers up to 108. Most of our solutions resemble chunks of the Skyrme crystal. They are constructed using a multi-layer version of the rational map ansatz to create initial configurations, which are then relaxed numerically to find the energy minima. The coefficients of the rational maps are found by a geometrical construction related to the Skyrme crystal structure. We find some further solutions by numerical relaxation of clusters composed of baryon number 4 Skyrmions.
