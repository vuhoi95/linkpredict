Title: Recursion relations for the multiparton collinear limit and splitting  functions
Authors: Stefano Catani and Petros Draggiotis and Germ√°n Rodrigo
Abstract: We present a systematic method to evaluate the splitting functions for tree-level QCD processes where m partons approach the collinear limit. The splitting functions are computed by deriving on-shell recursion equations, which are similar to the Berends-Giele recursion relations for off-shell currents.
