Title: Quasinormal frequencies using the hidden conformal symmetry of the  Schwarzschild black hole
Authors: Yong-Wan Kim and Yun Soo Myung and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: We show that the hidden conformal symmetry of the Schwarzschild black hole is realized from the AdS$_2$ sector of the AdS$_2\times S^2$, but not from the Rindler spacetime which is the genuine near-horizon geometry of the Schwarzschild black hole. This implies that purely imaginary quasinormal frequencies obtained using the hidden conformal symmetry is not suitable for describing the largely damped modes around the Schwarzschild black hole.
