Title: Violation of non-Gaussianity consistency relation in a single field  inflationary model
Authors: Mohammad Hossein Namjoo and Hassan Firouzjahi and Misao Sasaki
Abstract: In this paper we present a simple, toy model of single field inflation in which the standard non-Gaussianity consistency condition is violated. In this model the curvature perturbations on super-horizon scales are not conserved and the decaying modes of perturbations are not negligible in the non-atractor phase. As a result a large local non-Gaussianity can be obtained in the squeezed limit which violates the standard non-Gaussianity consistency condition for the single field models.
