Title: N=8 SYM vs. N=6 Chern-Simons: Four-point amplitudes at two-loops
Authors: Marco S. Bianchi and Matias Leoni
Abstract: We compute the four-point amplitude in 3d N=8 SYM at two loops, by solving the three dimensional scalar doublebox in dimensional regularization. We compare it to the same result in the ABJM theory, to which maximal SYM should flow in the infrared at strong coupling. After proper rescalings, we find that the two amplitudes coincide in the Regge limit.
