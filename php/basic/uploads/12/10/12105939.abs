Title: Cosmological constraints in a two branes system for a vacuum bulk
Authors: Juan L. Perez and L. Arturo Urena-Lopez and Ruben Cordero
Abstract: We present the study of a two 3-branes system embedded in a 5-dimensional space-time in which the fifth dimension is compacted on a $S^{1}/Z_{2}$ orbifold and the space between the two branes is vacuum. Assuming isotropic and homogeneous space time, we probe that the dynamics of the visible brane is affected by the dynamics of the hidden brane and the possible components which fills it. We study two different cases: assuming a constant equation of state and inflationary scalar field, and its possible consequences in the brane evolution.
