Title: Liouville's Imaginary Shadow
Authors: Volker Schomerus and Paulina Suchanek
Abstract: N=1 super Liouville field theory is one of the simplest non-rational conformal field theories. It possesses various important extensions and interesting applications, e.g. to the AGT relation with 4D gauge theory or the construction of the OSP(1|2) WZW model. In both setups, the N=1 Liouville field is accompanied by an additional free fermion. Recently, Belavin et al. suggested a bosonization of the product theory in terms of two bosonic Liouville fields. While one of these Liouville fields is standard, the second turns out to be imaginary (or time-like). We extend the proposal to the R sector and perform extensive checks based on detailed comparison of 3-point functions involving several super-conformal primaries and descendants. On the basis of such strong evidence we sketch a number of interesting potential applications of this intriguing bosonization.
