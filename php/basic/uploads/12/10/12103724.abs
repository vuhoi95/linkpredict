Title: Diffractive and deeply virtual Compton scattering in holographic QCD
Authors: Alexander Stoffers and Ismail Zahed
Abstract: We further analyze the holographic dipole-dipole scattering amplitude developed in arXiv:1202.0831, 1205.3223. Gribov diffusion at strong coupling yields the scattering amplitude in a confining background. We compare the holographic result for the differential cross section to proton-proton and deeply virtual Compton scattering data.
