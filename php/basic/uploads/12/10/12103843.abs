Title: Holographic Renormalization of Asymptotically Flat Gravity
Authors: Miok Park and Robert B. Mann
Abstract: We compute the boundary stress tensor associated with Mann-Marolf counterterm in asymptotic flat and static spacetime for cylindrical boundary surface as $r \rightarrow \infty$, and find that the form of the boundary stress tensor is the same as the hyperbolic boundary case in 4 dimensions, but has additional terms in higher than 4 dimensions. We find that these additional terms are impotent and do not contribute to conserved charges. We also check the conservation of the boundary stress tensor in a sense that $\mathcal{D}^a T_{ab} = 0$, and apply our result to the ($n+3$)-dimensional static black hole solution. As a result, we show that the stress boundary tensor with Mann-Marolf counterterm works well in standard boundary surfaces.
