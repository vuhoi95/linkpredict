Title: Rademacher Sums and Rademacher Series
Authors: Miranda C. N. Cheng and John F. R. Duncan
Abstract: We exposit the construction of Rademacher sums in arbitrary weights and describe their relationship to mock modular forms. We introduce the notion of Rademacher series and describe several applications, including the determination of coefficients of Rademacher sums and a very general form of Zagier duality. We then review the application of Rademacher sums and series to moonshine both monstrous and umbral and highlight several open problems. We conclude with a discussion of the interpretation of Rademacher sums in physics.
