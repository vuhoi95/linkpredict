Title: Probing the Higgs branch of 5d fixed point theories with dual giant  gravitons in AdS(6)
Authors: Oren Bergman and Diego Rodriguez-Gomez
Abstract: We consider the warped AdS(6)xS^4/Z_n backgrounds dual to certain 5d quiver gauge theories. By studying dual giant gravitons in the AdS(6) geometry we are able to partially probe the Higgs branch of these theories. We show how the quantization of the phase space of such dual giants coincides with the counting of holomorphic functions on C^2/Z_n, which is the geometric part of the Higgs branch for these theories.
