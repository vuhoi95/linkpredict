Abstract: We study SU(3)-invariant integrable models solvable by nested algebraic Bethe ansatz. Different formulas are given for the Bethe vectors and the actions of the generators of the Yangian Y(sl(3)) on Bethe vectors are considered. These actions are relevant for the calculation of correlation functions and form factors of local operators of the underlying quantum models.
