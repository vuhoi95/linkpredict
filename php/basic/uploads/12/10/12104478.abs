Title: Priomordial non-Gaussian features from DBI Galileon inflation
Authors: Sayantan Choudhury and Supratik Pal
Abstract: We have studied primordial non-Gaussian features from a model of potential driven single field DBI Galileon inflation. We have computed the bispectrum from the three point correlation function considering all possible cross correlation between scalar and tensor modes from the proposed setup. Further, we have computed the trispectrum from four point correlation function considering the contribution from contact interaction, scalar and graviton exchange diagrams in the in-in picture. Finally we have obtained the non-Gaussian consistency conditions from the four point correlator, which results in partial violation of the Suyama-Yamaguchi four-point consistency relation. This further leads to the conclusion that sufficient primordial non-Gaussianities can be obtained from DBI Galileon inflation.
