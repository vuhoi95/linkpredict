Title: On the origin of superselection rules and different solutions of  Thirring model
Authors: S. E. Korenblit and V. V. Semenov
Abstract: The normal forms of different one- and two- parametric solutions of Thirring model are connected with each other by making use of generalized conformal shift transformations. A new alternative sources of superselection rules are shown and the ways of spontaneous symmetry breaking are discussed.
