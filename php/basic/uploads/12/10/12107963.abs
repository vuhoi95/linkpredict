Title: Exact higher-spin symmetry in CFT: all correlators in unbroken Vasiliev  theory
Authors: V. E. Didenko and E. D. Skvortsov
Abstract: All correlation functions of conserved currents of the CFT that is dual to unbroken Vasiliev theory are found as invariants of higher-spin symmetry in the bulk of AdS. The conformal and higher-spin symmetry of the correlators as well as the conservation of currents are manifest, which also provides a direct link between the Maldacena-Zhiboedov result and higher-spin symmetries. Our method is in the spirit of AdS/CFT, though we never take any boundary limit or compute any bulk integrals. Boundary-to-bulk propagators are shown to exhibit an algebraic structure, living at the boundary of SpH(4), semidirect product of Sp(4) and the Heisenberg group. N-point correlation function is given by a product of N elements.
