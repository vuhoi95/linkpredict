Abstract: We present the analytic Lifshitz solutions for a scalar field model minimally coupled with the abelian gauge field in $N$ dimensions. We also consider the presence of cosmological constant $\Lambda$. The Lifshitz parameter $z$ appearing in the solution plays the role of the Lorentz breaking parameter of the model. We investigate the thermodynamical properties of the solutions and discuss the energy issue. Furthermore, we study the hairy black hole solutions in which the abelian gauge field breaks the symmetry near the horizon. In the holographic picture, it is equivalent to a second order phase transition. Explicitly we show that there exists a critical temperature which is a function of the Lifshitz parameter $z$. The system below the critical temperature becomes superconductor, but the critical exponent of the model remains the same of the usual holographic superconductors without the higher order gravitational corrections, in agreement with Ginzburg-Landau theories.
