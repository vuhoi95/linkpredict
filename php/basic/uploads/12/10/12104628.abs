Title: Possible daily and seasonal variations in quantum interference induced  by Chern-Simons gravity
Authors: Hiroki Okawara and Kei Yamada and Hideki Asada
Abstract: Possible effects of Chern-Simons (CS) gravity on a quantum interferometer turn out to be dependent on the latitude and direction of the interferometer on the Earth in orbital motion around the Sun. Daily and seasonal variations in phase shifts are predicted with an estimate of the size of the effects, wherefore neutron interferometry with $\sim 5$ meters arm length and $\sim 10^{-4}$ phase measurement accuracy would place a bound on a CS parameter comparable to Gravity Probe B satellite.
