Title: Four results on phi^4 oscillons in D+1 dimensions
Authors: Erik Alexander Andersen and Anders Tranberg
Abstract: We present four results for oscillons in classical phi^4 theory in D+1 space-time dimensions, based on numerical simulations. These include the oscillon lifetime and the dependence on D; evidence for the uniqueness of the oscillon; evidence for the existence of oscillons beyond D=7; and a brief study of the spectrum of the radiation emitted from the oscillons before, during and after its ultimate demise.
