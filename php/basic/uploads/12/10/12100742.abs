Title: Tachyon Warm-Intermediate Inflationary Universe Model in High  Dissipative Regime
Authors: M. R. Setare and V. Kamali
Abstract: We consider tachyonic warm-inflationary models in the context of intermediate inflation. We derive the characteristics of this model in slow-roll approximation and develop our model in two cases, 1- For a constant dissipative parameter $\Gamma$. 2- $\Gamma$ as a function of tachyon field $\phi$. We also describe scalar and tensor perturbations for this scenario. The parameters appearing in our model are constrained by recent observational data. We find that the level of non-Gaussianity for this model is comparable with non-tachyonic model.
