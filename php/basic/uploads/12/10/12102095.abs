Title: Light Probes in a Strongly Coupled Anisotropic Plasma
Authors: Berndt MÃ¼ller and Di-Lun Yang
Abstract: We employ the gauge/gravity duality to study the jet quenching of light probes traversing a static yet anisotropic strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills plasma. We compute the stopping distance of an image jet induced by a massless source field, which is characterized by a massless particle falling along the null geodesic in the WKB approximation, in an anisotropic dual geometry introduced by Mateos and Trancancelli. At mid and large anisotropic regimes, the stopping distances of a probe traveling in the anisotropic plasma along various orientations are suppressed compared to those in an isotropic plasma especially along the longitudinal direction at equal temperature. However, when fixing the entropy density, the anisotropic values of stopping distances near the transverse directions slightly surpass the isotropic values. In general, the jet quenching of light probes is increased by the anisotropic effect in a strongly coupled and equilibrium plasma.
