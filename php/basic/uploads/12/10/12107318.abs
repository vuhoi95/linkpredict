Abstract: Mild, unavoidable deviations from circular-symmetry of instrumental beams in current Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments now pose a significant challenge to deriving high precision inferences from the high sensitivity and resolution of CMB measurements. We present analytic results, verified by numerical simulations, that CMB maps of cosmological signal that respect underlying statistical isotropy (SI) symmetry, measured with an instrument that has mildly non-circular (NC) beam would, nevertheless, exhibit SI violation. Further, we show that appropriate observable measures constructed within the Bipolar spherical harmonic (BipoSH) representation of SI violation capture subtle NC-beam effects coupled with the scan strategy of the instrument. Accompanying their latest 7-year data release, the WMAP team published very high significance measurements of non-zero BipoSH spectra, A^{20}_{l l} and A^{20}_{l-2 l}, in the "W" and "V" band of the experiment. We present a strong case that the BipoSH measurement are primarily explained by the quadrupolar (m=2) component of the NC-beams, b_{l2}, of the respective channels. The fact that subtle levels of non-circularity, e.g., WMAP beams |b_{l2}|/b_{l0} < 0.01, lead to measurable BipoSH spectra points to the immense promise and potential of the BipoSH representation. The key result of this work is that using BipoSH measurements it is possible to estimate an equivalent single hit,'parallel transported' effective NC-beam that matches both the angular power spectrum and the non-zero BipoSH measurements of the observed maps. Hence, BipoSH analysis provides a very simple and effective characterization of CMB maps made with NC-beam. (Abridged)
