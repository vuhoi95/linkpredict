Abstract: We propose a new Kaluza-Klein reduction scheme based on ADM decomposition. The scheme has been motivated by AdS/CFT, especially by how the worldvolume theory should appear from the supergravity side. We apply the scheme to IIB supergravity reduced on a 5D hyperboloidal $\cH^5$ space, and show that an (A)dS "braneworld" is be realized after further reduction to 4D. We comment on applications to cosmology and black hole physics. In particular, the scheme should provide a proper paradigm for black hole physics.
