Title: Infinitely extended Kac table of solvable critical dense polymers
Authors: Paul A. Pearce and Jorgen Rasmussen and Simon P. Villani
Abstract: Solvable critical dense polymers is a Yang-Baxter integrable model of polymers on the square lattice. It is the first member LM(1,2) of the family of logarithmic minimal models LM(p,p'). The associated logarithmic conformal field theory admits an infinite family of Kac representations labelled by the Kac labels r,s=1,2,.... In this paper, we explicitly construct the conjugate boundary conditions on the strip. The boundary operators are labelled by the Kac fusion labels (r,s)=(r,1) x (1,s) and involve a boundary field xi. Tuning the field xi appropriately, we solve exactly for the transfer matrix eigenvalues on arbitrary finite-width strips and obtain the conformal spectra using the Euler-Maclaurin formula. The key to the solution is an inversion identity satisfied by the commuting double-row transfer matrices. The transfer matrix eigenvalues are classified by the physical combinatorics of the patterns of zeros in the complex spectral-parameter plane. This yields selection rules for the physically relevant solutions to the inversion identity which takes the form of a decomposition into irreducible blocks corresponding combinatorially to finitized characters given by generalized q-Catalan polynomials. This decomposition is in accord with the decomposition of the Kac characters into irreducible characters. In the scaling limit, we confirm the central charge c=-2 and the Kac formula for the conformal weights Delta_{r,s}=((2r-s)^2-1)/8 for r,s=1,2,3,... in the infinitely extended Kac table.
