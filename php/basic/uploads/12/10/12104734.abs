Abstract: We study SU(2) three-dimensional Yang-Mills theories in presence of Higgs fields in the light of the Gribov phenomenon. By restricting the domain of integration in the functional integral to the first Gribov horizon, we are able to discuss a kind of transition between the Higgs and the confining phase in a semi-classical approximation. Both adjoint and fundamental representation for the Higgs field are considered, leading to a different phase structure.
