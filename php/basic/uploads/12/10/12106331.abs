Title: Redshift drift in a pressure-gradient cosmology
Authors: Adam Balcerzak and Mariusz P. Dabrowski
Abstract: We derive a redshift drift formula for the spherically symmetric inhomogeneous pressure Stephani universes which are complementary to the spherically symmetric inhomogeneous density Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi models. We show that there is a clear difference between redshift drift predictions for these two models as well as between the Stephani models and the standard $\Lambda$CDM Friedmann models. The Stephani models have positive drift values at small redshift and behave qualitatively (but not quantitatively) as the $\Lambda$CDM models at large redshift, while the drift for LTB models is always negative. This prediction may perhaps be tested in future telescopes such as European Extremely Large Telescope (EELT), Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT), and especially, in gravitational wave interferometers DECi-Hertz Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory and Big Bang Observer (DECIGO/BBO), which aim at low redshift.
