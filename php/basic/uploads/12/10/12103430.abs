Title: Model uncertainties on limits for quantum black hole production in dijet  events from ATLAS
Authors: Douglas M. Gingrich and Krishan Saraswat
Abstract: We study the model uncertainties on limits for quantum black hole production in dijet events from ATLAS. For models that assume a hard-disk cross section, the model uncertainty on the threshold mass limits is about 5%. If the trapped surface calculation is used for the cross section, the ATLAS mass threshold limits are below 2 TeV for all number of dimensions. Using the ATLAS data in the context of the Randall-Sundrum type-1 model gives a threshold mass lower limit of 2.84 TeV.
