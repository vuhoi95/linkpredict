Abstract: We analyse the most general N=2 supersymmetric solutions of D=11 supergravity consisting of a warped product of four-dimensional anti-de-Sitter space with a seven-dimensional Riemannian manifold Y_7. We show that the necessary and sufficient conditions for supersymmetry can be phrased in terms of a local SU(2)-structure on Y_7. Solutions with non-zero M2-brane charge also admit a canonical contact structure, in terms of which many physical quantities can be expressed, including the free energy and the scaling dimensions of operators dual to supersymmetric wrapped M5-branes. We show that a special class of solutions is singled out by imposing an additional symmetry, for which the problem reduces to solving a second order non-linear ODE. As well as recovering a known class of solutions, that includes the IR fixed point of a mass deformation of the ABJM theory, we also find new solutions which are dual to cubic deformations. In particular, we find a new supersymmetric warped AdS_4 x S^7 solution with non-trivial four-form flux.
