Abstract: Axions might play a crucial role for the solution of the strong CP-problem and explanation of cold dark matter in the universe. In addition they may find applications in the formulation of inflationary models for the early universe and can serve as candidates for quintessence. We show that all these phenomena can be described within a single framework exhibiting a specific pattern of mass scales: the axionic see-saw. We also discuss the role of supersymmetry (susy) in this axionic system in two specific examples: weak scale susy in the (multi) TeV range and tele-susy with a breakdown scale coinciding with the decay constant of the QCD axion: $f_a\sim 10^{11}-10^{12}$ GeV.
