Title: Bound state in continuum like solutions in one-dimensional  hetero-structures
Authors: O. Panella and P. Roy
Abstract: We examine the one dimensional Dirac equation with modulated or position dependent velocity. In particular, it is shown that using suitable velocity profiles it is possible to create bound state in continuum (BIC) like, as well as, discrete energy bound state solutions.
