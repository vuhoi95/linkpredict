Authors: Nahomi Kan and Koichiro Kobayashi and Kiyoshi Shiraishi
Abstract: Hosotani mechanism in higher-dimensional Lee-Wick theory is investigated. The symmetry breaking mechanism proposed by Hosotani is studied at one-loop level through a toy model in this theory. We find that the phase diagram of symmetry and masses of fields are modified from the original one if masses of Lee-Wick particles are in the same order of the inverse of the compactification scale.
