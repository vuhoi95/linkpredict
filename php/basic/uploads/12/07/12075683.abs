Title: New particle model in extended space-time and covariantization of planar  Landau dynamics
Authors: Sergey Fedoruk and Jerzy Lukierski
Abstract: We introduce the Maxwell-invariant extension of D=4 relativistic free particle model into ten-dimensional Maxwell tensorial space. The new model after first quantization describes in particular Lorentz frame the planar dynamics providing Landau orbits in the presence of constant magnetic field.
