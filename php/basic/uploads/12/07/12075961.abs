Title: Dispersive fields in de Sitter space and event horizon thermodynamics
Authors: Xavier Busch and Renaud Parentani
Abstract: When Lorentz invariance is violated at high energy, the laws of black hole thermodynamics are apparently no longer satisfied. To shed light on this observation, we study dispersive fields in de Sitter space. We show that the Bunch-Davies vacuum state restricted to the static patch is no longer thermal, and that the Tolman law is violated. However we also show that, for free fields at least, this vacuum is the only stationary stable state, as if it were in equilibrium. We then present a precise correspondence between dispersive effects found in de Sitter and in black hole metrics. This indicates that the consequences of dispersion on thermodynamical laws could also be similar.
