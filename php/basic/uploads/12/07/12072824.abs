Title: Lie Superalgebras arising from bosonic representation
Authors: Naihuan Jing and Chongbin Xu
Abstract: A 2-toroidal Lie superalgebra is constructed using bosonic fields and a ghost field. The superalgebra contains $osp(1|2n)^{(1)}$ as a distinguished subalgebra and behaves similarly to the toroidal Lie superalgebra of type $B(0, n)$. Furthermore this algebra is a central extension of the algebra $osp(1|2n)\otimes \mathbb C[s, s^{-1}, t,t^{-1}]$.
