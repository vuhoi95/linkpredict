Title: Rigid Supersymmetric Backgrounds of Minimal Off-Shell Supergravity
Authors: James T. Liu and Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas and Dori Reichmann
Abstract: We discuss various aspects of rigid supersymmetry within minimal N=1 off-shell supergravity using the old and new minimal formulations both in Lorentzian and Euclidean signatures. In particular, we construct all rigid supersymmetry backgrounds with a hypersurface orthogonal Killing vector. In the Lorentzian signature we show that AdS_4 provides a rigid supersymmetric background in both formulations albeit with different amounts of preserved supersymmetry. In the Euclidean signature we find new backgrounds of the old-minimal supergravity, including squashed four-spheres and a half-BPS version of flat space.
