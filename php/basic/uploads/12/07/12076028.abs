Title: Spherically symmetric gravity coupled to a scalar field with a local  Hamiltonian: the complete initial-boundary value problem using metric  variables
Authors: Rodolfo Gambini and Jorge Pullin
Abstract: We discuss a gauge fixing of gravity coupled to a scalar field in spherical symmetry such that the Hamiltonian is an integral over space of a local density. In a previous paper we had presented it using Ashtekar's new variables. Here we study it in metric variables. We specify completely the initial-boundary value problem for ingoing Gaussian pulses.
