Abstract: A new set of projection operators for three-dimensional models are constructed. Using these operators, an uncomplicated and easily handling algorithm for analysing the unitarity of the aforementioned systems is built up. Interestingly enough, this method converts the task of probing the unitarity of a given 3D system, that is in general a time-consuming work, into a straightforward algebraic exercise; besides, it also greatly clarifies the physical interpretation of the propagating modes. In order to test the efficacy and quickness of the algorithm at hand, the unitarity of some important and timely higher-order electromagnetic (gravitational) systems augmented by both Chern-Simons and higher order Chern-Simons terms are investigated.
