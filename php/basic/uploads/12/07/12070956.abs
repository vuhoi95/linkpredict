Authors: S. Belliard and S. Pakuliak and E. Ragoucy and N. A. Slavnov
Abstract: We study SU(3)-invariant integrable models solvable by nested algebraic Bethe ansatz. We obtain a determinant representation for particular case of scalar products of Bethe vectors. This representation can be used for the calculation of form factors and correlation functions of XXX SU(3)-invariant Heisenberg chain.
