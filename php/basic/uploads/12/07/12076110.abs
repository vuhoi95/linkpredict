Title: A Lorentz invariant doubled worldsheet theory
Authors: Stefan Groot Nibbelink and Peter Patalong
Abstract: We propose a Lorentz invariant version of Tseytlin's doubled worldsheet theory that makes T-duality covariance of the string manifest. This theory can be derived as a gauge fixed version of Buscher's gauging procedure, in which the left-over gauge field component acts as a Lagrange multiplier. This description can naturally account for fractional linear O(D,D) transformations of the metric and b-field. It is capable of describing non-geometric backgrounds; geometric and non-geometric fluxes are encoded in the doubled anti-symmetric tensor field strength.
