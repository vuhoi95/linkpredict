Title: A new three-loop sum-integral of mass dimension two
Authors: I. Ghisoiu and Y. Schroder
Abstract: We evaluate a new 3-loop sum-integral which contributes to the Debye screening mass in hot QCD. While we manage to derive all divergences analytically, its finite part is mapped onto simple integrals and evaluated numerically.
