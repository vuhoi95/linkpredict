Title: Consistent bilinear Wess-Zumino term for open AdS superstring
Authors: Ee Chang-Young and Hiroaki Nakajima and Hyeonjoon Shin
Abstract: We consider the open superstring action in AdS_5 x S^5 background with the bilinear Wess-Zumino term, which has been modified in such a way that a certain total derivative term is absent, and give the covariant description of supersymmetric D-branes. We show that the modification of bilinear Wess-Zumino term is necessary to describe correctly the 1/2-BPS D(-1)-brane in AdS_5 x S^5 background, while the classification of other supersymmetric D-branes does not depend on such modification.
