Title: Super Poisson-Lie symmetry of the GL(1|1) WZNW model and worldsheet  boundary conditions
Authors: A. Eghbali and A. Rezaei-Aghdam
Abstract: We show that the WZNW model on the Lie supergroup GL(1|1) has super Poisson-Lie symmetry with the dual Lie supergroup B + A + A1;1|.i. Then, we discuss about D-branes and worldsheet boundary conditions on supermanifolds, in general, and obtain the algebraic relations on the gluing supermatrix for the Lie supergroup case. Finally, using the supercanonical transformation description of the super Poisson-Lie T-duality transformation, we obtain formula for the description of the dual gluing supermatrix, then, we find the gluing supermatrix for the WZNW model on GL(1|1) and its dual model. We also discuss about different boundary conditions.
