Title: IBP methods at finite temperature
Authors: M. Nishimura and Y. Schroder
Abstract: We demonstrate the applicability of integration-by-parts (IBP) identities in finite-temperature field theory. As a concrete example, we perform 3-loop computations for the thermodynamic pressure of QCD in general covariant gauges, and confirm earlier Feynman-gauge results.
