Title: A word Hopf algebra based on the selection/quotient principle
Authors: G. H. E. Duchamp and N. Hoang-Nghia and A. Tanasa
Abstract: In this paper, we define a Hopf algebra structure on the vector space spanned by packed words using a selection/quotient coproduct. We show that this algebra is free on its irreducible packed words. We also construct the Hilbert series of this Hopf algebra and we investigate its primitive elements.
