Title: Some classes of renormalizable tensor models
Authors: Joseph Ben Geloun and Etera R. Livine
Abstract: We identify new families of renormalizable of tensor models from anterior renormalizable tensor models via a mapping capable of reducing or increasing the rank of the theory without having an effect on the renormalizability property. Mainly, a version of the rank 3 tensor model as defined in [arXiv:1201.0176 [hep-th]], the Grosse-Wulkenhaar model in 4D and 2D generate three different classes of renormalizable models. The proof of the renormalizability is fully performed for the first reduced model. The same procedure can be applied for the remaining cases. Interestingly, we find that, due to the peculiar behavior of anisotropic wave function renormalizations, the rank 3 tensor model reduced to a matrix model generates a simple super-renormalizable vector model.
