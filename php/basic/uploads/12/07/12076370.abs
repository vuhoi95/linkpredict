Title: A no-go theorem for slowly rotating black holes in Horava-Lifshitz  gravity
Authors: Enrico Barausse and Thomas P. Sotiriou
Abstract: We consider slowly rotating, stationary, axisymmetric black holes in the infrared limit of Horava-Lifshitz gravity. We show that such solutions do not exist, provided that they are regular everywhere apart from the central singularity. This has profound implications for the viability of the theory, considering the astrophysical evidence for the existence of black holes with non-zero spin. NOTE ADDED: A subtlety in the dynamical equivalence between Horava-Lifshitz gravity and Einstein-aether theory has been missed and this has seriously affected the conclusions of this paper.
