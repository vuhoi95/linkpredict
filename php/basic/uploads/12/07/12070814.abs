Abstract: The standard extremal p-brane solutions in supergravity are known to allow for a generalisation which consists of adding a linear dependence on the world-volume coordinates to the usual harmonic function. In this note we demonstrate that remarkably this generalisation goes through in exactly the same way for p-branes with fluxes added to it that correspond to fractional p-branes. We relate this to warped orientifold compactifications by trading the Dp-branes for Op-planes that solve the RR tadpole condition. This allows us to interpret the worldvolume dependence as due to lower-dimensional scalars that flow along the massless directions in the no-scale potential. Depending on the details of the fluxes these flows can be supersymmetric domain wall flows. Our solutions provide explicit examples of backreacted orientifold planes in compactifications with non-constant moduli.
