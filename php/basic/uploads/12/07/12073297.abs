Title: Squeezed coherent states for noncommutative spaces with minimal length  uncertainty relations
Authors: Sanjib Dey and Andreas Fring
Abstract: We provide an explicit construction for Gazeau-Klauder coherent states related to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with discrete bounded below and nondegenerate eigenspectrum. The underlying spacetime structure is taken to be of a noncommutative type with associated uncertainty relations implying minimal lengths. The uncertainty relations for the constructed states are shown to be saturated in a Hermitian as well as a non-Hermitian setting for a perturbed harmonic oscillator. The computed value of the Mandel parameter dictates that the coherent wavepackets are assembled according to sub-Poissonian statistics. Fractional revival times, indicating the superposition of classical-like sub-wave packets are clearly identified.
