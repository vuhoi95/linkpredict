Title: Multi-indexed Wilson and Askey-Wilson Polynomials
Authors: Satoru Odake and Ryu Sasaki
Abstract: As the third stage of the project multi-indexed orthogonal polynomials, we present, in the framework of 'discrete quantum mechanics' with pure imaginary shifts in one dimension, the multi-indexed Wilson and Askey-Wilson polynomials. They are obtained from the original Wilson and Askey-Wilson polynomials by multiple application of the discrete analogue of the Darboux transformations or the Crum-Krein-Adler deletion of 'virtual state solutions' of type I and II, in a similar way to the multi-indexed Laguerre, Jacobi and (q-)Racah polynomials reported earlier.
