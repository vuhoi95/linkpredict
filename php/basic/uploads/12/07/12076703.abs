Title: Consistent reduction of charged D3-D7 systems
Authors: Aldo L. Cotrone and Javier Tarrio
Abstract: We provide a consistent reduction to five dimensions of the system of D3-branes at Calabi-Yau singularities coupled to D7-branes with world-volume gauge flux. The D3-branes source the dual to would-be conformal quiver theories. The D7-branes, which are homogeneously distributed in their transverse directions, are dual to massless matter in the fundamental representation at finite (baryon) density. We provide the five-dimensional action and equations of motion, and discuss a few sub-truncations. The reduction can be used in the study of transport properties and stability of D3-D7 charged systems.
