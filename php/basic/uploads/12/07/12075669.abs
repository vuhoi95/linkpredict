Title: Poincar√© Invariant Quantum Field Theories With Twisted Internal  Symmetries
Authors: Rahul Srivastava and Sachindeo Vaidya
Abstract: Following up the work of [1] on deformed algebras, we present a class of Poincar\'e invariant quantum field theories with particles having deformed internal symmetries. The twisted quantum fields discussed in this work satisfy commutation relations different from the usual bosonic/fermionic commutation relations. Such twisted fields by construction are nonlocal in nature. Despite this nonlocality we show that it is possible to construct local interaction Hamiltonians which satisfy cluster decomposition principle and are Lorentz invariant. We further illustrate these ideas by considering global SU(N) symmetries. Specifically we show that twisted internal symmetries can significantly simplify the discussion of the marginal deformations (\beta-deformations) of the N=4 SUSY theories.
