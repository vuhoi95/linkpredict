Title: A quantum oscillator model for entropic gravity
Authors: Towe Wang and Yi-Wei Wu and Jian Zhao
Abstract: In Verlinde's theory of entropic gravity, the internal degrees of freedom are marked by "bits", but the microscopic origin of "bits" is unknown hitherto. To this direction, we adopt the quantum harmonic oscillators to naively model the internal degrees of freedom. In this model, the equipartition relation is modified at the low temperature. The Newton's law and Poisson's equation of gravity are reproduced at small distances, but they receive appreciable corrections at large distances. Geometrization of gravity for this model is explored, resulting in modifications to Einstein equations.
