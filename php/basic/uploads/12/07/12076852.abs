Title: Interacting universes and the cosmological constant
Authors: A. Alonso-Serrano and C. Bastos and O. Bertolami and S. Robles-Perez
Abstract: We study some collective phenomena that may happen in a multiverse scenario. First, it is posed an interaction scheme between universes whose evolution is dominated by a cosmological constant. As a result of the interaction, the value of the cosmological constant of one of the universes becomes very close to zero at the expense of an increasing value of the cosmological constant of the partner universe. Second, we found normal modes for a 'chain' of interacting universes. The energy spectrum of the multiverse, being this taken as a collective system, splits into a large number of levels, some of which correspond to a value of the cosmological constant very close to zero. We finally point out that the multiverse may be much more than the mere sum of its parts.
