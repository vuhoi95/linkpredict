Title: Non-perturbative QCD amplitudes in quenched and eikonal approximations
Authors: H. M. Fried and T. Grandou and Y. -M. Sheu
Abstract: Even though approximated, strong coupling non-perturbative QCD amplitudes remain very difficult to obtain. In this article, in eikonal and quenched approximations, physical insights are presented that rely on the newly-discovered property of Effective Locality.
