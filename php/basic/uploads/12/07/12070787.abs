Title: Conformal field theory of Painlev√© VI
Authors: O. Gamayun and N. Iorgov and O. Lisovyy
Abstract: Generic Painlev\'e VI tau function \tau(t) can be interpreted as four-point correlator of primary fields of arbitrary dimensions in 2D CFT with c=1. Using AGT combinatorial representation of conformal blocks and determining the corresponding structure constants, we obtain full and completely explicit expansion of \tau(t) near the singular points. After a check of this expansion, we discuss examples of conformal blocks arising from Riccati, Picard, Chazy and algebraic solutions of Painlev\'e VI.
