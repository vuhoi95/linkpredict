Title: Half--Hypers and Quivers
Authors: Sergio Cecotti and Michele Del Zotto
Abstract: We study systematically the BPS spectra of N=2 SYM coupled to half--hypermultiplets, the basic example being E_7 SYM coupled to a half--hyper in the 56 irrepr. In order to do this, we determine the BPS quivers with superpotential of such N=2 models using a new technique we introduce. The computation of the BPS spectra in the various chambers is then reduced to the Representation Theory of the resulting quivers. We use the quiver description to study the BPS spectrum at both strong and weak coupling. The following models are discussed in detail: SU(6) SYM coupled to a half 20, SO(12) SYM coupled to a half 32, and E_7 SYM coupled to a half 56. For models with gauge group SU(2) x SO(2n) and matter in the half (2,2n) we find strongly coupled chambers with a BPS spectrum consisting of just finitely many hypermultiplets.
