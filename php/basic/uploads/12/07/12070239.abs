Title: Classical and quantum Lagrangian field theories with boundary
Authors: Alberto S. Cattaneo and Pavel Mnev and Nicolai Reshetikhin
Abstract: This note gives an introduction to Lagrangian field theories in the presence of boundaries. After an overview of the classical aspects, the cohomological formalisms to resolve singularities in the bulk and in the boundary theories (the BV and the BFV formalisms, respectively) are recalled. One of the goals here (and in [arXiv:1201.0290]) is to show how the latter two formalisms can be put together in a consistent way, also in view of perturbative quantization.
