Title: Production of Prompt Photons: Holographic Duality and Thermalization
Authors: Rudolf Baier and Stefan A. Stricker and Olli Taanila and Aleksi Vuorinen
Abstract: We study the production of prompt photons in strongly coupled out-of-equilibrium Super Yang-Mills plasma using the AdS/CFT correspondence. Our goal is to determine the photon emission spectrum at different stages of a thermalization process, which is modeled via the gravitational collapse of a thin spherical shell in AdS$_5$ space. Particular emphasis is placed on the limit of large frequencies, which we are able to treat analytically.
