Title: Braneworld non-minimal inflation with induced gravity
Authors: Kourosh Nozari and Narges Rashidi
Abstract: We study cosmological inflation on a warped DGP braneworld where inflaton field is non-minimally coupled to induced gravity on the brane. We present a detailed calculation of the perturbations and inflation parameters both in Jordan and Einstein frame. We analyze the parameters space of the model fully to justify about the viability of the model in confrontation with recent observational data. We compare the results obtained in these two frames also in order to judge which frame gives more acceptable results in comparison with observational data.
