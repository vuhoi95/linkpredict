Title: Non-Gaussianities in multi-field DBI inflation with a waterfall phase  transition

Abstract: We study multi-field DBI inflation models with a waterfall phase transition. This transition happens for a D3 brane moving in the warped conifold if there is an instability along angular directions. The transition converts the angular perturbations into the curvature perturbation. Thanks to this conversion, multi-field models can evade the stringent constraints that strongly disfavour single field ultra-violet DBI inflation models in string theory. We explicitly demonstrate that our model satisfies current observational constraints on the spectral index and equilateral non-Gaussianity as well as the bound on the tensor to scalar ratio imposed in string theory models. In addition we show that large local type non-Gaussianity is generated together with equilateral non-Gaussianity in this model.
