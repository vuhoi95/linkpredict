Title: Correlators of Wilson loops and local operators from multi-matrix models  and strings in AdS
Authors: Simone Giombi and Vasily Pestun
Abstract: We study correlation functions of Wilson loops and local operators in a subsector of N=4 SYM which preserves two supercharges. Localization arguments allow to map the problem to a calculation in bosonic two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory. In turn, this can be reduced to computing correlators in certain Gaussian multi-matrix models. We focus on the correlation function of a Wilson loop and two local operators, and solve the corresponding three-matrix model exactly in the planar limit. We compare the strong coupling behavior to string theory in AdS_5xS^5, finding precise agreement. We pay particular attention to the case in which the local operators have large R-charge J \sim sqrt{lambda} at strong coupling.
