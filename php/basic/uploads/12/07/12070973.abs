Title: A Hilbert manifold structure on the refined Teichmueller space of  bordered Riemann surfaces
Authors: David Radnell and Eric Schippers and Wolfgang Staubach
Abstract: We consider bordered Riemann surfaces which are biholomorphic to compact Riemann surfaces of genus g with n regions biholomorphic to the disc removed. We define a refined Teichmueller space of such Riemann surfaces and demonstrate that in the case that 2g+2-n>0, this refined Teichmueller space is a Hilbert manifold. The inclusion map from the refined Teichmueller space into the usual Teichmueller space (which is a Banach manifold) is holomorphic. We also show that the rigged moduli space of Riemann surfaces with non-overlapping holomorphic maps, appearing in conformal field theory, is a complex Hilbert manifold. This result requires an analytic reformulation of the moduli space, by enlarging the set of non-overlapping mappings to a class of maps intermediate between analytically extendible maps and quasiconformally extendible maps. Finally we show that the rigged moduli space is the quotient of the refined Teichmueller space by a properly discontinuous group of biholomorphisms.
