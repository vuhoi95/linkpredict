Title: Chiral Kinetic Theory
Authors: M. A. Stephanov and Y. Yin
Abstract: We derive the non-equilibrium kinetic equation describing the motion of chiral massless particles in the regime where it can be considered classically. We show that the Berry monopole which appears at the origin of the momentum space due to level crossing is responsible for the chiral magnetic and vortical effects.
