Title: Construction of asymptotic fields for a charged particle
Authors: O. W. Greenberg and Steve Cowen
Abstract: Asymptotic fields do not exist in theories with massless particles and fields, because the vacuum matrix elements of products of the interacting fields in such theories do not have delta function or principal value singularities in momentum space. We remedy this problem by constructing a field for the charged particle that does have the required singularities in momentum space. We illustrate this construction in quantum electrodynamics (QED).
