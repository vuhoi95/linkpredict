Title: Translation-Invariant Renormalizable Noncommutative Chern-Simons Theory
Authors: Kaddour Chelabi and Manfred Schweda and Smain Kouadik
Abstract: In this paper we show the renormalizability of the translation invariant noncommutative Chern-Simons theory, motivated by the work done on noncommutative scalar field theory [06]. We add a new term to the bilinear part of the action. In addition, we prove, the finiteness of the theory at one- and two-loop level despite this modification. Finally we perform the one-loop two point functions of the gluon contribution.
