Title: Consequences of moduli stabilization in the Einstein-Maxwell landscape
Authors: Cesar Asensio and Antonio Segui
Abstract: A toy landscape sector is introduced as a compactification of the Einstein-Maxwell model on a product of two-spheres. Features of the model include: moduli stabilization, a distribution of the effective cosmological constant of the dimensionally reduced 1+1 spacetime, which is different from the analogous distribution of the Bousso-Polchinski landscape, and the absence of the so-called "alpha-star"-problem. This problem arises when the Kachru-Kallosh-Linde-Trivedi stabilization mechanism is naively applied to the states of the Bousso-Polchinski landscape. The model also contains anthropic states, which can be readily constructed without needing any fine-tuning.
