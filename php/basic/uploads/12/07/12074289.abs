Title: Parity Symmetry and Soft Limit for the Cachazo-Geyer Gravity Amplitude
Authors: Brenda Penante and Sayeh Rajabi and Grigory Sizov
Abstract: In this note, we prove that the recent proposal for the tree-level n-particle N=8 supergravity amplitudes by Cachazo and Geyer satisfies parity symmetry and soft limit behavior expected for graviton scattering amplitudes.
