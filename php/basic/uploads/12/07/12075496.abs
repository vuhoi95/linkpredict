Title: Visualizing Spacetime Curvature via Gradient Flows II: An Example of the  Construction of a Newtonian analogue
Authors: Majd Abdelqader and Kayll Lake
Abstract: This is the first in a series of papers in which the gradient flows of fundamental curvature invariants are used to formulate a visualization of curvature. We start with the construction of strict Newtonian analogues (not limits) of solutions to Einstein's equations based on the topology of the associated gradient flows. We do not start with any easy case. Rather, we start with the Curzon - Chazy solution, which, as history shows, is one of the most difficult exact solutions to Einstein's equations to interpret physically. We show that the entire field of the Curzon - Chazy solution, up to a region very "close" to the the intrinsic singularity, strictly represents that of a Newtonian ring, as has long been suspected. In this regard, we consider our approach very successful. As regrades the local structure of the singularity of the Curzon - Chazy solution within a fully general relativistic analysis, however, whereas we make some advances, the full structure of this singularity remains incompletely resolved.
