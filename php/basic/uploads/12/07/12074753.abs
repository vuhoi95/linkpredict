Title: Semichiral Sigma Models with 4D Hyperkaehler Geometry
Authors: Malin Göteman and Ulf Lindström and Martin Rocek
Abstract: Semichiral sigma models with a four-dimensional target space do not support extended N=(4,4) supersymmetries off-shell arXiv:0903.2376, arXiv:0912.4724. We contribute towards the understanding of the non-manifest on-shell transformations in (2,2) superspace by analyzing the extended on-shell supersymmetry of such models and find that a rather general ansatz for the additional supersymmetry (not involving central charge transformations) leads to hyperk\"ahler geometry. We give non-trivial examples of these models.
