Title: A Note on Genericity and Stability of Black Holes and Naked  Singularities in Dust Collapse
Authors: Ravindra V. Saraykar and Pankaj S. Joshi
Abstract: We comment here on the results in Ref [4] that showed naked singularities in dynamical gravitational collapse of inhomogeneous dust to be stable but non-generic. The definition of genericity used there is reconsidered. We point out that genericity in terms of an open set, with a positive measure defined suitably on the space of initial data, is physically more appropriate compared to the dynamical systems theory definition used in [4] which makes both black holes and naked singularities non-generic as collapse outcomes.
