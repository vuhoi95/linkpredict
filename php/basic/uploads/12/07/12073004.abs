Title: N=2 vacua in Generalized Geometry
Authors: Mariana Gra√±a and Francesco Orsi
Abstract: We find the conditions on compactifications of type IIA to four-dimensional Minkowski space to preserve N=2 supersymmetry in the language of Exceptional Generalized Geometry (EGG) and Generalized Complex Geometry (GCG). In EGG, off-shell N =2 supersymmetry requires the existence of a pair of SU(2)_R singlet and triplet algebraic structures on the exceptional generalized tangent space that encode all the scalars (NS-NS and R-R) in vector and hypermultiplets respectively. We show that on shell N=2 requires, except for a single component, these structures to be closed under a derivative twisted by the NS-NS and R-R fluxes. We also derive the corresponding GCG-type equations for the two pairs of pure spinors that build up these structures.
