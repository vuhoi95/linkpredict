Title: Gravity from Rational Curves
Authors: Freddy Cachazo and David Skinner
Abstract: This paper presents a new formula which is conjectured to yield all tree amplitudes in N=8 supergravity. The amplitudes are described in terms of higher degree rational maps to twistor space. The resulting expression has manifest N=8 supersymmetry and is manifestly permutation symmetric in all external states. It depends monomially on the infinity twistor that explicitly breaks conformal symmetry to Poincare. The formula has been explicitly checked to yield the correct amplitudes for the 3-point MHV-bar and for the n-point MHV, where it reduces to an expression of Hodges. We have also carried out numerical checks of the formula at NMHV and NNMHV level, for up to eight external states.
