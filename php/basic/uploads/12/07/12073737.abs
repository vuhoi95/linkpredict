Title: Simulating Symmetric Time Evolution With Local Operations
Authors: Borzu Toloui and Gilad Gour
Abstract: In closed systems, dynamical symmetries lead to conservation laws. However, conservation laws are not applicable to open systems that undergo irreversible transformations. More general selection rules are needed to determine whether, given two states, the transition from one state to the other is possible. The usual approach to the problem of finding such rules relies heavily on group theory and involves a detailed study of the structure of the respective symmetry group. We approach the problem in a completely new way by using entanglement to investigate the asymmetry properties of quantum states. To this end, we embed the space state of the system in a tensor product Hilbert space, whereby symmetric transformations between two states are replaced with local operations on their bipartite images.The embedding enables us to use the well-studied theory of entanglement to investigate the consequences of dynamic symmetries. Moreover, under reversible transformations, the entanglement of the bipartite image states becomes a conserved quantity. These entanglement-based conserved quantities are new and different from the conserved quantities based on expectation values of the Hamiltonian symmetry generators. Our method is not group-specific and applies to general symmetries associated with any semi-simple Lie group.
