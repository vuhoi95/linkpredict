Title: Perturbations and non-Gaussianities in three-form inflationary  magnetogenesis
Authors: Federico R. Urban and Tomi K. Koivisto
Abstract: We reconsider magnetogenesis in the context of three-form inflation, and its backreaction. In particular, we focus on first order perturbation theory during inflation and subsequent radiation era: we discuss the consistency of the perturbative approach, and elaborate on the possible non-Gaussian signatures of the model.
