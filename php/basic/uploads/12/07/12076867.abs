Title: Massive modes in magnetized brane models
Authors: Yuta Hamada and Tatsuo Kobayashi
Abstract: We study higher dimensional models with magnetic fluxes, which can be derived from superstring theory. We study mass spectrum and wavefunctions of massless and massive modes for spinor, scalar and vector fields. We compute the 3-point couplings and higher order couplings among massless modes and massive modes in 4D low-energy effective field theory. These couplings have non-trivial behaviors, because wavefunctions of massless and massive modes are non-trivial.
