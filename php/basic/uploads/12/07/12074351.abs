Title: Noncolliding Brownian Motion with Drift and Time-Dependent  Stieltjes-Wigert Determinantal Point Process
Authors: Yuta Takahashi and Makoto Katori
Abstract: Using the determinantal formula of Biane, Bougerol, and O'Connell, we give multitime joint probability densities to the noncolliding Brownian motion with drift, where the number of particles is finite. We study a special case such that the initial positions of particles are equidistant with a period $a$ and the values of drift coefficients are well-ordered with a scale $\sigma$. We show that, at each time $t >0$, the single-time probability density of particle system is exactly transformed to the biorthogonal Stieltjes-Wigert matrix model in the Chern-Simons theory introduced by Dolivet and Tierz. Here one-parameter extensions ($\theta$-extensions) of the Stieltjes-Wigert polynomials, which are themselves $q$-extensions of the Hermite polynomials, play an essential role. The two parameters $a$ and $\sigma$ of the process combined with time $t$ are mapped to the parameters $q$ and $\theta$ of the biorthogonal polynomials. By the transformation of normalization factor of our probability density, the partition function of the Chern-Simons matrix model is readily obtained. We study the determinantal structure of the matrix model and prove that, at each time $t >0$, the present noncolliding Brownian motion with drift is a determinantal point process, in the sense that any correlation function is given by a determinant governed by a single integral kernel called the correlation kernel. Using the obtained correlation kernel, we study time evolution of the noncolliding Brownian motion with drift.
