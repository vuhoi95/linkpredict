Title: Comment on "Creation of spin 1/2 particles by an electric field in de  Sitter space"
Authors: S. Haouat and R. Chekireb
Abstract: The main objective of this comment is to correct the density number of created fermions by an electric field in the (1+1) dimensional de-Sitter space-time communicated by V. M. Villalba in Phys. Rev. D 52, 3742 (1995). It is shown how the positive and negative energy solutions are connected to one another by the charge conjugation. Some concluding remarks are made.
