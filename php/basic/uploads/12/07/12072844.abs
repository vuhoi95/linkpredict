Title: Higher spin gravity in 3D: black holes, global charges and  thermodynamics
Authors: Alfredo Perez and David Tempo and Ricardo Troncoso
Abstract: Global charges and thermodynamic properties of three-dimensional higher spin black holes that have been recently found in the literature are revisited. Since these solutions possess a relaxed asymptotically AdS behavior, following the canonical approach, it is shown that the global charges, and in particular the mass, acquire explicit nontrivial contributions given by nonlinear terms in the deviations with respect to the reference background. It is also found that there are cases for which the first law of thermodynamics is fulfilled in the canonical ensemble, i.e., without work terms associated to the presence of higher spin fields, and remarkably, the semiclassical higher spin black hole entropy is exactly reproduced from Cardy formula.
