Title: Large Gauge Transformations in Double Field Theory
Authors: Olaf Hohm and Barton Zwiebach
Abstract: Finite gauge transformations in double field theory can be defined by the exponential of generalized Lie derivatives. We interpret these transformations as `generalized coordinate transformations' in the doubled space by proposing and testing a formula that writes large transformations in terms of derivatives of the coordinate maps. Successive generalized coordinate transformations give a generalized coordinate transformation that differs from the direct composition of the original two. Instead, it is constructed using the Courant bracket. These transformations form a group when acting on fields but, intriguingly, do not associate when acting on coordinates.
