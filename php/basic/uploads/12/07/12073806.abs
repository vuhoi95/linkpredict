Title: Large N Limit of N=2 SU(N) Gauge Theories from Localization
Authors: J. G. Russo and K. Zarembo
Abstract: We study N=2 Yang-Mills theory on S^4 in the large-N limit. We find that on a large sphere Wilson loops obey a perimeter law and that the free energy grows quadratically with the radius of the sphere. We also comment on the large-N limit of the N=2* theory, and on the free energy in N=2 and N=4 superconformal theories.
