Title: Virasoro constraint for Nekrasov instanton partition function
Authors: Shoichi Kanno and Yutaka Matsuo and Hong Zhang
Abstract: We show that Nekrasov instanton partition function for SU(N) gauge theories satisfies recursion relations in the form of U(1)+Virasoro constraints when {\beta} = 1. The constraints give a direct support for AGT conjecture for general quiver gauge theories.
