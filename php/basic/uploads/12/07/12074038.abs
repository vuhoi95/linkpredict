Title: Regularizing cosmological singularities by varying physical constants
Authors: Mariusz P. Dabrowski and Konrad Marosek
Abstract: Varying physical constant cosmologies were claimed to solve standard cosmological problems such as the horizon, the flatness and the $\Lambda$-problem. In this paper, we suggest yet another possible application of these theories: solving the singularity problem. By specifying some examples we show that various cosmological singularities may be regularized provided the physical constants evolve in time in an appropriate way.
