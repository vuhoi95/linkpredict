Title: Kink fluctuation asymptotics and zero modes
Authors: Alberto Alonso-Izquierdo and Juan Mateos-Guilarte
Abstract: In this paper we propose a refinement of the heat kernel/zeta function treatment of kink quantum fluctuations in scalar field theory, further analyzing the existence and implications of a zero energy fluctuation mode. Improved understanding of the interplay between zero modes and the kink heat kernel expansion delivers asymptotic estimations of one-loop kink mass shifts with remarkably higher precision than previously obtained by means of the standard Gilkey-DeWitt heat kernel expansion.
