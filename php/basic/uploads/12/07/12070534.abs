Title: One-loop divergences in the Galileon model
Authors: Tiberio de Paula Netto and Ilya L. Shapiro
Abstract: The investigation of UV divergences is a relevant step in better understanding of a new theory. In this work the one-loop divergences in the free field sector are obtained for the popular Galileons model. The calculations are performed by the generalized Schwinger-DeWitt technique and also by means of Feynman diagrams. The first method can be directly generalized to curved space, but here we deal only with the flat-space limit. We show that the UV completion of the theory includes the $\pi \Box^4\pi$ term. According to our previous analysis in the case of quantum gravity, this means that the theory can be modified to become superrenormalizable, but then its physical spectrum includes two massive ghosts and one massive scalar with positive kinetic energy. The effective approach in this theory can be perfectly successful, exactly as in the higher derivative quantum gravity, and in this case the non-renormalization theorem for Galileons remains valid in the low-energy region.
