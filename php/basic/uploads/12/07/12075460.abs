Title: Properties of the corolla polynomial of a 3-regular graph
Authors: Dirk Kreimer and Karen Yeats
Abstract: We investigate combinatorial properties of a graph polynomial indexed by half-edges of a graph which was introduced recently to understand the connection between Feynman rules for scalar field theory and Feynman rules for gauge theory. We investigate the new graph polynomial as a stand-alone object.
