Title: String-Net Models with $Z_N$ Fusion Algebra
Authors: Ling-Yan Hung and Yidun Wan
Abstract: We study the Levin-Wen string-net model with a $Z_N$ type fusion algebra. Solutions of the local constraints of this model correspond to $Z_N$ gauge theory and double Chern-simons theories with quantum groups. For the first time, we explicitly construct a spin-$(N-1)/2$ model with $Z_N$ gauge symmetry on a triangular lattice as an exact dual model of the string-net model with a $Z_N$ type fusion algebra on a honeycomb lattice. This exact duality exists only when the spins are coupled to a $Z_N$ gauge field living on the links of the triangular lattice. The ungauged $Z_N$ lattice spin models are a class of quantum systems that bear symmetry-protected topological phases that may be classified by the third cohomology group $H^3(Z_N,U(1))$ of $Z_N$. Our results apply also to any case where the fusion algebra is identified with a finite group algebra or a quantusm group algebra.
