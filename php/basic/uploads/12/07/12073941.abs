Title: Hard Thermal Loops in the n-Dimensional phi3 Theory
Authors: F. T. Brandt and J. Frenkel
Abstract: We derive a closed-form result for the leading thermal contributions which appear in the n-dimensional phi3 theory at high temperature. These contributions become local only in the long wavelength and in the static limits, being given by different expressions in these two limits.
