Title: Singularity Avoidance of Charged Black Holes in Loop Quantum Gravity
Authors: Mojtaba Taslimi Tehrani and Hoshang Heydari
Abstract: Based on spherically symmetric reduction of loop quantum gravity, quantization of the portion interior to the horizon of a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole is studied. Classical phase space variables of all regions of such a black hole are calculated for the physical case $M^2> Q^2$. This calculation suggests a candidate for a classically unbounded function of which all divergent components of the curvature scalar are composed. The corresponding quantum operator is constructed and is shown explicitly to possess a bounded operator. Comparison of the obtained result with the one for the Swcharzschild case shows that the upper bound of the curvature operator of a charged black hole reduces to that of Schwarzschild at the limit $Q \rightarrow 0$. This local avoidance of singularity together with non-singular evolution equation indicates the role quantum geometry can play in treating classical singularity of such black holes.
