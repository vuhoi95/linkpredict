Title: Recurrence relations for toric N=1 superconformal blocks
Authors: Leszek Hadasz and Zbigniew Jaskolski and Paulina Suchanek
Abstract: General 1-point toric blocks in all sectors of N=1 superconformal field theories are analyzed. The recurrence relations for blocks coefficients are derived by calculating their residues and large $\Delta$ asymptotics.
