Title: Noncommutative wormholes and the energy conditions
Authors: Everton M. C. Abreu and NÃ©lio Sasaki
Abstract: It is a very well known fact that the energy conditions concerning Lorentzian wormhole (WH) solutions of Einstein equations are violated. Consequently, attempts to avoid the violation of the energy conditions constitutes one of the main areas of research in WH physics. On the other hand, the current literature show us that noncommutativity is one of the candidates to understand the physics of the early Universe. In this letter we show that the null and weak energy conditions violations do not happen when the WH background geometry is a noncommutative one. We also construct the shape function and an equation of state for this noncommutative WH.
