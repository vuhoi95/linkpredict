Title: Understanding Hawking radiation from simple models of atomic  Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: R. Balbinot and I. Carusotto and A. Fabbri and C. Mayoral and A. Recati
Abstract: This chapter is an introduction to the Bogoliubov theory of dilute Bose condensates as applied to the study of the spontaneous emission of phonons in a stationary condensate flowing at supersonic speeds. This emission process is a condensed-matter analog of Hawking radiation from astrophysical black holes but is derived here from a microscopic quantum theory of the condensate without any use of the analogy with gravitational systems. To facilitate physical understanding of the basic concepts, a simple one-dimensional geometry with a stepwise homogenous flow is considered which allows for a fully analytical treatment.
