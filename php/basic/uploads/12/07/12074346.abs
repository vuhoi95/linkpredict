Title: Noncommutative gravity at second order via Seiberg-Witten map
Authors: Paolo Aschieri and Leonardo Castellani and Marija Dimitrijevic
Abstract: We develop a general strategy to express noncommutative actions in terms of commutative ones by using a recently developed geometric generalization of the Seiberg-Witten map (SW map) between noncommutative and commutative fields. We apply this general scheme to the noncommutative vierbein gravity action and provide a SW differential equation for the action itself as well as a recursive solution at all orders in the noncommutativity parameter \theta. We thus express the action at order \theta^n+2 in terms of noncommutative fields of order at most \theta^n+1 and, iterating the procedure, in terms of noncommutative fields of order at most \theta^n. This in particular provides the explicit expression of the action at order \theta^2 in terms of the usual commutative spin connection and vierbein fields. The result is an extended gravity action on commutative spacetime that is manifestly invariant under local Lorentz rotations and general coordinate transformations.
