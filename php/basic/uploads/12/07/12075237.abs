Title: Cyclically deformed defects and topological mass constraints
Authors: Alex E. Bernardini and Roldao da Rocha
Abstract: A systematic procedure for obtaining defect structures through cyclic deformation chains is introduced and explored in detail. The procedure outlines a set of rules for analytically constructing constraint equations that involve the finite localized energy of cyclically generated defects. The idea of obtaining cyclically deformed defects concerns the possibility of regenerating a primitive (departing) defect structure through successive, unidirectional, and eventually irreversible, deformation processes. Our technique is applied on kink-like and lump-like solutions in models described by a single real scalar field, such that extensions to quantum mechanics follow the usual theory of deformed defects. The preliminary results show that the cyclic device supports simultaneously kink-like and lump-like defects into 3- and 4-cyclic deformation chains with topological mass values closed by trigonometric and hyperbolic deformations. In a straightforward generalization, results concerning with the analytical calculation of $N$-cyclic deformations are obtained and lessons regarding extensions from more elaborated primitive defects are depicted.
