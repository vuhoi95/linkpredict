Title: Effective action for fermions with anomalous magnetic moment from  Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation
Authors: A. Barducci and R. Giachetti
Abstract: In this paper we calculate the effective action for neutral particles with anomalous magnetic moment in an external magnetic and electric field. We show that we can take advantage from the Foldy Wouthuysen transformation for such systems, determined in our previous works: indeed, by this transformation we have explicitly evaluated the diagonalized Hamiltonian, allowing to present a closed form for the corresponding effective action and for the partition function at finite temperature from which the thermodynamical potentials can be calculated.
