Title: Solving the Noether procedure for cubic interactions of higher spins in  (A)dS
Authors: Euihun Joung and Luca Lopez and Massimo Taronna
Abstract: The Noether procedure represents a perturbative scheme to construct all possible consistent interactions starting from a given free theory. In this note we describe how cubic interactions involving higher spins in any constant-curvature background can be systematically derived within this framework.
