Title: A simple E8 construction
Authors: S. L. Cacciatori and F. Dalla Piazza and A. Scotti
Abstract: In this short letter we conclude our program, started in [J. Math. Phys. 46 (2005) 083512], of building up explicit generalized Euler angle parameterizations for all exceptional compact Lie groups. In this last step we solve the problem for E8.
