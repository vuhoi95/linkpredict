Title: Rational Calogero-Moser Model: Explicit Form and r-Matrix of the Second  Poisson Structure
Authors: Jean Avan and Eric Ragoucy
Abstract: We compute the full expression of the second Poisson bracket structure for N=2 and N=3 site rational classical Calogero-Moser model. We propose an r-matrix formulation for N=2. It is identified with the classical limit of the second dynamical boundary algebra previously built by the authors.
