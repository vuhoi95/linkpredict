Title: Wheeler-DeWitt Equation in 2 + 1 Dimensions
Authors: Herbert W. Hamber and Reiko Toriumi and Ruth M. Williams
Abstract: The infrared structure of quantum gravity is explored by solving a lattice version of the Wheeler-DeWitt equations. In the present paper only the case of 2+1 dimensions is considered. The nature of the wavefunction solutions is such that a finite correlation length emerges and naturally cuts off any infrared divergences. Properties of the lattice vacuum are consistent with the existence of an ultraviolet fixed point in $G$ located at the origin, thus precluding the existence of a weak coupling perturbative phase. The correlation length exponent is determined exactly and found to be $\nu=6/11$. The results obtained so far lend support to the claim that the Lorentzian and Euclidean formulations belong to the same field-theoretic universality class.
