Title: A Galileon Design of Slow Expansion: II
Authors: Zhi-Guo Liu and Yun-Song Piao
Abstract: We parameterize the evolutions of the slow expansion, which emerges from a static state in infinite past, into different classes. We show that the scale invariant adiabatical perturbation may be generated during these evolutions, and the corrsponding evolutions can be realized with generalized Galileon Lagrangians, in which there is not the ghost instability.
