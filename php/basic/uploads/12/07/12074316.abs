Title: Perturbative correlation functions of null Wilson loops and local  operators
Authors: Luis F. Alday and Paul Heslop and Jakub Sikorowski
Abstract: We consider the correlation function of a null Wilson loop with four edges and a local operator in planar MSYM. By applying the insertion procedure, developed for correlation functions of local operators, we give an integral representation for the result at one and two loops. We compute explicitly the one loop result and show that the two loop result is finite.
