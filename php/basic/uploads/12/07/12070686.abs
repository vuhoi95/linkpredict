Title: Fermionic Wigs for AdS-Schwarzschild Black Holes
Authors: L. G. C. Gentile and P. A. Grassi and A. Mezzalira
Abstract: We provide the metric, the gravitino fields and the gauge fields to all orders in the fermionic zero modes for D=5 and D=4, N=2 gauged supergravity solutions starting from non-extremal AdS--Schwarzschild black holes. We compute the Brown-York stress--energy tensor on the boundary of AdS_5 / AdS_4 spaces and we discuss some implications of the fermionic corrections to perfect fluid interpretation of the boundary theory. The complete non-linear solution, which we denote as fermionic wig, is achieved by acting with supersymmetry transformations upon the supergravity fields and that expansion naturally truncates at some order in the fermionic zero modes.
