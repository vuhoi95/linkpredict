Title: The hadron resonance gas model: thermodynamics of QCD and Polyakov loop
Authors: E. Megias and E. Ruiz Arriola and L. L. Salcedo
Abstract: We study the hadron resonance gas model and describe the equation of state of QCD and the vacuum expectation value of the Polyakov loop in the confined phase, in terms of hadronic states with light quarks in the first case, and with exactly one heavy quark in the second case. Comparison with lattice simulations is made.
