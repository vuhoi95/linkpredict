Title: Analytic study of properties of holographic p-wave superconductors
Authors: Sunandan Gangopadhyay and Dibakar Roychowdhury
Abstract: In this paper, we analytically investigate the properties of p-wave holographic superconductors in $AdS_{4}$-Schwarzschild background by two approaches, one based on the Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem and the other based on the matching of the solutions to the field equations near the horizon and near the asymptotic $AdS$ region. The relation between the critical temperature and the charge density has been obtained and the dependence of the expectation value of the condensation operator on the temperature has been found. Our results are in very good agreement with the existing numerical results. The critical exponent of the condensation also comes out to be 1/2 which is the universal value in the mean field theory.
