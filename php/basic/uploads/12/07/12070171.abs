Title: The Benefits of Stress: Resolution of the Lifshitz Singularity
Authors: Ning Bao and Xi Dong and Sarah Harrison and Eva Silverstein
Abstract: Through the AdS/CFT correspondence, Lifshitz spacetimes describe field theories with dynamical scaling ($z \neq 1$). Although curvature invariants are small, the Lifshitz metric exhibits a null singularity in the IR with a large tidal force that excites string oscillator modes. However, Lifshitz is not a vacuum solution of the Einstein equations -- the metric is supported by nontrivial matter content which must be taken into account in analyzing the propagation of test objects. In this paper, we consider the interaction of a string with a D0-brane density in the IR which supports a class of UV-complete $z=2$ Lifshitz constructions. We show that string/D-brane scattering in the Regge limit slows the string significantly, preventing divergent mode production and resolving the would-be singularity in string propagation.
