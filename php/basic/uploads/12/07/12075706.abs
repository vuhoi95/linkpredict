Title: Universal local symmetries in classical mechanics and physical degrees  of freedom
Authors: Enrico Cattaruzza and Ennio Gozzi
Abstract: In a recent paper we have analyzed the role that a universal set of local symmetries plays in suppressing the superposition principle in classical mechanics via a path-integral formulation of classical mechanics itself. In this paper first we generalize those symmetries, second we study the role which the gauge fixing plays and third we put forward the idea of which ones should be the physical degrees of freedom of the theory.
