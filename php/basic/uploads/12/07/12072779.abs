Title: Collective Symmetry Breaking and Resonant Non-Gaussianity
Authors: Siavosh R. Behbahani and Daniel Green
Abstract: We study inflationary models that produce a nearly scale-invariant power spectrum while breaking scale invariance significantly in the bispectrum. Under most circumstances, such models are finely-tuned, as radiative corrections generically induce a larger signal in the power spectrum. However, when scale invariance is broken collectively (i.e., it requires more than one coupling to break the symmetry), these radiative corrections may be suppressed. We illustrate the features and limitations of collective symmetry breaking in the context of resonant non-gaussianity. We discuss two examples where oscillatory features can arise predominantly in the bispectrum.
