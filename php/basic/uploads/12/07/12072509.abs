Title: Gravity's weight on worldline fuzziness
Authors: Giovanni Amelino-Camelia and Valerio Astuti and Giacomo Rosati
Abstract: We investigate a connection between recent results in 3D quantum gravity, providing an effective noncommutative-spacetime description, and some earlier heuristic descriptions of a quantum-gravity contribution to the fuzziness of the worldlines of particles. We show that 3D-gravity-inspired spacetime noncommutativity reflects some of the features suggested by previous heuristic arguments. Most notably, gravity-induced worldline fuzziness, while irrelevantly small on terrestrial scales, could be observably large for propagation of particles over cosmological distances.
