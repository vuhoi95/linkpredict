Title: Bosonic String Quantization in Static Gauge
Authors: George Jorjadze and Jan Plefka and Jonas Pollok
Abstract: The bosonic string in D dimensional Minkowski space-time is quantized in static gauge. It is shown that the system can be described by D-1 massless free fields constrained on the surface L_m = 0, for m \neq 0, where L_m are the generators of conformal transformations. The free fields are quantized and the physical states are selected by the conditions L_m|phys>=0, for m>0. The Poincar\'e group generators on the physical Hilbert space are constructed and the critical dimension D=26 is recovered from the commutation relations of the boost operators. The equivalence with the covariant quantization is established. A possible generalization to the AdS string dynamics is discussed.
