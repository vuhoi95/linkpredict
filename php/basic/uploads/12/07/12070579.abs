Abstract: We investigate the equation of state (EoS) of the scalar-torsion mode in Poincar\'{e} gauge theory of gravity. We concentrate on two cases with the constant curvature solution and positive kinetic energy, respectively. In the former, we find that the torsion EoS has different values in the various stages of the universe. In particular, it behaves like the radiation (matter) EoS of $w_r=1/3$ ($w_m=0$) in the radiation (matter) dominant epoch, while in the late time the torsion density is supportive for the accelerating universe. In the latter, our numerical analysis shows that in general the EoS has an asymptotic behavior in the high redshift regime, while it could cross the phantom divide line in the low redshift regime.
