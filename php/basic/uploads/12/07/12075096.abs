Title: Approximate Particle Spectra in the Pyramid Scheme
Authors: Tom Banks and T. J. Torres
Abstract: We construct a minimal model within the general class of Pyramid Schemes, which is consistent with both supersymmetry breaking and electroweak symmetry breaking. In order to do computations, we make unjustified approximations to the low energy K\"ahler potential. The phenomenological viability of the resultant mass spectrum is then examined and compared with current collider limits. We show that, for certain regimes of parameters, the Pyramid Scheme can accommodate the current collider mass constraints on physics beyond the standard model with a tree-level light Higgs mass near 125 GeV. However, in this regime the model exhibits a little hierarchy problem, and one must permit fine-tunings that are generically 5%.
