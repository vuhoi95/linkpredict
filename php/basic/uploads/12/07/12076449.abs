Title: Finite BRST transformation and constrained systems
Authors: Sudhaker Upadhyay and Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: We establish the connection between the generating functional for the first-class theories and the generating functional for the second-class theories using the finite field dependent BRST (FFBRST) transformation. We show this connection with the help of explicit calculations in two different models. The generating functional of Proca model is obtained from the generating functional of Stueckelberg theory for massive spin 1 vector field using FFBRST transformation. In the other example we relate the generating functionals for gauge invariant and gauge variant theory for self-dual chiral boson.
