Title: An application of Cubical Cohomology to Adinkras and Supersymmetry  Representations
Authors: Charles Doran and Kevin Iga and Greg Landweber
Abstract: An Adinkra is a class of graphs with certain signs marking its vertices and edges, which encodes off-shell representations of the super Poincar\'e algebra. The markings on the vertices and edges of an Adinkra are cochains for cubical cohomology. This article explores the cubical cohomology of Adinkras, treating these markings analogously to characteristic classes on smooth manifolds.
