Title: A Deformation of Sasakian Structure in the Presence of Torsion and  Supergravity Solutions
Authors: Tsuyoshi Houri and Hiroshi Takeuchi and Yukinori Yasui
Abstract: We discuss a deformation of Sasakian structure in the presence of totally skew-symmetric torsion by introducing odd dimensional manifolds whose metric cones are K\"ahler with torsion. It is shown that such a geometry inherits similar properties to those of Sasakian geometry. As an example of them, we present an explicit expression of local metrics and see how Sasakian structure is deformed by the presence of torsion. We also demonstrate that our example of the metrics admits the existence of hidden symmetries described by non-trivial odd-rank generalized closed conformal Killing-Yano tensors. Furthermore, using these metrics as an {\it ansatz}, we construct exact solutions in five dimensional minimal (un-)gauged supergravity and eleven dimensional supergravity. Finally, we discuss the global structures of the solutions and obtain regular metrics on compact manifolds in five dimensions, which give natural generalizations of Sasaki--Einstein manifolds $Y^{p,q}$ and $L^{a,b,c}$. We also discuss regular metrics on non-compact manifolds in eleven dimensions.
