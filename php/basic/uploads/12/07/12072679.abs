Title: Nonextremal black holes in gauged supergravity and the real formulation  of special geometry
Authors: Dietmar Klemm and Owen Vaughan
Abstract: We give a rather general recipe for constructing nonextremal black hole solutions to N=2, D=4 gauged supergravity coupled to abelian vector multiplets. This problem simplifies considerably if one uses the formalism developed in arXiv:1112.2876, based on dimensional reduction and the real formulation of special geometry. We use this to find new nonextremal black holes for several choices of the prepotential, that generalize the BPS solutions found in arXiv:0911.4926. Some physical properties of these black holes are also discussed.
