Title: Generalized McKay quivers of rank three
Authors: Xiaoli Hu and Naihuan Jing and Wuxing Cai
Abstract: For each finite subgroup G of SL(n, C), we introduce the generalized Cartan matrix C_{G} in view of McKay correspondence from the fusion rule of its natural representation. Using group theory, we show that the generalized Cartan matrices have similar favorable properties such as positive semi-definiteness as in the classical case of affine Cartan matrices (the case of SL(2,C)). The complete McKay quivers for SL(3,C) are explicitly described and classified based on representation theory.
