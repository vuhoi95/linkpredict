Title: Static nonextremal AdS4 black hole solutions
Authors: Chiara Toldo and Stefan Vandoren
Abstract: We find new static nonextremal black hole solutions that asymptote to AdS_4 in D=4 gauged N=2 supergravity. Solutions include electric and magnetic black holes with constant scalars that in the BPS limit reduce to naked singularities, but also magnetic black holes with running scalars that at extremality reduce to BPS black holes with finite horizon area. For all these solutions we compute area product formulae and show they are independent of the mass. Finally, we also find new examples of nonextremal magnetic black branes.
