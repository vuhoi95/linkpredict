Title: Cosmological brane systems in warped spacetime
Authors: Masato Minamitsuji and Kunihito Uzawa
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the time-dependent brane solutions in higher-dimensional supergravity theories. We particularly focus on the dynamical extensions of the intersecting brane solutions involving three branes. We also show that in the near-horizon limits, where the time dependence is negligible, these branes describe warped anti-de Sitter spacetimes as in the corresponding static solutions. We finally examine the lower-dimensional cosmological dynamics obtained after compactifications of the higher-dimensional solutions and show the solutions we have found give the four-dimensional universe with power-law expansion.
