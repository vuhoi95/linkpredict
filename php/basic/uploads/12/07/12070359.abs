Abstract: The no-boundary wave function of quantum gravity usually assigns only very small probability to long periods of inflation. This was a reason to doubt about the no-boundary wave function to explain the observational universe. We study the no-boundary proposal in the context of multi-field inflation to see whether the number of fields changes the situation. For a simple model, we find that indeed the no-boundary wave function can give higher probability for sufficient inflation, but the number of fields involved has to be very high.
