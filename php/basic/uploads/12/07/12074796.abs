Title: Primordial Bispectrum and Trispectrum Contributions to the Non-Gaussian  Excursion Set Halo Mass Function with Diffusive Drifting Barrier
Authors: Ixandra E. Achitouv and Pier Stefano Corasaniti
Abstract: The high-mass end of the halo mass function is a sensitive probe of primordial non-Gaussianity (NG). In a recent study [9] we have computed the NG halo mass function in the context of the Excursion Set theory and shown that the primordial NG imprint is coupled to that induced by the non-linear collapse of dark matter halos. We also found an excellent agreement with N-body simulation results. Here, we perform a more accurate computation which accounts for the interval validity of the bispectrum expansion to next-to-leading order and extend the calculation to the case of a non-vanishing primordial trispectrum.
