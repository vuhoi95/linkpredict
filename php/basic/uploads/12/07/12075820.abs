Abstract: We consider a noncommutative description of graphene. This description consists of a Dirac equation for massless Dirac fermions plus noncommutative corrections, which are treated in the presence of an external magnetic field. We argue that, being a two-dimensional Dirac system, graphene is particularly interesting to test noncommutativity. We find that momentum noncommutativity affects the energy levels of graphene, but that it does not entail any kind of correction to the Hall conductivity.
