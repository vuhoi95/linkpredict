Title: Quasinormal modes around the BTZ black hole at the tricritical  generalized massive gravity
Authors: Yong-Wan Kim and Yun Soo Myung and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: Employing the operator method, we obtain log-square quasinormal modes and frequencies of a graviton around the BTZ black hole at the tricritical point of the generalized massive gravity. The log-square quasinormal frequencies are also obtained by considering a finite temperature conformal field theory. This shows the AdS/LCFT correspondence at the tricritical point approximately. We discuss a truncation process to the unitary theory on the BTZ black hole background.
