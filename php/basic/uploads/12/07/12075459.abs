Title: On the D-brane solutions in Godel Universe
Authors: Kamal L. Panigrahi and Pratap K. Swain
Abstract: We present a class of supersymmetric Godel solutions in string theory from the non-standard intersection of branes in supergravities. Such solutions are obtained by applying a T-duality on the known solutions in PP-wave spacetime. We further present classical solutions of supersymmetric D-brane in Godel universes arising from the PP-wave in the near horizon geometry of stack of D5-branes and from the new isometries of H_6 PP-wave background. These branes are supported by multiple constant Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond-Ramond field strengths.
