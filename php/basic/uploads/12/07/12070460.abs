Title: BPS States in Omega Background and Integrability
Authors: Kseniya Bulycheva and Heng-yu Chen and Alexander Gorsky and Peter Koroteev
Abstract: We reconsider string and domain wall central charges in N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions in presence of the Omega background in the Nekrasov-Shatashvili (NS) limit. Existence of these charges entails presence of the corresponding topological defects in the theory - vortices and domain walls. In spirit of the 4d/2d duality we discuss the worldsheet low energy effective theory living on the BPS vortex in N=2 Supersymmetric Quantum Chromodynamics (SQCD). We discuss some aspects of the brane realization of the dualities between various quantum integrable models. A chain of such dualities enables us to check the AGT correspondence in the NS limit.
