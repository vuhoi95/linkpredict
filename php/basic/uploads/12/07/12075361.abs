Title: Iterative Fluiddynamics
Authors: F. Wunderlich and B. KÃ¤mpfer
Abstract: An iterative scheme is presented to solve analytically the relativistic fluid dynamics equations. The scheme is applied to longitudinal expansion, transversal symmetric and transversal asymmetric (triaxial) expansion as well. Within this scheme it is possible to describe the dynamics of a strongly coupled (i.e. conformal) medium for parameters referring to heavy-ion collisions at LHC.
