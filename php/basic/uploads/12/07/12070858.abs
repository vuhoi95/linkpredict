Title: Violation of the Robertson-Schrödinger uncertainty principle and  non-commutative quantum mechanics
Authors: Catarina Bastos and Orfeu Bertolami and Nuno Costa Dias and João Nuno Prata
Abstract: We show that a possible violation of the Robertson-Schr\"odinger uncertainty principle may signal the existence of a deformation of the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra. More precisely, we prove that any Gaussian in phase-space (even if it violates the Robertson-Schr\"odinger uncertainty principle) is always a quantum state of an appropriate non-commutative extension of quantum mechanics. Conversely, all canonical non-commutative extensions of quantum mechanics display states that violate the Robertson-Schr\"odinger uncertainty principle.
