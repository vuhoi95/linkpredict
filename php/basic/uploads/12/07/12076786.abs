Title: Towards higher-spin holography in ambient space of any dimension
Authors: V. E. Didenko and E. D. Skvortsov
Abstract: We derive the propagators for higher-spin master fields in anti-de Sitter space of arbitrary dimension. A method is developed to construct the propagators directly without solving any differential equations. The use of the ambient space, where AdS is represented as a hyperboloid and its conformal boundary as a projective light-cone, simplifies the approach and makes a direct contact between boundary-to-bulk propagators and two-point functions of conserved currents.
