Title: Stability of solitonic solutions of Super KdV equations under Susy  breaking conditions
Authors: A. Restuccia and A. Sotomayor
Abstract: A supersymmetric breaking procedure for N=1 Super KdV, preserving the positivity of the hamiltonian as well as the existence of solitonic solutions, is implemented. The resulting integrable system is shown to have nice stability properties.
