Title: Compact Lie groups: Euler constructions and generalized Dyson conjecture
Authors: S. L. Cacciatori and F. Dalla Piazza and A. Scotti
Abstract: A generalized Euler parameterization of a compact Lie group is a way for parameterizing the group starting from a maximal Lie subgroup, which allows a simple characterization of the range of parameters. In the present paper we consider the class of all compact connected Lie groups. We present a general method for realizing their generalized Euler parameterization starting from any symmetrically embedded Lie group. Our construction is based on a detailed analysis of the geometry of these groups. As a byproduct this gives rise to an interesting connection with certain Dyson integrals. In particular, we obtain a geometry based proof of a Macdonald conjecture regarding the Dyson integrals correspondent to the root systems associated to all irreducible symmetric spaces. As an application of our general method we explicitly parameterize all groups of the class of simple, simply connected compact Lie groups. We provide a table giving all necessary ingredients for all such Euler parameterizations.
