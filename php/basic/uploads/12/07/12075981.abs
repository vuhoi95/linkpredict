Title: Gravitational Corrections to $Î¦^{4}$ Theory with Spontaneously Broken  Symmetry
Authors: Hao-Ran Chang and Wen-Tao Hou and Yi Sun
Abstract: We consider a complex scalar $\Phi^4 $ theory with spontaneously broken global U(1) symmetry, minimally coupling to perturbatively quantized Einstein gravity which is treated as an effective theory at the energy well below the Planck scale. Both the lowest order pure real scalar correction and the gravitational correction to the renormalization of the Higgs sector in this model have been investigated. Our results show that the gravitational correction renders the renormalization of the Higgs sector in this model inconsistent while the pure real scalar correction to it leads to a compatible renormalization.
