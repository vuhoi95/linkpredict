Title: Euclidean N=2 Supergravity
Authors: Jan B. Gutowski and W. A. Sabra
Abstract: Euclidean special geometry has recently been investigated in the context of Euclidean supersymmetric theories with vector multiplets. In the rigid case, the scalar manifold is described by affine special para-Kahler geometry while the target geometries of Euclidean vector multiplets coupled to supergravity are given by projective special para-Kahler manifolds. In this letter, we derive the Killing spinor equations of Euclidean N=2 supergravity theories coupled to vector multiplets. These equations provide the starting point for finding general supersymmetric instanton solutions.
