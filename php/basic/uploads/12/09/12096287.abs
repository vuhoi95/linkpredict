Title: Nonlinear magnetic response of the magnetized vacuum to applied electric  field
Authors: Dmitry M. Gitman and Anatoly E. Shabad
Abstract: We find first nonlinear correction to the field, produced by a static charge at rest in a background constant magnetic field. It is quadratic in the charge and purely magnetic. The third-rank polarization tensor - the nonlinear response function - is written within the local approximation of the effective action in an otherwise model- and approximation-independent way within any P-invariant nonlinear electrodynamics, QED included.
