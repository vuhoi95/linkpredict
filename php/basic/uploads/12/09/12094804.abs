Title: Holographic Renormalisation for the Spin-3 Theory and the (A)dS3/CFT2  correspondence
Authors: Shailesh Lal and Bindusar Sahoo
Abstract: We compute the two-point correlation functions for the spin-3 theory in three dimensional (Anti-) de Sitter spacetimes by using holographic renormalisation. For the AdS case, we find results consistent with the general requirements of two-dimensional conformal invariance. In the de Sitter case, we find similar results. We discuss consistency requirements on the three point functions TWW for our results to be compatible with the asymptotic symmetry algebra for AdS case and with the de-Sitter central charge found in hep-th/0106113 by analyzing the stress-tensor. We also discuss why it is very likely that our results are not compatible with the imaginary central charge previously found for higher-spin theories in dS(3).
