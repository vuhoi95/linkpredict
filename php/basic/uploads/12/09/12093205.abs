Abstract: We consider the classical solution describing a folded type IIA string in the background $AdS_4 \times \mathbb{CP}^3$. The string is spinning in $AdS$ and has angular momentum in $\mathbb{CP}^3$. In the 't Hooft limit, this is the gravity dual of twist operators in the ABJM superconformal theory. We quantize the classical solution by algebraic curve methods and determine the first semiclassical correction to the energy. An integral representation is given, valid for all values of the charges. We analyze its properties in the special regimes associated with a short or long string. Finally, we investigate various properties of the leading term of the energy for short strings (the so-called slope).
