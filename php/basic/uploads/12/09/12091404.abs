Title: An E7 Surprise
Authors: Tudor Dimofte and Davide Gaiotto
Abstract: We explore some curious implications of Seiberg duality for an SU(2) four-dimensional gauge theory with eight chiral doublets. We argue that two copies of the theory can be deformed by an exactly marginal quartic superpotential so that they acquire an enhanced E7 flavor symmetry. We argue that a single copy of the theory can be used to define an E7-invariant superconformal boundary condition for a theory of 28 five-dimensional free hypermultiplets. Finally, we derive similar statements for three-dimensional gauge theories such as an SU(2) gauge theory with six chiral doublets or Nf=4 SQED.
