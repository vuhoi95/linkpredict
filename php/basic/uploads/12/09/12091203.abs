Title: Dynamical Collapse of Charged Scalar Field in Phantom Gravity
Authors: Anna Nakonieczna and Marek Rogatko and Rafal Moderski
Abstract: We investigated the problem of the dynamical collapse of a self-gravitating complex charged scalar field in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory with a phantom copuling for the adequate fields in the system under consideration. We also considered two simplifications of it, i.e., the separate collapses of phantom Maxwell and phantom scalar fields under the influence of Einstein gravity. One starts with the regular spacetime and leads the evolution through the formation of the horizons and the final singularity. We discuss the structures of spacetimes emerging in the process of the dynamical collapse and comment on the role of the considered fields in its course.
