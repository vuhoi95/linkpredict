Authors: Bhabani Prasad Mandal and Ananya Ghatak
Abstract: We consider non-Hermitian PT-symmetric deformation of $A_{N-1}$ type Calogero model without confining potential to investigate the possible existence of spectral singularity. By considering the Wronskian between asymptotic incoming and outgoing scattering state wave functions, we found that there exist no spectral singularity in this model. We further explicitly show that the transmission coefficient vanishes and the reflection coefficient becomes unity for all values of the energy in such a momentum dependent non-Hermitian PT-symmetric model.
