Title: Thermalization at intermediate coupling
Authors: Dominik Steineder and Stefan A. Stricker and Aleksi Vuorinen
Abstract: We use the AdS/CFT conjecture to investigate the thermalization of large-N_c N=4 Super Yang-Mills plasma in the limit of large but finite 't Hooft coupling. On the gravity side, we supplement the type IIB supergravity action by the full set of O(\alpha'^3) operators, which enables us to derive O(\lambda^{-3/2}) corrections to the emission spectrum of prompt photons in one model of holographic thermalization. Decreasing the coupling strength from the \lambda=\infty limit, we observe a qualitative change in the way the photon spectral density approaches its thermal limit as a function of the photon energy. We interpret this behavior as a sign of the thermalization pattern of the plasma shifting from top/down towards bottom/up.
