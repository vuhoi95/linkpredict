Title: N=2 Moonshine
Authors: Tohru Eguchi and Kazuhiro Hikami
Abstract: We construct a model of moonshine phenomenon based on the use of N=2 superconformal algebra. We consider an extremal Jacobi form of weight 0 and index 2, and expand it in terms of N=2 massless and massive representations. We find the multiplicities of massive representations are decomposed into a sum of dimensions of irreducible representations of the group L2(11).
