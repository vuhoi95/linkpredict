Title: G/G gauged WZW model and Bethe Ansatz for the phase model
Authors: Satoshi Okuda and Yutaka Yoshida
Abstract: We investigate the G/G gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten model on a Riemann surface from the point of view of the algebraic Bethe Ansatz for the phase model. After localization procedure is applied to the G/G gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten model, the diagonal components for group elements satisfy Bethe Ansatz equations for the phase model. We show that the partition function of the G/G gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten model is identified as the summation of norms with respect to all the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian with the fixed number of particles in the phase model. We also consider relations between the Chern-Simons theory on $S^1\times\Sigma_h$ and the phase model.
