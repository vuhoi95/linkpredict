Title: Fixed points and infrared completion of quantum gravity
Authors: Nicolai Christiansen and Daniel F. Litim and Jan M. Pawlowski and Andreas Rodigast
Abstract: The phase diagram of four-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert gravity is studied using Wilson's renormalization group. Smooth trajectories connecting the ultraviolet fixed point at short distances with attractive infrared fixed points at long distances are derived from the non-perturbative graviton propagator. Implications for the asymptotic safety conjecture and further results are discussed.
