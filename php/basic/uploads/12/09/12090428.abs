Title: Quantization of Reissner-Nordstr√∂m Black Holes and Their  Non-Singular Quantum Behavior
Authors: Mojtaba Taslimi Tehran and Hoshang Heydari
Abstract: Quantization of different regions of the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m space time (charged black hole) is done in the framework of loop quantum gravity. The geometry of Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m space-time is expressed in terms of Ashtekar variables which form the classical phase space of such a black hole. Using the loop quantization of phase space, the issue of singularity avoidance of such a black hole is addressed; based on spherically symmetry reduced models of loop quantum gravity, the operator analogue of the diverging factor of scalar curvature of the charged black hole is constructed and is shown to exhibit an upper bounded spectrum. This local criterion, together with the global one (non-singular quantum evolution equation) proves the avoidance of charged black hole singularity in symmetry reduced models of loop quantum gravity.
