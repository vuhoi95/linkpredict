Title: Conjecture on Hidden Superconformal Symmetry of N=4 Supergravity
Authors: Sergio Ferrara and Renata Kallosh and Antoine Van Proeyen
Abstract: We argue that the observed UV finiteness of the 3-loop extended supergravities may be a manifestation of a hidden local superconformal symmetry of supergravity. We focus on the SU(2,2|4) dimensionless superconformal model. In Poincare gauge where the compensators are fixed to phi^2= 6 M_P^2 this model becomes a pure classical N=4 Einstein supergravity. We argue that in N=4 the higher-derivative superconformal invariants like phi^{-4}W^2 \bar W^2 and the consistent local anomaly delta (ln phi W^2) are not available. This conjecture on hidden local N=4 superconformal symmetry of Poincare supergravity may be supported by subsequent loop computations.
