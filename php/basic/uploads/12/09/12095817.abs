Title: Partially Supersymmetric ABJM Theory with Flux
Authors: Yoonbai Kim and O-Kab Kwon and D. D. Tolla
Abstract: Starting with generic Wess-Zumino type coupling to constant four-form and the dual seven-form field strengths in the ABJM theory, we obtain mass-deformed theories with ${\cal N}=2,4$ supersymmetries. These theories contain massless scalar fields and allow the implementation of the Mukhi-Papageorgakis Higgsing procedure. Using this procedure, we connect the Higgsed theories to three-dimensional mass-deformed SYM theories. These are also connected by the four-dimensional ${\cal N}=1^*,2^*$ mass-deformed SYM theories through dimensional reduction. We classify the three-dimensional mass-deformed SYM theories of ${\cal N}=1,2,4$ supersymmetry, of which a few cases of ${\cal N}=1,2$ are connected neither by MP Higgsing procedure nor dimensional reduction.
