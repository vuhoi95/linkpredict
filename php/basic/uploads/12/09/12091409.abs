Title: Super-A-polynomials for Twist Knots
Authors: Satoshi Nawata and P. Ramadevi and Zodinmawia and Xinyu Sun
Abstract: We conjecture formulae of the colored superpolynomials for a class of twist knots $K_p$ where p denotes the number of full twists. The validity of the formulae is checked by applying differentials and taking special limits. Using the formulae, we compute both the classical and quantum super-A-polynomial for the twist knots with small values of p. The results support the categorified versions of the generalized volume conjecture and the quantum volume conjecture. Furthermore, we obtain the evidence that the Q-deformed A-polynomials can be identified with the augmentation polynomials of knot contact homology in the case of the twist knots.
