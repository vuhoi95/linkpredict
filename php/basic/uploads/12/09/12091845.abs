Title: Exact Half-BPS Flux Solutions in M-theory with $D(2, 1; c'; 0)^2$  Symmetry: Local Solutions
Authors: John Estes and Roman Feldman and Darya Krym
Abstract: We construct local solutions to 11-dimensional supergravity (or M-theory), which are invariant under the superalgebra $D(2, 1; c'; 0)\oplus D(2, 1; c'; 0)$ for all values of the parameter $c'$. The BPS constraints are reduced to a single linear PDE on a complex function $G$. The PDE was solved in 0806.0605 modulo application of boundary and regularity conditions. The physical fields of the solutions are determined by $c'$, a harmonic function $h$, and the complex function $G$. $ h$ and $G$ are both functions on a 2-dimensional compact Riemannian manifold. The harmonic function $ h$ is freely chosen. We obtain the expressions for the metric and the field strength in terms of $G$, $h$, and $c'$ and show that these are indeed valid solutions of the Einstein, Maxwell, and Bianchi equations. Finally we give a construction of one parameter deformations of $AdS_7 \times S^4$ and $AdS_4 \times S^7$ as a function of $c'$.
