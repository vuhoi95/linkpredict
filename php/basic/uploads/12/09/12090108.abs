Title: Metric Properties of the Fuzzy Sphere
Authors: Francesco D'Andrea and Fedele Lizzi and Joseph C. Varilly
Abstract: The fuzzy sphere, as a quantum metric space, carries a sequence of metrics which we describe in detail. We show that the Bloch coherent states, with these spectral distances, form a sequence of metric spaces that converge to the round sphere in the high-spin limit.
