Title: Aging Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory : a holographic view
Authors: Seungjoon Hyun and Jaehoon Jeong and Bom Soo Kim
Abstract: We consider logarithmic extensions of the correlation and response functions of scalar operators for the systems with aging as well as Schr\"odinger symmetry. Aging is known to be the simplest nonequilibrium phenomena, and its physical significances can be understood by the two-time correlation and response functions. Their logarithmic part is completely fixed by the bulk geometry in terms of the conformal weight of the dual operator and the dual particle number. Motivated by recent experimental realizations of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in growth phenomena and its subsequent theoretical extension to aging, we investigate our two-time correlation functions out of equilibrium, which show several qualitatively different behaviors depending on the parameters in our theory. They exhibit either growing or aging, i.e. power-law decaying, behaviors for the entire range of our scaling time. Surprisingly, for some parameter ranges, they exhibit growing at early times as well as aging at later times.
