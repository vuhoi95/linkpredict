Abstract: As in the case of Einstein or Lovelock gravity, the action of quartic quasitopological gravity has not a well-defined variational principle. In this paper, we first introduce a surface term that makes the variation of quartic quasitopological gravity well defined. Second, we present the static charged solutions of quartic quasitopological gravity in the presence of a non linear electromagnetic field. One of the branch of these solutions presents a black brane with one or two horizons or a naked singularity depending on the charge and mass of the solution. The thermodynamic of these black branes are investigated through the use of the Gibbs free energy. In order to do this, we calculate the finite action by use of the counterterm method inspired by AdS/CFT correspondence. Introducing a Smarr-type formula, we also show that the conserved and thermodynamics quantities of these solutions satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. Finally, we present the charged rotating black branes in $(n+1)$ dimensions with $k\leq [n/2]$ rotation parameters and investigate their thermodynamics.
