Title: On Mixing Supersymmetry and Family Symmetry Breakings
Authors: M Jay Perez and Pierre Ramond and Jue Zhang
Abstract: We present a toy model in which the Higgs sector fields transform as non-Abelian representations of a family symmetry group, and consider the possibility that the extra family partners of the Higgs particles act as messengers for both supersymmetry and family symmetry breakings. Although such mediation schemes generically produce family dependent soft supersymmetry breaking terms at the messenger scale, we demonstrate the existence of a focusing mechanism which may erase such hierarchies through renormalization group running.
