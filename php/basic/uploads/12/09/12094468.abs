Title: Chiral transition in dense, magnetized matter
Authors: Florian Preis and Anton Rebhan and Andreas Schmitt
Abstract: In the presence of a chemical potential, the effect of a magnetic field on chiral symmetry breaking goes beyond the well-known magnetic catalysis. Due to a subtle interplay with the chemical potential, the magnetic field may work not only in favor but also against the chirally broken phase. At sufficiently large coupling, the magnetic field favors the broken phase only for field strengths beyond any conceivable value in nature. Therefore, in the interior of magnetars, a possible transition from chirally broken hadronic matter to chirally symmetric quark matter might occur at smaller densities than previously thought.
