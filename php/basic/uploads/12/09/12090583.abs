Title: Higher derivative theories with constraints : Exorcising Ostrogradski's  Ghost
Authors: Tai-jun Chen and Matteo Fasiello and Eugene A. Lim and Andrew J. Tolley
Abstract: We prove that the linear instability in a non-degenerate higher derivative theory, the Ostrogradski instability, can only be removed by the addition of constraints if the original theory's phase space is reduced.
