Title: Mass Deformed L-BLG Theory From ABJ Theory
Authors: Tanay K. Dey and Kamal L. Panigrahi
Abstract: We construct mass deformed SU(N) L-BLG theory together with $U(M-N)_k$ Chern-Simons theory. This mass deformed L-BLG theory is a low energy world volume theory of a stack of $N$ number of M2-brane far away from $C^4/Z_k$ singularity. We carry out this by defining a special scaling limit of the fields of this theory and simultaneously sending the Chern-Simons level to infinity.
