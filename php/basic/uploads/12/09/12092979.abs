Title: Hawking radiation for non asymptotically flat dilatonic black holes  using gravitational anomaly
Authors: J. C. Fabris and G. T. Marques
Abstract: The $d$-dimensional scalar field action may be reduced, in the background geometry of a black hole, to a 2-dimensional effective action. In the near horizon region, it appears a gravitational anomaly: the energy-momentum tensor of the scalar field is not conserved anymore. This anomaly is removed by introducing a term related to the Hawking temperature of the black hole. Even if the temperature term introduced is not covariant, a gauge transformation may restore the covariance. We apply this method to compute the temperature of the black hole of the dilatonic non asymptotically flat black holes. We compare the results with those obtained through other methods.
