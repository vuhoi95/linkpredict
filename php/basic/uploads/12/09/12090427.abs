Title: Plasma photoemission from string theory
Authors: Babiker Hassanain and Martin Schvellinger
Abstract: Leading 't Hooft coupling corrections to the photoemission rate of the planar limit of a strongly-coupled {\cal {N}}=4 SYM plasma are investigated using the gauge/string duality. We consider the full order \alpha'^3 type IIB string theory corrections to the supergravity action, including higher order terms with the Ramond-Ramond five-form field strength. We extend our previous results presented in arXiv:1110.0526. Photoemission rates depend on the 't Hooft coupling, and their curves suggest an interpolating behaviour from strong towards weak coupling regimes. Their slopes at zero light-like momentum give the electrical conductivity as a function of the 't Hooft coupling, in full agreement with our previous results of arXiv:1108.6306. Furthermore, we also study the effect of corrections beyond the large N limit.
