Title: Bipartite Riemann-Finsler geometry and Lorentz violation
Authors: Alan Kostelecky and Neil Russell and Rhondale Tso
Abstract: Bipartite Riemann-Finsler geometries with complementary Finsler structures are constructed. Calculable examples are presented based on a bilinear-form coefficient for explicit Lorentz violation.
