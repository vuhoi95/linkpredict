Title: A 6D standing wave Braneworld
Authors: L. J. S. Sousa and J. E. G. Silva and C. A. S. Almeida
Abstract: We constructed a six-dimensional version of the standing wave model with an anisotropic 4-brane generated by a phantom-like scalar field. The model represents a braneworld where the compact (on-brane) dimension is assumed to be sufficiently small in order to describe our universe (hybrid compactification). The proposed geometry of the brane and its transverse manifold is non-static, unlike the majority of braneworld models presented in the literature. Furthermore, we have shown that the zero-mode scalar field is localized around the brane. While in the string-like defect the scalar field is localized on a brane with decreasing warp factor, here it was possible to perform the localization with an increasing warp factor.
