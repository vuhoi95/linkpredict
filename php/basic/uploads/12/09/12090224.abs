Title: Superpropagator and superconformal invariants
Authors: A. V. Belitsky and S. Caron-Huot
Abstract: We construct a superpropagator in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory which is invariant off-shell under a chiral half of supersymmetries. Motivated by the duality with scattering amplitudes in this theory, we apply this superpropagator to supersymmeytric Wilson loop on polygonal contours. By performing explicit one-loop calculations we confirm the absence of anomalies and verify the duality between the object under study and NMHV amplitudes.
