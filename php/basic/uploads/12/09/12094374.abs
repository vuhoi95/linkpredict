Title: On the Uniqueness of Kinematics of Loop Quantum Cosmology
Authors: Abhay Ashtekar and Miguel Campiglia
Abstract: The holonomy-flux algebra $\A$ of loop quantum gravity is known to admit a natural representation that is uniquely singled out by the requirement of covariance under spatial diffeomorphisms. In the cosmological context, the requirement of spatial homogeneity naturally reduces $\A$ to a much smaller algebra, $\A_{\rm Red}$, used in loop quantum cosmology. In Bianchi I models, it is shown that the requirement of covariance under \emph{residual} diffeomorphism symmetries again uniquely selects the representation of $\A_{\rm Red}$ that has been commonly used. We discuss the close parallel between the two uniqueness results and also point out a difference.
