Title: Evidence for a family of SO(8) gauged supergravity theories
Authors: G. Dall'Agata and G. Inverso and M. Trigiante
Abstract: In this note we discuss the classification of duality orbits of N = 8 gauged supergravity models. Using tensor classifiers, we show that there is a one-parameter family of inequivalent SO(8) gauged supergravity theories. We briefly discuss the couplings of such models and show that, although the maximally symmetric vacuum has the same quadratic spectrum, the supersymmetry transformations, the couplings and the scalar potential are parameter dependent. We also comment on the possible M-theory uplift and on the meaning of the parameter for the dual gauge theories.
