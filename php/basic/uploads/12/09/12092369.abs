Title: A Kolmogorov-Zakharov Spectrum in $AdS$ Gravitational Collapse
Authors: H. P. de Oliveira and Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas and E. L. Rodrigues
Abstract: We study black hole formation during the gravitational collapse of a massless scalar field in asymptotically $AdS_D$ spacetimes for $D=4,5$. We conclude that spherically symmetric gravitational collapse in asymptotically $AdS$ spaces is turbulent and characterized by a Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectrum. Namely, we find that after an initial period of weakly nonlinear evolution, there is a regime where the power spectrum of the Ricci scalar evolves as $\omega^{-s}$ with the frequency, $\omega$, and $s\approx 1.7\pm 0.1$.
