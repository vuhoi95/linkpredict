Title: Expansion History with Decaying Vacuum: A Complete Cosmological Scenario
Authors: J. A. S. Lima and S. Basilakos and Joan Sola
Abstract: We propose a novel cosmological scenario with the space-time emerging from a pure initial de Sitter stage and subsequently evolving into the radiation, matter and dark energy dominated epochs, thereby avoiding the initial singularity and providing a complete description of the expansion history and a natural solution to the horizon problem. The model is based on a dynamical vacuum energy density which evolves as a power series of the Hubble rate. The transit from the inflation into the standard radiation epoch is universal, giving a clue for a successful description of the graceful exit. Since the resulting late time cosmic history is very close to the concordance LCDM model, the new unified framework embodies a more complete past cosmic evolution than the standard cosmology.
