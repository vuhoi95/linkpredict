Title: CDT coupled to dimer matter: An analytical approach via tree bijections
Authors: Max R. Atkin and Stefan Zohren
Abstract: We review a recently obtained analytical solution of a restricted so-called hard dimers model coupled to two-dimensional CDT. The combinatorial solution is obtained via bijections of causal triangulations with dimers and decorated trees. We show that the scaling limit of this model can also be obtained from a multi-critical point of the transfer matrix for dynamical triangulations of triangles and squares when one disallows for spatial topology changes to occur.
