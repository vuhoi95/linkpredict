Title: B-field in AdS(3)/CFT(2) Correspondence and Integrability
Authors: Alessandra Cagnazzo and Konstantin Zarembo
Abstract: We construct topological Wess-Zumino term for supercoset sigma-models on various AdS(3) backgrounds. For appropriately chosen set of parameters, the sigma-model remains integrable when the Wess-Zumino term is added to the action. Moreover, the conditions for integrability, kappa-symmetry and conformal invariance are equivalent to each other.
