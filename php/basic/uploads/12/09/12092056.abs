Title: Energy and Angular Momentum in Generic F(Riemann) Theories
Authors: Cetin Senturk and Tahsin Cagri Sisman and Bayram Tekin
Abstract: We construct the conserved charge of generic gravity theories built on arbitrary contractions of the Riemann tensor (but not on its derivatives) for asymptotically (anti)-de Sitter spacetimes. Our construction is a generalization of the ADT charges of linear and quadratic gravity theories in cosmological backgrounds. As an explicit example we find the energy and angular momentum of the BTZ black hole in the 2+1 dimensional Born-Infeld gravity.
