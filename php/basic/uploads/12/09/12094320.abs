Authors: Masashi Fujitsuka and Masazumi Honda and Yutaka Yoshida
Abstract: We construct d<=7 dimensional maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories on a class of curved backgrounds with off-shell supercharges. The off-shell supersymmetry is mainly a generalization of on-shell supersymmetry constructed previously by Blau. We present several examples of backgrounds and discuss the number of the preserved supersymmetries on these backgrounds. We also construct another maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories on S^3 by dimensional reducing along the R-direction of N=4 super Yang-Mills theory on RxS^3.
