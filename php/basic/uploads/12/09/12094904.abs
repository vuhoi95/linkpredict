Title: Flavored Gauge Mediation, A Heavy Higgs, and Supersymmetric Alignment
Authors: Mohammad Abdullah and Iftah Galon and Yael Shadmi and Yuri Shirman
Abstract: We show that the messenger-matter couplings of Flavored Gauge Mediation Models can generate substantial stop mixing, leading to Higgs masses around 126 GeV with colored superpartners below 2 TeV and even a TeV. These results are largely independent of the messenger scale. We study the spectra of a few examples with a single messenger pair coupling dominantly to the top, for different messenger scales. Flavor constraints in these models are obeyed by virtue of supersymmetric alignment: the same flavor symmetry that explains fermion masses dictates the structure of the matter-messenger couplings, and this structure is inherited by the soft terms. We also present the leading 1-loop and 2-loop contributions to the soft terms for general coupling matrices in generation space.
