Title: Quasi-exact solvability, resonances and trivial monodromy in ordinary  differential equations
Authors: Patrick Dorey and Clare Dunning and Roberto Tateo
Abstract: A correspondence between the sextic anharmonic oscillator and a pair of third-order ordinary differential equations is used to investigate the phenomenon of quasi-exact solvability for eigenvalue problems involving differential operators with order greater than two. In particular, links with Bender-Dunne polynomials and resonances between independent solutions are observed for certain second-order cases, and extended to the higher-order problems.
