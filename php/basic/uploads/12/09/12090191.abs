Title: Wess-Zumino-Witten Model for Galilean Conformal Algebra
Authors: Somdeb Chakraborty and Parijat Dey
Abstract: In this note, we construct a Wess-Zumino-Witten model based on the Galilean conformal algebra in 2-spacetime dimensions, which is a nonrelativistic analogue of the relativistic conformal algebra. We obtain exact background corresponding to \sigma-models in six dimensions (the dimension of the group manifold) and a central charge c=6. We carry out a Sugawara type construction to verify the conformal invariance of the model. Further, we discuss the feasibility of the background obtained as a physical spacetime metric.
