Title: A Computer Algorithm For Engineering Off-Shell Multiplets With Four  Supercharges On The World Sheet
Authors: K. Burghardt and S. J. Gates Jr
Abstract: We present an adinkra-based computer algorithm implemented in a Mathematica code and use it in a limited demonstration of how to engineer off-shell, arbitrary N-extended world-sheet supermultiplets. Using one of the outputs from this algorithm, we present evidence for the unexpected discovery of a previously unknown 8 - 8 representation of N = 2 world sheet supersymmetry. As well, we uncover a menagerie of (p, q) = (3, 1) world sheet supermultiplets.
