Title: Reformulated invariants for non-torus knots and links
Authors: Zodinmawia and P. Ramadevi
Abstract: Using the Racah coefficients in our earlier paper arXiv:1107.3918, we explicitly write the Chern-Simons field theory invariants for many non-torus knot and links. Further, we have tabulated the reformulated invariants which agrees with the Ooguri-Vafa conjecture for knots and Labastida-Marino-Vafa conjecture for links.
