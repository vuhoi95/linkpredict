Title: Chern-Simons diffusion rate in a holographic Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Ben Craps and Carlos Hoyos and Piotr Surowka and Pieter Taels
Abstract: Using holography, we compute the Chern-Simons diffusion rate of 4d gauge theories constructed by wrapping D4-branes on a circle. In the model with antiperiodic boundary conditions for fermions, we find that it scales like $T^6$ in the high-temperature phase. With periodic fermions, this scaling persists at low temperatures. The scaling is reminiscent of 6d hydrodynamic behavior even at temperatures small compared to compactification scales of the M5-branes from which the D4-branes descend. We offer a holographic explanation of this behavior by adding a new entry to the known map between D4 and M5 hydrodynamics, and suggest a field theory explanation based on "deconstruction" or "fractionization".
