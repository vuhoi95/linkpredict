Title: Thermodynamics of string black hole with hyperscaling violation
Authors: J. Sadeghi and B. Pourhassan and A. Asadi
Abstract: In this paper, we start with black brane and construct specific space-time which violates hyperscaling. In order to obtain the string solution we apply Null-Melvin-Twist and $KK$-reduction. By using the difference action method we study thermodynamics of system to obtain Hawking-Page phase transition. In order to have hyperscaling violation we need to consider $\theta=\frac{d}{2}.$ In that case the free energy $F$ is always negative and our solution is thermal radiation without a black hole. Therefore we find that there is not any Hawking-Page transition. Also, we discuss the stability of system and all thermodynamical quantities.
