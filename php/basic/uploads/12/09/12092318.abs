Title: Some tt* structures and their integral Stokes data
Authors: Martin A. Guest and Chang-Shou Lin
Abstract: In "Isomonodromy aspects of the tt* equations of Cecotti and Vafa I. Stokes data" (arxiv:1209.2045) we described all smooth solutions of the two-function tt*-Toda equations in terms of asymptotic data, holomorphic data, and monodromy data. In this supplementary article we focus on the holomorphic data and its interpretation in quantum cohomology, and enumerate those solutions with integral Stokes data. This leads to a characterization of quantum D-modules for certain complete intersections of Fano type in weighted projective spaces.
