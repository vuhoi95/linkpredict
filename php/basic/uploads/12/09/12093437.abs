Title: Emergent Universe Scenario via Quintom Matter
Authors: Yi-Fu Cai and Mingzhe Li and Xinmin Zhang
Abstract: The emergent universe scenario provides a possible alternative to bouncing cosmology to avoid the Big Bang singularity problem. In this paper we study the realization of the emergent universe scenario by making use of Quintom matter with an equation of state across the cosmological constant boundary. We will show explicitly the analytic and numerical solutions of emergent universe in two Quintom models, which are a phenomenological fluid and a nonconventional spinor field, respectively.
