Title: Entropy and entanglement in polymer quantization
Authors: Tommaso F. Demarie and Daniel R. Terno
Abstract: Polymer quantization is as a useful toy model for the mathematical aspects of loop quantum gravity and is interesting in its own right. Analyzing entropies of physically equivalent states in the standard Hilbert space and the polymer Hilbert space we show that they converge in the limit of vanishing polymer scale. We derive a general bound that relates entropies of physically equivalent states in unitarily inequivalent representations.
