Title: A Wald-like Formula for Energy
Authors: Aaron J. Amsel and Dan Gorbonos
Abstract: We present a simple "Wald-like" formula for gravitational energy about a constant curvature background spacetime. The formula is derived following the Abbott-Deser-Tekin approach for the definition of conserved asymptotic charges in higher-derivative gravity.
