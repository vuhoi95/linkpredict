Title: Strong restriction on inflationary vacua from the local gauge invariance  I: Local gauge invariance and infrared regularity
Authors: Takahiro Tanaka and Yuko Urakawa
Abstract: The primordial perturbation is widely accepted to be generated through the vacuum fluctuation of the scalar field which drives inflation. It is, however, not completely clear what is the natural vacuum in the inflationary universe particularly in the presence of non-linear interactions. In this series of papers, we will address this issue, focusing on the condition required for the removal of the divergence from the infrared (IR) contribution to loop diagrams. We show that requesting the gauge invariance in the local observable universe guarantees the IR regularity of the loop corrections beginning with a simple initial state. In our previous works, the IR regularity condition was discussed using the slow roll expansion, which restricts the background evolution of the inflationary universe. We will show more generally that requesting the gauge invariance/the IR regularity leads to non-trivial constraints on the allowed quantum states.
