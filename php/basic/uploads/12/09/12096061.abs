Title: A UV complete model of Large N Thermal QCD
Authors: Fang Chen and Long Chen and Keshav Dasgupta and Mohammed Mia and Olivier Trottier
Abstract: Many recent works on large N holographic QCD in the planar limit have not considered UV completions, restricting exclusively towards analyzing the IR physics. Due to this, the UV problems like Landau poles and divergences of Wilson loops including instabilities at high temperatures have not been addressed. In some of our recent papers, we have discussed a possible UV completion, which is conformal in the UV and confining in the far IR, that avoids the Landau poles and the Wilson loop divergences. In this paper we give a field theory realization of this including the complete RG flow. We extend our UV complete model to study scenarios both above and below the deconfinement temperature and argue how phase transition in our model should be understood. Interestingly, because of the UV completion, subtle issues like instability due to negative specific heat do not appear. We also briefly elucidate the advantages that our model may have over other models studying large N thermal QCD.
