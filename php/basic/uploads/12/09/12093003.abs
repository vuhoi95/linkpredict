Title: All G_2 invariant critical points of maximal supergravity
Authors: Andrea Borghese and Adolfo Guarino and Diederik Roest
Abstract: We perform an exhaustive classification of G_2 invariant extrema of the most general gauged N=8 supergravity in four dimensions. They comprise four branches of Anti-de Sitter solutions labelled by a single parameter. Interestingly, while the gauge groups vary with the parameters, the mass spectra are invariant. One of these is a new non-supersymmetric yet stable point. Our analysis includes the recently proposed family of SO(8) gauged supergravities and more.
