Title: Tachyon Vacuum of Bosonic Open String Field Theory in Marginally  Deformed Backgrounds
Authors: Shoko Inatomi and Isao Kishimoto and Tomohiko Takahashi
Abstract: We consider bosonic open string field theory in marginally deformed backgrounds, which is obtained by expanding the string field around the identity-based solutions associated with marginal deformations. We find a new set of string fields which satisfies the KBc algebra, but the nilpotent kinetic operator is that of the theory expanded around the identity-based marginal solution. By use of these string fields, we construct the tachyon vaccum solution in marginally deformed backgrounds. The vacuum energy density is equivalent to that of the tachyon vacuum without marginal deformations. The gauge invariant overlap is changed according to the effect of marginal deformations, as expected from known results in CFT. These results suggest that the vacuum energy is zero for the identity-based marginal solutions in the original theory.
