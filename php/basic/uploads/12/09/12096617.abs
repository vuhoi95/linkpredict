Title: Fermionic impurities in the unquenched ABJM
Authors: Georgios Itsios and Konstadinos Sfetsos and Dimitrios Zoakos
Abstract: We study, in a holographic setup, the effect of adding localized fermionic impurities to the three-dimensional Chern-Simons-matter theories with unquenched fields in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. The impurities are introduced as probe D6-branes extending along the radial direction and wrapping a five-dimensional submanifold inside a squashed CP^3. We analyze the straight flux tube embeddings and study the corresponding fluctuation modes of the D6-branes. The conformal dimensions of the operators dual to such fluctuations depend non-trivially on the ratio of the flavor number to the Chern-Simon level of the unquenched ABJM.
