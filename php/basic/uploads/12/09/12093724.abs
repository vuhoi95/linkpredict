Title: Local measurement of Λ using pulsar timing arrays
Authors: Domènec Espriu and Daniel Puigdomènech
Abstract: We have considered the propagation of gravitational waves (GW) in de Sitter space time and how a non-zero value of the cosmological constant might affect their detection in pulsar timing arrays (PTA). If {\Lambda} is different from zero waves are non-linear in Friedmann-Robertson-Walker coordinates and although the amount of non-linearity is very small it gives noticeable effects for GW originating in extragalactic sources such as spiraling black hole binaries. The results indicate that the timing residuals induced by gravitational waves from such sources in PTA would show a peculiar angular dependence with a marked enhancement around a particular value of the angle subtended by the source and the pulsars, depending mainly on the actual value of the cosmological constant and the distance to the source. The position of the peak could represent a gauge of the value of \Lambda. The enhancement that the new effect brings about could facilitate the first direct detection of gravitational waves while representing a local measurement of \Lambda.
