Title: Holographic Brownian Motion in Magnetic Environments
Authors: Willy Fischler and Juan F. Pedraza and Walter Tangarife Garcia
Abstract: Using the gauge/gravity correspondence, we study the dynamics of a heavy quark in two strongly-coupled systems at finite temperature: Super-Yang-Mills in the presence of a magnetic field and non-commutative Super-Yang-Mills. In the former, our results agree qualitatively with the expected behavior from weakly-coupled theories. In the latter, we propose a Langevin equation that accounts for the effects of non-commutativity and we find new interesting features. The equation resembles the structure of Brownian motion in the presence of a magnetic field and implies that the fluctuations along non-commutative directions are correlated. Moreover, our results show that the viscosity is smaller than the commutative case and that the diffusion properties of the quark are unaffected by non-commutativity. Finally, we compute the random force autocorrelator and verify that the fluctuation-dissipation theorem holds in the presence of non-commutativity.
