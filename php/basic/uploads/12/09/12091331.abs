Title: The Seiberg-Witten map for non-commutative pure gravity and vacuum  Maxwell theory
Authors: Elisabetta Di Grezia and Giampiero Esposito and Marco Figliolia and Patrizia Vitale
Abstract: In this paper the Seiberg-Witten map is first analyzed for non-commutative Yang-Mills theories with the related methods, developed in the literature, for its explicit construction, that hold for any gauge group. These are exploited to write down the second-order Seiberg-Witten map for pure gravity with a constant non-commutativity tensor. In the analysis of pure gravity when the classical space-time solves the vacuum Einstein equations, we find for three distinct vacuum solutions that the corresponding non-commutative field equations do not have solution to first order in non-commutativity, when the Seiberg-Witten map is eventually inserted. In the attempt of understanding whether or not this is a peculiar property of gravity, in the second part of the paper, the Seiberg-Witten map is considered in the simpler case of Maxwell theory in vacuum in the absence of charges and currents. Once more, no obvious solution of the non-commutative field equations is found, unless the electromagnetic potential depends in a very special way on the wave vector.
