Title: Analytical approaches to 2D CDT coupled to matter
Authors: Max R. Atkin and Stefan Zohren
Abstract: We review some recent results by Ambjorn et al. (1202.4435) and the authors (1202.4322,1203.5034) in which multicritical points of the CDT matrix model were found and in a particular example identified with a hard dimer model. This identification requires solving the combinatorial problem of counting configurations of dimers on CDTs.
