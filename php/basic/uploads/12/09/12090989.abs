Title: Effective Monopoles within Thick Branes
Authors: J. M. Hoff da Silva and Roldao da Rocha
Abstract: The monopole mass is revealed to be considerably modified in the thick braneworld paradigm, and depends on the position of the monopole in the brane as well. Accordingly, the monopole radius continuously increases, leading to an unacceptable setting that can be circumvented when the brane thickness has an upper limit. Despite such peculiar behavior, the quantum corrections accrued -- involving the classical monopole solution -- are shown to be still under control. We analyze the monopole's peculiarities also taking into account the localization of the gauge fields. Furthermore, some additional analysis in the thick braneworld context and the similar behavior evinced by the topological string are investigated.
