Title: BPS bounds in supersymmetric extensions of K field theories
Authors: C. Adam and J. M. Queiruga and J. Sanchez-Guillen and A. Wereszczynski
Abstract: We demonstrate that in the supersymmetric extensions of a class of generalized (or K) field theories introduced recently, the static energy satisfies a BPS bound in each topological sector. Further, the corresponding soliton solutions saturate the bound. We also find strong indications that the BPS bound shows up in the SUSY algebra as a central extension, as is the case in the well-known supersymmetric field theories with standard kinetic terms.
