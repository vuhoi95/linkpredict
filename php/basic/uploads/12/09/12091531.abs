Title: Cosmologically viable gauge mediation
Authors: Hiraku Fukushima and Ryuichiro Kitano and Fuminobu Takahashi
Abstract: Gauge mediation provides us with a complete picture of supersymmetry breaking and its mediation within the effective field theories, and thus allows us to discuss consistencies with low-energy particle physics as well as cosmological observations. We study in detail the cosmological evolution of the pseudo-modulus field in the supersymmetry breaking sector and also the production of the gravitinos in the early Universe in a simple (but a complete) model of gauge mediation. Under fairly reasonable assumptions, it is found that there exists a parameter region where dark matter of the Universe is explained by both thermally and non-thermally produced gravitinos, while the baryon asymmetry of the Universe is generated through the thermal leptogenesis.
