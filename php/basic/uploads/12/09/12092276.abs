Title: Dirac factorization and fractional calculus
Authors: D. Babusci and G. Dattoli and M. Quattromini and P. E. Ricci
Abstract: We show that the Dirac factorization method can be successfully employed to treat problems involving operators raised to a fractional power. The technique we adopt is based on an extension of the Pauli matrices and the properties of the roots of unity. We also comment about the possibility of using the method to linearize evolution equations containing the $n$-th root of differential operators and make a comparison with other techniques involving suitable transforms.
