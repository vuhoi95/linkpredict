Title: From motives to differential equations for loop integrals
Authors: S. MÃ¼ller-Stach and S. Weinzierl and R. Zayadeh
Abstract: In this talk we discuss how ideas from the theory of mixed Hodge structures can be used to find differential equations for Feynman integrals. In particular we discuss the two-loop sunrise graph in two dimensions and show that these methods lead to a differential equation which is simpler than the ones obtained from integration-by-parts.
