Abstract: In this note we describe several procedures to construct, from known black-hole and black-brane solutions of any ungauged supergravity theory, non-trivial gravitational solutions whose "near-horizon" and "near-singularity" limits are Lifshitz-like spacetimes with dynamical critical exponent z, "hyperscaling violation" exponent \theta and Lifshitz radius \ell that depends on the physical parameters of the original black-hole solution. Since the new Lifshitz-like solutions can be constructed from any black-hole solution of any ungauged supergravity, many of them can be easily embedded in String Theory. Some of the procedures produce supersymmetric Lifshitz-like solutions.
