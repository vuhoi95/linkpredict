Title: Scalar-Graviton Scattering in Noncommutative Space and Deformed Newton  Gravity
Authors: A. Jahan and A. Parvishi
Abstract: The isotropy of Newton potential in noncommutative space disappears as it deforms to a momentum dependent one. We generalize the earlier derivation of such a deformed potential to the relativistic regime by calculating the 2 scalar-1 graviton scattering amplitude by taking into account the noncommutativity of space.
