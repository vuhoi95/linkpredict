Title: Stochastic Bias from Non-Gaussian Initial Conditions
Authors: Daniel Baumann and Simone Ferraro and Daniel Green and Kendrick M. Smith
Abstract: In this article, we show that a stochastic form of scale-dependent halo bias arises in multi-source inflationary models, where multiple fields determine the initial curvature perturbation. We derive this effect for general non-Gaussian initial conditions and study various examples, such as curvaton models and quasi-single field inflation. We present a general formula for both the stochastic and the non-stochastic parts of the halo bias, in terms of the N-point cumulants of the curvature perturbation at the end of inflation. At lowest order, the stochasticity arises if the collapsed limit of the four-point function is boosted relative to the square of the three-point function in the squeezed limit. We derive all our results in two ways, using the barrier crossing formalism and the peak-background split method. In a companion paper, we prove that these two approaches are mathematically equivalent.
