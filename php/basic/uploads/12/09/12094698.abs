Title: Local thermodynamics of KS black hole
Authors: Myungseok Eune and Bogeun Gwak and Wontae Kim
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of the KS black hole which is an asymptotically flat solution of the HL gravity. In particular, we introduce a cavity to describe the thermodynamics at a finite isothermal surface on general ground and to get a well-defined thermodynamics. We show that there exists a locally stable small black hole which tunnels to the hot flat space below the critical temperature and to the large black hole above the critical temperature. Moreover, it turns out that the remnant decays into the vacuum through a quantum tunneling.
