Authors: Roldao da Rocha and M. A. Traesel and Jayme Vaz Jr
Abstract: In this paper we discuss generalized properties of non-associativity in Clifford bundles on the 7-sphere S7. Novel and prominent properties inherited from the non-associative structure of the Clifford bundle on S7 are demonstrated. They naturally lead to general transformations of the spinor fields on S7 and have dramatic consequences for the associated Kac-Moody current algebras. All additional properties concerning the non-associative structure in the Clifford bundle on S7 are considered. We further discuss and explore their applications.
