Title: Topology of Minimal Walking Technicolor
Authors: Ed Bennett and Biagio Lucini
Abstract: We perform a lattice study of the topological susceptibility and instanton size distribution of the $\su{2}$ gauge theory with two adjoint Dirac fermions (also known as Minimal Walking Technicolor), which is known to be in the conformal window. In the theory deformed with a small mass term, by drawing a comparison with the pure gauge theory, we find that topological observables are decoupled from the fermion dynamics. This provides further evidence for the infrared conformality of the theory. A study of the instanton size distribution shows that this quantity can be used to detect the onset of finite size effects.
