Abstract: We make a first study of the phase diagram of four-dimensional N=4 super Yang-Mills theory regulated on a space-time lattice. The lattice formulation we employ is both gauge invariant and retains at all lattice spacings one exactly preserved supersymmetry charge. Our numerical results are consistent with the existence of a single deconfined phase at all observed values of the bare coupling.
