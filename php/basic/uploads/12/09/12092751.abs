Abstract: The Julia-Toulouse approach for condensation of charges and defects is used to show that the bosonized Schwinger model can be obtained through a condensation of electric charges in 1+1 dimensions. The massive model is derived by taking into account the presence of vortices over the electric condensate, while the massless model is obtained when these vortices are absent. This construction is then straightforwardly generalized for arbitrary d+1 spacetime dimensions. The d=3 case corresponds to the large N chiral dynamics of SU(N) QCD in the limit $N\rightarrow\infty$.
