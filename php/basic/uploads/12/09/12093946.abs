Title: Charged Black Branes with Hyperscaling Violating Factor
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha and Eoin Ó Colgáin and Hossein Yavartanoo
Abstract: We present an analytic solution of a charged black hole with hyperscaling violating factor in an Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton model where the scalar potential is key to the existence of a solution. This solution provides a candidate gravitational description of theories with hyperscaling violation at both finite temperature and finite charge density. Using this background we explore certain features of these theories via AdS/CFT correspondence. Finally, we discuss embeddings based on the well-known sphere reductions of ten and eleven-dimensional supergravity.
