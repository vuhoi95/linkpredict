Title: On the $\star$-product quantization and the Duflo map in three  dimensions
Authors: Luigi Rosa and Patrizia Vitale
Abstract: We analyze the star product induced on the algebra of functions on R^3 by a suitable reduction of the Moyal product defined on F(R^4). This is obtained through the identification of R^3 with the dual of a three dimensional Lie algebra. We consider the su(2) case, exhibit a matrix basis and realize the algebra of functions on its dual in such a basis. The relation to the Duflo map is discussed. As an application to quantum mechanics we compute the spectrum of the hydrogen atom.
