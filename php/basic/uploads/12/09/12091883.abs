Title: Entanglement entropy in long-range harmonic oscillators
Authors: M. Ghasemi Nezhadhaghighi and M. A. Rajabpour
Abstract: We study the Von Neumann and R\'enyi entanglement entropy of long-range harmonic oscillators (LRHO) by both theoretical and numerical means. We show that the entanglement entropy in massless harmonic oscillators increases logarithmically with the sub-system size as $S=\frac{c_{eff}}{3}\log l$. Although the entanglement entropy of LRHO's shares some similarities with the entanglement entropy at conformal critical points we show that the R\'enyi entanglement entropy presents some deviations from the expected conformal behavior. In the massive case we demonstrate that the behavior of the entanglement entropy with respect to the correlation length is also logarithmic as the short range case.
