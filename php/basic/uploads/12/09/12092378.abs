Title: Charged Boson Stars in AdS and a Zero Temperature Phase Transition
Authors: Sanle Hu and James T. Liu and Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas
Abstract: We numerically construct charged boson stars in asymptotically AdS spacetime. We find an intricate phase diagram dominated by solutions whose main matter contribution are alternately provided by the scalar field or by the gauge field.
