Authors: Rong-Gen Cai and Shankhadeep Chakrabortty and Song He and Li Li
Abstract: We continue to study the holographic QCD (hQCD) model, proposed in a previous paper, in an Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) system. In this paper we discuss some aspects of quark gluon plasma (QGP) in the hQCD model, such as drag force, jet quenching parameter and screening length. The results turn out to be consistent with those as expected in QCD qualitatively. By calculating free energy of the background black hole solution, we find that there exists a Hawking-Page phase transition between small black hole and big black hole when chemical potential $\mu $ is less than a critical one $ \mu_c$, and the phase transition is absent when chemical potential is beyond the critical one.
