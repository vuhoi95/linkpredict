Title: N=1 supersymmetric higher spin holography on AdS_3
Authors: Thomas Creutzig and Yasuaki Hikida and Peter B. Ronne
Abstract: We propose a duality between a higher spin N=1 supergravity on AdS_3 and a large N limit of a family of N=(1,1) superconformal field theories. The gravity theory is an N=1 truncation of the N=2 supergravity found by Prokushkin and Vasiliev, and the dual conformal field theory is defined by a supersymmetric coset model. We check this conjecture by comparing one loop partition functions and find agreement. Moreover, we study the symmetry of the dual coset model and in particular compute fields of the coset algebra of dimension 3/2, 2, 2 and 5/2 explicitely.
