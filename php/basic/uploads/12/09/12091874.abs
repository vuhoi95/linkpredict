Authors: J. Sadeghi and B. Pourhassan and F. Pourasadollah
Abstract: In this work, we follow Kim and Yamada (JHEP1107 (2011) 120) and utilize AdS in light-cone frame to derive thermodynamic and transport properties of two kinds of Schr\"{o}dinger black holes with hyperscaling violation. In that case, we show entropy and temperature are depend on $\theta$. In $\theta=0$ we see our results are agree with the work of Kim and Yamada. We also construct R-charged black hole with hyperscaling violation and obtain thermodynamics and transport properties.
