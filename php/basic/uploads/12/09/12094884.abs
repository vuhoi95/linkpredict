Title: Symmetric backgrounds of type IIB supergravity
Authors: Jos√© Figueroa-O'Farrill and Noel Hustler
Abstract: In this paper we study homogeneous backgrounds of type IIB supergravity where the underlying geometry is that of a symmetric space. We determine which ten-dimensional lorentzian symmetric spaces (up to local isometry) admit such backgrounds and in about two thirds of the cases we determine fully their moduli space.
