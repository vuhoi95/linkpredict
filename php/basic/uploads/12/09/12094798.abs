Title: Aspects of dynamical dimensional reduction in multigraph ensembles of  CDT
Authors: Georgios Giasemidis and John F. Wheater and Stefan Zohren
Abstract: We study the continuum limit of a "radially reduced" approximation of Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT), so-called multigraph ensembles, and explain why they serve as realistic toy models to study the dimensional reduction observed in numerical simulations of four-dimensional CDT. We present properties of this approximation in two, three and four dimensions comparing them with the numerical simulations and pointing out some common features with 2+1 dimensional Horava-Lifshitz gravity.
