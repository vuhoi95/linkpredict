Authors: Elina Seel and Dominik Smith and Stefano Lottini and Francesco Giacosa
Abstract: A detailed study of the thermodynamics of the O(N=3) model in 1+1 dimensions is presented, employing a two-particle-irreducible resummation prescription as well as fully nonperturbative finite-temperature lattice simulations. The analytical results are computed using the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) formalism and the auxiliary field method to one- and to two-loop order. The lattice results are obtained through Monte Carlo simulation for various lattice spacings. The analytical and lattice results for pressure, trace anomaly, and energy density, resembling closely those of four-dimensional Yang-Mills theories, are compared with each other. We find that to one-loop order there is a good correspondence between the CJT formalism and the lattice study for low temperatures. However, at high T the two-loop calculation fares better, correcting for the overestimation from the former approximation.
