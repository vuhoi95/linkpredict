Title: Dilatons and the Dynamical Collapse of Charged Scalar Field
Authors: Anna Nakonieczna and Marek Rogatko
Abstract: We studied the influence of dilaton field on the dynamical collapse of a charged scalar one. Different values of the initial amplitude of dilaton field as well as the altered values of the dilatonic coupling constant were considered. We described structures of spacetimes and properties of black holes emerging from the collapse of electrically charged scalar field in dilaton gravity. Moreover, we provided a meaningful comparison of the collapse in question with the one in Einstein gravity, when dilaton field is absent and its coupling with the scalar field is equal to zero. The course and results of the dynamical collapse process seem to be very sensitive to the amplitude of dilaton field and to the value of the coupling constant in the underlying theory.
