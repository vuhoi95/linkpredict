Title: M5/D4 brane partition function on a circle bundle
Authors: Dongsu Bak and Andreas Gustavsson
Abstract: We consider Abelian M5 brane on a six-manifold which we take as a circle bundle over a five-manifold $M$. We compute the zero mode part of the M5 brane partition function using Chern-Simons theory and Hamiltonian formulation respectively and find an agreement. We also show that the D4 brane on $M$ shares exactly the same zero mode partition function again using the Hamiltonian formulation. For the oscillator modes we find that KK modes associated with the circle compactification are missing from the D4 brane. By making an infinitesimal noncommutative deformation we have instanton threshold bound states. We explicitly compute the instanton partition function up to instanton charge three, and show a perfect match with a corresponding contribution inside the M5 brane partition function, thus providing a very strong supporting evidence that D4 brane is identical with M5 brane which extends beyond the BPS sector. We comment on the modular properties of the M5 brane partition function when compactified on $T^2$ times a four-manifold. We briefly discuss a case of a singular fibration.
