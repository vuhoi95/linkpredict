Title: What is the origin of the mass of the Higgs boson?
Authors: M. Novello and E. Bittencourt
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to present a unified description of mass generation mechanisms that have been investigated so far and that are called the Mach and Higgs proposals. In our mechanism, gravity acts merely as a catalyst and the final expression of the mass depends neither on the intensity nor on the particular properties of the gravitational field. We shall see that these two strategies to provide mass for all bodies that operate independently and competitively can be combined into a single unified theoretical framework. As a consequence of this new formulation we are able to present an answer to the question: what is the origin of the mass of the Higgs boson?
