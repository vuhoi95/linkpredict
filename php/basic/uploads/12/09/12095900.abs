Title: Î±'-Corrected Chiral Magnetic Effect
Authors: M. Ali-Akbari and S. F. Taghavi
Abstract: Using AdS/CFT correspondence, the effect of alpha'-correction on the value of Chiral Magnetic Effect(CME) is computed by adding a number of spinning probe D7-branes in the $\alpha'$-corrected background. We show that although for the massive solutions the magnitude of CME increases in the presence of alpha'-correction, it does not change for the massless solution. However some of the D7-brane embeddings have no CME, after applying alpha'-correction, they find a non-zero value for the CME. As a result the number of solutions with a non-zero CME increases. We also show that the effect of alpha'-correction removes the singularity from some of the D7-brane embeddings.
