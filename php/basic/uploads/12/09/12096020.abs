Abstract: We extend our investigation of resonance production in the Sakai-Sugimoto model to the case of negative parity baryon resonances. Using holographic techniques we extract the generalized Dirac and Pauli baryon form factors as well as the helicity amplitudes for these baryonic states. Identifying the first negative parity resonance with the experimentally observed S_{11}(1535), we find reasonable agreement with experimental data from the JLab-CLAS collaboration. We also estimate the contribution of negative parity baryons to the proton structure functions.
