Title: Pomeron dynamics in the AdS space and structure functions of hadrons at  small x
Authors: Akira Watanabe and Katsuhiko Suzuki
Abstract: The Pomeron dynamics is investigated via deep inelastic scattering (DIS) at small x in the framework of holographic quantum chromodynamics. The small x DIS process is assumed to be described by the graviton exchange between external vector current and hadron in the AdS space. Our calculations for $F_2^p$, $F_2^\pi$, as well as the longitudinal counterpart $F_L^p$ are consistent with the experimental data. We discuss origins of a difference between $F_2$ and $F_L$ in our approach.
