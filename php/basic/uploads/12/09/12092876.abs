Abstract: We consider the relativistic generalization of the harmonic oscillator problem by addressing different questions regarding its classical aspects. We treat the problem using the formalism of Hamiltonian mechanics. A Lie algebraic technique is used to solve the associated Liouville equations, yielding the phase space evolution of an ensemble of relativistic particles, subject to a "harmonic" potential. The non-harmonic distortion of the spatial and momentum distributions due to the intrinsic non-linear nature of the relativistic contributions are discussed. We analyze the relativistic dynamics induced by two types of Hamiltonian, which can ascribed to those of harmonic oscillators type. Finally, we briefly discuss the quantum aspects of the problem by considering possible strategies for the solution of the associated Salpeter equation.
