Title: Processing quantum information with relativistic motion of atoms
Authors: Eduardo Martin-Martinez and David Aasen and Achim Kempf
Abstract: We show that particle detectors, such as 2-level atoms, in non-inertial motion (or in gravitational fields) could be used to build quantum gates for the processing of quantum information. Concretely, we show that through suitably chosen non-inertial trajectories of the detectors the interaction Hamiltonian's time dependence can be modulated to yield arbitrary rotations in the Bloch sphere due to relativistic quantum effects.
