Title: Relative helicity phases in planar Dirac scattering
Authors: Stefano De Leo and Pietro Rotelli
Abstract: We study planar Dirac scattering for an electrostatic stratified barrier potential. The general expressions for transmitted and reflected waves are derived. Of particular interest is the information upon relative helicity phases. We also briefly discuss some possible applications.
