Title: Isomonodromy aspects of the tt* equations of Cecotti and Vafa I. Stokes  data
Authors: Martin A. Guest and Alexander R. Its and Chang-Shou Lin
Abstract: We describe all smooth solutions of the two-function tt*-Toda equations (a version of the tt* equations, or equations for harmonic maps into SL(n,R)/SO(n)) in terms of (i) asymptotic data, (ii) holomorphic data, and (iii) monodromy data. This allows us to find all solutions with integral Stokes data. These include solutions associated to nonlinear sigma models (quantum cohomology) or Landau-Ginzburg models (unfoldings of singularities), as conjectured by Cecotti and Vafa.
