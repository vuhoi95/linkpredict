Abstract: Large-N_c QCD matter at intermediate baryon density and low temperatures has been conjectured to be in the so-called quarkyonic phase, i.e., to have a quark Fermi surface and on top of it a confined spectrum of excitations. It has been suggested that the presence of the quark Fermi surface leads to a homogeneous phase with restored chiral symmetry, which is unstable towards creating condensates breaking both the chiral and translational symmetry. Motivated by these exotic features, we investigate properties of cold baryonic matter in the single flavor Sakai-Sugimoto model searching for a holographic realization of the quarkyonic phase. We use a simplified mean-field description and focus on the regime of parametrically large baryon densities, of the order of the square of the 't Hooft coupling, as they turn out to lead to new physical effects similar to the ones occurring in the quarkyonic phase. One effect, the appearance of a particular marginally stable mode breaking translational invariance and linked with the presence of the Chern-Simons term in the flavor brane Lagrangian, is known to occur in the deconfined phase of the Sakai-Sugimoto model, but turns out to be absent here. The other, completely new phenomenon that we, preliminarily, study using strong simplifying assumptions are density-enhanced interactions of the flavor brane gauge field with holographically represented baryons. These seem to significantly affect the spectrum of vector and axial mesons and might lead to approximate chiral symmetry restoration in the lowest part of the spectrum, where the mesons start to qualitatively behave like collective excitations of the dense baryonic medium. We discuss the relevance of these effects for holographic searches of the quarkyonic phase and conclude with a discussion of various subtleties involved in constructing a mean-field holographic description of a dense baryonic medium.
