Title: Exotic symmetry and monodromy equivalence in Schrodinger sigma models
Authors: Io Kawaguchi and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We consider the classical integrable structure of two-dimensional non-linear sigma models with target space three-dimensional Schrodinger spacetimes. There are the two descriptions to describe the classical dynamics: 1) the left description based on SL(2,R)_L and 2) the right description based on U(1)_R. We have shown the sl(2,R)_L Yangian and q-deformed Poincare algebras associated with them. We proceed to argue an infinite-dimensional extension of the q-deformed Poincare algebra. The corresponding charges are constructed by using a non-local map from the flat conserved currents related to the Yangian. The exotic tower structure of the charges is revealed by directly computing the classical Poisson brackets. Then the monodromy matrices in both descriptions are shown to be gauge-equivalent via the relation between the spectral parameters. We also give a simple Riemann sphere interpretation of this equivalence.
