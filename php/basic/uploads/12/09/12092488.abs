Title: Gravity Mediation Retrofitted
Authors: Milton Bose and Michael Dine
Abstract: Most discussion of metastable dynamical supersymmetry breaking (MDSB) has focussed on low energy breaking, as in gauge mediation. It is of interest to consider possible implications for intermediate scale breaking ("gravity mediation"), especially as the early LHC results suggest the possibility that supersymmetry, if broken at relatively low energies, might be tuned. A somewhat high scale for susy breaking could ameliorate the usual flavor problems of gravity mediation, resolve the question of cosmological moduli, and account for a Higgs with mass well above $M_Z$. We study MDSB in gravity mediation, especially retrofitted models in which discrete $R$ symmetries play an important role, considering questions including implications of symmetries for $B$ and $A$ terms, and the genericity of split supersymmetry.
