Title: A String Theory Explanation for Quantum Chaos in the Hadronic Spectrum
Authors: Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas and Dori Reichmann
Abstract: In the 1950's Wigner and collaborators provided an explanation for the spectrum of hadronic excitations in terms of Random Matrix Theory. In the 1980's it was understood that some hadronic spectral properties were generic to systems whose classical limit is chaotic. We use string theory to demonstrate explicitly how, under very general conditions, recent holographic models of strong interactions have a spectrum compatible with Wigner's conjecture.
