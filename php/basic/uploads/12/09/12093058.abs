Title: Physics of three dimensional bosonic topological insulators: Surface  Deconfined Criticality and Quantized Magnetoelectric Effect
Authors: Ashvin Vishwanath and T. Senthil
Abstract: We discuss physical properties of `integer' topological phases of bosons in D=3+1 dimensions, protected by internal symmetries like time reversal and/or charge conservation. These phases invoke interactions in a fundamental way but do not possess topological order and are bosonic analogs of free fermion topological insulators and superconductors. While a formal cohomology based classification of such states was recently discovered, their physical properties remain mysterious. Here we develop a field theoretic description of several of these states and show that they possess unusual surface states, which if gapped, must either break the underlying symmetry, or develop topological order. In the latter case, symmetries are implemented in a way that is forbidden in a strictly two dimensional theory. While this is the usual fate of the surface states, exotic gapless states can also be realized. For example, tuning parameters can naturally lead to a deconfined quantum critical point or, in other situations, a fully symmetric vortex metal phase. We discuss cases where the topological phases are characterized by quantized magnetoelectric response \theta, which, somewhat surprisingly, is an odd multiple of 2\pi. Two different surface theories are shown to capture these phenomena - the first is a nonlinear sigma model with a topological term. The second invokes vortices on the surface that transform under a projective representation of the symmetry group. A bulk field theory consistent with these properties is identified, which is a multicomponent `BF' theory supplemented, crucially, with a topological term. A possible topological phase characterized by the thermal analog of the magnetoelectric effect is also discussed.
