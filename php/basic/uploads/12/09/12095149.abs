Abstract: We investigate a holographic description of k-strings in higher representations via D5 branes with worldvolume fluxes. The D-brane configurations are embedded in supergravity backgrounds dual to confining field theories in 3 and 4 dimensions. We compute the tensions and find qualitative agreement for the totally symmetric and totally anti-symmetric representations with the results of other methods such as lattice as well as the Hamiltonian approach of Karabali and Nair. A one-loop computation on the D-brane configurations yields the Luescher term and allows us to confirm a previously proposed universal expression following from holography.
