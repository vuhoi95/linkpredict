Title: Reheating in 3-form inflation
Authors: Antonio De Felice and Khamphee Karwan and Pitayuth Wongjun
Abstract: We consider the 3-form field, which has been considered as a candidate for realizing inflation, coupled to a scalar field which models the relativistic matter particles produced during the reheating epoch. We have investigated the stability conditions for this theory and found that introducing such a coupling does not lead to any ghosts or Laplacian instabilities. We have also investigated the reheating temperature and the production of particles due to parametric resonances. We have found that this process is more efficient in this theory compared to the result of the standard-scalar-field inflationary scenario.
