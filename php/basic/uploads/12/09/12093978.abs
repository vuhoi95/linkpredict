Title: Moduli Stabilization in a de Sitter Compactification Model
Authors: Antonino Flachi and Masato Minamitsuji and Kunihito Uzawa
Abstract: We discuss the moduli stabilization in a de Sitter compactification model obtained coupling D-dimensional gravity to scalar and gauge fields. This class of models is characterized by two moduli: one related to the volume of the internal space, the other to the warp factor. While the volume modulus can be fixed by appropriately tuning the gauge field strength, curvature of the internal space, and cosmological constant, the same mechanism does not work for the warp modulus. In this paper we discuss a stabilization mechanism based on quantum effects and show that both moduli can be efficiently stabilized.
