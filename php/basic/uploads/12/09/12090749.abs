Title: Six-loop Konishi anomalous dimension from the Y-system
Authors: Sebastien Leurent and Didina Serban and Dmytro Volin
Abstract: We compute the Konishi anomalous dimension perturbatively up to six loop using the finite set of functional equations derived recently by Gromov, Kazakov, Leurent and Volin. The recursive procedure can be in principle extended to higher loops, the only obstacle being the complexity of the computation.
