Title: Groundstate projection of the charged SU(2) polarization tensor in a  chromomagnetic background field
Authors: M. Bordag and V. Skalozub
Abstract: We consider the polarization tensor of a color charged gluon field in SU(2) in the background of a homogeneous color magnetic field and calculate its projection onto the lower (tachyonic) state. We obtain a quite simple representation of the polarization tensor in terms of double parametric integral. We provide examples for the numerical evaluation of the polarization tensor in this case. Also, we consider the corresponding expressions at high temperature and calculate the charged gluon magnetic mass in this limit. We conclude that radiation corrections stabilize the ground state. Applications of the results obtained are discussed.
