Title: The heterotic string yields natural supersymmetry
Authors: Sven Krippendorf and Hans Peter Nilles and Michael Ratz and Martin Wolfgang Winkler
Abstract: The most promising MSSM candidates of the heterotic string reveal some distinctive properties. These include gauge-top unification, a specific solution to the mu-problem and mirage pattern for the gaugino masses. The location of the top- and the Higgs-multiplets in extra dimensions differs significantly from that of the other quarks and leptons leading to a characteristic signature of suppressed soft breaking terms, reminiscent of a scheme known as natural supersymmetry.
