Title: Static Charges in the Low-Energy Theory of the S-Duality Twist
Authors: Ori J. Ganor and Yoon Pyo Hong and Ruza Markov and Hai Siong Tan
Abstract: We continue the study of the low-energy limit of N=4 super Yang-Mills theory compactified on a circle with S-duality and R-symmetry twists that preserve N=6 supersymmetry in 2+1D. We introduce external static supersymmetric quark and anti-quark sources into the theory and calculate the Witten Index of the resulting Hilbert space of ground states on a torus. Using these results we compute the action of simple Wilson loops on the Hilbert space of ground states without sources. In some cases we find disagreement between our results for the Wilson loop eigenvalues and previous conjectures about a connection with Chern-Simons theory.
