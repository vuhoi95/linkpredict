Title: Helicity Spinor Methods and Tree Level QCD Corrections in Higgs  Production via Weak Boson Fusion
Authors: A. R. Fazio and S. C. Vargas
Abstract: We calculate analytically tree level amplitudes for Higgs production via Weak Bosons Fusion (WBF) and QCD corrections to the Standard Model prediction (SM) by using the helicity spinor formalism. We provide the explicit expression for the amplitude with two gluons emission in the final state together with massless final two quarks. The massive generalization of the Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten (BCFW) recursion scheme is applied successfully obtaining compact results which agree with, and overcome in simplicity, the conventional Feynman diagrams approach.
