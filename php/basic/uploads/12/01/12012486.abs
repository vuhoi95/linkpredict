Authors: Da-Zhu Ma and Yue Cao and Jian-Pin Wu
Abstract: In this letter we construct the St\"{u}ckelberg holographic superconductor with Weyl corrections. Under such corrections, the Weyl coupling parameter $\gamma$ plays an important role in the order of phase transitions and the critical exponents of second order phase transitions. So do the model parameters $c_{\alpha}$, $\alpha$ and $c_{4}$. Moreover, we show that the Weyl coupling parameter $\gamma$ and the model parameters $c_{\alpha}$, $\alpha$, $c_{4}$ which together control the size and strength of the conductivity coherence peak and the ratio of gap frequency over critical temperature $\omega_{g}/T_{c}$.
