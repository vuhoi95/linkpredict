Title: Noncommutative spectral geometry, dissipation and the origin of  quantization
Authors: Mairi Sakellariadou and Antonio Stabile and Giuseppe Vitiello
Abstract: We present a physical interpretation of the doubling of the algebra, which is the basic ingredient of the noncommutative spectral geometry, developed by Connes and collaborators as an approach to unification. We discuss its connection to dissipation and to the gauge structure of the theory. We then argue, following 't Hooft's conjecture, that noncommutative spectral geometry classical construction carries implicit in its feature of the doubling of the algebra the seeds of quantization.
