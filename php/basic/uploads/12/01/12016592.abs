Title: Black branes in AdS: BPS bounds and asymptotic charges
Authors: Kiril Hristov and Chiara Toldo and Stefan Vandoren
Abstract: We focus on black branes and toroidal black holes in N=2 gauged supergravities that asymptote to AdS_4, and derive formulas for the mass and central charge densities. We derive the corresponding BPS bound from the superalgebra of the asymptotic vacuum and illustrate our procedure with explicit examples of genuine black brane solutions with non-trivial scalars.
