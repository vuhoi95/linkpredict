Title: Localized O6-plane solutions with Romans mass
Authors: Fabio Saracco and Alessandro Tomasiello
Abstract: Orientifold solutions have an unphysical region around their source; for the O6, the singularity is resolved in M-theory by the Atiyah-Hitchin metric. Massive IIA, however, does not admit an eleven-dimensional lift, and one wonders what happens to the O6 there. In this paper, we find evidence for the existence of localized (unsmeared) O6 solutions in presence of Romans mass, in the context of four-dimensional compactifications. As a first step, we show that for generic supersymmetric compactifications, the Bianchi identity for the F_4 RR field follows from constancy of F_0. Using this, we find a procedure to deform any O6-D6 Minkowski compactification at first order in F_0. For a single O6, some of the symmetries of the massless solution are broken, but what is left is still enough to obtain a system of ODEs with as many variables as equations. Numerical analysis indicates that Romans mass makes the unphysical region disappear.
