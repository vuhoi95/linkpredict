Title: Quantum frameness for Charge-Parity-Time (CPT) inversion symmetry
Authors: Michael Skotiniotis and Ian T. Durham and Borzu Toloui and Barry C. Sanders
Abstract: We develop a charge-parity-time (CPT) frameness resource theory to circumvent CPT- superselection. We construct and quantify such resources for spins 0, 1/2, and 1 and for Majorana particles, and we show that spin 0 particles only admit classical information processing whereas particles of higher-dimensional spin permit quantum information processing in the presence of CPT-superselection. Our treatment of CPT inversion as indecomposable circumvents the anti-unitarity of certain actions (C and T) by strictly considering the aggregate CPT.
