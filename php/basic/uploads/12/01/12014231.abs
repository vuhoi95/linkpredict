Title: Non-perturbative gauge couplings from holography
Authors: Marco Billo and Marialuisa Frau and Luca Giacone and Alberto Lerda
Abstract: We show how D-instanton corrections modify the dilaton-axion profile emitted by an O7/D7 system turning it into the non-singular F-theory background which corresponds to the effective coupling on a D3 probe.
