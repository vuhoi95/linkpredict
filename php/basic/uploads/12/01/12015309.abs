Title: Inflation with Multi-Vector-Hair: The Fate of Anisotropy
Authors: Kei Yamamoto and Masa-aki Watanabe and Jiro Soda
Abstract: We study inflation with multiple vector fields. In the presence of non-trivial couplings between the inflaton and the vector fields, it turns out that no-hair conjecture does not hold and vector-hair appears. In the case of uniform couplings, nevertheless, we find that the universe approaches an isotropic final state after transient anisotropic inflationary phases. For general couplings, we numerically show attractors are anisotropic inflation. Even in these cases, it turns out that the inflation always tends to minimize the anisotropy in the expansion of the universe.
