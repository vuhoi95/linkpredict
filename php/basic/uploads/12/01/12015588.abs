Title: Quantum states to brane geometries via fuzzy moduli spaces of giant  gravitons
Authors: Jurgis Pasukonis and Sanjaye Ramgoolam
Abstract: Eighth-BPS local operators in N=4 SYM are dual to quantum states arising from the quantization of a moduli space of giant gravitons in AdS5xS5. Earlier results on the quantization of this moduli space give a Hilbert space of multiple harmonic oscillators in 3 dimensions. We use these results, along with techniques from fuzzy geometry, to develop a map between quantum states and brane geometries. In particular there is a map between the oscillator states and points in a discretization of the base space in the toric fibration of the moduli space. We obtain a geometrical decomposition of the space of BPS states with labels consisting of U(3) representations along with U(N) Young diagrams and associated group theoretic multiplicities. Factorization properties in the counting of BPS states lead to predictions for BPS world-volume excitations of specific brane geometries. Some of our results suggest an intriguing complementarity between localisation in the moduli space of branes and localisation in space-time.
