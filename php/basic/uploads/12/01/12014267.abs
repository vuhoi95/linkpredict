Title: The Cardy-Cartan modular invariant
Authors: Jurgen Fuchs and Christoph Schweigert and Carl Stigner
Abstract: Using factorizable Hopf algebras, we construct modular invariant partition functions of charge conjugation, or Cardy, type as characters of coends in categories that share essential features with the ones appearing in logarithmic CFT. The coefficients of such a partition function are given by the Cartan matrix of the theory.
