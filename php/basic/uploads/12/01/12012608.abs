Title: Leading logarithms in the anomalous sector of two-flavour QCD
Authors: Johan Bijnens and Karol Kampf and Stefan Lanz
Abstract: We add the Wess-Zumino-Witten term to the N=3 massive nonlinear sigma model and study the leading logarithms in the anomalous sector. We obtain the leading logarithms to six loops for \pi^0 --> \gamma^*\gamma^* and to five loops for \gamma^*\pi\pi\pi. In addition we extend the earlier work on the mass and decay constant to six loops and the vector form factor to five loops. We present numerical result for the anomalous processes and the vector form factor. In all cases the series are found to converge rapidly.
