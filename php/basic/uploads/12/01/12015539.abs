Title: Line Operator Index on S1 $\times$ S3
Authors: Dongmin Gang and Eunkyung Koh and Kimyeong Lee
Abstract: We derive a general formula of an index for N = 2 superconformal field theories on S1 \times S3 with insertions of BPS Wilson line or 't Hooft line operator at the north pole and their anti-counterpart at the south pole of S3. One-loop and monopole bubbling effects are taken into account in the computation. As examples, we calculate the indices for N = 4 theories and N = 2 SU(2) theory with Nf = 4, and find good agreements between indices of line operators related by S-duality. The relation between Verlinde loop operators and the indices is explored. The holographic correspondence between the fundamental (anti-symmetric) Wilson line operator and the fundamental string (D5 brane) in AdS5\timesS5 is confirmed by the index comparison.
