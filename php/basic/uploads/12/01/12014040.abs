Title: The Kerr-Newman/CFTs Correspondence
Authors: Chiang-Mei Chen and Jia-Rui Sun
Abstract: In this article, we review recent studies on multiple dual 2D CFT descriptions of the Kerr-Newman black hole, in terms of the Kerr/CFT and Reissner-Nordstr\"om/CFT correspondences. A microscopic hair conjecture is suggested.
