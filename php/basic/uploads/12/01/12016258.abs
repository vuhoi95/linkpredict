Title: Generalized quark-antiquark potential in AdS/CFT
Authors: Valentina Forini and Nadav Drukker
Abstract: In this talk we present a family of Wilson loop operators which continuously interpolates between the 1/2 BPS line and the antiparallel lines, and can be thought of as calculating a generalization of the quark--antiquark potential for the gauge theory on S^3 x R. We evaluate the first two orders of these loops perturbatively both in the gauge and string theory. We obtain analytical expressions in a systematic expansion around the 1/2 BPS configuration, and comment on possible all-loop patterns for these Wilson loops.
