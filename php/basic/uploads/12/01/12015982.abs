Title: Degenerate noncommutativity
Authors: Harald Grosse and Michael Wohlgenannt
Abstract: We study a renormalizable four dimensional model with two deformed quantized space directions. A one-loop renormalization is performed explicitly. The Euclidean model is connected to the Minkowski version via an analytic continuation. At a special value of the parameters a nontrivial fixed point of the renormalization group occurs.
