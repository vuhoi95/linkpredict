Title: Hypercomplex limits of pluricomplex structures and the Euclidean limit  of hyperbolic monopoles
Authors: Roger Bielawski and Lorenz Schwachh√∂fer
Abstract: We discuss the Euclidean limit of hyperbolic SU(2)-monopoles, framed at infinity, from the point of view of pluricomplex geometry. More generally, we discuss the geometry of hypercomplex manifolds arising as limits of pluricomplex manifolds.
