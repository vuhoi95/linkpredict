Abstract: We study a smooth cosmological solution within a generalized 5D standing wave braneworld modeled by gravity and a phantom scalar field. In this model the 3-brane is anisotropically warped along its spatial dimensions and contains a novel time-dependent scale factor that multiplies the anisotropic spatial interval of the 5D metric, a fact that allows us to study cosmological effects. By explicitly solving the bulk field equations we found a natural mechanism which isotropizes the braneworld for a wide class of natural initial conditions. We are able to give a physical interpretation of the anisotropic dissipation: as the anisotropic energy of the 3-brane rapidly leaks into the bulk through the nontrivial components of the projected to the brane non-local Weyl tensor, the bulk becomes less isotropic. At the same time, under the action of the 4D cosmological constant, the anisotropic braneworld super-exponentially isotropizes by itself, rendering a 3-brane with de Sitter symmetry embedded in a 5D de Sitter space-time, while the phantom scalar field exponentially vanishes.
