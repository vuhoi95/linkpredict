Title: Self-isospectral tri-supersymmetry in PT-symmetric quantum systems with  pure imaginary periodicity
Authors: Francisco Correa and Mikhail S. Plyushchay
Abstract: We study a reflectionless PT-symmetric quantum system described by the pair of complexified Scarf II potentials mutually displaced in the half of their pure imaginary period. Analyzing the rich set of intertwining discrete symmetries of the pair, we find an exotic supersymmetric structure based on three matrix differential operators that encode all the properties of the system, including its reflectionless (finite-gap) nature. The structure we revealed particularly sheds new light on the splitting of the discrete states into two families, related to the bound and resonance states in Hermitian Scarf II counterpart systems, on which two different series of irreducible representations of sl(2,C) are realized.
