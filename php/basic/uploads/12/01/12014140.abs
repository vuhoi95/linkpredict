Title: The Largest Mathieu Group and (Mock) Automorphic Forms
Authors: Miranda C. N. Cheng and John F. R. Duncan
Abstract: We review the relationship between the largest Mathieu group and various modular objects, including recent progress on the relation to mock modular forms. We also review the connections between these mathematical structures and string theory on K3 surfaces.
