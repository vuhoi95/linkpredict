Title: Near-extremal black holes
Authors: Bhramar Chatterjee and Amit Ghosh
Abstract: We present a new formulation of deriving Hawking temperature for near-extremal black holes using distributions. In this paper the near-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom and Kerr black holes are discussed. It is shown that the extremal solution as a limit of non-extremal metric is well-defined. The pure extremal case is also discussed separately.
