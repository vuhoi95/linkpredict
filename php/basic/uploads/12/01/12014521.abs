Title: Quasinormal modes and Stability Analysis for 4-dimensional Lifshitz  Black Hole
Authors: P. A. Gonzalez and Joel Saavedra and Yerko Vasquez
Abstract: We study the Lifshitz black hole in 4-dimensions with dynamical exponent z=2 and we calculate analytically the quasinormal modes of scalar perturbations. These quasinormal modes allows to study the stability of the Lifshitz black hole and we have obtained that Lifshitz black hole is stable.
