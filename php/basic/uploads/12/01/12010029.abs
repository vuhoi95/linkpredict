Title: Multi-Stream Inflation in a Landscape
Authors: Francis Duplessis and Yi Wang and Robert Brandenberger
Abstract: There are hidden observables for inflation, such as features localized in position space, which do not manifest themselves when only one inflation trajectory is considered. To address this issue, we investigate inflation dynamics in a landscape mimicked by a random potential. We calculate the probability for bifurcation of the inflation trajectory in multi-stream inflation. Depending on the shape of the random bumps and the distance between bumps in the potential, there is a phase transition: on one side of the critical curve in parameter space isocurvature fluctuation are exponentially amplified and bifurcation becomes very probable. On the other side bifurcation is dominated by a random walk where bifurcations are less likely to happen.
