Title: Dark Matter, Infinite Statistics and Quantum Gravity
Authors: Chiu Man Ho and Djordje Minic and Y. Jack Ng
Abstract: We elaborate on our proposal regarding a connection between global physics and local galactic dynamics via quantum gravity. This proposal calls for the concept of MONDian dark matter which behaves like cold dark matter at cluster and cosmological scales but emulates modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) at the galactic scale. In the present paper, we first point out a surprising connection between the MONDian dark matter and an effective gravitational Born-Infeld theory. We then argue that these unconventional quanta of MONDian dark matter must obey infinite statistics, and the theory must be fundamentally non-local. Finally, we provide a possible top-down approach to our proposal from the Matrix theory point of view.
