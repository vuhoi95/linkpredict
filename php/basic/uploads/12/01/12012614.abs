Title: Brane Tilings and Reflexive Polygons
Authors: Amihay Hanany and Rak-Kyeong Seong
Abstract: Reflexive polygons have attracted great interest both in mathematics and in physics. This paper discusses a new aspect of the existing study in the context of quiver gauge theories. These theories are 4d supersymmetric worldvolume theories of D3 branes with toric Calabi-Yau moduli spaces that are conveniently described with brane tilings. We find all 30 theories corresponding to the 16 reflexive polygons, some of the theories being toric (Seiberg) dual to each other. The mesonic generators of the moduli spaces are identified through the Hilbert series. It is shown that the lattice of generators is the dual reflexive polygon of the toric diagram. Thus, the duality forms pairs of quiver gauge theories with the lattice of generators being the toric diagram of the dual and vice versa.
