Title: Vortex trimer in three-component Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Minoru Eto and Muneto Nitta
Abstract: Vortex trimer is predicted in three-component Bose-Einstein condensates with internal coherent couplings. The molecule is made by three constituent vortices which are bounded by domain walls of the relative phases. We show that the shape and the size of the molecule can be controlled by changing the internal coherent couplings.
