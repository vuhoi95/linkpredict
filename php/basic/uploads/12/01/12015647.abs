Authors: A. J. López-Revelles and Ratbay Myrzakulov and Diego Sáez-Gómez
Abstract: The Ekpyrotic scenario is studied in the context of some extensions of Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity. Some particular solutions that lead to cyclic Hubble parameters are analyzed, where the corresponding gravitational actions are reconstructed by using several techniques and auxiliary fields. Its comparison with standard $F(R)$ gravity is performed. In addition, the so-called Little Rip, a stage of the universe evolution when some bounded systems may be dissolute, is also studied in this frame of theories.
