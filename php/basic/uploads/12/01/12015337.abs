Title: Thermodynamics of phantom black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory
Authors: Manuel E. Rodrigues and Zui A. A. Oporto
Abstract: A thermodynamic analysis of the black hole solutions coming from the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory (EMD) in 4D is done. By consider the canonical and grand-canonical ensemble, we apply standard method as well as a recent method known as Geometrothermodynamics (GTD). We are particularly interested in the characteristics of the so called phantom black hole solutions. We will analyze the thermodynamics of these solutions, the points of phase transition and their extremal limit. Also the thermodynamic stability is analyzed. We obtain a mismatch of the between the results of the GTD method when compared with the ones obtained by the specific heat, revealing a weakness of the method, as well as possible limitations of its applicability to very pathological thermodynamic systems. We also found that normal and phantom solutions are locally and globally unstable, unless for certain values of the coupled constant of the EMD action. We also shown that the anti-Reissner-Nordstrom solution does not posses extremal limit nor phase transition points, contrary to the Reissner-Nordstrom case.
