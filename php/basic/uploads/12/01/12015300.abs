Title: Dynamical Symmetry Breaking in Supersymmetric Extensions of  Nambu-Jona-Lasinio Model
Authors: Gaber Faisel and Dong-Won Jung and Otto C. W. Kong
Abstract: In this paper we discuss Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model as a classical model for dynamical mass generation and symmetry breaking. In addition we discuss the possible supersymmetric extensions of this model resulting from interaction terms with four chiral superfields that may be regarded as a supersymmetric generalization of the four-fermion interactions of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. A four-superfield interaction terms can be constructed as either dimension 6 or dimension 5 operators. Through analyzing solutions to the gap equations, we discuss the dynamical generation of superfield Dirac mass, including a supersymmetry breaking part. A dynamical symmetry breaking generally goes along with the dynamical mass generation, for which a bi-superfield condensate is responsible.
