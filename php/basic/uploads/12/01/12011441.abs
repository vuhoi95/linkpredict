Title: Feynman Rules for QCD in Space-Cone Gauge
Authors: Alexander Karlberg and Thomas Sondergaard
Abstract: We present the Lagrangian and Feynman rules for QCD written in space-cone gauge and after eliminating unphysical degrees of freedom from the gluonic sector. The main goal is to clarify and allow for straightforward application of these Feynman rules. We comment on the connection between BCFW recursion relations and space-cone gauge.
