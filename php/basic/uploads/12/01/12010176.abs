Title: 3D Tensor Field Theory: Renormalization and One-loop $Î²$-functions
Authors: Joseph Ben Geloun and Dine Ousmane Samary
Abstract: We prove that the rank 3 analogue of the tensor model defined in [arXiv:1111.4997 [hep-th]] is renormalizable at all orders of perturbation. The proof is given in the momentum space. The one-loop $\gamma$- and $\beta$-functions of the model are also determined. We find that the model with a unique coupling constant for all interactions and a unique wave function renormalization is asymptotically free in the UV.
