Title: Quantum fluids in the Kaehler parametrization
Authors: L. Holender and M. A. Santos and I. V. Vancea
Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of the quantization of the perfect relativistic fluids formulated in terms of the K\"{a}hler parametrization. This fluid model describes a large set of interesting systems such as the power law energy density fluids, Chaplygin gas, etc. In order to maintain the generality of the model, we apply the BRST method in the reduced phase space in which the fluid degrees of freedom are just the fluid potentials and the fluid current is classically resolved in terms of them. We determine the physical states in this setting, the time evolution and the path integral formulation.
