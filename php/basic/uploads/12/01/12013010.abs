Title: Extended axion electrodynamics: Optical activity induced by  nonstationary dark matter
Authors: A. B. Balakin and N. O. Tarasova
Abstract: We establish a new self-consistent Einstein-Maxwell-axion model based on the Lagrangian, which is linear in the pseudoscalar (axion) field and its four-gradient and includes the four-vector of macroscopic velocity of the axion system as a whole. We consider extended equations of the axion electrodynamics, modified gravity field equations, and discuss nonstationary effects in the phenomenon of optical activity induced by axions.
