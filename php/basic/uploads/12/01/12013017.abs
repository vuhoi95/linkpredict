Title: Condensate Structure of D-particle Induced Flavour Vacuum
Authors: Nick E. Mavromatos and Sarben Sarkar and Walter Tarantino
Abstract: It is argued that four Fermi interactions induced by non-perturbative effects due to scattering of stringy matter from D-particles, D-instantons and more generally bulk gauge fields in models with large extra dimensions have in specific situations condensate structure described by flavour vacua.
