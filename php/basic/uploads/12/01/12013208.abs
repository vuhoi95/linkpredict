Title: Black Hole Remnants at the LHC
Authors: L. Bellagamba and R. Casadio and R. Di Sipio and V. Viventi
Abstract: We investigate possible signatures of black hole events at the LHC in the hypothesis that such objects will not evaporate completely, but leave a stable remnant. For the purpose of defining a reference scenario, we have employed the publicly available Monte Carlo generator CHARYBDIS2, in which the remnant's behavior is mostly determined by kinematic constraints and conservation of some quantum numbers, such as the baryon charge. Our findings show that electrically neutral remnants are highly favored and a significantly larger amount of missing transverse momentum is to be expected with respect to the case of complete decay.
