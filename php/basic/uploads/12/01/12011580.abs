Title: Thermodynamics of String Field Theory Motivated Nonlocal Models
Authors: Tirthabir Biswas and Joseph Kapusta and Abraham Reddy
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of the nonlocal tachyon motivated by their nonlocal structure in string field theory. We use previously developed perturbative methods for nonlocal fields to calculate the partition function and the equation of state in the high temperature limit. We find that in these models the tachyons undergo a second order phase transition. We compare our results with those of ordinary scalar field theory. We also calculate the one loop finite temperature effective potential.
