Title: Theory of heavy quark energy loss
Authors: Pol Gossiaux and Joerg Aichelin and Thierry Gousset
Abstract: We briefly review some of the models and theoretical schemes established to describe heavy quark quenching in ultrarelativistic heavy ions collisions. Some lessons are derived from RHIC and early LHC data, especially as for the contraints they impose on those models.
