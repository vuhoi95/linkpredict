Title: Gauged Double Field Theory
Authors: Mariana Gra√±a and Diego Marques
Abstract: We find necessary and sufficient conditions for gauge invariance of the action of Double Field Theory (DFT) as well as closure of the algebra of gauge symmetries. The so-called weak and strong constraints are sufficient to satisfy them, but not necessary. We then analyze compactifications of DFT on twisted double tori satisfying the consistency conditions. The effective theory is a Gauged DFT where the gaugings come from the duality twists. The action, bracket, global symmetries, gauge symmetries and their closure are computed by twisting their analogs in the higher dimensional DFT. The non-Abelian heterotic string and lower dimensional gauged supergravities are particular examples of Gauged DFT.
