Title: Comparative study of loop contributions in AdS and dS
Authors: E. T. Akhmedov and A. V. Sadofyev
Abstract: The generic feature of non-conformal fields in Poincare patch of de Sitter space is the presence of large IR loop corrections even for massive fields. Moreover, in global de Sitter there are loop IR divergences for the massive fields. Naive analytic continuation from de Sitter to Anti-de-Sitter might lead one to conclude that something similar should happen in the latter space as well. However, we show that there are no large IR effects in the one-loop two-point functions in the Poincare patch of Anti-de-Sitter space even for the zero mass minimally coupled scalar fields. As well there are neither large IR effects nor IR divergences in global Anti-de-Sitter space even for the zero mass.
