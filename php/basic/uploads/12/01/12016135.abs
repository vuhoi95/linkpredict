Title: Solutions of the Generic Non-Compact Weyl Equation
Authors: Anastasia Doikou and Theodora Ioannidou
Abstract: In this paper, solutions of the generic non-compact Weyl equation are obtained. In particular, by identifying a suitable similarity transformation and introducing a non-trivial change of variables we are able to implement azimuthal dependence on the solutions of the diagonal non-compact Weyl equation. We also discuss some open questions related to the construction of infinite BPS monopole configurations.
