Title: Bulk and Transhorizon Measurements in AdS/CFT
Authors: Idse Heemskerk and Donald Marolf and Joseph Polchinski and James Sully
Abstract: We discuss the construction of bulk operators in asymptotically AdS spacetimes, including the interiors of AdS black holes. We use this to address the question "If Schrodinger's cat were behind the horizon of an AdS black hole, could we determine its state by a measurement in the dual CFT?"
