Title: D-brane Moduli Spaces and Superpotentials in a Two-Parameter Model
Authors: Marco Baumgartl and Ilka Brunner and Daniel Plencner
Abstract: We study D2-branes on the K3-fibration P^4_(11222)[8] using matrix factorizations at the Landau-Ginzburg point and analyze their moduli space and superpotentials in detail. We find that the open string moduli space consists of various intersecting branches of different dimensions. Families of D2-branes wrapping rational curves of degree one intersect with bound state branches. The influence of non-toric complex structure deformations is investigated in the Landau-Ginzburg framework, where these deformations arise as bulk moduli from the twisted sectors.
