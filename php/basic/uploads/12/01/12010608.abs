Title: Resummation of semiclassical short folded string
Authors: Matteo Beccaria and Guido Macorini
Abstract: We reconsider semiclassical quantization of folded string spinning in AdS_3 part of AdS_5 X S^5 using integrability-based (algebraic curve) method. We focus on the "short string" (small spin S) limit with the angular momentum J in S^5 scaled down according to \cal J = rho \sqrt \cal S in terms of the variables \cal J = J/\sqrt\lambda, \cal S = S/\sqrt\lambda. The semiclassical string energy in this particular scaling limit admits the double expansion E = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{p=0}^{\infty} (\sqrt\lambda)^{1-n}\,a_{n,p}(rho)\, \cal S^{p+1/2}. It behaves smoothly as J -> 0 and partially resums recent results by Gromov and Valatka. We explicitly compute various one-loop coefficients a_{1,p}(rho) by summing over the fluctuation frequencies for integrable perturbations around the classical solution. For the simple folded string, the result agrees with what could be derived exploiting a recent conjecture of Basso. However, the method can be extended to more general situations. As an example, we consider the m-folded string where Basso's conjecture fails. For this classical solution, we present the exact values of a_{1,0}(rho) and a_{1,1}(rho) for m=2, 3, 4, 5 and explain how to work out the general case.
