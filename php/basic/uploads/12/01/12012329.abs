Title: A critical analysis of the cosmological implementation of Loop Quantum  Gravity
Authors: Francesco Cianfrani and Giovanni Montani
Abstract: This papers offers a critical discussion on the procedure by which Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC) is constructed from the full Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) theory. Revising recent issues in preserving SU(2) symmetry when quantizing the isotropic Universe, we trace a new perspective in approaching the cosmological problem within quantum geometry. The cosmological sector of LQG is reviewed and a critical point of view on LQC is presented. It is outlined how a polymer-like scale for quantum cosmology can be predicted from a proper fundamental graph underlying the homogeneous and isotropic continuous picture. However, such a minimum scale does not coincide with the choice made in LQC. Finally, the perspectives towards a consistent cosmological LQG model based on such a graph structure are discussed.
