Title: The hybrid curvaton
Authors: Konstantinos Dimopoulos and Kazunori Kohri and Tomohiro Matsuda
Abstract: We study both oscillating and inflating curvaton scenarios when the curvaton mechanism is caused by a hybrid potential. The source of the curvature perturbation is the inhomogeneous phase transition that causes the modulation of the onset of the oscillation. For the supergravity-motivated curvaton there is a possibility of finding natural coincidence of the energy density that is needed to affect non-Gaussianity in the curvaton scenario.
