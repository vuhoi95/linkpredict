Title: A Twistor Description of Six-Dimensional N=(1,1) Super Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Christian Saemann and Robert Wimmer and Martin Wolf
Abstract: We present a twistor space that describes super null-lines on six-dimensional N=(1,1) superspace. We then show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between holomorphic vector bundles over this twistor space and solutions to the field equations of N=(1,1) super Yang-Mills theory. Our constructions naturally reduce to those of the twistorial description of maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions.
