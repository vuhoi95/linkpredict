Title: Time-dependent Robin boundary conditions in the dynamical Casimir effect
Authors: C. Farina and Hector O. Silva and Andreson L. C. Rego and Danilo T. Alves
Abstract: Motivated by experiments in which moving boundaries are simulated by time-dependent properties of static systems, we discuss the model of a massless scalar field submitted to a time-dependent Robin boundary condition (BC) at a static mirror in 1+1 dimensions. Using a perturbative approach, we compute the spectral distribution of the created particles and the total particle creation rate, considering a thermal state as the initial field state.
