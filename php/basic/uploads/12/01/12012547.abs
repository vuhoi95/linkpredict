Title: On Schwarzschild black holes in a D-dimensional noncommutative space
Authors: M. Chabab and H. El Moumni and M. B. Sedra
Abstract: This work aims to implement the idea of noncommutativity in the subject of black holes. Its principal contents deal with a study of Schwarzschild black holes in a D-dimensional noncommutative space. Various aspects related to the non commutative extension are discussed and some non trivial results are derived.
