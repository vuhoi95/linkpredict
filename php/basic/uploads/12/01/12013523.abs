Title: Electron Dynamics in Slowly Varying Antiferromagnetic Texture
Authors: Ran Cheng and Qian Niu
Abstract: Effective dynamics of conduction electrons in antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials with slowly varying spin texture is developed via non-Abelian gauge theory. Quite different from the ferromagnetic (FM) case, the spin of a conduction electron does not follow the background texture even in the adiabatic limit due to the accumulation of a SU(2) non-Abelian Berry phase. Correspondingly, it is found that the orbital dynamics becomes spin-dependent and is affected by two emergent gauge fields. While one of them is the non-Abelian generalization of what has been discovered in FM systems, the other leads to an anomalous velocity that has no FM counterpart. Two examples are provided to illustrate the distinctive spin dynamics of a conduction electron.
