Title: Cosmological Backgrounds of Gravitational Waves and eLISA/NGO: Phase  Transitions, Cosmic Strings and Other Sources
Authors: Pierre Binétruy and Alejandro Bohé and Chiara Caprini and Jean-François Dufaux
Abstract: We review several cosmological backgrounds of gravitational waves accessible to direct-detection experiments, with a special emphasis on those backgrounds due to first-order phase transitions and networks of cosmic (super-)strings. For these two particular sources, we revisit in detail the computation of the gravitational wave background and improve the results of previous works in the literature. We apply our results to identify the scientific potential of the NGO/eLISA mission of ESA regarding the detectability of cosmological backgrounds.
