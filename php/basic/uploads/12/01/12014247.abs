Title: On the Relations between Gravity and BF Theories
Authors: Laurent Freidel and Simone Speziale
Abstract: We review, in the light of recent developments, the existing relations between gravity and topological BF theories at the classical level. We include the Plebanski action in both self-dual and non-chiral formulations, their generalizations, and the MacDowell-Mansouri action.
