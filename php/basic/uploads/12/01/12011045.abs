Title: Comment on "Fermionic entanglement ambiguity in noninertial frames"
Authors: Kamil Bradler and Rocio Jauregui
Abstract: In this comment we show that the ambiguity of entropic quantities calculated in Physical Review A 83, 062323 (2011) for fermionic fields in the context of Unruh effect is not related to the properties of anticommuting fields, as claimed in Physical Review A 83, 062323 (2011), but rather to wrong mathematical manipulations with them and not taking into account a fundamental superselection rule of quantum field theory.
