Title: Dark Energy with Logarithmic Cosmological Fluid
Authors: Seyen Kouwn and Phillial Oh
Abstract: We propose a dark energy model with a logarithmic cosmological fluid which can result in a very small current value of the dark energy density and avoid the coincidence problem without much fine-tuning. We construct a couple of dynamical models that could realize this dark energy at very low energy in terms of four scalar fields quintessence and discuss the current acceleration of the Universe. Numerical values can be made to be consistent with the accelerating Universe with adjustment of the two parameters of the theory. The potential can be given only in terms of the scale factor, but the explicit form at very low energy can be obtained in terms of the scalar field to yield of the form V(\phi)=\exp(-2\phi)(\frac{4 A}{3}\phi+B). Some discussions and the physical implications of this approach are given.
