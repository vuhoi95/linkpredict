Title: A square-torsion modification of Einstein-Cartan theory
Authors: Luca Fabbri and Stefano Vignolo and Cosimo Stornaiolo
Abstract: In the present paper we consider a theory of gravity in which not only curvature but also torsion is explicitly present in the Lagrangian, both with their own coupling constant. In particular, we discuss the couplings to Dirac fields and spin fluids: in the case of Dirac fields, we discuss how in our approach, the Dirac self-interactions depend on the coupling constant as a parameter that may even make these non-linearities manifest at subatomic scales, showing different applications according to the value of the parameter we have assigned; in the case of spin fluids, we discuss FLRW cosmological models arising from the proposed theory.
