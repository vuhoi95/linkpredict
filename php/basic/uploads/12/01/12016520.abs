Title: Analytic study of properties of holographic superconductors in  Born-Infeld electrodynamics
Authors: Sunandan Gangopadhyay and Dibakar Roychowdhury
Abstract: In this paper, based on the Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem, we analytically investigate several properties of holographic s-wave superconductors in the background of a Schwarzschild-AdS spacetime in the framework of Born-Infeld electrodynamics. Based on a perturbative approach, we explicitly find the relation between the critical temperature and the charge density and also the fact that the Born-Infeld coupling parameter indeed affects the formation of scalar hair at low temperatures. Higher value of the Born-Infeld parameter results in a harder condensation to form. We further compute the critical exponent associated with the condensation near the critical temperature. The analytical results obtained are found to be in good agreement with the existing numerical results.
