Title: On the exact evaluation of spin networks
Authors: Laurent Freidel and Jeff Hnybida
Abstract: We introduce a fully coherent spin network amplitude whose expansion generates all SU(2) spin networks associated with a given graph. We then give an explicit evaluation of this amplitude for an arbitrary graph. We show how this coherent amplitude can be obtained from the specialization of a generating functional obtained by the contraction of parametrized intertwiners a la Schwinger. We finally give the explicit evaluation of this generating functional for arbitrary graphs.
