Authors: Yun Soo Myung and Yong-Wan Kim and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: Using the operator approach, we obtain quasinormal modes (QNMs) of BTZ black hole in spin-3 topologically massive gravity by solving the first-order equation of motion with the transverse-traceless condition. We find that these are different from those obtained when solving the second-order differential equation for the third-rank tensor of spin-3 field subject to suitable boundary conditions and having the sign ambiguity of mass. However, it is shown clearly that two approaches to the left-moving QNMs are identical, while the right-moving QNMs of solving the second-order equation are given by descendants of the operator approach.
