Title: Boundary contributions to the hypervirial theorem
Authors: J. G. Esteve and F. Falceto and Pulak Ranjan Giri
Abstract: It is shown that under certain boundary conditions the virial theorem has to be modified. We analyze the origin of the extra term and compute it in particular examples. The Coulomb and harmonic oscillator with point interaction have been studied in the light of this generalization of the virial theorem.
