Title: Aspects of holography for theories with hyperscaling violation
Authors: Xi Dong and Sarah Harrison and Shamit Kachru and Gonzalo Torroba and Huajia Wang
Abstract: We analyze various aspects of the recently proposed holographic theories with general dynamical critical exponent z and hyperscaling violation exponent $\theta$. We first find the basic constraints on $z, \theta$ from the gravity side, and compute the stress-energy tensor expectation values and scalar two-point functions. Massive correlators exhibit a nontrivial exponential behavior at long distances, controlled by $\theta$. At short distance, the two-point functions become power-law, with a universal form for $\theta > 0$. Next, the calculation of the holographic entanglement entropy reveals the existence of novel phases which violate the area law. The entropy in these phases has a behavior that interpolates between that of a Fermi surface and that exhibited by systems with extensive entanglement entropy. Finally, we describe microscopic embeddings of some $\theta \neq 0$ metrics into full string theory models -- these metrics characterize large regions of the parameter space of Dp-brane metrics for $p\neq 3$. For instance, the theory of N D2-branes in IIA supergravity has z=1 and $\theta = -1/3$ over a wide range of scales, at large $g_s N$.
