Title: Gradient models of the axion-photon coupling
Authors: Alexander B. Balakin and Vladimir V. Bochkarev and Nadezhda O. Tarasova
Abstract: We establish an extended version of the Einstein - Maxwell - axion model by introducing into the Lagrangian cross-terms, which contain the gradient four-vector of the pseudoscalar (axion) field in convolution with the Maxwell tensor. The gradient model of the axion-photon coupling is applied to cosmology: we analyze the Bianchi-I type Universe with an initial magnetic field, electric field induced by the axion-photon interaction, cosmological constant and dark matter, which is described in terms of the pseudoscalar (axion) field. Analytical, qualitative and numerical results are presented in detail for two distinguished epochs: first, for the early Universe with magnetic field domination; second, for the stage of late-time accelerated expansion.
