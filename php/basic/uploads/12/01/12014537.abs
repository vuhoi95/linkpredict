Title: Super-Higgs in Superspace
Authors: Moritz McGarrie and Gianni Tallarita
Abstract: We determine the effective gravitational couplings in superspace whose components reproduce the supergravity Higgs effect for the constrained Goldstino multiplet. It reproduces the known Gravitino sector whilst constraining the off-shell completion. We show that these components arise by computing the effective action. This may be useful for phenomenological studies and model building: We give an example of its application to multiple Goldstini.
