Title: Spinors and Twistors in Loop Gravity and Spin Foams
Authors: Maite Dupuis and Simone Speziale and Johannes Tambornino
Abstract: Spinorial tools have recently come back to fashion in loop gravity and spin foams. They provide an elegant tool relating the standard holonomy-flux algebra to the twisted geometry picture of the classical phase space on a fixed graph, and to twistors. In these lectures we provide a brief and technical introduction to the formalism and some of its applications.
