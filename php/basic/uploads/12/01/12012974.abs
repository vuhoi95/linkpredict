Title: BPS Solutions to a Generalized Maxwell-Higgs Model
Authors: D. Bazeia and E. da Hora and C. dos Santos and R. Menezes
Abstract: We look for topological BPS solutions of an Abelian-Maxwell-Higgs theory endowed by non-standard kinetic terms to both gauge and scalar fields. Here, the non-usual dynamics are controlled by two positive functions, G(|{\phi}|) and w(|{\phi}|), which are related to the self-dual scalar potential V(|{\phi}|) of the model by a fundamental constraint. The numerical results we found present interesting new features, and contribute to the development of the recent issue concerning the study of generalized models and their applications.
