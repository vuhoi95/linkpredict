Title: Black Hole Thermodynamics from a Noncommutative Area Operator
Authors: S. Pérez-Payán and M. Sabido
Abstract: One key element to calculate thermodynamical properties for a black hole is the partition function. In this paper we have incorporated the idea of a two dimensional area in a noncommutative space and were able to calculate the partition function with such a spectra. Employing the canonical quantum statistics formalism we compute the temperature, entropy and time of evaporation for a Schwarzschild black hole.
