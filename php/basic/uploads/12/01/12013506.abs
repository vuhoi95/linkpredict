Title: Derivation of the blackfold effective theory
Authors: Joan Camps and Roberto Emparan
Abstract: We study fluctuations and deformations of black branes over length scales larger than the horizon radius. We prove that the Einstein equations for the perturbed p-brane yield, as constraints, the equations of the effective blackfold theory. We solve the Einstein equations for the perturbed geometry and show that it remains regular on and outside the black brane horizon. This study provides an ab initio derivation of the blackfold effective theory and gives explicit expressions for the metrics near the new black holes and black branes that result from it, to leading order in a derivative expansion.
