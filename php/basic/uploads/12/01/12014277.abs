Title: 3D gravity with propagating torsion: the AdS sector
Authors: Milutin Blagojević and Branislav Cvetković
Abstract: We study the general parity-preserving model of three-dimensional gravity with propagating torsion, with a focus on its nonlinear dynamics in the AdS sector. The model is shown to posses the black hole with torsion as a vacuum solution, provided we adopt certain restrictions on its coupling constants. The canonical analysis in the AdS asymptotic region yields the conserved charges of the black hole and the central charges of the asymptotic conformal symmetry.
