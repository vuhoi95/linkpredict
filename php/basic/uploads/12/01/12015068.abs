Title: Weyl-Invariant Higher Curvature Gravity Theories in n Dimensions
Authors: M. Reza Tanhayi and Suat Dengiz and Bayram Tekin
Abstract: We study the particle spectrum and the unitarity of the generic n-dimensional Weyl-invariant quadratic curvature gravity theories around their (anti-)de Sitter [(A)dS] and flat vacua. Weyl symmetry is spontaneously broken in (A)dS and radiatively broken at the loop level in flat space. Save the three dimensional theory (which is the Weyl-invariant extension of the new massive gravity), the graviton remains massless and the unitarity requires that the only viable Weyl-invariant quadratic theory is the Weyl-invariant extension of the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory. The Weyl gauge field on the other hand becomes massive. Symmetry breaking scale fixes all the dimensionful parameters in the theory.
