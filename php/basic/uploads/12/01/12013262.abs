Title: The vacuum nature of the QCD condensates
Authors: H. Reinhardt and H. Weigel
Abstract: Recently it was claimed that QCD condensates were associated with the internal dynamics of the hadrons. We challenge this "in-hadron" picture of the QCD condensates and show that it conflicts well established concepts and experimental facts for the example of the quark condensate. We explicitly demonstrate the vacuum nature of the quark condensate by a model calculation.
