Title: On asymptotic solutions of RFT in zero transverse dimensions
Authors: S. Bondarenko and L. Horwitz and J. Levitan and A. Yahalom
Abstract: An investigation of dynamical properties of solutions of toy model of interacting Pomerons with triple vertex in zero transverse dimension is performed. Stable points and corresponding solutions at the limit of large rapidity are studied in the framework of given model. A presence of closed cycles in solutions is discussed as well as an application of obtained results for the case of interacting QCD Pomerons.
