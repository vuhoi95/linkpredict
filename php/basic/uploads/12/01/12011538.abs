Title: Primordial power spectrum versus extension parameters beyond the  standard model
Authors: Zong-Kuan Guo and Yuan-Zhong Zhang
Abstract: We reconstruct the shape of the primordial power spectrum of curvature perturbations in extended cosmological models, including addition of massive neutrinos, extra relativistic species or varying primordial helium abundance, from the latest cosmic microwave background data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the South Pole Telescope. We find that a scale-invariant primordial spectrum is disfavored by the data at 95% confidence level even in the presence of massive neutrinos, however it can lie within the 95% confidence region if the effective number of relativistic species or the primordial helium abundance is allowed to vary freely. The constraints on the extension parameters from WMAP7+ACT+H0+BAO, are the total mass of neutrinos sum(m_nu) < 0.48 eV (95% CL), the effective number of relativistic species N_eff = 4.50 +/- 0.81 and the primordial helium abundance Y_p = 0.303 +/- 0.075. The constraints from WMAP7+SPT+H0+BAO, are sum(m_nu) < 0.45 eV (95% CL), N_eff = 3.86 +/- 0.63 and Y_p = 0.277 +/- 0.050.
