Title: Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity. Phenomenology of non-linear  gravity-matter coupling
Authors: Paolo Pani and Terence Delsate and Vitor Cardoso
Abstract: Viable corrections to the matter sector of Poisson's equation may result in qualitatively different astrophysical phenomenology, for example the gravitational collapse and the properties of compact objects can change drastically. We discuss a class of modified non-relativistic theories and focus on a relativistic completion, Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity. This recently proposed theory is equivalent to General Relativity in vacuum, but its non-trivial coupling to matter prevents singularities in early cosmology and in the non-relativistic collapse of non-interacting particles. We extend our previous analysis, discussing further developments. We present a full numerical study of spherically symmetric non-relativistic gravitational collapse of dust. For any positive coupling, the final state of the collapse is a regular pressureless star rather than a singularity. We also argue that there is no Chandrasekhar limit for the mass of non-relativistic white dwarf in this theory. Finally, we extend our previous results in the fully relativistic theory by constructing static and slowly rotating compact stars governed by nuclear-physics inspired equations of state. In the relativistic theory, there exists an upper bound on the mass of compact objects, suggesting that black holes can still be formed in the relativistic collapse.
