Title: Simple superamplitudes in higher dimensions
Authors: Rutger H. Boels and Donal O'Connell
Abstract: We provide simple superspaces based on a formulation of spinor helicity in general even dimensions. As a distinguishing feature these spaces admit a fermionic super-momentum conserving delta function solution to the on-shell supersymmetry Ward identities. Using these solutions, we present beautifully simple formulae for the complete three, four and five point superamplitudes in maximal super Yang-Mills theory in eight dimensions, and for the three and four point superamplitudes in ten dimensional type IIB supergravity. In addition, we discuss the exceptional kinematics of the three point amplitude, and the supersymmetric spinorial BCFW recursion, in general dimensions.
