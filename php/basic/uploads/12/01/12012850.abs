Title: Maxwell symmetries and some applications
Authors: J. A. de Azcarraga and K. Kamimura and J. Lukierski
Abstract: The Maxwell algebra is the result of enlarging the Poincar\'{e} algebra by six additional tensorial Abelian generators that make the fourmomenta non-commutative. We present a local gauge theory based on the Maxwell algebra with vierbein, spin connection and six additional geometric Abelian gauge fields. We apply this geometric framework to the construction of Maxwell gravity, which is described by the Einstein action plus a generalized cosmological term. We mention a Friedman-Robertson-Walker cosmological approximation to the Maxwell gravity field equations, with two scalar fields obtained from the additional gauge fields. Finally, we outline further developments of the Maxwell symmetries framework.
