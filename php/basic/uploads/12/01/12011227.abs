Title: Gravitational particle production in massive chaotic inflation and the  moduli problem
Authors: Jaume de Haro and Emilio Elizalde
Abstract: Particle production from vacuum fluctuations during inflation is briefly revisited. The moduli problem occurring with light particles produced at the end of inflation is addressed, namely the fact that some results are in disagreement with nucleosynthesis constrains. A universal solution to this problem is found which leads to reasonable reheating temperatures in all cases. It invokes the assumption that, immediately after inflation, the moduli evolve like non-relativistic matter. The assumption is justified in the context of massive chaotic inflation were, at the end of inflation, the universe evolves as if it was matter-dominated.
