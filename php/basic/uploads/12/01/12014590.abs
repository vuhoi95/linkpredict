Title: The Gribov horizon and the one-loop color-Coulomb potential
Authors: Maarten Golterman and Jeff Greensite and Santiago Peris and Adam P. Szczepaniak
Abstract: We recalculate the color-Coulomb potential to one-loop order, under the assumption that the effect of the Gribov horizon is to make i) the transverse gluon propagator less singular; and ii) the color-Coulomb potential more singular, than their perturbative behavior in the low-momentum limit. As a first guess, the effect of the Gribov horizon is mimicked by introducing a transverse momentum-dependent gluon mass term, leading to a propagator of the Gribov form, with the prescription that the mass parameter should be adjusted to the unique value where the infrared behavior of the Coulomb potential is enhanced. We find that this procedure leads to a Coulomb potential rising asymptotically as a linear term modified by a logarithm.
