Abstract: Recently, it has been suggested that large-Nc orbifold equivalences may be applicable to certain theories with chemical potentials, including QCD, in certain portions of their phase diagram. When valid, such an equivalence offers the possibility of relating large-Nc QCD at non-zero baryon chemical potential, a theory with a complex fermion determinant, to a related theory whose fermion determinant is real and positive. In this paper, we provide a test of this large Nc equivalence using a holographic realization of a supersymmetric theory with baryon chemical potential and a related theory with isospin chemical potential. We show that the two strongly-coupled, large-Nc theories are equivalent in a large region of the phase diagram.
