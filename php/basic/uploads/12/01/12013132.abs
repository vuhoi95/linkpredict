Title: Moving Stable Solitons in Galileon Theory
Authors: Ali Masoumi and Xiao Xiao
Abstract: Despite the no-go theorem [5] which rules out static stable solitons in Galileon theory, we propose a family of solitons that evade the theorem by traveling at the speed of light. These domain-wall-like solitons are stable under small fluctuations-analysis of perturbation shows neither ghost-like nor tachyon-like instabilities, and perturbative collision of these solitons suggests that they pass through each other asymptotically, which maybe an indication of the integrability of the theory itself.
