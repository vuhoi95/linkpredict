Title: Brane Cosmology with the Chameleon Scalar Field in Bulk
Authors: Khaled Saaidi and AbolHassan Mohammadi
Abstract: In this work we investigate the effect of a kind of scalar field, called chameleon, on the evolution of universe. We put this scalar field in the bulk. It is displayed that this scalar field gives us an exponential expansion in early time which may concern inflation. Interaction between scalar field and matter bring some complications in our analysis, however it is shown that by defining an effective potential, we could recover conventional equation at inflation era. After inflation, and entering the universe in radiation era, the exponential expansion is omitted. Also, in late time the universe possess an accelerated expansion. In the last section, the validity of generalized second law of thermodynamic, with assumption the validity of first law is considered.
