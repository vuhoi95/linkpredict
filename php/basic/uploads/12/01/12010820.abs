Title: A hQCD model and its phase diagram in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton system
Authors: Rong-Gen Cai and Song He and Danning Li
Abstract: By use of the potential reconstruction approach we obtain a series of asymptotically AdS (aAdS) black hole solutions in an Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) system. Basing on the solutions of the system, we reconstruct a semi-analytical holographic QCD (hQCD) model with a quadratic term in warped factor. We discuss some aspects of the hQCD model, in particular we calculate the free energy of two static color sources (a heavy quark-antiquark pair) which is an important order parameter to describe confinement/deconfinement phase transition. The behavior of the free energy with respect to temperature and chemical potential is studied. We find that in the hQCD model the deconfinement phase transition can be realized and a critical point occurs. The resulting phase diagram in the temperature-chemical potential $T-\mu$ plane is in quite good agreement with the one from recent lattice results and effective models of QCD.
