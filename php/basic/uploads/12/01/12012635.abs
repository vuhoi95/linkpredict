Title: Finite-size effects of beta-deformed AdS_5/CFT_4 at strong coupling
Authors: Changrim Ahn and Diego Bombardelli and Minkyoo Kim
Abstract: We compute both classical and quantum finite-size corrections at leading order in the strong coupling limit for the (dyonic) giant magnon in the Lunin-Maldacena background. Based on the exact S-martix conjectured for the deformed theory, we generalize the Luscher formula to include twisted boundary conditions and show that the results match with those derived both by finite-size classical solutions of the giant magnon and by algebraic curve analysis.
