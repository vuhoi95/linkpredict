Abstract: This proceeding is based on arXiv:1105.0591 [hep-th] where we consider breaking of supersymmetry in intersecting D-brane configurations by slight deviation of the angles from their supersymmetric values. We compute the masses generated by radiative corrections for the adjoint scalars on the brane world-volumes. In the open string channel, the string two-point function receives contributions only from the infrared limits of N~4 and N~2 supersymmetric configurations, via messengers and their Kaluza-Klein excitations, and leads at leading order to tachyonic directions.
