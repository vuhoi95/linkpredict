Title: Spinning particles in de Sitter spacetime
Authors: Yuri N. Obukhov and Dirk Puetzfeld
Abstract: We report on the multipolar equations of motion for spinning test bodies in the de Sitter spacetime of constant positive curvature. The dynamics of spinning particles is discussed for the two supplementary conditions of Frenkel and Tulczyjew. Furthermore, the 4-momentum and the spin are explicitly expressed in terms of the spacetime coordinates with the help of the 10 Killing vectors available in de Sitter spacetime.
