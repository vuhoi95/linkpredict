Abstract: We consider the effects of higher curvature terms on a holographic dual description of boundary conformal field theory. Specifically, we consider three-dimensional gravity with a specific combination of Ricci tensor square and curvature scalar square, so called, new massive gravity. We show that a boundary entropy and an entanglement entropy are given by similar expression with those of the Einstein gravity case when we introduce an {\it effective} Newton's constant and an {\it effective} cosmological constant. We also show that the holographic g-theorem still holds in this extension, and we give some comments about the central charge dependence of boundary entropy in the holographic construction. In the same way, we consider new type black holes and comment on the boundary profile. Moreover, we reproduce these results through auxiliary field formalism in this specific higher curvature gravity.
