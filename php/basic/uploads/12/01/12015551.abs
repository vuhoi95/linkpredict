Authors: Patricio Gaete and Jose` Helayel-Neto and Euro Spallucci
Abstract: We study the impact of a minimal length on physical observables for a three-dimensional axionic electrodynamics. Our calculation is done within the framework of the gauge-invariant, but path-dependent, variables formalism which is alternative to the Wilson loop approach. Our result shows that the interaction energy contains a regularised Bessel function and a linear confining potential. This calculation involves no theta expansion at all. Once again, the present analysis displays the key role played by the new quantum of length.
