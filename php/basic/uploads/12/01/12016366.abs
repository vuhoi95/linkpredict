Title: Disordered Holographic Systems II: Marginal Relevance of Imperfection
Authors: Allan Adams and Sho Yaida
Abstract: We continue our study of quenched disorder in holographic systems, focusing on the effects of mild electric disorder. By studying the renormalization group evolution of the disorder distribution at subleading order in perturbations away from the clean fixed point, we show that electric disorder is marginally relevant in (2+1)-dimensional holographic conformal field theories.
