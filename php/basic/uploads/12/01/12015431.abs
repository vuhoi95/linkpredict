Title: Component reduction in N=2 supergravity: the vector, tensor, and  vector-tensor multiplets
Authors: Daniel Butter and Joseph Novak
Abstract: Recent advances in curved N=2 superspace methods have rendered the component reduction of superspace actions more feasible than in the past. In this paper, we consider models involving both vector and tensor multiplets coupled to supergravity and demonstrate explicitly how component actions may be efficiently obtained. In addition, tensor multiplets coupled to conformal supergravity are considered directly within projective superspace, where their formulation is most natural. We then demonstrate how the inverse procedure -- the lifting of component results to superspace -- can simplify the analysis of complicated multiplets. We address the off-shell N=2 vector-tensor multiplet coupled to conformal supergravity with a central charge and demonstrate explicitly how its constraints and Lagrangian can be written in a simpler way using superfields.
