Title: One-loop divergences in massive gravity theory
Authors: Ioseph L. Buchbinder and Dante D. Pereira and Ilya L. Shapiro
Abstract: The one-loop divergences are calculated for the recently proposed ghost-free version of massive gravity, where the action depends on both metric and external tensor field f. The non-polynomial structure of the massive term is reduced to a more standard form by means of auxiliary tensor field, which is settled on-shell after quantum calculations are performed. As one should expect, the counterterms do not reproduce the form of the classical action. Moreover, the result has the form of the power series in f.
