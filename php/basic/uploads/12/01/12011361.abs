Title: The Microscopic Twisted Mass Dirac Spectrum
Authors: K. Splittorff and J. J. M. Verbaarschot
Abstract: The microscopic spectral density for lattice QCD with two flavors and maximally twisted mass is computed. The results are given for fixed index of the Dirac operator and include the leading order $a^2$ corrections to the chiral Lagrangian due to the discretization errors. The computation is carried out within the framework of Wilson chiral perturbation theory.
