Title: Finite-mass correction to 2D Black-hole evaporation rate
Authors: Liora Dori and Amos Ori
Abstract: We numerically analyze the evolution of a two-dimensional dilatonic black hole, within the CGHS model. We focus our attention on the finite-mass corrections to the universal evaporation rate which applies at the large-mass limit. Our numerical results confirm a previous theoretical prediction for the first-order ($\propto 1/M$) correction. In addition, our results strongly suggest that the next-order ($\propto 1/M^{2}$) term vanishes, and provide a rough estimate for the third-order term.
