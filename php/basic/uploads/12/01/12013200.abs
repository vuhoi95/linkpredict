Authors: A. Khodam-Mohammadi and M. Malekjani and M. Monshizadeh
Abstract: In this work, we reconstruct the $f(R)$ modified gravity for different ghost and generalized ghost dark energy models in FRW flat universe, which describe the accelerated expansion of the universe. The equation of state of reconstructed $f(R)$ - gravity has been calculated. We show that the corresponding $f(R)$ gravity of ghost dark energy model can behave like phantom or quintessence. We also show that the equation of state of reconstructed $f(R)$ gravity for generalized ghost model can transit from quintessence regime to the phantom regime as indicated by recent observations.
