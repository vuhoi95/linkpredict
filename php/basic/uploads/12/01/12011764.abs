Title: Fermions on Lifshitz Background
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha and M. Reza Mohammadi Mozaffar and Ali Mollabashi
Abstract: We study a non-relativistic fermionic retarded Green's function by making use of a fermion on the Lifshitz geometry with critical exponent z = 2. With a natural boundary condition, respecting the symmetries of the model, the resultant retarded Green's function exhibits a number of interesting features including a flat band. We also study the finite temperature and finite chemical potential cases where the geometry is replaced by Lifshitz black hole solutions.
