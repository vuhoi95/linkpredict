Title: Cosmological tests of sudden future singularities
Authors: Tomasz Denkiewicz and Mariusz P. Dabrowski and Hoda Ghodsi and Martin A. Hendry
Abstract: We discuss combined constraints, coming from the cosmic microwave background shift parameter $\mathcal{R}$, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) distance parameter $\mathcal{A}$, and from the latest type Ia supernovae data, imposed on cosmological models which allow sudden future singularities of pressure. We show that due to their weakness such sudden singularities may happen in the very near future and that at present they can mimic standard dark energy models.
