Authors: I. L. Buchbinder and B. S. Merzlikin and I. B. Samsonov
Abstract: We study local superspace contributions to low-energy effective action in general chiral three-dimensional superfield model. The effective Kahler and chiral potentials are computed in explicit form up to the two-loop order. In accordance with the non-renormalization theorem, the ultraviolet divergences appear only in the full superspace while the effective chiral potential receives only finite quantum contributions in the massless case. As an application, the two-loop effective scalar potential is found for the three-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model.
