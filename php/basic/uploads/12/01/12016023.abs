Title: Equations of motion in Double Field Theory: from classical particles to  quantum cosmology
Authors: Nahomi Kan and Koichiro Kobayashi and Kiyoshi Shiraishi
Abstract: The equation of motion for a point particle in the background field of double field theory is considered. We find that the motion is described by a geodesic flow in the doubled geometry. Inspired by analysis on the particle motion, we propose a modified model of quantum string cosmology, which includes two scale factors. The report is based on Phys. Rev. D84 (2011) 124049 [arXiv:1108.5795].
