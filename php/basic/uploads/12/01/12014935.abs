Title: Symmetries and solutions of field equations of axion electrodynamics
Authors: A. G. Nikitin and Oksana Kuriksha
Abstract: The group classification of models of axion electrodynamics with arbitrary self interaction of axionic field is carried out. It is shown that extensions of the basic Poincar\'e invariance of these models appear only for constant and exponential interactions. The related conservation laws are discussed. Using the In\"on\"u-Wigner contraction the non-relativistic limit of equations of axion electrodynamics is found. An extended class of exact solutions for the electromagnetic and axion fields is obtained. Among them there are solutions including up to six arbitrary functions. In particular, solutions which describe propagation with velocities faster than the velocity of light are found. These solutions are smooth and bounded functions which correspond to positive definite and bounded energy density.
