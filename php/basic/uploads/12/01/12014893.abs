Title: Soft Spectrum in Yukawa-Gauge Mediation
Authors: Federico Galli and Alberto Mariotti
Abstract: We introduce a model independent parametrization for a subclass of gauge mediated theories, which we refer to as Yukawa-gauge mediation. Within this formalism we study the resulting soft masses in the visible spectrum. We find general expressions for the gaugino and scalar masses. Under generic conditions, the gaugino mass is screened, vanishing at first order in the SUSY breaking scale.
