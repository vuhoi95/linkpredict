Title: Anomaly/Transport in an Ideal Weyl gas
Authors: R. Loganayagam and Piotr Sur√≥wka
Abstract: We study some of the transport processes which are specific to an ideal gas of relativistic Weyl fermions and relate the corresponding transport coefficients to various anomaly coefficients of the system. We propose that these transport processes can be thought of as arising from the continuous injection of chiral states and their subsequent adiabatic flow driven by vorticity. This in turn leads to an elegant expression relating the anomaly induced transport coefficients to the anomaly polynomial of the Ideal Weyl gas.
