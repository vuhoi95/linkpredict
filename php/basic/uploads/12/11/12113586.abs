Title: N-Galilean conformal algebras and quantum theory with higher order time  derivatives
Authors: K. Andrzejewski and J. Gonera and P. Kosinski
Abstract: It is shown that centrally extended N-Galilean conformal algebra, with N-odd, is the maximal symmetry algebra of the Schrodinger equation corresponding to the free Lagrangian involving (N+1)/2-th order time derivatives.
