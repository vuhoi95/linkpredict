Title: Thermodynamics of the brane in Chern-Simons matter theories with flavor
Authors: Niko Jokela and Javier Mas and Alfonso V. Ramallo and Dimitrios Zoakos
Abstract: We study the holographic dual of flavors in a Chern-Simons matter theory at non-zero temperature, realized as D6-branes in the type IIA black hole dual in the ABJM background geometry. We consider both massive and massless flavors. The former are treated in the quenched approximation, whereas the massless ones are considered as dynamical objects and their backreaction on the geometry is included in the black hole background. We compute the holographically renormalized action of the probe by imposing several physical conditions. In the limit of massless flavors the free energy and entropy of the probe match non-trivially the first variation of these quantities for the backreacted background when the number of flavors is increased by one unit. We compute several thermodynamical functions for the system and analyze the meson melting phase transition between Minkowski and black hole embeddings.
