Title: Couplings of gravitational currents with Chern-Simons gravities
Authors: Ümit Ertem and Özgür Açık
Abstract: The coupling of conserved p-brane currents with non-Abelian gaugetheories is done consistently by using Chern-Simons forms. Conserved currents localized on p-branes that have a gravitational origin can be constructed from Killing-Yano forms of the underlying spacetime. We propose a generalization of the coupling procedure with Chern-Simons gravities to the case of gravitational conserved currents. In odd dimensions, the field equations of coupled Chern-Simons gravities that describe the local curvature on p-branes are obtained. In special cases of three and five dimensions, the field equations are investigated in detail.
