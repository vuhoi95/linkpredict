Title: On Holographic Thermalization and Dethermalization of Quark-Gluon Plasma
Authors: I. Ya. Arefeva and I. V. Volovich
Abstract: We estimate the ratio of the thermalization time over the freeze-out time using a holographic AdS-Vaidya model for quark-gluon plasma formed in the heavy ion collisions. In the model the process of thermalization is described as formation of the black hole in AdS space while dethermalization process, related with the freeze-out, as the black hole evaporation due to the Hawking radiation that is modeled by the Vaidya metric with a negative mass. In this model the thermalization takes place only at small scales and absent in the infrared region. At small scales the system tends towards a state of the thermal equilibrium only for the short time after which the processes of dethermalization starts. In this simple model the dethermalization time has a low bound about 7 fm/c which is consistent with experimental data.
