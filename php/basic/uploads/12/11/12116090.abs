Abstract: We study the leading quantum string correction to the dressing phase in the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz system for superstring in AdS_3 x S^3 x T^4 supported by RR flux. We find that the phase should be different from the BES phase appearing in the AdS_5 x S^5 case. We use the simplest example of a rigid circular string with two equal spins in S^3 and also consider the general approach based on the algebraic curve description. We also discuss the case of the AdS_3 x S^3 x S^3 x S^1 theory and find the dependence of the 1-loop correction to the effective string tension function h(\lambda) (expected to enter the magnon dispersion relation) on the parameters alpha related to the ratio of the two 3-sphere radii. This correction vanishes in the AdS_3 x S^3 x T^4 case.
