Abstract: We revisit baryons in the Skyrme model. Starting from static baryons in the helicity eigenstates, we generalize their wavefunctions to the non-static and relativistic regime. A new representation for gamma matrices in the soliton collective space is constructed and the corresponding Dirac equation is obtained. As an example, we draw consideration on how to apply this new representation on the calculus of vector current vacuum expectation values for baryon states of spin and isospin half and arbitrary momenta and we show how elastic form factors can be derived.
