Title: Dilaton emission and absorption from far-from-equilibrium non-abelian  plasma
Authors: Paul M. Chesler and Derek Teaney
Abstract: Using gauge/gravity duality, we study emission and absorption rates of scalar quanta from far-from-equilibrium N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma. By comparing the emission and absorption rates to expectations from the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem, we study how the spectrum thermalizes and how the thermalization time depends on the four momentum of the emitted quanta.
