Title: Local gauge symmetry on optical lattices?
Authors: Yuzhi Liu and Yannick Meurice and Shan-Wen Tsai
Abstract: The versatile technology of cold atoms confined in optical lattices allows the creation of a vast number of lattice geometries and interactions, providing a promising platform for emulating various lattice models. This opens the possibility of letting nature take care of sign problems and real time evolution in carefully prepared situations. Up to now, experimentalists have succeeded to implement several types of Hubbard models considered by condensed matter theorists. In this proceeding, we discuss the possibility of extending this effort to lattice gauge theory. We report recent efforts to establish the strong coupling equivalence between the Fermi Hubbard model and SU(2) pure gauge theory in 2+1 dimensions by standard determinantal methods developed by Robert Sugar and collaborators. We discuss the possibility of using dipolar molecules and external fields to build models where the equivalence holds beyond the leading order in the strong coupling expansion.
