Title: A scale-covariant quantum space-time
Authors: Claudio Perini and Gabriele Nunzio Tornetta
Abstract: A noncommutative space-time admitting dilation symmetry was briefly mentioned in the seminal work of Doplicher, Fredenhagen and Roberts. In this paper we explicitly construct the model in details and carry out an in-depth analysis. The C*-algebra that describes this quantum space-time is determined, and it is shown that it admits an action by *-automorphisms of the dilation group, along with the expected Poincar\'e covariance. In order to study the main physical properties of this scale-covariant model, a free scalar neutral field is introduced as a investigation tool. Our key results are then the loss of locality and the irreducibility, or triviality, of special field algebras associated with regions of the ordinary Minkowski space-time. It turns out, in the conclusions, that this analysis allows also to argue on viable ways of constructing a full conformally covariant model for quantum space-time.
