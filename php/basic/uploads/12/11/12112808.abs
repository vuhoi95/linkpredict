Title: BPS states and their reductions
Authors: Prarit Agarwal and Antonio Amariti and Alberto Mariotti and Massimo Siani
Abstract: We develop a method to identify the BPS states in the Hilbert space of a supersymmetric field theory on a generic curved space which preserves at least two real supercharges. We also propose a one-to-one map between BPS states in d-dimensional field theories and states that contribute to the supersymmetric partition function of a corresponding (d-1)-dimensional field theory. As an application we obtain the superconformal index on rounded and squashed three spheres, and we show a natural reduction of the respective indices to the three-dimensional exact partition functions. We discuss the validity of the correspondence both at the perturbative and at the non-perturbative level and exploit the idea to uplift the computation of the exact supersymmetric partition function on a general manifold to a higher dimensional index.
