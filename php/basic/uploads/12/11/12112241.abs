Title: A cold-atom quantum simulator for SU(2) Yang-Mills lattice gauge theory
Authors: Erez Zohar and J. Ignacio Cirac and Benni Reznik
Abstract: Non-abelian gauge theories play an important role in the standard model of particle physics, and unfold a partially unexplored world of exciting physical phenomena. In this letter, we suggest a realization of a non-abelian lattice gauge theory - SU(2) Yang-Mills in 1+1 dimensions, using ultracold atoms. Remarkably, and in contrast to previous proposals, in our model gauge invariance is a direct consequence of angular momentum conservation and thus is fundamental and robust. Our proposal may serve as well as a starting point for higher dimensional realizations.
