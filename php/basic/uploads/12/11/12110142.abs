Abstract: We present preliminary results for simulations of SO(4)-gauge theory with two Dirac Wilson fermions transforming according to the vector representation. We map out the phase diagram including the strong coupling bulk phase transition line as well as the zero PCAC-mass line. In addition, we measure the pseudo scalar and vector meson masses, and investigate whether the theory features chiral symmetry breaking. If the theory is used for breaking the electroweak symmetry dynamically it is the orthogonal group equivalent of the Minimal Walking Technicolor model but with the following distinctive features: a] It provides a natural complex weak isotriplet of Goldstone bosons of which the neutral component can be identified with a light composite dark matter state; b] It is expected to break the global symmetry spontaneously; c] It is free from fermionic composite states made by a techniglue and a technifermion.
