Title: Casimir Effect in the Presence of External Fields
Authors: Matthew Beauregard and Guglielmo Fucci and Klaus Kirsten and Pedro Morales
Abstract: In this work the Casimir effect is studied for scalar fields in the presence of boundaries and under the influence of arbitrary smooth potentials of compact support. In this setting, piston configurations are analyzed in which the piston is modeled by a potential. For these configurations, analytic results for the Casimir energy and force are obtained by employing the zeta function regularization method. Also, explicit numerical results for the Casimir force are provided for pistons modeled by a class of compactly supported potentials that are realizable as delta-sequences. These results are then generalized to higher dimensional pistons by considering additional Kaluza-Klein dimensions.
