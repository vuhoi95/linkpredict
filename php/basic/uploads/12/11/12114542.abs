Title: On Gravity localization under Lorentz Violation in warped scenario
Authors: Victor Santos and C. A. S. Almeida
Abstract: Recently Rizzo studied the Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) in a brane scenario with one extra dimension where he found a non-zero mass for the four-dimensional graviton. This leads to the conclusion that five-dimensional models with LIV are not phenomenologically viable. In this work we re-examine the issue of Lorentz Invariance Violation in the context of higher dimensional theories. We show that a six-dimensional geometry describing a string-like defect with a bulk-dependent cosmological constant can yield a massless 4D graviton, if we allow the cosmological constant variation along the bulk, and thus can provides a phenomenologically viable solution for the gauge hierarchy problem.
