Title: Going beyond the Standard Model with noncommutative geometry
Authors: Thijs van den Broek and Walter D. van Suijlekom
Abstract: The derivation of the full Standard Model from noncommutative geometry has been a promising sign for possible applications of the latter in High Energy Physics. Many believe, however, that the Standard Model cannot be the final answer. We translate several demands whose origin lies in physics to the context of noncommutative geometry and use these to put constraints on the fermionic content of models. We show that the Standard Model only satisfies these demands provided it has a right-handed neutrino in each 'generation'. Furthermore, we show that the demands can be met upon extending the SM with a copy of the representation (1, 2, 1/2), but this has consequences for the number of particle generations. We finally prove that the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model is not among the models that satisfy our constraints, but we pose a solution that is a slight extension of the MSSM.
