Title: Implications of purely classical gravity for inflationary tensor modes
Authors: Amjad Ashoorioon and P. S. Bhupal Dev and Anupam Mazumdar
Abstract: We discuss the implications of purely classical, instead of quantum, theory of gravity for the gravitational wave spectrum generated during inflation. We show that a positive detection of primordial gravitational waves will no longer suffice to determine the scale of inflation in this case -- even a high-scale model of inflation can bypass the observational constraints due to large uncertainties in the initial classical amplitude of the tensor modes.
