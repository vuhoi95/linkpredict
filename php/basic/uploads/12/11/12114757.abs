Title: The Non-Adiabatic Pressure Perturbation and Non-Canonical Kinetic Terms  in Multifield Inflation
Authors: C. van de Bruck and S. Vu
Abstract: The evolution of the non-adiabatic pressure perturbation during inflation driven by two scalar fields is studied numerically for three different types of models. In the first model, the fields have standard kinetic terms. The other two models considered feature non-canonical kinetic terms; the first containing two fields which are coupled via their kinetic terms, and the second where one field has the standard kinetic term with the other field being a DBI field. We find that the evolution and the final amplitude of the non-adiabatic pressure perturbation depends strongly on the kinetic terms.
