Title: Conformal quantum mechanics and Fick-Jacobs equation
Authors: Juan M. Romero and Alejandro Gaona
Abstract: It is found a relation between conformal quantum mechanics and Fick-Jacobs equation, which describes diffusion in channels. This relation is given between a family of channels and a family of conformal Hamiltonians. In addition, it is shown that a conformal Hamiltonian is associated with two channels with different geometry. Furthermore exact solutions for Fick-Jacobs equation are given for this family of channels.
