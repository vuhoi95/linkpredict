Title: Graviton multi-point functions at the AdS boundary
Authors: Ram Brustein and A. J. M. Medved
Abstract: The gauge-gravity duality can be used to relate connected multi-point graviton functions to connected multi-point correlation functions of the stress tensor of a strongly coupled fluid. Here, we show how to construct the connected graviton functions for a particular kinematic regime that is ideal for discriminating between different gravitational theories; in particular, between Einstein theory and its leading-order string theory correction. Our analysis begins with the one-particle irreducible graviton amplitudes in an anti-de Sitter black brane background. We show how these can be used to calculate the connected graviton functions and demonstrate that the two types of amplitudes agree in some cases. It is then asserted on physical grounds that this agreement persists in all cases for both Einstein gravity and its leading-order correction. This outcome implies that the corresponding field-theory correlation functions can be read directly off from the bulk Lagrangian, just as can be done for the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density.
