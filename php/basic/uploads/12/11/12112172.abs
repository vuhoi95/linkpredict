Title: The mirror symmetry of K3 surfaces with non-symplectic automorphisms of  prime order
Authors: Paola Comparin and Christopher Lyons and Nathan Priddis and Rachel Suggs
Abstract: We consider K3 surfaces that possess certain automorphisms of prime order p>2 and we present, for these surfaces, a correspondence between the mirror symmetry of Berglund-Huebsch-Chiodo-Ruan and that for lattice polarized K3 surfaces presented by Dolgachev.
