Title: New Magnetized Squashed Black Holes -- Thermodynamics and Hawking  Radiation
Authors: Petya G. Nedkova and Stoytcho S. Yazadjiev
Abstract: We construct a new exact solution in the 5D Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity describing a magnetized squashed black hole. We calculate its physical characteristics, and derive the Smarr-like relations. The Hawking radiation of the solution is also investigated by calculating the greybody factor for the emission of massless scalar particles in the low-energy regime. In distinction to the case of asymptotically flat magnetized black holes, the thermodynamical characteristics and the Hawking radiation of the solution depend on the external magnetic field, and consequently can be tuned by its variation.
