Title: Differential forms and k-Minkowski spacetime from extended twist
Authors: Tajron Jurić and Stjepan Meljanac and Rina Štrajn
Abstract: We analyze bicovariant differential calculus on $\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime. It is shown that corresponding Lorentz generators and noncommutative coordinates compatible with bicovariant calculus cannot be realized in terms of commutative coordinates and momenta. Furthermore, $\kappa$-Minkowski space and NC forms are constructed by twist related to a bicrossproduct basis. It is pointed out that the consistency condition is not satisfied. We present the construction of $\kappa$-deformed coordinates and forms (super-Heisenberg algebra) using extended twist. It is compatible with bicovariant differential calculus with $\kappa$-deformed $\mathfrak{igl}(4)$-Hopf algebra. The extended twist leading to $\kappa$-Poincar\'{e}-Hopf algebra is also discussed.
