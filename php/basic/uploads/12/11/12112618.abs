Title: Just Renormalizable TGFT's on U(1)^d with Gauge Invariance
Authors: Dine Ousmane Samary and Fabien Vignes-Tourneret
Abstract: We study the polynomial Abelian or U(1)^d Tensorial Group Field Theories equipped with a gauge invariance condition in any dimension d. From our analysis, we prove the just renormalizability at all orders of perturbation of the phi^4_6 and phi^6_5 random tensor models. We also deduce that the phi^4_5 tensor model is super-renormalizable.
