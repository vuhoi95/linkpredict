Title: Hybrid inflation in high-scale supersymmetry
Authors: Tetsutaro Higaki and Kwang Sik Jeong and Fuminobu Takahashi
Abstract: In hybrid inflation, the inflaton generically has a tadpole due to gravitational effects in supergravity, which significantly changes the inflaton dynamics in high-scale supersymmetry. We point out that the tadpole can be cancelled if there is a supersymmetry breaking singlet with gravitational couplings, and in particular, the cancellation is automatic in no-scale supergravity. We consider the LARGE volume scenario as a concrete example and discuss the compatibility between the hybrid inflation and the moduli stabilization. We also point out that the dark radiation generated by the overall volume modulus decay naturally relaxes a tension between the observed spectral index and the prediction of the hybrid inflation.
