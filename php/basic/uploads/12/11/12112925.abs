Title: Nonconformal holographic model for D-meson suppression at energies  available at the CERN Large Hadron Collider
Authors: Santosh K. Das and Ali Davody
Abstract: The drag force of charm quarks propagating through a thermalized system of Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) has been considered within the framework of both conformal/non-conformal Anti de Sitter (AdS) correspondence. Newly derived Einstein Fluctuation-Dissipation relation has been used to calculate the heavy flavor diffusion coefficients. Using the drag and diffusion coefficients as inputs Langevin equation has been solved to study the heavy flavor suppression factor. It has been shown that within conformal AdS correspondence the D-meson suppression at LHC energy can be reproduced where as the non-conformal AdS correspondence fail to reproduce the experimental results. It suggests collisional loss alone within non-conformal AdS correspondence can not reproduce the experimental results and inclusion of radiative loss becomes important.
