Title: A topological state sum model for fermions on the circle
Authors: John W. Barrett and Steven Kerr and Jorma Louko
Abstract: A simple state sum model for fermions on a 1-manifold is constructed. The model is independent of the triangulation and gives exactly the same partition function as the Dirac functional integral with zeta-function regularisation. Some implications for more realistic physical models are discussed.
