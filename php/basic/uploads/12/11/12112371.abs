Title: Primordial Black Holes from the inflating curvaton
Authors: Kazunori Kohri and Chia-Min Lin and Tomohiro Matsuda
Abstract: The primordial black hole (PBH) formation is studied in light of the inflating curvaton. The typical scale of the PBH formation is determined by curvaton inflation, which may generate PBH with $10^{14}\mathrm{g}\le M_\mathrm{PBH}\le 10^{38}\mathrm{g}$ when curvaton inflation gives the number of e-foldings $5\leq N_2\leq 38$. The non-Gaussianity of the inflating curvaton does not prevent the PBH formation.
