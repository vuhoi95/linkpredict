Title: Thermal photon production in a strongly coupled anisotropic plasma
Authors: Leonardo Patino and Diego Trancanelli
Abstract: Photons produced in heavy ion collisions escape virtually unperturbed from the surrounding medium, thus representing an excellent probe of the conditions at the emission point. Using the gauge/gravity duality, we calculate the rate of photon production in an anisotropic, strongly coupled N=4 plasma with Nf<<Nc quark flavors. We consider arbitrary orientations of the photon momentum with respect to the anisotropic direction, as well as arbitrary values of the anisotropy. We present results for the correlation functions of two electromagnetic currents and for the electric conductivity. These quantities can be larger or smaller than the isotropic ones, depending on the direction of propagation and polarization of the photons. The total production rate is however always larger than the isotropic one, independently of the frequency, direction of propagation, and value of the anisotropy.
