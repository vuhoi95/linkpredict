Title: String theory embeddings of non-relativistic field theories and their  holographic Horava gravity duals
Authors: Stefan Janiszewski and Andreas Karch
Abstract: We argue that generic non-relativistic quantum field theories have a holographic description in terms of Horava gravity. We construct explicit examples of this duality embedded in string theory by starting with relativistic dual pairs and taking a non-relativistic scaling limit.
