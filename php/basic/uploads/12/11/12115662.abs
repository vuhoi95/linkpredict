Title: Cosmological constraints on spontaneous R-symmetry breaking models
Authors: Yuta Hamada and Kohei Kamada and Tatsuo Kobayashi and Yutaka Ookouchi
Abstract: We study general constraints on spontaneous R-symmetry breaking models coming from the cosmological effects of the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons, R-axions. They are substantially produced in the early Universe and may cause several cosmological problems. We focus on relatively long-lived R-axions and find that in a wide range of parameter space, models are severely constrained. In particular, R-axions with mass less than 1 MeV are generally ruled out for relatively high reheating temperature, $T_R>10$ GeV.
