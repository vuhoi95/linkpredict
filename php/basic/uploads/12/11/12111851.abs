Title: Supersymmetry breaking, conserved charges and stability in N=1 Super KdV
Authors: A. Restuccia and A. Sotomayor
Abstract: We analyse the non-abelian algebra and the supersymmetric cohomology associated to the local and non-local conserved charges of N=1 SKdV under Poisson brackets. We then consider the breaking of the supersymmetry and obtain an integrable model in terms of Clifford algebra valued fields. We discuss the remaining conserved charges of the new system and the stability of the solitonic solutions.
