Title: Inflection Points and the Power Spectrum
Authors: Sean Downes and Bhaskar Dutta
Abstract: Inflection point inflation generically includes a deviation from slow-roll when the inflaton approaches the inflection point. Such deviations are shown to be generated by transitions between singular trajectories. The effects on the power spectrum are studied within the context of universality classes for small-field models. These effects are shown to scale with universality parameters, and can explain the anomalously low power at large scales observed in the CMB. The reduction of power is related to the inflection point's basin of attraction. Implications for the likelihood of inflation are discussed.
