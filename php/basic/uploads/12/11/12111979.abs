Title: Universality of second order transport in Gauss-Bonnet gravity
Authors: Evgeny Shaverin and Amos Yarom
Abstract: We compute all the second order transport coefficients of a hydrodynamic theory with a gravity dual which includes a Gauss-Bonnet term. We find that a particular linear combination of the second order transport coefficients, which was found to vanish in generic two derivative gravity theories with matter, remains zero even in the presence of the Gauss-Bonnet term. We contrast this behavior with the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio.
