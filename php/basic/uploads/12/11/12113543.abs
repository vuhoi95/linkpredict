Title: Comment on the paper "Minimal Fields of Canonical Dimensionality are  Free" [arXiv:1210.3864] by S. Weinberg
Authors: Alexander Monin and Mikhail Shaposhnikov
Abstract: In this note we show that in a scale invariant relativistic field theory fields of canonical dimensionality are not necessarily free provided the scale invariance is spontaneously broken.
