Abstract: We analyze the properties of asymptotically AdS electrically charged black brane solutions in a consistent truncation of the N=4^+, D=5 Romans' gauged supergravity which contains gravity, SU(2) and U(1) gauge fields, and a dilaton possessing a nontrivial potential approaching a constant negative value at infinity. We find that the U(1)\times U(1) solutions become unstable to forming non-Abelian hair. These configurations emerge as zero modes of the Abelian solutions at critical temperature and a critical (nonvanishing) ratio of the electric charges and can be viewed as holographic p-wave superfluids.
