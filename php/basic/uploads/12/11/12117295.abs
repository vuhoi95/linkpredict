Title: On anharmonic stabilisation equations for black holes
Authors: Pietro Galli and Kevin Goldstein and Jan Perz
Abstract: We investigate the stabilisation equations for sufficiently general, yet regular, extremal (supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric) and non-extremal black holes in four-dimensional N=2 supergravity using both the H-FGK approach and a generalisation of Denef's formalism. By an explicit calculation we demonstrate that the equations necessarily contain an anharmonic part, even in the static, spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat case.
