Abstract: We provide a string theory embedding for N = 1 superconformal field theories defined by bipartite graphs inscribed on a disk. We realize these theories by exploiting the close connection with related N = 2 generalized (A_(k-1), A_(n-1)) Argyres-Douglas theories. The N = 1 theory is obtained from spacetime filling D5-branes wrapped on an algebraic curve and NS5-branes wrapped on special Lagrangians of C^2 which intersect along the BPS flow lines of the corresponding N = 2 Argyres-Douglas theory. Dualities of the N = 1 field theory follow from geometric deformations of the brane configuration which leave the UV boundary conditions fixed. In particular we show how to recover the classification of IR fixed points from cells of the totally non-negative Grassmannian Gr^(tnn)_(k,n+k). Additionally, we present evidence that in the 3D theory obtained from dimensional reduction on a circle, VEVs of line operators given by D3-branes wrapped over faces of the bipartite graph specify a coordinate system for Gr^(tnn)_(k,n+k).
