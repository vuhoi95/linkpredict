Title: Induced gravity from gauge theories
Authors: R. F. Sobreiro and A. A. Tomaz and V. J. Vasquez Otoya
Abstract: We discuss the possibility of a class of gauge theories, in four Euclidean dimensions, to describe gravity at quantum level. The requirement is that, at low energies, these theories can be identified with gravity as a geometrodynamical theory. Specifically, we deal with de Sitter-type groups and show that a Riemann-Cartan first order gravity emerges. An analogy with quantum chromodynamics is also formulated. Under this analogy it is possible to associate a soft BRST breaking to a continuous deformation between both sectors of the theory, namely, ultraviolet and infrared. Moreover, instead of hadrons and glueballs, the physical observables are identified with the geometric properties of spacetime. Furthermore, Newton and cosmological constants can be determined from the dynamical content of the theory.
