Abstract: We consider symmetron model in a generalized background with a hope to make it compatible with dark energy. We observe a "no go" theorem at least in case of a conformal coupling. Being convinced of symmetron incapability to be dark energy, we try to retain its role for spontaneous symmetry breaking and assign the role of dark energy either to standard quintessence or $F(R)$ theory which are switched on by symmetron field in the symmetry broken phase. The scenario reduces to standard Einstein gravity in the high density region. After the phase transition generated by symmetron field, either the $F(R)$ gravity or the standard quintessence are induced in the low density region. we demonstrate that local gravity constraints and other requirements are satisfied although the model could generate the late-time acceleration of Universe.
