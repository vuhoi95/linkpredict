Title: Holographic Symmetries and Generalized Order Parameters for Topological  Matter
Authors: E. Cobanera and G. Ortiz and Z. Nussinov
Abstract: We introduce a universally applicable method, based on the bond-algebraic theory of dualities, to search for generalized order parameters in disparate systems including non-Landau systems with topological order. A key notion that we advance is that of {\em holographic symmetry}. It reflects situations wherein global symmetries become, under a duality mapping, symmetries that act solely on the system's boundary. Holographic symmetries are naturally related to edge modes and localization. The utility of our approach is illustrated by systematically deriving generalized order parameters for pure and matter-coupled Abelian gauge theories, and for some models of topological matter.
