Abstract: We present a particle physics model based on a ten-dimensional (10D) super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory compactified on magnetized tori preserving four-dimensional ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry. The low-energy spectrum contains the minimal supersymmetric standard model with hierarchical Yukawa couplings caused by a wavefunction localization of the chiral matter fields due to the existence of magnetic fluxes, allowing a semi-realistic pattern of the quark and the lepton masses and mixings. We show supersymmetric flavor structures at low energies induced by a moduli-mediated and an anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking.
