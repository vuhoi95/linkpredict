Title: Exact S-matrices for AdS_3/CFT_2
Authors: Changrim Ahn and Diego Bombardelli
Abstract: We propose exact $S$-matrices for the AdS_3/CFT_2 duality between Type IIB strings on AdS_3 x S^3 x M_4 with M_4=S^3 x S^1 or T^4 and the corresponding two-dimensional conformal field theories. We fix the complete two-particle S-matrices for both those cases of AdS_3/CFT_2, on the basis of the symmetries su(1|1) and su(1|1) x su(1|1), respectively preserved by their vacua. A crucial justification comes from the derivation of the all-loop Bethe ansatz matching exactly the recent conjecture proposed by [1] and [2].
