Title: Linearised stability analysis of generic thin shells
Authors: Francisco S. N. Lobo and Prado Martin-Moruno and Nadiezhda Montelongo Garcia and Matt Visser
Abstract: We construct generic spherically symmetric thin shells by using the cut-and-paste procedure. We take considerable effort to make the analysis as general and unified as practicable; investigating both the internal physics of the transition layer and its interaction with "external forces" arising due to interactions between the transition layer and the bulk spacetime. We demonstrate in full generality that stability of the thin shell is equivalent to choosing suitable properties for the material residing on the junction interface. Applications to gravastars and wormhole geometries are also explored.
