Abstract: The spin-statistics connection, quantum gravity and other physical considerations suggest that classical space-time topology is not an immutable attribute and can change in quantum physics. The implementation of topology change using quantum principles has been studied for over two decades by a few of us. There has been a recent revival of interest in some of our work, dating back to as early as 1995. The present paper is meant as a resource article to our major relevant papers. It contains summaries of the contents of the cited papers and the corresponding links wherever available.
