Abstract: During inflation, spacetime is approximately described by de Sitter space which is conformally invariant with the symmetry group SO(1,4). This symmetry can significantly constrain the quantum perturbations which arise in the inflationary epoch. We consider a general situation of single field inflation and show that the three point function involving two scalar modes and one tensor mode is uniquely determined, up to small corrections, by the conformal symmetries. Special conformal transformations play an important role in our analysis. Our result applies only to models where the inflaton sector also approximately preserves the full conformal group and shows that this three point function is a good way to test if special conformal invariance was preserved during inflation.
