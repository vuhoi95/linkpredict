Title: Combinatorial Hopf algebraic description of the multiscale  renormalization in quantum field theory
Authors: Thomas Krajewski and Vincent Rivasseau and Adrian Tanasa
Abstract: We define in this paper several Hopf algebras describing the combinatorics of the so-called multi-scale renormalization in quantum field theory. After a brief recall of the main mathematical features of multi-scale renormalization, we define assigned graphs, that are graphs with appropriate decorations for the multi-scale framework. We then define Hopf algebras on these assigned graphs and on the Gallavotti-Nicol\`o trees, particular class of trees encoding the supplementary informations of the assigned graphs. Several morphisms between these combinatorial Hopf algebras and the Connes-Kreimer algebra are given. Finally, scale dependent couplings are analyzed via this combinatorial algebraic setting.
