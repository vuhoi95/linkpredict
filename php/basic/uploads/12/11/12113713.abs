Title: Superembedding Methods for Current Superfields
Authors: Walter D. Goldberger and Zuhair U. Khandker and Daliang Li and Witold Skiba
Abstract: We extend the superembedding formalism for 4D N=1 superconformal field theory (SCFT) to the case of fields in arbitrary representations of the superconformal group SU(2,2|1). As applications we obtain manifestly superconformally covariant expressions for two- and three-point functions involving conserved currents, e.g. the supercurrent multiplet or global symmetry current superfields. The embedding space results are presented in a compact form by employing an index-free formalism. Our expressions are consistent with the literature, but the manifestly covariant forms of correlators presented here are new.
