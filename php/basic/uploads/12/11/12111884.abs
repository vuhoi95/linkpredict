Title: Field Theory Interpretation of N=2 Stringy Instantons
Authors: Riccardo Argurio and Davide Forcella and Alberto Mariotti and Daniele Musso and Christoffer Petersson
Abstract: We consider stringy instanton contributions to the prepotential of low-energy N=2 theories engineered by D-brane set ups at orbifold and orientifold singularities. We show that such contributions can always be reproduced in a purely field theoretic UV completion. We perform the explicit check up to instanton number three, both for Sp(0) and U(1) stringy instantons, the latter being introduced for the purpose. We further argue that the UV completion that we propose, though weakly coupled, can be smoothly mapped to a gravity-dual inspired UV completion consisting of a cascade of baryonic root transitions.
