Title: Soft Supersymmetry Breaking in Anisotropic LARGE Volume  Compactifications
Authors: Stephen Angus and Joseph P. Conlon
Abstract: We study soft supersymmetry breaking terms for anisotropic LARGE volume compactifications, where the bulk volume is set by a fibration with one small four-cycle and one large two-cycle. We consider scenarios where D7s wrap either a blow-up cycle or the small fibre cycle. Chiral matter can arise either from modes parallel or perpendicular to the brane. We compute soft terms for this matter and find that for the case where the D7 brane wraps the fibre cycle the scalar masses can be parametrically different, allowing a possible splitting of third-generation soft terms.
