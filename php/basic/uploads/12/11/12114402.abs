Title: Stability of Einstein-Aether Cosmological Models
Authors: Patrik Sandin and Bassemah Alhulaimi and Alan Coley
Abstract: We use a dynamical systems analysis to investigate the future behaviour of Einstein-Aether cosmological models with a scalar field coupling to the expansion of the aether and a non-interacting perfect fluid. The stability of the equilibrium solutions are analysed and the results are compared with the standard inflationary cosmological solutions and previously studied cosmological Einstein-Aether models.
