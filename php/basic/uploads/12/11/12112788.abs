Abstract: We continue our study of the AGT correspondence between instanton counting on C^2/Z_p and Conformal field theories with the symmetry algebra A(r,p). In the cases r=1, p=2 and r=2, p=2 this algebra specialized to: A(1,2)=H+sl(2)_1 and A(2,2)=H+sl(2)_2+NSR. As the main tool we use a new construction of the algebra A(r,2) as the limit of the toroidal gl(1) algebra for q,t tend to -1. We claim that the basis of the representation of the algebra A(r,2) (or equivalently, of the space of the local fields of the corresponding CFT) can be expressed through Macdonald polynomials with the parameters q,t go to -1. The vertex operator which naturally arises in this construction has factorized matrix elements in this basis. We also argue that the singular vectors of the $\mathcal{N}=1$ Super Virasoro algebra can be realized in terms of Macdonald polynomials for a rectangular Young diagram and parameters q,t tend to -1.
