Title: Identification of the Givental formula with the spectral curve  topological recursion procedure
Authors: P. Dunin-Barkowski and N. Orantin and S. Shadrin and L. Spitz
Abstract: We identify the Givental formula for the ancestor formal Gromov-Witten potential with a version of the topological recursion procedure for a collection of isolated local germs of the spectral curve. As an application we prove a conjecture of Norbury and Scott on the reconstruction of the stationary sector of the Gromov-Witten potential of $\CP1$ via a particular spectral curve.
