Title: A dual order parameter from fundamentally colour charged matter
Authors: Markus Hopfer and Mario Mitter and Bernd-Jochen Schaefer and Reinhard Alkofer
Abstract: The center phase transition of QCD and of fundamentally charged scalar QCD at non-vanishing temperature is investigated within a Dyson-Schwinger approach. The temperature dependence of the scalar/quark propagator is studied with generalized boundary conditions. A novel order parameter for the center phase transition is established which still exhibits a considerable dependence on the scalar/quark-gluon vertex.
