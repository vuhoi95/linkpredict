Title: UV Completions of Composite Higgs Models with Partial Compositeness
Authors: Francesco Caracciolo and Alberto Parolini and Marco Serone
Abstract: We construct UV completions of bottom-up models with a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone Boson (NGB) composite Higgs and partial compositeness, admitting a weakly coupled description of the composite sector. This is identified as the low energy description of an SO(N) supersymmetric gauge theory with matter fields in the fundamental of the group. The Higgs is a NGB associated to an SO(5)/SO(4) coset of a global symmetry group and is identified with certain components of matter fields in a Seiberg dual description of the theory. The Standard Model (SM) gauge fields are obtained by gauging a subgroup of the global group. The mass mixing between elementary SM and composite fermion fields advocated in partial compositeness arise from the flow in the IR of certain trilinear Yukawa couplings defined in the UV theory. We explicitly construct two models of this kind. Most qualitative properties of the bottom-up constructions are derived. The masses of gauge and fermion resonances in the composite sector are governed by different couplings and can naturally be separated. Accommodating all SM fermion masses within the partial compositeness paradigm remains the main open problem, since the SM gauge couplings develop Landau poles at unacceptably low energies.
