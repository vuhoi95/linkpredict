Title: Strong Coupling and Bounds on the Graviton Mass in Massive Gravity
Authors: Clare Burrage and Nemanja Kaloper and Antonio Padilla
Abstract: The theory of a single massive graviton has a cutoff much below its Planck scale, because the extra modes from the graviton multiplet involve higher derivative self-interactions, controlled by a scale convoluted from the small graviton mass. Generically, these correct the propagator by environmental effects. The resulting effective cutoff depends on the environmental parameters and the graviton mass. Requiring the theory to be perturbative down to ${\cal O}(1) mm$, we derive bounds on the graviton mass, corresponding to $\gtrsim {\cal O}(1) meV$ for the generic case, and somewhat weaker bounds in cases of fine-tuning. In all cases the mass is required to be much too large for the theory to conform with GR at cosmological distances. Similar results also hold in quartic and quintic Galileon theory.
