Abstract: We examine the near collapse dynamics of a self-gravitating magnetized electron gas at finite temperature, taken as the source of a Bianchi-I spacetime described by the Kasner metric. The set of Einstein-Maxwell field equations reduces to a complete and self-consistent system of non-linear autonomous ODE's. By considering a representative set of initial conditions, the numerical solutions of this system show the gas collapsing into both, isotropic ("point--like") and anisotropic ("cigar-like") singularities, depending on the intensity of the magnetic field. We also examined the behavior during the collapse stage of all relevant state and kinematic variables: the temperature, the expansion scalar, the magnetic field, the magnetization and energy density. We notice a significant qualitative difference in the behavior of the gas for a range of temperatures between the values $\hbox{T}\sim10^{3}\hbox{K}$ and $\hbox{T}\sim 10^{7}\hbox{K}$.
