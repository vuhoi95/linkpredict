Abstract: Models of chaotic inflation with a fractional power-law potential are not only viable but also testable in the foreseeable future. We show that such models can be realized in simple strongly coupled supersymmetric gauge theories. In these models, the energy scale during inflation is dynamically generated by the dimensional transmutation due to the strong gauge dynamics. Therefore, such models not only explain the origin of the fractional power in the inflationary potential but also provide a reason why the energy scale of inflation is much smaller than the Planck scale.
