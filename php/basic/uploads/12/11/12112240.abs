Title: Seiberg-Witten geometry of four dimensional N=2 quiver gauge theories
Authors: Nikita Nekrasov and Vasily Pestun
Abstract: Seiberg-Witten geometry of mass deformed N=2 superconformal ADE quiver gauge theories in four dimensions is determined. We solve the limit shape equations derived from the gauge theory and identify the space M of vacua of the theory with the moduli space of the genus zero holomorphic (quasi)maps to the moduli space of holomorphic G-bundles on a (possibly degenerate) elliptic curve defined in terms of the microscopic gauge couplings, for the corresponding simple ADE Lie group G. The integrable systems underlying, or, rather, overlooking the special geometry of M are identified. The moduli spaces of framed G-instantons on R^2xT^2, of G-monopoles with singularities on R^2xS^1, the Hitchin systems on curves with punctures, as well as various spin chains play an important role in our story. We also comment on the higher dimensional theories. In the companion paper the quantum integrable systems and their connections to the representation theory of quantum affine algebras will be discussed
