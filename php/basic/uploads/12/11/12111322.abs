Title: Dual description of a 4d cosmology
Authors: Michael Smolkin and Neil Turok
Abstract: M-theory compactified on S^7/Z_k allows for a four-dimensional, asymptotically AdS cosmology. The holographic dual consists of ABJM theory with a non-supersymmetric marginal deformation. At weak 't Hooft coupling the dual theory possesses a UV fixed point, allowing the construction of a conformal field theory dual. The dual theory has an infinite family of instantons, which we are able to sum completely. The resulting theory spontaneously breaks global conformal symmetry but is manifestly unitary and non-singular. Our findings point to a holographic resolution of the singularity, measure and conformal factor problems in quantum cosmology.
