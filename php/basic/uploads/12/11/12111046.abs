Title: No asymptotically highly damped quasi-normal modes without horizons?
Authors: Cecilia Chirenti and Alberto Saa and Jozef Skakala
Abstract: We explore the question of what happens with the asymptotically highly damped quasi-normal modes ($\ell$ fixed, $|\omega_{I}|\to\infty$) when the underlying spacetime has no event horizons. We consider the characteristic oscillations of a scalar field in a large class of asymptotically flat spherically symmetric static spacetimes without (absolute) horizons, such that the class accommodates the cases that are known to be of some sort of physical interest. The question of the asymptotic quasi-normal modes in such spacetimes is relevant to elucidate the connection between the behavior of the asymptotic quasi-normal modes and the quantum properties of event horizons, as put forward in some recent important conjectures. We prove for a large class of asymptotically flat spacetimes without horizons that the scalar field asymptotically highly damped modes do not exist. This provides in our view additional evidence that there is indeed a close link between the asymptotically highly damped modes and the existence of spacetime horizons (and their properties).
