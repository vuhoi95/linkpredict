Title: Worldsheet S-matrix of beta-deformed SYM
Authors: Changrim Ahn and Minkyoo Kim and Bum-Hoon Lee
Abstract: We compute perturbative worldsheet S-matrix of beta-deformed AdS/CFT in the strong and weak `t Hooft coupling limit to compare with exact S-matrix. For the purpose we take near BMN limit of TsT-transformed AdS_5 x S^5 with the twisted boundary condition and compute the S-matrix on worldsheet using light-cone gauge fixed Lagrangian. For the weak coupling side, we compute the S-matrix in the SU(3) sector by applying coordinate Bethe ansatz method to the one-loop dilatation operator obtained from the deformed super Yang-Mills theory. These analysis support the conjectured exact S-matrix in the leading order for both sides of beta-deformed AdS/CFT along with appropriate twisted boundary conditions.
