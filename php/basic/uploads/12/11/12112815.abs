Title: AdS/Ricci-flat correspondence and the Gregory-Laflamme instability
Authors: Marco M. Caldarelli and Joan Camps and Blaise Gout√©raux and Kostas Skenderis
Abstract: We show that for every asymptotically AdS solution compactified on a torus there is a corresponding Ricci-flat solution obtained by replacing the torus by a sphere, performing a Weyl rescaling of the metric and appropriately analytically continuing the dimension of the torus/sphere (as in generalized dimensional reduction). In particular, it maps Minkowski spacetime to AdS on a torus, the holographic stress energy tensor of AdS to the stress energy tensor due to a brane localized in the interior of spacetime and AdS black branes to (asymptotically flat) Schwarzschild black branes. Applying it to the known solutions describing the hydrodynamic regime in AdS/CFT, we derive the hydrodynamic stress-tensor of asymptotically flat black branes to second order, which is constrained by the parent conformal symmetry. We compute the dispersion relation of the Gregory-Laflamme unstable modes through cubic order in the wavenumber, finding remarkable agreement with numerical data. In the case of no transverse sphere, AdS black branes are mapped to Rindler spacetime and the second-order transport coefficients of the fluid dual to Rindler spacetime are recovered.
