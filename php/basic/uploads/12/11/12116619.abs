Title: Generation of Cosmological Flows in General Relativity (Features and  Properties of Integrable Singularities)
Authors: V. N. Lukash and E. V. Mikheeva and V. N. Strokov
Abstract: We discuss status of the singularity problem in General Relativity and argue that the requirement that a physical solution must be completely free of singularities may be too strong. As an example, we consider properties of the integrable singularities and show that they represent light horizons separating T-regions of black and white holes. Connecting an astrophysical black hole to a white hole, they lead to a natural mechanism of generating new universes. Under favorable conditions the new universes will also contain black holes which, in their turn, will give rise to another generation of universes. In this case the cosmological evolutionary tree will continue to grow to form the "hyperverse". This scenario essentially differs from other known mechanisms, such as bounce, birth from "nothing", baby-universe scenario, etc.
