Title: Momentum dependence of the bispectrum in two-field inflation
Authors: Eleftheria Tzavara and Bartjan van Tent
Abstract: We examine the momentum dependence of the bispectrum of two-field inflationary models within the long-wavelength formalism. We determine the sources of scale dependence in the expression for the parameter of non-Gaussianity fNL and study two types of variation of the momentum triangle: changing its size and changing its shape. We introduce two spectral indices that quantify the possible types of momentum dependence of the local type fNL and illustrate our results with examples.
