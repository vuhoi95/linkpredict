Title: A Novel String Field Theory Solving String Theory by Liberating Left and  Right Mover
Authors: Holger B. Nielsen and Masao Ninomiya
Abstract: We put forward ideas to a novel string field theory based on making some "objects" that essentially describe "liberated" left- and right- mover fields $X^{\mu}_{L}(\tau + \sigma)$ and $X^{\mu}_{R}(\tau - \sigma)$ on the string. The main progress is that we manage to make our novel string field theory provide the correct mass square spectrum for the string. An interesting detail is that we have to dispense of a species doubler caused by the discretization we introduced in our string field theory of the string right- and left- mover variables. We finally suggest how to obtain the Veneziano amplitude in our model.
