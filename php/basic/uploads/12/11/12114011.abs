Title: Implementing Hilltop F-term Hybrid Inflation in Supergravity
Authors: R. Armillis and C. Pallis
Abstract: F-term hybrid inflation (FHI) of the hilltop type can generate a scalar spectral index, ns, in agreement with the fitting of the seven-year Wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe data by the standard power-law cosmological model with cold dark matter and a cosmological constant, LambdaCDM. We investigate the realization of this type of FHI by using quasi-canonical Kahler potentials with or without the inclusion of extra hidden-sector fields. In the first case, acceptable results can be obtained by constraining the coefficients of the quadratic and/or quartic supergravity correction to the inflationary potential and therefore a mild tuning of the relevant term of the Kahler potential is unavoidable. Possible reduction of ns without generating maxima and minima of the potential on the inflationary path is also possible in a limited region of the available parameter space. The tuning of the terms of the Kahler potential can be avoided with the adoption of a simple class of string-inspired Kahler potentials for the hidden-sector fields which ensures a resolution to the eta problem of FHI and allows acceptable values for the spectral index, constraining the coefficient of the quartic supergravity correction to the inflationary potential. Performing a four-point test of the analyzed models, we single out the most promising of these.
