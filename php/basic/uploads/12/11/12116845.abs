Title: Half-flat structures on S^3xS^3
Authors: Thomas Bruun Madsen and Simon Salamon
Abstract: We describe left-invariant half-flat SU(3)-structures on S^3xS^3 using the representation theory of SO(4) and matrix algebra. This leads to a systematic study of the associated cohomogeneity one Ricci-flat metrics with holonomy G_2 obtained on 7-manifolds with equidistant S^3xS^3 hypersurfaces. The generic case is analysed numerically.
