Title: Baxter operators with deformed symmetry
Authors: D. Chicherin and S. Derkachov and D. Karakhanyan and R. Kirschner
Abstract: Baxter operators are constructed for quantum spin chains with deformed $s\ell_2$ symmetry. The parallel treatment of Yang-Baxter operators for the cases of undeformed, trigonometrically and elliptically deformed symmetries presented earlier and relying on the factorization regarding parameter permutations is extended to the global chain operators following the scheme worked out recently in the undeformed case.
