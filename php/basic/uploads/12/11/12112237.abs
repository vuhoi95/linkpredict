Title: Three point functions in higher spin AdS_3 supergravity
Authors: Thomas Creutzig and Yasuaki Hikida and Peter B. Ronne
Abstract: In a previous work we have proposed that the Prokushkin-Vasiliev higher spin N=2 supergravity on AdS_3 is dual to a large N limit of the N=(2,2) CP^N Kazama-Suzuki model. There is now strong evidence supporting this proposal based on symmetry and spectrum comparison. In this paper we will give further evidence for the duality by studying correlation functions. We compute boundary three point functions with two fermionic operators and one higher spin bosonic current in terms of the bulk supergravity theory. Then we compare with the results in the dual CFT, where the supersymmetry of the theory turns out to be very helpful. In particular we use it to confirm results conjectured in the bosonic case. Moreover, correlators with a fermionic current can be obtained via supersymmetry.
