Title: Charged black holes on the Taub-Bolt instanton
Authors: Cristian Stelea and Ciprian Dariescu and Marina Aura Dariescu
Abstract: We construct a new exact solution of the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton field equations in five dimensions, which describes a system of two general charged and static black holes sitting at the two turning points of the Taub-bolt instanton. We show that in this case the conical singularities can be completely eliminated and the black hole system remains in static equilibrium. We show how to recover some of the known solutions in particular cases and also obtain as a new solution the extremal double-black hole solution on the Taub-bolt instanton. Finally, we compute the conserved charges and investigate some of the thermodynamic properties of this system.
