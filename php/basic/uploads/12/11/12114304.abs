Title: Uniformly accelerated detector in the $Îº$-deformed Dirac vacuum
Authors: E. Harikumar and Ravikant Verma
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how a uniformly accelerated detector responds to vacuum state of a Dirac field in the $\kappa$-Minkowski space-time. Starting from $\kappa$-deformed Dirac theory, which is invariant under $\kappa$-Poincare algebra, we derive $\kappa$-deformed Wightmann function for Dirac field, which is valid up to first order in the deformation parameter $a$. Using this, we calculate the response function of the uniformly accelerated detector, which is coupled to massless Dirac field in $\kappa$-spacetime. From this, we obtain the modification to Unruh effect for the $\kappa$-deformed Dirac field, valid up to first order in the deformation parameter.
