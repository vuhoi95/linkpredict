Title: A non-associative quaternion scalar field theory
Authors: Sergio Giardino and Paulo Teot√¥nio-Sobrinho
Abstract: A non-associative Groenewold-Moyal plane is constructed using quaternion-valued function algebras. The symmetrized multi-particle states, the scalar product, the annihilation/creation algebra and d the formulation in terms of a Hopf algebra are also developed. Non-associative quantum algebras in terms of position and momentum operators are given as the simplest examples of a framework whose applications may involve string theory and non-linear quantum field theory
