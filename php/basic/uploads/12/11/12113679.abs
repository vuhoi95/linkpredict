Title: Rank-n logarithmic conformal field theory in the BTZ black hole
Authors: Taeyoon Moon and Yun Soo Myung
Abstract: We construct the rank-$n$ finite temperature logarithmic conformal field theory (LCFT) starting from the $n$-coupled scalar field theory in the BTZ black hole background. Its zero temperature limit reduces to a rank-$n$ LCFT in the AdS$_3$ background whose gravity dual is a polycritical gravity. We compute all two-point functions of a rank-$n$ finite temperature LCFT. Using the retarded Green's functions on the boundary, we obtain quasinormal modes of scalar $A_n$ which satisfies the $2n$-th order linearized equation. Furthermore, the absorption cross section of $A_n$ indicates a feature of $\ln^{n-1}[\omega \ell]$-correction to the Klein-Gordon mode.
