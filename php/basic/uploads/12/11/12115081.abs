Title: Stochastic Quantization of the Spherical Model and Supersymmetry
Authors: P. F. Bienzobaz and Pedro R. S. Gomes and M. Gomes
Abstract: We use the stochastic quantization method to construct a supersymmetric version of the quantum spherical model. This is based on the equivalence between the Brownian motion described by a Langevin equation and the supersymmetric quantum mechanics, which is connected with the existence of the Nicolai map. We investigate the critical behavior of the supersymmetric model at finite as well as at zero temperatures, showing that it exhibits both classical and quantum phase transitions, and determine the critical dimensions.
