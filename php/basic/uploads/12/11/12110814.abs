Title: p-Brane Actions and Higher Roytenberg Brackets
Authors: Branislav Jurco and Peter Schupp and Jan Vysoky
Abstract: Motivated by the quest to understand the analog of non-geometric flux compactification in the context of M-theory, we study higher dimensional analogs of generalized Poisson sigma models and corresponding dual string and p-brane models. We find that higher generalizations of the algebraic structures due to Dorfman, Roytenberg and Courant play an important role and establish their relation to Nambu-Poisson structures.
