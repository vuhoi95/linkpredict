Authors: Kazunari Shima and Motomu Tsuda and Takeshi Okano
Abstract: The exact classical solution of the equation of the motion for the Nambu-Goldstone fermion of the nonlinear representation of supersymmetry and its physical significance are discussed, which gives a new insight into the chiral symmetry of the standard model for the low energy particle physics.
