Title: Spin-k/2-spin-k/2 SU(2) two-point functions on the torus
Authors: Ingo Kirsch and Piotr Kucharski
Abstract: We discuss a class of two-point functions on the torus of primary operators in the SU(2) Wess-Zumino-Witten model at integer level k. In particular, we construct an explicit expression for the current blocks of the spin-k/2-spin-k/2 torus two-point functions for all k. We first examine the factorization limits of the proposed current blocks and test their monodromy properties. We then prove that the current blocks solve the corresponding Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-like differential equations using the method of Mathur, Mukhi and Sen.
