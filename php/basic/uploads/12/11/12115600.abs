Title: Holographic Stripes
Authors: Moshe Rozali and Darren Smyth and Evgeny Sorkin and Jared B. Stang
Abstract: We construct inhomogeneous asymptotically AdS black hole solutions corresponding to the spontaneous breaking of translational invariance and the formation of striped order in the boundary field theory. We find that the system undergoes a second order phase transition in both the fixed density and fixed chemical potential ensembles, for sufficiently large values of the axion coupling. We investigate the phase structure as function of the temperature, axion coupling and the stripe width. The bulk solutions have striking geometrical features related to a magnetoelectric effect associated with the existence of a near horizon topological insulator. At low temperatures the horizon becomes highly inhomogeneous and tends to pinch off.}
