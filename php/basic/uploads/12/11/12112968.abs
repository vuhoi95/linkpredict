Title: Future singularities and Teleparallelism in Loop Quantum Cosmology
Authors: Kazuharu Bamba and Jaume de Haro and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: We demonstrate how holonomy corrections in loop quantum cosmology (LQC) prevent the Big Rip singularity by introducing a quadratic modification in terms of the energy density $\rho$ in the Friedmann equation in the Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) space-time in a consistent and useful way. In addition, we investigate whether other kind of singularities like Type II,III and IV singularities survive or are avoided in LQC when the universe is filled by a barotropic fluid with the state equation $P=-\rho-f(\rho)$, where $P$ is the pressure and $f(\rho)$ a function of $\rho$. It is shown that the Little Rip cosmology does not happen in LQC. Nevertheless, the occurrence of the Pseudo-Rip cosmology, in which the phantom universe approaches the de Sitter one asymptotically, is established, and the corresponding example is presented. It is interesting that the disintegration of bound structures in the Pseudo-Rip cosmology in LQC always takes more time than that in Einstein cosmology. Our investigation on future singularities is generalized to that in modified teleparallel gravity, where LQC and Brane Cosmology in the Randall-Sundrum scenario are the best examples. It is remarkable that $F(T)$ gravity may lead to all the kinds of future singularities including Little Rip.
