Title: Complex-mass scheme and perturbative unitarity
Authors: T. Bauer and J. Gegelia and G. Japaridze and S. Scherer
Abstract: We derive cutting rules for loop integrals containing propagators with complex masses. Using a field-theoretical model of a heavy vector boson interacting with a light fermion, we demonstrate that the complex-mass scheme respects unitarity order by order in a perturbative expansion provided that the renormalized coupling constant remains real.
