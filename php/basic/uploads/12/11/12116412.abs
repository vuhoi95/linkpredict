Title: Effect of quark masses on the QCD presssure in a strong magnetic  background
Authors: Jean-Paul Blaizot and Eduardo S. Fraga and Leticia F. Palhares
Abstract: We compute the two-loop contribution to the QCD pressure in a strong magnetic background, for arbitrary quark masses. We show that, for very large fields, the chiral limit is trivial.
