Title: Correlation functions of the ABJM model
Authors: Bum-Hoon Lee and Bogeun Gwak and Chanyong Park
Abstract: In the ABJM model, we study the three-point function of two heavy operators and an (ir)relevant one. Following the AdS/CFT correspondence, the structure constant in the large 't Hooft coupling limit can be factorized into two parts. One is the structure constant with a marginal operator, which is fully determined by the physical quantities of heavy operator and gives rise to the consistent result with the RG analysis. The other can be expressed as the universal form depending only on the conformal dimension of an (ir)relevant operator. We also investigate the new size effect of a circular string dual to a certain closed spin chain.
