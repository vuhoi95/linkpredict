Title: Impurity effect in a holographic superconductor
Authors: Takaaki Ishii and Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: We consider a holographic superconductor with homogeneous impurities added. We start with the holographic Abelian-Higgs model for s-wave superconductivity, and turn on a coupling between the gauge field and a new massive gauge field that is introduced for impurities, whose effect is examined in the probe limit. We find that the condensation of the massive gauge field is induced in the superconducting phase. When the coupling is sufficiently large, the mass gap in the optical conductivity disappears. A resonance peak is found in the conductivity for the massive vector field.
