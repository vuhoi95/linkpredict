Title: The Kepler problem in the Snyder space
Authors: Carlos Leiva and Joel Saavedra and J. R. Villanueva
Abstract: In this paper we study the Kepler problem in the non commutative Snyder scenario. We characterize the deformations in the Poisson bracket algebra under a mimic procedure from quantum standard formulations and taking into account a general recipe to build the noncommutative phase space coordinates (in the sense of Poisson brackets). We obtain an expression to the deformed potential, and then the consequences in the precession of the orbit of Mercury are calculated. This result allows us to find an estimated value for the non commutative deformation parameter introduced.
