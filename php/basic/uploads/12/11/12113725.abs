Title: A black ring on the Taub-bolt instanton in five dimensions
Authors: Cristian Stelea and Marian C. Ghilea
Abstract: Using a solution generating technique, we derive a new exact solution describing a charged static black ring on the Taub-bolt gravitational instanton in five dimensions. Unlike the black ring constructed on the self-dual Taub-NUT instanton, it turns out that it is possible to find values of the parameters for which the static black ring is in equilibrium and the conical singularities disappear. We compute its conserved charges and discuss some of its thermodynamic properties.
