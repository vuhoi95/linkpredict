Title: Perturbative superstrata
Authors: Stefano Giusto and Rodolfo Russo
Abstract: We study a particular class of D-brane bound states in type IIB string theory (dubbed "superstrata") that describe microstates of the 5D Strominger-Vafa black hole. By using the microscopic description in terms of open strings we probe these configurations with generic light closed string states and from there we obtain a linearized solution of six-dimensional supergravity preserving four supersymmetries. We then discuss two generalizations of the solution obtained which capture different types of non-linear corrections. By using this construction, we can provide the first explicit example of a superstratum solution which includes the effects of the KK-monopole dipole charge to first order.
