Title: Banks-Casher-type relation for the BCS gap at high density
Authors: Takuya Kanazawa and Tilo Wettig and Naoki Yamamoto
Abstract: We derive a new Banks-Casher-type relation which relates the density of complex Dirac eigenvalues at the origin to the BCS gap of quarks at high density. Our relation is applicable to QCD and QCD-like theories without a sign problem, such as two-color QCD and adjoint QCD with baryon chemical potential, and QCD with isospin chemical potential. It provides us with a method to measure the BCS gap through the Dirac spectrum on the lattice.
