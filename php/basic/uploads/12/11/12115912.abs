Title: Generating functions of (partially-)massless higher-spin cubic  interactions
Authors: Euihun Joung and Luca Lopez and Massimo Taronna
Abstract: Generating functions encoding cubic interactions of (partially-)massless higher-spin fields are provided within the ambient-space formalism. They satisfy a system of higher-order partial differential equations that can be explicitly solved due to their factorized form. We find that the number of consistent couplings increases whenever the squares of the field masses take some integer values (in units of the cosmological constant) and satisfy certain conditions. Moreover, it is shown that only the supplemental solutions can give rise to non-Abelian deformations of the gauge symmetries. The presence of these conditions on the masses is a distinctive feature of (A)dS interactions that has in general no direct counterpart in flat space.
