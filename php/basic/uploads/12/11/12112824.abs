Title: The SU(3)/Z_3 QCD(adj) deconfinement transition via the gauge  theory/"affine" XY-model duality
Authors: Mohamed M. Anber and Scott Collier and Erich Poppitz
Abstract: Earlier, two of us and M. Unsal [arXiv:1112.6389] showed that some 4d gauge theories, compactified on a small spatial circle of size L and considered at temperatures 1/beta near deconfinement, are dual to 2d "affine" XY-spin models. We use the duality to study deconfinement in SU(3)/Z_3 theories with n_f>1 massless adjoint Weyl fermions, QCD(adj) on R^2 x S^1_beta x S^1_L. The"affine" XY-model describes two "spins" - compact scalars taking values in the SU(3) root lattice, with nearest-neighbor interactions and subject to an "external field" preserving the topological Z_3^t and a discrete Z_3^chi subgroup of the chiral symmetry of the 4d gauge theory. The equivalent Coulomb gas representation of the theory exhibits electric-magnetic duality, which is also a high-/low-temperature duality. A renormalization group analysis suggests - but is not convincing, due to the onset of strong coupling - that the self-dual point is a fixed point, implying a continuous deconfinement transition. Here, we study the nature of the transition via Monte Carlo simulations. The Z_3^t x Z_3^chi order parameter, its susceptibility, the vortex density, the energy per spin, and the specific heat are measured over a range of volumes, temperatures, and "external field" strengths (in the gauge theory, these correspond to magnetic bion fugacities). The finite-size scaling of the susceptibility and specific heat we find is characteristic of a first-order transition. Furthermore, for sufficiently large but still smaller than unity bion fugacity (as can be achieved upon an increase of the S^1_L size), at the critical temperature we find two distinct peaks of the energy probability distribution, indicative of a first-order transition, as has been seen in earlier simulations of the full 4d QCD(adj) theory. We end with discussions of the global phase diagram in the beta-L plane for different numbers of flavors.
