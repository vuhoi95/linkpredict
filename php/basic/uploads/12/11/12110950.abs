Abstract: The IKKT or IIB matrix model has been postulated to be a non perturbative definition of superstring theory. It has the attractive feature that spacetime is dynamically generated, which makes possible the scenario of dynamical compactification of extra dimensions, which in the Euclidean model manifests by spontaneously breaking the SO(10) rotational invariance (SSB). In this work we study using Monte Carlo simulations the 6 dimensional version of the Euclidean IIB matrix model. Simulations are found to be plagued by a strong complex action problem and the factorization method is used for effective sampling and computing expectation values of the extent of spacetime in various dimensions. Our results are consistent with calculations using the Gaussian Expansion method which predict SSB to SO(3) symmetric vacua, a finite universal extent of the compactified dimensions and finite spacetime volume.
