Title: Exact kink solitons in a monopole confinement problem
Authors: Shouxin Chen and Yijun Li and Yisong Yang
Abstract: We explicitly construct all kink solitons arising in the recent study of Auzzi, Bolognesi, and Shifman of a monopole confinement problem in ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric QCD. In particular, we show that all finite-energy kink solitons must be BPS.
