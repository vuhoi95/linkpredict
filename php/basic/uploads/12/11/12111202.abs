Title: The world as quantized minimal surfaces
Authors: Joakim Arnlind and Jens Hoppe
Abstract: It is pointed out that the equations $\sum_{i=1}^d [X_i,[X_i,X_j]]=0$ (and its super-symmetrizations, playing a central role in M-theory matrix models) describe noncommutative minimal surfaces -- and can be solved as such.
