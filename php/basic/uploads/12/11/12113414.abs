Title: de Sitter vacua in N = 8 supergravity and slow-roll conditions
Authors: G. Dall'Agata and G. Inverso
Abstract: In this letter we discuss de Sitter vacua in maximal gauged supergravity in 4 dimensions. We show that, using the newly deformed theories introduced in arxiv:1209.0760, we can obtain de Sitter vacua with arbitrarily flat tachyonic directions in the SO(4,4)c models.
