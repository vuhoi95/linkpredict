Title: New class of quantum deformations of D=4 Euclidean supersymmetry
Authors: A. Borowiec and J. Lukierski and M. Mozrzymas and V. N. Tolstoy
Abstract: We present the class of deformations of simple Euclidean superalgebra, which describe the supersymmetrization of some Lie algebraic noncommutativity of D=4 Euclidean space-time. The presented deformations are generated by the supertwists. We provide new explicit formulae for a chosen twisted D=4 Euclidean Hopf superalgebra and describe the corresponding quantum covariant deformation of chiral Euclidean superspace.
