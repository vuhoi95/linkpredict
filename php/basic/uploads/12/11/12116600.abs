Title: Traces on the Algebra of Observables of Rational Calogero Model based on  the Root System
Authors: S. E. Konstein and I. V. Tyutin
Abstract: It is shown that H_R(\nu), the algebra of observables of the rational Calogero model based on the root system R, possesses T(R) independent traces, where T(R) is the number of conjugacy classes of elements without eigenvalue 1 belonging to the Coxeter group W(R) generated by the root system R. Simultaneously, we reproduced an older result: the algebra H_R(\nu), considered as a superalgebra with a natural parity, possesses ST(R) independent supertraces, where ST(R) is the number of conjugacy classes of elements without eigenvalue -1 belonging to W(R).
