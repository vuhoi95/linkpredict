Title: Bounds on the Nonminimal Coupling of the Higgs Boson to Gravity
Authors: Michael Atkins and Xavier Calmet
Abstract: We derive the first bound on the value of the Higgs boson non-minimal coupling to the Ricci scalar. We show that the recent discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN implies that the non-minimal coupling is smaller than $2.6\times 10^{15}$.
