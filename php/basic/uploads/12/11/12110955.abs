Title: Asymptotic safety in the f(R) approximation
Authors: Juergen A. Dietz and Tim R. Morris
Abstract: In the asymptotic safety programme for quantum gravity, it is important to go beyond polynomial truncations. Three such approximations have been derived where the restriction is only to a general function f(R) of the curvature R>0. We confront these with the requirement that a fixed point solution be smooth and exist for all non-negative R. Singularities induced by cutoff choices force the earlier versions to have no such solutions. However, we show that the most recent version has a number of lines of fixed points, each supporting a continuous spectrum of eigen-perturbations. We uncover and analyse the first five such lines. Sensible fixed point behaviour may be achieved if one consistently incorporates geometry/topology change. As an exploratory example, we analyse the equations analytically continued to R<0, however we now find only partial solutions.We show how these results are always consistent with, and to some extent can be predicted from, a straightforward analysis of the constraints inherent in the equations.
