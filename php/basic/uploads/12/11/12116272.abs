Abstract: We employ the superpotential technique for the reconstruction of cosmological models with a non-minimally coupled scalar field evolving on a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background. The key point in this method is that the Hubble parameter is considered as a function of the scalar field and this allows one to reconstruct the scalar field potential and determine the dynamics of the field itself, without a priori fixing the Hubble parameter as a function of time or of the scale factor. The scalar field potentials that lead to de Sitter or asymptotic de Sitter solutions, and those that reproduce the cosmological evolution given by Einstein-Hilbert action plus a barotropic perfect fluid, have been obtained.
