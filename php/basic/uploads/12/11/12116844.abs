Abstract: We perform Monte Carlo study of the 3d N=6 superconformal U(N)*U(N) Chern-Simons gauge theory (ABJM theory), which is conjectured to be dual to M-theory or type IIA superstring theory on certain AdS backgrounds. Our approach is based on a localization method, which reduces the problem to the simulation of a simple matrix model. This enables us to circumvent the difficulties in the original theory such as the sign problem and the SUSY breaking on a lattice. The new approach opens up the possibility of probing the quantum aspects of M-theory and testing the AdS_4/CFT_3 duality at the quantum level. Here we calculate the free energy, and confirm the N^{3/2} scaling in the M-theory limit predicted from the gravity side. We also find that our results nicely interpolate the analytical formulae proposed previously in the M-theory and type IIA regimes.
