Title: Exact hairy black brane solutions in $AdS_{5}$ and holographic RG flows
Authors: Andres Acena and Andres Anabalon and Dumitru Astefanesei
Abstract: We construct a general class of exact, regular black hole solutions with toroidal horizon topology in 5-dimensional AdS gravity with a self-interacting scalar field. Due to the non-trivial backreaction of the scalar field, the no-hair theorems can be evaded so that an event horizon can be formed. The scalar field is regular everywhere outside the curvature singularity and it vanishes at the boundary where the potential is finite. We study the properties of these black holes in the context of AdS/CFT duality and comment on the dual operators, which saturate the unitarity bound. We present exact expressions for the beta-function and construct a c-function that characterizes the RG flow.
