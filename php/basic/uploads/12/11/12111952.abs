Title: On the massless modes of the AdS3/CFT2 integrable systems
Authors: Olof Ohlsson Sax and Bogdan Stefanski jr and Alessandro Torrielli
Abstract: We make a proposal for incorporating massless modes into the spin-chain of the AdS3/CFT2 integrable system. We do this by considering the alpha to 0 limit of the alternating d(2,1;alpha)^2 spin-chain constructed in arXiv:1106.2558. In the process we encounter integrable spin-chains with non-irreducible representations at some of their sites. We investigate their properties and construct their R-matrices in terms of Yangians.
