Title: Volume dependence in 2+1 Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Margarita Garcia Perez and Antonio Gonzalez-Arroyo and Masanori Okawa
Abstract: We present the results of an analysis of a 2+1 dimensional pure SU(N) Yang-Mills theory formulated on a 2-dimensional spatial torus with non-trivial magnetic flux. We focus on investigating the dependence of the electric-flux spectrum, extracted from Polyakov loop correlators, with the spatial size l, the number of colours N, and the magnetic flux m. The size of the torus acts a parameter that allows to control the onset of non-perturbative effects. In the small volume regime, where perturbation theory holds, we derive the one-loop self-energy correction to the single-gluon spectrum, for arbitrary N and m. We discuss the transition from small to large volumes that has been investigated by means of Monte-Carlo simulations. We argue that the energy of electric flux e, for the lowest gluon momentum, depends solely on e/N and on the dimensionless variable x=lambda N l, with lambda the 't Hooft coupling. The variable x can be interpreted as the dimensionless 't Hooft coupling for an effective box size given by Nl. This implies a version of reduction that allows to trade l by N without modifying the electric-flux energy.
