Title: The Hoop Conjecture for Black Rings
Authors: A. H. Mujtaba and C. N. Pope
Abstract: A precise formulation of the hoop conjecture for four-dimensional spacetimes proposes that the Birkhoff invariant \beta for an apparent horizon in a spacetime with mass M should satisfy \beta \le 4\pi M. The invariant \beta is the least maximal length of any sweepout of the 2-sphere apparent horizon by circles. An analogous conjecture in five spacetime dimensions was recently formulated, asserting that the Birkhoff invariant \beta for S^1\times S^1 sweepouts of the apparent horizon should satisfy \beta \le (16/3)\pi M. Although this hoop inequality was formulated for conventional five-dimensional black holes with 3-sphere horizons, we show here that it is also obeyed by a wide variety of black rings, where the horizon instead has S^2\times S^1 topology.
