Title: Gauge field localization on the Bloch Brane

Abstract: We present new results on the localization of gauge fields in thick brane models. The four-dimensional observable universe is considered to be a topological defect which is generated by two scalar fields coupled with gravity embedded in a five-dimensional space-time. Like other thick brane models, the Bloch brane setup is not capable of supporting gauge field localization. In order to circumvent this problem we include the dilaton field and, as a result, obtain normalizable solutions. In addition, by writing the equations of motion as Schroedinger-like equations, we have found new kinds of resonances in the massive spectrum which appear also for heavy modes. This is in sharp contrast to what is commonly found in previous analog studies, where only light modes become resonant. At specific energies, the wave solutions exhibit very high amplitudes within the membrane. The influence of the dilaton coupling and of the internal structure on the resonant modes are also discussed.
