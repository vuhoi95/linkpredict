Title: Ungauging black holes and hidden supercharges
Authors: Kiril Hristov and Stefanos Katmadas and Valentina Pozzoli
Abstract: We embed the general solution for non-BPS extremal asymptotically flat static and under-rotating black holes in abelian gauged D=4 N=2 supergravity, in the limit where the scalar potential vanishes but the gauging does not. Using this result, we show explicitly that some supersymmetries are preserved in the near horizon region of all the asymptotically flat solutions above, in the gauged theory. This reveals a deep relation between microscopic entropy counting of extremal black holes in Minkowski and BPS black holes in AdS. Finally, we discuss the relevance of this construction to the structure of asymptotically AdS4 black holes, as well as the possibility of including hypermultiplets.
