Title: Reliability of the Optimized Perturbation Theory for scalar fields at  finite temperature
Authors: R. L. S. Farias and D. L. Teixeira Jr and R. O. Ramos
Abstract: The thermodynamics of a massless scalar field with a quartic interaction is studied up to third order in the Optimized Perturbation Theory (OPT) method. A comparison with other nonperturbative approaches is performed such that the reliability of OPT is accessed.
