Title: Canonical bifurcation in higher derivative, higher spin, theories
Authors: S. Deser and S. Ertl and D. Grumiller
Abstract: We present a non-perturbative canonical analysis of the D=3 quadratic-curvature, yet ghost-free, model to exemplify a novel, "constraint bifurcation", effect. Consequences include a jump in excitation count: a linearized level gauge variable is promoted to a dynamical one in the full theory. We illustrate these results with their concrete perturbative counterparts. They are of course mutually consistent, as are perturbative findings in related models. A geometrical interpretation in terms of propagating torsion reveals the model's relation to an (improved) version of Einstein-Weyl gravity at the linearized level. Finally, we list some necessary conditions for triggering the bifurcation phenomenon in general interacting gauge systems.
