Title: Complex Factorisation and Recursion for One-Loop Amplitudes
Authors: Sam D. Alston and David C. Dunbar and Warren B. Perkins
Abstract: We consider the factorisation of one-loop amplitudes at complex kinematic points. By determining the terms that are absent for real kinematics, we can construct a recursive ansatz for the purely rational pieces of one-loop amplitudes in massless theories. We illustrate this method by verifying the Bern et.al. n-point ansatze for the single-minus one-loop amplitudes in Yang-Mills theory and by constructing the scalar contribution to the one-loop five graviton MHV scattering amplitude.
