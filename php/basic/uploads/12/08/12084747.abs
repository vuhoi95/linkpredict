Title: Highly interactive kink solutions
Authors: A. R. Gomes and R. Menezes and J. C. R. E. Oliveira
Abstract: In this work we present a new class of real scalar field models admitting strongly interactive kink solutions. Instead of the usual exponential asymptotic behavior these topological solutions exhibit a power-law one. We investigate the interaction force between a pair of kink/anti-kink solutions both analytically and numerically, by integrating the time dependent field equations of the model. Furthermore, working within the first-order framework, we analyze the linear stability of these solutions. The stability analysis leads to Sch\"odinger-like equations with potentials which, despite admitting no bound states, lead to strong resonance peaks. We argue that these properties are important for some possible physical applications.
