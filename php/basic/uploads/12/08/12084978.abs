Title: Towards the Ground State of the Supermembrane
Authors: Yoji Michishita and Maciej Trzetrzelewski
Abstract: The explicit, near the origin, form of the ground state of the SU(2) supermembrane matrix model is studied. We evaluate the 2nd order terms of the Taylor expansion of the wave-function, which together with the 0th and the 1st order terms can be used to determine other terms by recurrence equations coming from the Schroedinger equation.
