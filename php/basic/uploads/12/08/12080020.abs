Title: Duality Invariant M-theory: Gauged supergravities and Scherk-Schwarz  reductions
Authors: David S. Berman and Edvard T. Musaev and Daniel C. Thompson
Abstract: We consider the reduction of the duality invariant approach to M-theory by a U-duality group valued Scherk-Schwarz twist. The result is to produce potentials for gauged supergravities that are normally associated with non-geometric compactifications. The local symmetry reduces to gauge transformations with the gaugings exactly matching those of the embedding tensor approach to gauged supergravity. Importantly, this approach now includes a nontrivial dependence of the fields on the extra coordinates of the extended space.
