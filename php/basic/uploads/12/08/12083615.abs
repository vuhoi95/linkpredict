Title: Exploring Holographic General Gauge Mediation
Authors: Riccardo Argurio and Matteo Bertolini and Lorenzo Di Pietro and Flavio Porri and Diego Redigolo
Abstract: We study models of gauge mediation with strongly coupled hidden sectors, employing a hard wall background as an holographic dual description. The structure of the soft spectrum depends crucially on the boundary conditions one imposes on bulk fields at the IR wall. Generically, vector and fermion correlators have poles at zero momentum, leading to gauge mediation by massive vector messengers and/or generating Dirac gaugino masses. Instead, non-generic choices of boundary conditions let one cover all of GGM parameter space. Enriching the background with R-symmetry breaking scalars, the SSM soft term structure becomes more constrained and similar to previously studied top-down models, while retaining the more analytic control the present bottom-up approach offers.
