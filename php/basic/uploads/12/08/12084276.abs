Title: Gravitino cosmology in supersymmetric warm inflation
Authors: Sam Bartrum and Arjun Berera and Joao G. Rosa
Abstract: In supersymmetric models of warm inflation, the large temperature of the radiation bath produced by the dissipative motion of the inflaton field may induce a significant thermal abundance of potentially dangerous gravitinos. While previous discussions of this problem focused on gravitino production only at the end of warm inflation, similarly to conventional reheating scenarios, we study the full evolution of the gravitino abundance during and after inflation for simple monomial potentials, taking into account the enhanced gravitino and possibly gaugino masses due to supersymmetry breaking during inflation and the smooth transition into a radiation-dominated era. We find, on one hand, that the continuous thermal production increases the gravitino yield, although, on the other hand, `freeze-out' occurs at temperatures much lower than previously estimated. Moreover, for sufficiently strong dissipation, which allows for sub-planckian inflaton values, the lower radiation temperature significantly alleviates and possibly solves the gravitino problem, with a baryon asymmetry being nevertheless produced through dissipative effects. Our analysis may also be relevant to standard reheating as an oscillating inflaton will also change the gravitino mass, potentially modifying the produced gravitino yield.
