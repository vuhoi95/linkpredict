Title: Lorentz invariance in heavy particle effective theories
Authors: Johannes Heinonen and Richard J. Hill and Mikhail P. Solon
Abstract: Employing induced representations of the Lorentz group (Wigner's little group construction), formalism for constructing heavy particle effective Lagrangians is developed, and Lagrangian constraints enforcing Lorentz invariance of the S matrix are derived. The relationship between Lorentz invariance and reparameterization invariance is established and it is shown why a standard ansatz for implementing reparameterization invariance in heavy fermion effective Lagrangians breaks down at order 1/M^4. Formalism for fields of arbitrary spin and for self-conjugate fields is presented, and the extension to effective theories of massless fields is discussed.
