Title: Runaway, D term and R-symmetry Breaking
Authors: Tatsuo Azeyanagi and Tatsuo Kobayashi and Atsushi Ogasahara and Koichi Yoshioka
Abstract: We study the D-term effect on runaway directions of the F-term scalar potential. A minimal renormalizable model is presented where supersymmetry is broken without any pseudomoduli. The model is applied to the hidden sector of gauge mediation for spontaneously breaking R symmetry and generating nonvanishing gaugino masses at the one-loop order.
