Title: M5-branes in ABJM theory and Nahm equation
Authors: Tomoki Nosaka and Seiji Terashima
Abstract: We construct BPS solutions representing M2-M5 bound state in the ABJM action explicitly. They include the funnel type solutions and 't Hooft Polyakov monopole solutions. Furthermore, we give a one to one correspondence between the solutions of the BPS equation and the ones of an extended Nahm equation which includes the Nahm equation. This enables us to construct infinitely many conserved quantities from the Lax form of the Nahm equation.
