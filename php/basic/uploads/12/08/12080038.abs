Title: On the Hamiltonian form of 3D massive gravity
Authors: Olaf Hohm and Alasdair Routh and Paul K. Townsend and Baocheng Zhang
Abstract: We present a "Chern-Simons-like" action for the "general massive gravity" model propagating two spin-2 modes with independent masses in three spacetime dimensions (3D), and we use it to find a simple Hamiltonian form of this model. The number of local degrees of freedom, determined by the dimension of the physical phase space, agrees with a linearized analysis except in some limits, in particular that yielding "new topologically massive gravity", which therefore suffers from a linearization instability.
