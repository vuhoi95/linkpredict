Title: On Holography with Hyperscaling Violation
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha and Hossein Yavartanoo
Abstract: We study certain features of strongly coupled theories with hyperscaling violation by making use of their gravitational duals. We will consider models with an anisotropic scaling in time or in one of spatial directions. In particular for the case where the anisotropic scaling is along a spatial direction we will compute the holographic entanglement entropy and show that for specific values of the parameters it exhibits a logarithmic violation of the area law. We will also probe the backgrounds by different closed and open strings which in turn can be used to read, for example, effective potential of an external object, drag force and etc.
