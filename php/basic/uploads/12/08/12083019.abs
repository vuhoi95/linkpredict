Title: Self-accelerating solutions in massive gravity on an isotropic reference  metric
Authors: Hayato Motohashi and Teruaki Suyama
Abstract: Within the framework of the recently proposed ghost-free massive gravity, a cosmological constant-type self-accelerating solution has been obtained for Minkowski and de Sitter reference metrics. We ease the assumption on the reference metric and find the self-accelerating solution for the reference metric respecting only isotropy, thus considerably extending the range of known solutions.
