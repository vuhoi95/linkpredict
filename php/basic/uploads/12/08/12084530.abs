Title: Logarithmic modes of critical gravity in de Sitter space-time
Authors: M. R. Setare and H. Karimi
Abstract: In this paper we consider the critical gravity in four dimensional de Sitter space-time. We obtain logarithmic modes in the critical point of the theory. Then we show that these logarithmic modes in de Sitter space-time obey similar properties as the ones in AdS-space-time. Our result in this paper indicate that critical gravity theories in de Sitter space-times could lead to a de Sitter/log CFT correspondence.
