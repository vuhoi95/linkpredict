Title: Inflation from Strongly Coupled Gauge Dynamics
Authors: Nick Evans and James French and Keun-Young Kim
Abstract: We argue, using a phenomenological holographic approach, that walking, strongly coupled gauge theories generate a suitable potential for a small field inflation model. We show that the effective description is a model of a single inflaton. We determine the tunings necessary in the gauge sector to generate inflation and overcome the \eta problem.
