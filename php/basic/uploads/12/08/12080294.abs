Title: Constructive proof of the Kerr-Newman black hole uniqueness: derivation  of the full solution from scratch
Authors: Reinhard Meinel and Ren√© Richter
Abstract: The Kerr-Newman black hole solution can be constructed straightforwardly as the unique solution to the boundary value problem of the Einstein-Maxwell equations corresponding to an asymptotically flat, stationary and axisymmetric electro-vacuum spacetime surrounding a connected Killing horizon.
