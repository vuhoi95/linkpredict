Title: Biaxially symmetric solutions to 4D higher-spin gravity
Authors: Carlo Iazeolla and Per Sundell
Abstract: We review some aspects of biaxially symmetric solutions to Vasiliev's equations in four dimensional spacetime with negative cosmological constant. The solutions, which activate bosonic fields of all spins, are constructed using gauge functions, projectors and deformed oscillators. The deformation parameters, which are formally gauge invariant, are related to generalized electric and magnetic charges in asymptotic weak-field regions. Alternatively, the solutions can be characterized in a dual fashion using zero-form charges which are higher-spin Casimir invariants built from combinations of curvatures and all their derivatives that are constant on shell and well-defined everywhere.
