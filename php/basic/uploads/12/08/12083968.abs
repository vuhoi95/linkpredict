Title: Stationary Closed Strings in Five-dimensional Flat Spacetime
Authors: Takahisa Igata and Hideki Ishihara and Keisuke Nishiwaki
Abstract: We investigate stationary rotating closed Nambu-Goto strings in five-dimensional flat spacetime. The stationary string is defined as a worldsheet that is tangent to a timelike Killing vector. Nambu-Goto equation of motion for the stationary string is reduces to the geodesic equation on the orbit space of the isometry group action generated by the Killing vector. We take a linear combination of a time-translation vector and space-rotation vectors as the Killing vector, and explicitly construct general solutions of stationary rotating closed strings in five-dimensional flat spacetime. We show a variety of their configurations and properties.
