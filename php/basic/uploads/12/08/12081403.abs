Title: Dynamical realization of l-conformal Galilei algebra and oscillators
Authors: Anton Galajinsky and Ivan Masterov
Abstract: The method of nonlinear realizations is applied to the l-conformal Galilei algebra to construct a dynamical system without higher derivative terms in the equations of motion. A configuration space of the model involves coordinates, which parametrize particles in d spatial dimensions, and a conformal mode, which gives rise to an effective external field. It is shown that trajectories of the system can be mapped into those of a set of decoupled oscillators in d dimensions.
