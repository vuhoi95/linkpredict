Abstract: We study the theoretical features in relation to dynamical mass generation and symmetry breaking for the recently proposed holomorphic supersymmetric Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. The basic model has two different chiral superfields (multiplets) with a strongly coupled dimension five four-superfield interaction. In addition to the possibility of generation of Dirac mass between the pair established earlier, we show here the new option of generation of Majorana masses for each chiral superfield. We also give a first look at what condition may prefer Dirac over Majorana mass, illustrating that a split in the soft supersymmetry breaking masses is crucial. In particular, in the limit where one of the soft masses vanish, we show that generation of the Majorana mass is no longer an option, while the Dirac mass generation survives well. The latter is sensitive mostly to the average of the two soft masses. The result has positive implication on the application of the model framework towards dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking with Higgs superfields as composites.
