Title: Integrable Superstrings on the Squashed Three-sphere
Authors: Domenico Orlando and Linda I. Uruchurtu
Abstract: In this note we study type II superstring theory on the direct product of AdS3, the squashed three-sphere and a four-torus (AdS3 \times SqS3 \times T4). We derive explicitly the Green-Schwarz action and discuss in detail the hidden integrable structure corresponding to local and non-local currents. We find that the model is classically integrable and that the currents generate a full psu(1, 1|2) superalgebra, even though the corresponding spacetime isometries are broken by the squashing.
