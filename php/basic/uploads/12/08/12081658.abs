Title: Flat-Space Chiral Gravity
Authors: Arjun Bagchi and Stephane Detournay and Daniel Grumiller
Abstract: We provide the first evidence for a holographic correspondence between a gravitational theory in flat space and a specific unitary field theory in one dimension lower. The gravitational theory is a flat-space limit of topologically massive gravity in three dimensions at Chern-Simons level k=1. The field theory is a chiral two-dimensional conformal field theory with central charge c=24.
