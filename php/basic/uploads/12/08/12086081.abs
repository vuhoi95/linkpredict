Title: FQHE interferometers in strong tunneling regime. The role of compactness  of edge fields
Authors: Sriram Ganeshan and Alexander G. Abanov and Dmitri V. Averin
Abstract: We consider multiple-point tunneling in the interferometers formed between edges of electron liquids with in general different filling factors in the regime of the Fractional Quantum Hall effect (FQHE). We derive an effective matrix Caldeira-Leggett models for the multiple tunneling contacts connected by the chiral single-mode FQHE edges. It is shown that the compactness of the Wen- Fr\"ohlich chiral boson fields describing the FQHE edge modes plays a crucial role in eliminating the spurious non-locality of the electron transport properties of the FQHE interferometers arising in the regime of strong tunneling.
