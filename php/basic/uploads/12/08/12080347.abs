Title: Jordan Pairs, E6 and U-Duality in Five Dimensions
Authors: Sergio Ferrara and Alessio Marrani and Bruno Zumino
Abstract: By exploiting the Jordan pair structure of U-duality Lie algebras in D = 3 and the relation to the super-Ehlers symmetry in D = 5, we elucidate the massless multiplet structure of the spectrum of a broad class of D = 5 supergravity theories. Both simple and semi-simple, Euclidean rank-3 Jordan algebras are considered. Theories sharing the same bosonic sector but with different supersymmetrizations are also analyzed.
