Title: Perturbative algebraic quantum field theory
Authors: Klaus Fredenhagen and Katarzyna Rejzner
Abstract: These notes are based on the course given by Klaus Fredenhagen at the Les Houches Winter School in Mathematical Physics (January 29 - February 3, 2012) and the course "QFT for mathematicians" given by Katarzyna Rejzner in Hamburg for the Research Training Group 1670 (February 6 -11, 2012). Both courses were meant as an introduction to modern approach to perturbative quantum field theory and are aimed both at mathematicians and physicists.
