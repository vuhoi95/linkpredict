Title: On Holographic Entanglement Entropy of Charged Matter
Authors: Manuela Kulaxizi and Andrei Parnachev and Koenraad Schalm
Abstract: We study holographic entanglement entropy in the background of charged dilatonic black holes which can be viewed as holographic duals of certain finite density states of N=4 super Yang-Mills. These charged black holes are distinguished in that they have vanishing ground state entropy. The entanglement entropy for a slab experiences a second order phase transition as the thickness of the slab is varied, while the entanglement entropy for a sphere is a smooth function of the radius. This suggests that the second scale introduced by the anisotropy of the slab plays an important role in driving the phase transition. In both cases we do not observe any logarithmic violation of the area law indicative of hidden Fermi surfaces. We investigate how these results are affected by the inclusion of the Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulk gravitational action. We also observe that such addition to the bulk action does not change the logarithmic violation of the area law in the backgrounds with hyperscaling violation.
