Title: Charged Black Holes in String Theory with Gauss-Bonnet Correction in  Various Dimensions
Authors: Nobuyoshi Ohta and Takashi Torii
Abstract: We study charged black hole solutions in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory with the dilaton field which is the low-energy effective theory of the heterotic string. The spacetime is D-dimensional and assumed to be static and spherically symmetric with the $(D-2)$-dimensional constant curvature space and asymptotically flat. The system of the basic equations is complex and the solutions are obtained numerically. We identify the allowed parameter region where the black hole solutions exist, and show configurations of the field functions in D=4 -- 6 and 10. We also show the relations of the physical quantities of the black holes such as the horizon radius, the mass, the temperature, and so on, and find several results. The forms of the allowed parameter regions are different depending on the dimension. There is no extreme black hole solution with T=0 that can be obtained by taking the limit of the non-extreme solutions within the parameter range we chose. Entropy of the black holes in the dilatonic theory is always larger than that in the non-dilatonic theory. Our analysis includes the higher order term of the dilaton field which is not in our previous works. Its effect remarkably appears in five dimensions and is given in the appendix. By our analysis it is found that the properties of the black hole solutions strongly depend on the dimension, charge, existence of the dilaton field. Hence both the detailed analyses of the individual systems and the investigations from the systematic point of view are important.
