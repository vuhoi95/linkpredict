Title: On finite size corrections to the dispersion relations of giant magnon  and single spike on Î³-deformed T^{1,1}
Authors: Michal Michalcik and Radoslav C. Rashkov
Abstract: In this paper we consider the finite size effects for the strings in \beta -deformed AdS_{5}\times T^{1,1} background. We analyze the finite size corrections for the cases of giant magnon and single spike string solution. The finite size corrections for the undeformed case are straightforwardly obtained sending the deformation parameter to zero.
