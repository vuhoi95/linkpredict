Abstract: An extended version of the AdS/QCD Soft-Wall model that incorporates QCD-like anomalous contributions to the dimensions of gauge theory operators is proposed. This exploratory approach leads to a relation between scalar glueball masses and beta functions. Using this relation, properties of the glueball mass spectroscopy that emerge from phenomenological beta functions proposed in the literature are investigated. The reverse problem is also considered: starting from a linear Regge trajectory which fits the lattice glueball masses, beta functions with different asymptotic infrared behaviours are found. Remarkably, some of them present a fixed point at finite coupling.
