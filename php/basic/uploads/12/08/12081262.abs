Title: All homogeneous N=2 M-theory truncations with supersymmetric AdS4 vacua
Authors: Davide Cassani and Paul Koerber and Oscar Varela
Abstract: We study consistent truncations of M-theory to gauged N=2 supergravity in four dimensions, based on a large class of SU(3)-structures in seven dimensions. We show that the gauging involves isometries of the vector multiplet scalar manifold as well as the Heisenberg algebra and a special isometry of the hyperscalar manifold. As a result, non-abelian gauge groups and new non-trivial scalar potentials are generated. Then we specialize to all homogeneous SU(3)-structures supporting supersymmetric AdS4 vacua. These are the Stiefel manifold V52, the Aloff-Wallach spaces N(k,l), the seven-sphere (seen as SU(4)/SU(3) or Sp(2)/Sp(1)) and the M110 and Q111 coset spaces. For each of these cases, we describe in detail the N=2 model and discuss its peculiarities.
