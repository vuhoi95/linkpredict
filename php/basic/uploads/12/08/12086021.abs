Title: Renormalized transport properties of randomly gapped 2D Dirac fermions
Authors: Andreas Sinner and Klaus Ziegler
Abstract: We investigate the scaling properties of the recently acquired fermionic non--linear $\sigma$--model which controls gapless diffusive modes in a two--dimensional disordered system of Dirac electrons beyond charge neutrality. The transport on large scales is governed by a novel renormalizable nonlocal field theory. For zero mean random gap, it is characterized by the absence of a dynamic gap generation and a scale invariant diffusion coefficient. The $\beta$ function of the DC conductivity, computed for this model, is in perfect agreement with numerical results obtained previously.
