Title: Are quantization rules for horizon areas universal?
Authors: Valerio Faraoni and Andres F. Zambrano Moreno
Abstract: Doubts have been expressed on the universality of holographic/string-inspired quantization rules for the horizon areas of stationary black holes or the products of their radii, already in simple 4-dimensional general relativity. Realistic black holes are not stationary but time-dependent. Using two examples of 4D general-relativistic spacetimes containing dynamical black holes for at least part of the time, it is shown that the quantization rules (even counting virtual horizons) cannot hold, except possibly at isolated instants of time, and do not seem to be universal.
