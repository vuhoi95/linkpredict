Title: Accretion of non-minimally coupled generalized Chaplygin gas into black  holes
Authors: Manuela G. Rodrigues and Alex E. Bernardini
Abstract: The mass evolution of Schwarzschild black holes by the absorption of scalar fields is investigated in the scenario of the generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG). The GCG works as a unification picture of dark matter plus dark energy that naturally accelerates the expansion of the Universe. Through elements of the quasi-stationary approach, we consider the mass evolution of Schwarzschild black holes accreted by non-minimally coupled cosmological scalar fields reproducing the dynamics of the GCG. As a scalar field non-minimally coupled to the metrics, such an exotic content has been interconnected with accreting black holes. The black hole increasing masses by the absorption of the gas reflects some consistence of the accretion mechanism with the hypothesis of the primordial origin of supermassive black holes. Our results effectively show that the non-minimal coupling with the GCG dark sector accelerates the increasing of black hole masses. Meanwhile some exotic features can also be depicted for specific ranges of the non-minimal coupling in which the GCG dynamics is substantially modified.
