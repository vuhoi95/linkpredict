Title: M-theory and Type IIA Flux Compactifications
Authors: Jock McOrist and Savdeep Sethi
Abstract: We consider compactifications of M-theory and type IIA string theory to four dimensions. For Minkowski space-time, a supergravity no-go theorem forbids flux supported in the internal space. We show how to evade this no-go theorem by exhibiting new sources of brane charge: in string theory, the basic physical phenomenon is the generation of new brane charges from D-branes in transverse fluxes. In M-theory, there is a new source of M5-brane charge from novel higher derivative couplings that involve fluxes as well as curvatures. We present some explicit orientifold examples with both N=1 and N=2 space-time supersymmetry. Finally, we explain the status of massive type IIA flux compactifications.
