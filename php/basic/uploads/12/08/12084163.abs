Title: Fab 5: Noncanonical Kinetic Gravity, Self Tuning, and Cosmic  Acceleration
Authors: Stephen A. Appleby and Antonio De Felice and Eric V. Linder
Abstract: We investigate circumstances under which one can generalize Horndeski's most general scalar-tensor theory of gravity. Specifically we demonstrate that a nonlinear combination of purely kinetic gravity terms can give rise to an accelerating universe without the addition of extra propagating degrees of freedom on cosmological backgrounds, and exhibit self tuning to bring a large cosmological constant under control. This nonlinear approach leads to new properties that may be instructive for exploring the behaviors of gravity.
