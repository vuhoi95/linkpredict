Abstract: We investigate the existence of non axisymmetric solutions in the 6-dimensional baby-Skyrme brane model. The brane is described by a localized solution to the baby-Skyrme model extending in the extra dimensions. Such non symmetric branes have already been constructed in the original 2+1-dimensional baby-Skyrme model in flat space. We generalize this result to the case of gravitating baby-Skyrme and in the context of extradimensions. These non-trivial deformation from the axisymmetric shape appear for higher values of the topological charge, so we consider the cases of $B=3,4$, where $B$ is the topological charge. We solve the coupled system of the Einstein and baby-Skyrme equations by successive over relaxation method. We argue that the result may be a possible resolution for the fermion mass hierarchy puzzle.
