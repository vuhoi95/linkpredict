Title: Twistorial eigenvalue estimates for generalized Dirac operators with  torsion
Authors: Ilka Agricola and Julia Becker-Bender and Hwajeong Kim
Abstract: We study the Dirac spectrum on compact Riemannian spin manifolds $M$ equipped with a metric connection $\nabla$ with skew torsion $T\in\Lambda^3M$ by means of twistor theory. An optimal lower bound for the first eigenvalue of the Dirac operator with torsion is found that generalizes Friedrich's classical Riemannian estimate. We also determine a novel twistor and Killing equation with torsion and use it to discuss the case in which the minimum is attained in the bound.
