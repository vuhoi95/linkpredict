Title: Jumping Out of the Light-Higgs Conformal Window
Authors: Oleg Antipin and Matin Mojaza and Francesco Sannino
Abstract: We investigate generic properties of the conformal phase transition in gauge theories featuring Higgs-like fundamental particles. These theories provide an excellent arena to properly investigate conformal dynamics and discover novel features. We show that the phase transition at the boundary of the Higgs conformal window is not smooth but a jumping one for the known perturbative examples. In addition the general conditions under which the transition is either jumping or smooth are provided. Jumping implies that the massive spectrum of the theory will jump at the phase transition. It, however, still allows for one of the states, the would be dilaton of the theory, to be lighter than the heaviest states in the broken phase. Finally we exhibit a calculable Higgs model in which we can, in perturbation theory, determine the Higgs conformal window, the spectrum in the conformally broken phase and demonstrate it to possess a jumping type conformal phase transition.
