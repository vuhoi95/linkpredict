Title: Novel symmetries in N = 2 supersymmetric quantum mechanical models
Authors: R. P. Malik and Avinash Khare
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a novel set of discrete symmetries in the context of N = 2 supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanical model with a potential function f(x) that is a generalization of the potential of the 1D SUSY harmonic oscillator. We perform the same exercise for the motion of a charged particle in the X-Y plane under the influence of a magnetic field in the Z-direction. We derive the underlying algebra of the existing continuous symmetry transformations (and corresponding conserved charges) and establish its relevance to the algebraic structures of the de Rham cohomological operators of differential geometry. We show that the discrete symmetry transformations of our present general theories correspond to the Hodge duality operation. Ultimately, we conjecture that any arbitrary N = 2 SUSY quantum mechanical system can be shown to be a tractable model for the Hodge theory.
