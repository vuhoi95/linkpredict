Title: Adinkras and SUSY Holography
Authors: S. James Gates Jr and T. Hubsch and Kory Stiffler
Abstract: We discuss the mechanism by which adinkras holographically store the required information for the Spin(1,3) Clifford Algebra fiber bundle in the cases of three 4D, N=1 representations: the chiral, vector and tensor supermultiplets.
