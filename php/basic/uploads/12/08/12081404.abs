Title: S^3/Z_n partition function and dualities
Authors: Yosuke Imamura and Daisuke Yokoyama
Abstract: We investigate S^3/Z_n partition function of N = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories. A gauge theory on the orbifold has degenerate vacua specified by the holonomy. The partition function is obtained by summing up the contributions of saddle points with different holonomies. An appropriate choice of the phase of each contribution is essential to obtain the partition function. We determine the relative phases in the holonomy sum in a few examples by using duality to non-gauge theories. In the case of odd n the phase factors can be absorbed by modifying a single function appearing in the partition function.
