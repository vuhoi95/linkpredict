Title: Spontaneous electromagnetic superconductivity of vacuum induced by a  strong magnetic field: QCD and electroweak theory
Authors: M. N. Chernodub and J. Van Doorsselaere and H. Verschelde
Abstract: Both in electroweak theory and QCD, the vacuum in strong magnetic fields develops charged vector condensates once a critical value of the magnetic field is reached. Both ground states have a similar Abrikosov lattice structure and superconducting properties. It is the purpose of these proceedings to put the condensates and their superconducting properties side by side and obtain a global view on this type of condensates. Some peculiar aspects of the superfluidity and backreaction of the condensates are also discussed.
