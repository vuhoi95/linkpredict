Authors: G. Alencar and I. Guedes and R. R. Landim and R. N. Costa Filho
Abstract: In this work we investigate the quantum theory of the Kalb-Ramond fields propagating in $D-$dimensional de Sitter spacetimes using the dynamic invariant method developed by Lewis and Riesenfeld [J. Math. Phys. 10, 1458 (1969)] to obtain the solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The wave function is written in terms of a $c-$number quantity satisfying of the Milne-Pinney equation, whose solution can be expressed in terms of two independent solutions of the respective equation of motion. We obtain the exact solution for the quantum Kalb-Ramond field in the de Sitter background and discuss its relation with the Cremmer-Scherk-Kalb-Ramond model.
