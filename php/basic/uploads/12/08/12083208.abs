Title: Building an explicit de Sitter
Authors: Jan Louis and Markus Rummel and Roberto Valandro and Alexander Westphal
Abstract: We construct an explicit example of a de Sitter vacuum in type IIB string theory that realizes the proposal of K\"ahler uplifting. As the large volume limit in this method depends on the rank of the largest condensing gauge group we carry out a scan of gauge group ranks over the Kreuzer-Skarke set of toric Calabi-Yau threefolds. We find large numbers of models with the largest gauge group factor easily exceeding a rank of one hundred. We construct a global model with K\"ahler uplifting on a two-parameter model on $\mathbb{CP}^4_{11169}$, by an explicit analysis from both the type IIB and F-theory point of view. The explicitness of the construction lies in the realization of a D7 brane configuration, gauge flux and RR and NS flux choices, such that all known consistency conditions are met and the geometric moduli are stabilized in a metastable de Sitter vacuum with spontaneous GUT scale supersymmetry breaking driven by an F-term of the K\"ahler moduli.
