Title: The all-order equation of the effective gluon mass
Authors: D. Binosi and D. Iba√±ez and J. Papavassiliou
Abstract: We present the general derivation of the full non-perturbative equation that governs the momentum evolution of the dynamically generated gluon mass, in the Landau gauge. The entire construction hinges crucially on the inclusion of longitudinally coupled vertices containing massless poles of non-perturbative origin, which preserve the form of the fundamental Slavnov-Taylor identities of the theory. The mass equation is obtained from a previously unexplored version of the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the gluon propagator, particular to the PT-BFM formalism, which involves a reduced number of "two-loop dressed" diagrams, thus simplifying the calculational task considerably. The two-loop contributions turn out to be of paramount importance, modifying the qualitative features of the full mass equation, and enabling the emergence of physically meaningful solutions. Specifically, the resulting homogeneous integral equation is solved numerically, subject to certain approximations, for the entire range of physical momenta, yielding positive-definite and monotonically decreasing gluon masses.
