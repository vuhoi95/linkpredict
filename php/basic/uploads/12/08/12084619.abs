Title: Magnetic black universes and wormholes with a phantom scalar
Authors: S. V. Bolokhov and K. A. Bronnikov and M. V. Skvortsova
Abstract: We construct explicit examples of globally regular static, spherically symmetric solutions in general relativity with scalar and electromagnetic fields which describe traversable wormholes (with flat and AdS asymptotics) and regular black holes, in particular, black universes. A black universe is a nonsingular black hole where, beyond the horizon, instead of a singularity, there is an expanding, asymptotically isotropic universe. The scalar field in these solutions is phantom (i.e., its kinetic energy is negative), minimally coupled to gravity and has a nonzero self-interaction potential. The configurations obtained are quite diverse and contain different numbers of Killing horizons, from zero to four. This substantially widens the list of known structures of regular black hole configurations. Such models can be of interest both as descriptions of local objects (black holes and wormholes) and as a basis for building nonsingular cosmological scenarios.
