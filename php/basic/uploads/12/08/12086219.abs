Abstract: Massless matter fields and non-Abelian gauge fields are localized on domain walls in a (4+1)-dimensional $U(N)_c$ gauge theory with $SU(N)_{L}\times SU(N)_{R}\times U(1)_{A}$ flavor symmetry. We also introduce $SU(N)_{L+R}$ flavor gauge fields and a scalar-field-dependent gauge coupling, which provides massless non-Abelian gauge fields localized on the wall. We find a chiral Lagrangian interacting minimally with the non-Abelian gauge field together with nonlinear interactions of moduli fields as the (3+1)-dimensional effective field theory up to the second order of derivatives. Our result provides a step towards a realistic model building of brane-world scenario using topological solitons.
