Title: Biorthogonal Quantum Mechanics: Super-Quantum Correlations and  Expectation Values without Definite Probabilities
Authors: Lay Nam Chang and Zachary Lewis and Djordje Minic and Tatsu Takeuchi
Abstract: We propose mutant versions of quantum mechanics constructed on vector spaces over the finite Galois fields GF(3) and GF(9). The mutation we consider here is distinct from what we proposed in previous papers on Galois field quantum mechanics. In this new mutation, the canonical expression for expectation values is retained instead of that for probabilities. In fact, probabilities are indeterminate. Furthermore, it is shown that the mutant quantum mechanics over the finite field GF(9) exhibits super-quantum correlations (i.e. the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt bound is 4). We comment on the fundamental physical importance of these results in the context of quantum gravity.
