Title: On Partially Massless Bimetric Gravity
Authors: S. F. Hassan and Angnis Schmidt-May and Mikael von Strauss
Abstract: We extend the notion of the Higuchi bound and partial masslessness to ghost-free nonlinear bimetric theories. This can be achieved in a simple way by first considering linear massive spin-2 perturbations around maximally symmetric background solutions, for which the linear gauge symmetry at the Higuchi bound is easily identified. Then, requiring consistency between an appropriate subset of these transformations and the dynamical nature of the backgrounds, fixes all but one parameter in the bimetric interaction potential. This specifies the theory up to the value of the Fierz-Pauli mass and leads to the unique candidate for nonlinear partially massless bimetric theory.
