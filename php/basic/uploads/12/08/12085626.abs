Title: Homotopy Classification of Bosonic String Field Theory
Authors: Korbinian Muenster and Ivo Sachs
Abstract: We prove the decomposition theorem for the loop homotopy algebra of quantum closed string field theory and use it to show that closed string field theory is unique up to gauge transformations on a given string background and given S-matrix. For the theory of open and closed strings we use results in open-closed homotopy algebra to show that the space of inequivalent open string field theories is isomorphic to the space of classical closed string backgrounds. As a further application of the open-closed homotopy algebra we show that string field theory is background independent and locally unique in a very precise sense. Finally we discuss topological string theory in the framework of homotopy algebras and find a generalized correspondence between closed strings and open string field theories.
