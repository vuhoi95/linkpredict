Title: Landau meets Newton: time translation symmetry breaking in classical  mechanics
Authors: Liu Zhao and Wei Xu and Pengfei Yu
Abstract: Every classical Newtonian mechanical system can be equipped with a nonstandard Hamiltonian structure, in which the Hamiltonian is the square of the canonical Hamiltonian up to a constant shift, and the Poisson bracket is nonlinear. In such a formalism, time translation symmetry can be spontaneously broken, provided the potential function becomes negative. A nice analogy between time translation symmetry breaking and the Landau theory of second order phase transitions is established, together with several example cases illustrating time translation breaking ground states. In particular, the $\Lambda$CDM model of FRW cosmology is reformulated as the time translation symmetry breaking ground states.
