Title: Properties of a Discrete Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Micheal S. Berger and Naoki Yamatsu
Abstract: A scalar quantum field theory defined on a discrete spatial coordinate is examined. The renormalization of the lattice propagator is discussed with an emphasis on the periodic nature of the associated momentum coordinate. The analytic properties of the scattering amplitudes indicate the development of a second branch point on which the branch cut from the optical theorem terminates.
