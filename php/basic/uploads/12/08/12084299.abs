Title: Simulating 2+1d Lattice QED with dynamical matter using ultracold atoms
Authors: Erez Zohar and J. Ignacio Cirac and Benni Reznik
Abstract: We suggest a method to simulate lattice compact Quantum Electrodynamics (cQED) using ultracold atoms in optical lattices, which includes dynamical Dirac fermions in 2+1 dimensions. This allows to test dynamical effects of confinement as well as 2d flux loops deformations and breaking, and to observe Wilson-loop area-law.
