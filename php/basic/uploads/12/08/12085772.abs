Title: On the Nonlinear Stability of Asymptotically Anti-de Sitter Solutions
Authors: Oscar J. C. Dias and Gary T. Horowitz and Don Marolf and Jorge E. Santos
Abstract: Despite the recent evidence that anti-de Sitter spacetime is nonlinearly unstable, we argue that many asymptotically anti-de Sitter solutions are nonlinearly stable. This includes geons, boson stars, and black holes. As part of our argument, we calculate the frequencies of long-lived gravitational quasinormal modes of AdS black holes in various dimensions. We also discuss a new class of asymptotically anti-de Sitter solutions describing noncoalescing black hole binaries.
