Title: Rotating One-Half Topological Charge Dyon
Authors: Rosy Teh and Ban-Loong Ng and Khai-Ming Wong
Abstract: Recently, we have shown the existence of a finite energy one-half monopole. In this paper, we would like to introduce electric charge into the one-half monopole configuration, thus creating a one-half dyon. This one-half dyon possesses finite energy, magnetic dipole moment and angular momentum. Hence it is able to rotate in the presence of an external magnetic field. Similar to the single pole dyons and the MAP dyons, this one-half dyon possesses critical (maximum) electric charge, total energy, and magnetic dipole moment when the Higgs self-coupling constant is nonvanishing, and the electric charge parameter approaches one. This one-half dyon solution does not satisfy the first order Bogomol'nyi equations and is a non-BPS solution in the limit of vanishing Higgs self-coupling constant.
