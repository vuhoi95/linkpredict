Abstract: We consider the nonlinear Dirac equations (NLDE's) in 1+1 dimension with scalar-scalar self interaction $\frac{g^2}{\kappa+1} ({\bPsi} \Psi)^{\kappa+1}$ in the presence of various external electromagnetic fields. Starting from the exact solutions for the unforced problem we study the behavior of solitary wave solutions to the NLDE in the presence of a wide variety of fields in a variational approximation depending on collective coordinates which allows the position, width and phase of these waves to vary in time. We find that in this approximation the position $q(t)$ of the center of the solitary wave obeys the usual behavior of a relativistic point particle in an external field. For time independent external fields we find that the energy of the solitary wave is conserved but not the momentum which becomes a function of time. We postulate that similar to the nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation (NLSE) that a sufficient dynamical condition for instability to arise is that $ dP(t)/d \dq(t) < 0$. Here $P(t)$ is the momentum of the solitary wave, and $\dq$ is the velocity of the center of the wave in the collective coordinate approximation. We found for our choices of external potentials we always have $ dP(t)/d \dq(t) > 0$ so when instabilities do occur they are due to a different source. We investigate the accuracy of our variational approximation using numerical simulations of the NLDE and find that when the forcing term is small and we are in a regime where the solitary wave is stable, that the behavior of the solutions of the collective coordinate equations agrees very well with the numerical simulations.
