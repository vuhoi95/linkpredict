Title: NSR superstring measures in genus 5
Authors: Petr Dunin-Barkowski and Alexey Sleptsov and Abel Stern
Abstract: Currently there are two proposed ansatze for NSR superstring measures: the Grushevsky ansatz and the OPSMY ansatz, which for genera g<=4 are known to coincide. However, neither the Grushevsky nor the OPSMY ansatz leads to a vanishing two point function in genus four, which can be constructed from the genus five expressions for the respective ansatze. This is inconsistent with the known properties of superstring amplitudes. In the present paper we show that the Grushevsky and OPSMY ansatze do not coincide in genus five. Then, by combining these ansatze, we propose a new ansatz for genus five, which now leads to a vanishing two-point function in genus four. We also show that one cannot construct an ansatz from the currently known forms in genus 6 that satisfies all known requirements for superstring measures.
