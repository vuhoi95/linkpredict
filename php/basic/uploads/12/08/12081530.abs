Title: Toward an understanding of short distance repulsions among baryons in  QCD -- NBS wave functions and operator product expansion --
Authors: Sinya Aoki and Janos Balog and Peter Weisz
Abstract: We report on our recent attempts to determine the short distance behaviors of general 2-baryon and 3-baryon forces, which are defined from the Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter(NBS) wave function, by using the operator product expansion and a renormalization group analysis in QCD. We have found that the repulsion at short distance increases as the number of valence quarks increases or when the number of different flavors involved decreases. This global tendency suggests a Pauli suppression principle among quark fields at work.
