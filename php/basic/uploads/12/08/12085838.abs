Title: A naked singularity stable under scalar field perturbations
Authors: Amruta Sadhu and V. Suneeta
Abstract: We prove the stability of a spacetime with a naked singularity under scalar field perturbations, where the perturbations are regular at the singularity. This spacetime, found by Janis, Newman and Winicour, and independently by Wyman, is sourced by a massless scalar field and also arises as a certain limit of a class of charged dilatonic solutions in string theory. This stability result opens up specific questions for investigation related to the cosmic censorship conjecture and the mechanism by which it is implemented in nature.
