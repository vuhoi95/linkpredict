Title: Local field theory from the expanding universe at late times in the IIB  matrix model
Authors: Jun Nishimura and Asato Tsuchiya
Abstract: Recently we have shown that (3+1)-dimensional expanding universe appears dynamically and uniquely from the Lorentzian version of the IIB matrix model, which is considered as a nonperturbative formulation of superstring theory. Similarly, it is possible that the Standard Model appears uniquely at the electroweak scale from the same model at late times. In order to pursue such a possibility, we discuss how to derive the effective local field theory for the massless modes that appear at late times in the same formulation. As a concrete example, we consider the massless modes associated with the spontaneous breaking of (9+1)-dimensional Poincare symmetry and supersymmetry.
