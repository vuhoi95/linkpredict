Title: The Quantum Deformed Mirror TBA I
Authors: Gleb Arutyunov and Marius de Leeuw and Stijn J. van Tongeren
Abstract: We derive the ground state thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations for the quantum deformation of the AdS_5 x S^5 mirror model, taking the deformation parameter to be a root of unity. By virtue of the deformation, the resulting equations show an interesting structure between a finite number of Y-functions.
