Title: Gravity localization in a string-cigar braneworld

Abstract: We proposed a six dimensional string-like braneworld built from a warped product between a 3-brane and the Hamilton cigar soliton space, the string-cigar braneworld. This transverse manifold is a well-known steady solution of the Ricci flow equation that describes the evolution of a manifold. The resulting bulk is an interior and exterior metric for a thick string. This is a physical and feasible scenario since the source satisfies the dominant energy condition. It is possible to realize the geometric flow as a result of variations of the matter content of the brane, actually, as its tensions. Furthermore, the Ricci flow defines a family of string-like branes and we studied the effects that the evolution of the transverse space has on the geometric and physical quantities. The geometric flow makes the cosmological constant and the relationship between the Planck masses evolves. The gravitational massless mode remains trapped to the brane and the width of the mode depends on the evolution parameter. For the Kaluza-Klein modes, the asymptotic spectrum of mass is the same as for the thin string-like brane and the analogue Schroedinger potential also changes according to the flow.
