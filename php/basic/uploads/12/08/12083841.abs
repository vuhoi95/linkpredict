Title: Constraints on Chronologies
Authors: Alfred Shapere and Frank Wilczek
Abstract: The time ordering of two spacelike separated events is arbitrary, when all inertial frames are taken into account, but for three or more events it is not generally so. We determine the structure of possible time orderings, or chronologies, for multiple events in any number of dimensions, analytically and exhaustively for three events in four space-time dimensions, algorithmically in other cases. We also formulate an alternative criterion, based on convexity, for determining the allowed chronologies of a set of events. We show how the metric of a Lorentz invariant spacetime can be partially reconstructed from a knowledge of the chronologies it supports. Finally, we propose a different but related criterion for allowed chronologies in curved spacetimes.
