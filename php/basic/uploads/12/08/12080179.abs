Title: DBI Galileon and Late time acceleration of the universe
Authors: Sampurnanand and Anjan A. Sen
Abstract: We consider 1+3 dimensional maximally symmetric Minkowski brane embedded in a 1+4 dimensional maximally symmetric Minkowski background. The resulting 1+3 dimensional effective field theory is of DBI (Dirac-Born-Infeld) Galileon type. We use this model to study the late time acceleration of the universe. We study the deviation of the model from the concordance \Lambda CDM behaviour. Finally we put constraints on the model parameters using various observational data.
