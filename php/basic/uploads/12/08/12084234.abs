Title: Wilson-Loop Characterization of Inversion-Symmetric Topological  Insulators
Authors: A. Alexandradinata and Xi Dai and B. Andrei Bernevig
Abstract: The ground state of translationally-invariant insulators comprise bands which can assume topologically distinct structures. There are few known examples where this distinction is enforced by a point-group symmetry alone. In this paper we show that 1D and 2D insulators with the simplest point-group symmetry - inversion - have a $Z^{\geq}$ classification. In 2D, we identify a relative winding number that is solely protected by inversion symmetry. By analysis of Berry phases, we show that this invariant has similarities with the first Chern class (of time-reversal breaking insulators), but is more closely analogous to the $Z_2$ invariant (of time-reversal invariant insulators). Implications of our work are discussed in holonomy, the geometric-phase theory of polarization, the theory of maximally-localized Wannier functions, and in the entanglement spectrum.
