Abstract: In (2+1)-dimensional hydrodynamic systems with broken parity, the shear and bulk viscosity is joined by the Hall viscosity and curl viscosity. The dual holographic model has been constructed by coupling a pseudo scalar to the gravitational Chern-Simons term in (3+1)-dimensional bulk gravity. In this paper, we investigate the non-relativistic fluid with Hall viscosity and curl viscosity living on a finite radial cutoff surface in the bulk. Employing the non-relativistic hydrodynamic expansion method, we obtain the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with Hall viscosity and curl viscosity. Unlike the shear viscosity, the ratio of the Hall viscosity over entropy density is found to be cutoff scale dependent, and it tends to zero when the cutoff surface approaches to the horizon of the background spacetime.
