Title: Evolution of cusped light-like Wilson loops and geometry of the loop  space
Authors: I. O. Cherednikov and T. Mertens and F. F. Van der Veken
Abstract: We discuss the possible relation between certain geometrical properties of the loop space and energy evolution of the cusped Wilson exponentials defined on the light-cone. Analysis of the area differential equations for this special class of the Wilson loops calls for careful treatment of the ultraviolet and rapidity divergences which make those loops non-multiplicatively-renormalizable. We propose to consider the renormalization properties of the light-cone cusped Wilson loops from the point of view of the universal quantum dynamical approach introduced by Schwinger. We conjecture and discuss the relevance of the Makeenko-Migdal loop equations supplied with the modified Schwinger principle to the energy evolution of some phenomenologically significant objects, such as transverse-momentum dependent distribution functions, collinear parton densities at large-$x$, etc.
