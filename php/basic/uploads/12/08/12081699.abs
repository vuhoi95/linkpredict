Authors: Dmitry Belyaev and Patrick Hearin and Pierre Ramond
Abstract: The SuperConformal theory in three space-time dimensions with SO(16) $R$-symmetry, 128 bosons, and 128 fermions, cannot sustain interactions. This result is obtained using both light-cone superspace techniques which rely on algebraic consistency, and covariant methods which rely on SO(16) Fierz identities which fail to produce the desired algebra.
