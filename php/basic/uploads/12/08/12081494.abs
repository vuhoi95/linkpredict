Title: Supersymmetric quantum criticality supported by baryonic charges
Authors: Aristomenis Donos and Jerome P. Gauntlett
Abstract: In the context of the $AdS_4\times Q^{111}$ solution of D=11 supergravity we construct supersymmetric zero temperature black brane solutions that interpolate between $AdS_4$ in the UV and $AdS_2\times \mathbb{R}^2$ in the IR. The dual N=2 SCFT has a $U(1)^2$ baryonic symmetry and the solutions carry electric charge with respect to one of the U(1) factors and magnetic charge with respect to the other. The solutions describe stable zero temperature ground states of the deformed SCFT which have finite entropy density. We also construct analogous supersymmetric solutions that flow to $AdS_2\times S^2$ and to $AdS_2\times H^2/\Gamma$ in the IR which, in addition, carry magnetic R-symmetry charge similar to other known wrapped brane solutions.
