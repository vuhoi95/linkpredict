Title: Functional RG flow of the effective Hamiltonian action
Authors: G. P. Vacca and L. Zambelli
Abstract: After a brief review of the definition and properties of the quantum effective Hamiltonian action we describe its renormalization flow by a functional RG equation. This equation can be used for a non-perturbative quantization and study also of theories with bare Hamiltonians which are not quadratic in the momenta. As an example the vacuum energy and gap of quantum mechanical models are computed. Extensions of this framework to quantum field theories are discussed. In particular one possible Lorentz covariant approach for simple scalar field theories is developed. Fermionic degrees of freedom, being naturally described by a first order formulation, can be easily accommodated in this approach.
