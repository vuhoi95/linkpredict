Title: The Higher Spin/Vector Model Duality
Authors: Simone Giombi and Xi Yin
Abstract: This paper is mainly a review of the dualities between Vasiliev's higher spin gauge theories in AdS4 and three dimensional large N vector models, with focus on the holographic calculation of correlation functions of higher spin currents. We also present some new results in the computation of parity odd structures in the three point functions in parity violating Vasiliev theories.
