Title: A generalized topological recursion for arbitrary ramification
Authors: Vincent Bouchard and Joel Hutchinson and Prachi Loliencar and Michael Meiers and Matthew Rupert
Abstract: The Eynard-Orantin topological recursion relies on the geometry of a Riemann surface S and two meromorphic functions x and y on S. To formulate the recursion, one must assume that x has only simple ramification points. In this paper we propose a generalized topological recursion that is valid for x with arbitrary ramification. We justify our proposal by studying degenerations of Riemann surfaces. We check in various examples that our generalized recursion is compatible with invariance of the free energies under the transformation (x,y) -> (y,x), where either x or y (or both) have higher order ramification, and that it satisfies some of the most important properties of the original recursion. Along the way, we show that invariance under (x,y) -> (y,x) is in fact more subtle than expected; we show that there exists a number of counter examples, already in the case of the original Eynard-Orantin recursion, that deserve further study.
