Title: Conductivity of Strongly Coupled Striped Superconductor
Authors: Jimmy A. Hutasoit and George Siopsis and Jason Therrien
Abstract: We study the conductivity of a strongly coupled striped superconductor using gauge/gravity duality (holography). The study is done analytically, in the large modulation regime. We show that the optical conductivity is inhomogeneous but isotropic at low temperatures. Near but below the critical temperature, we calculate the conductivity analytically at small frequency \omega, and find it to be both inhomogeneous and anisotropic. The anisotropy is imaginary and scales like 1/\omega. We also calculate analytically the speed of the second sound and the thermodynamic susceptibility.
