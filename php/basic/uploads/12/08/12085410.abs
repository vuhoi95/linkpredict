Title: Loop space and evolution of the light-like Wilson polygons
Authors: I. O. Cherednikov and T. Mertens and F. F. Van der Veken
Abstract: We address a connection between the energy evolution of the polygonal light-like Wilson exponentials and the geometry of the loop space with the gauge invariant Wilson loops of a variety of shapes being the fundamental degrees of freedom. The renormalization properties and the differential area evolution of these Wilson polygons are studied by making use of the universal Schwinger quantum dynamical approach. We discuss the appropriateness of the dynamical differential equations in the loop space to the study of the energy evolution of the collinear and transverse-momentum dependent parton distribution functions.
