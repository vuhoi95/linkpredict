Title: Long range order in gauge theories. Deformed QCD as a toy model
Authors: Evan Thomas and Ariel R. Zhitnitsky
Abstract: We study a number of different ingredients, related to long range order observed in lattice QCD simulations, using a simple "deformed QCD" model. This model is a weakly coupled gauge theory, which however has all the relevant crucial elements allowing us to study difficult and nontrivial problems which are known to be present in real strongly coupled QCD. In the present study, we want to understand the physics of long range order in form of coherent low dimensional vacuum configurations observed in Monte Carlo lattice simulations. We demonstrate the presence of double-layer domain wall structures in the deformed QCD, and study their interaction with localized topological monopoles. Furthermore, we show that there is in fact an attractive interaction between the two, such that the monopole favors a position within the domain wall.
