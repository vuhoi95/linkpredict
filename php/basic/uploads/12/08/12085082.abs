Title: Rank-3 finite temperature logarithmic conformal field theory
Authors: Taeyoon Moon and Yun Soo Myung
Abstract: We construct a rank-3 finite temperature logarithmic conformal field theory (LCFT) starting from a higher-derivative scalar field model in the BTZ black hole background. Its zero temperature limit reduces to a rank-3 LCFT in the AdS$_3$ background. For a tricritical generalized massive gravity, we read off the log-square quasinormal frequencies of graviton from the poles of the retarded Green's function in the momentum space. After using the truncation process, we find quasinormal frequencies from a unitary conformal field theory. Finally, employing the retarded Green's functions on the boundary, we compute the absorption cross sections of BTZ black hole which show feature of higher-order differential equations for scalars.
