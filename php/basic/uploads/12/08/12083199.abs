Title: Bosonic Fractionalisation Transitions
Authors: Alexander Adam and Benedict Crampton and Julian Sonner and Benjamin Withers
Abstract: At finite density, charge in holographic systems can be sourced either by explicit matter sources in the bulk or by bulk horizons. In this paper we find bosonic solutions of both types, breaking a global U(1) symmetry in the former case and leaving it unbroken in the latter. Using a minimal bottom-up model we exhibit phase transitions between the two cases, under the influence of a relevant operator in the dual field theory. We also embed solutions and transitions of this type in M-theory, where, holding the theory at constant chemical potential, the cohesive phase is connected to a neutral phase of Schr\"odinger type via a z=2 QCP.
