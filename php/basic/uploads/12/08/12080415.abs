Title: Balanced electric-magnetic dihole in Kaluza-Klein theory
Authors: Yu Chen and Edward Teo
Abstract: We present a four-dimensional double-black-hole (or dihole) solution in Kaluza-Klein theory, describing a superposition of an electrically charged and a magnetically charged black hole. This system can be balanced for appropriately chosen parameters, and the resulting space-time is completely regular on and outside the event horizons. This solution was constructed using the inverse-scattering method in five-dimensional vacuum gravity, in which it describes a rotating black ring surrounding a static black hole on a Taub-NUT background space. Various properties of this solution are studied, from both a four- and five-dimensional perspective.
