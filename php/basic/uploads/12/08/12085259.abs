Title: Integrable boundary interaction in 3D target space: the "pillow-brane"  model
Authors: Sergei L. Lukyanov and Alexander B. Zamolodchikov
Abstract: We propose a model of boundary interaction, with three-dimensional target space, and the boundary values of the field {\vec X}\in R^3 constrained to lay on a two-dimensional surface of the "pillow" shape. We argue that the model is integrable, and suggest that its exact solution is described in terms of certain linear ordinary differential equation.
