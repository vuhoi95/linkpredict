Title: Dirac theory on a space with linear Lie type fuzziness
Authors: A. Shariati and M. Khorrami and A. H. Fatollahi
Abstract: A spinor theory on a space with linear Lie type noncommutativity among spatial coordinates is presented. The model is based on the Fourier space corresponding to spatial coordinates, as this Fourier space is commutative. When the group is compact, the real space exhibits lattice characteristics (as the eigenvalues of space operators are discrete), and the similarity of such a \emph{lattice} with ordinary lattices is manifested, among other things, in a phenomenon resembling the famous \emph{fermion doubling} problem. A projection is introduced to make the dynamical number of spinors equal to that corresponding to the ordinary space. The actions for free and interacting spinors (with Fermi-like interactions) are presented. The Feynman rules are extracted and 1-loop corrections are investigated.
