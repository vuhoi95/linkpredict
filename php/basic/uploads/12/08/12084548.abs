Title: Ï‡-Systems for Correlation Functions
Authors: J. Caetano and J. Toledo
Abstract: We consider the strong coupling limit of 4-point functions of heavy operators in N=4 SYM dual to strings with no spin in AdS. We restrict our discussion for operators inserted on a line. The string computation factorizes into a state-dependent sphere part and a universal AdS contribution which depends only on the dimensions of the operators and the cross ratios. We use the integrability of the AdS string equations to compute the AdS part for operators of arbitrary conformal dimensions. The solution takes the form of TBA-like integral equations with the minimal AdS string-action computed by a corresponding free-energy-like functional. These TBA-like equations stem from a peculiar system of functional equations which we call a \chi-system. In principle one could use the same method to solve for the AdS contribution in the N-point function. An interesting feature of the solution is that it encodes multiple string configurations corresponding to different classical saddle-points. The discrete data that parameterizes these solutions enters through the analog of the chemical-potentials in the TBA-like equations. Finally, for operators dual to strings spinning in the same equator in S^5 (i.e. BPS operators of the same type) the sphere part is simple to compute. In this case (which is generically neither extremal nor protected) we can construct the complete, strong-coupling 4-point function.
