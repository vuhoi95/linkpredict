Title: Analogue Aharonov-Bohm effect in a Lorentz-violating background
Authors: M. A. Anacleto and F. A. Brito and E. Passos
Abstract: In this paper we consider the acoustic black hole metrics obtained from a relativistic fluid under the influence of constant background that violates the Lorentz symmetry to study the analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect. We show that the scattering of planar waves by a draining bathtub vortex leads to a modified AB effect and due to the Lorentz symmetry breaking, the phase shift persists even in the limit where the parameters associated with the circulation and draining vanish. In this limit, the Lorentz-violating background forms a conical defect, which is also responsible for the appearance of the analogue AB effect.
