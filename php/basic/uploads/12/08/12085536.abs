Abstract: We construct exact solutions, which represent regular charged rotating Kaluza-Klein multi-black holes in the five-dimensional pure Einstein-Maxwell theory. Quantization conditions between the mass, the angular momentum, and charges appear from the regularity condition of horizon. We also obtain multi-black string solutions by taking some limits in the solutions. We extend the black hole solutions to the five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory with an arbitrary Chern-Simons coupling constant.
