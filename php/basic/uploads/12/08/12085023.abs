Title: Asymptotic safety, hypergeometric functions, and the Higgs mass in  spectral action models
Authors: Christopher Estrada and Matilde Marcolli
Abstract: We study the renormalization group flow for the Higgs self coupling in the presence of gravitational correction terms. We show that the resulting equation is equivalent to a singular linear ODE, which has explicit solutions in terms of hypergeometric functions. We discuss the implications of this model with gravitational corrections on the Higgs mass estimates in particle physics models based on the spectral action functional.
