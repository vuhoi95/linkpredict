Title: A Remark on Supersymmetric Bubbles and Spectrum Crossover
Authors: M. Shifman and M. Voloshin
Abstract: Using an exact expression for the domain wall tension in a supersymmetric model we show that a spectrum crossover takes place in passing from weak to strong coupling. In the weak coupling regime elementary excitations are the lightest states, while in the strong coupling regime solitonic objects of a special type -- bubbles -- assume the role of the lightest states. The crossover occurs at \lambda^2/(4\pi) \sim 0.4.
