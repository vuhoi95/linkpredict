Title: One-loop four-graviton amplitudes in N=4 supergravity models
Authors: Piotr Tourkine and Pierre Vanhove
Abstract: We evaluate in great detail one-loop four-graviton field theory amplitudes in pure N=4 D=4 supergravity. The expressions are obtained by taking the field theory limits of (4,0) and (2,2) space-time supersymmetric string theory models. For each model we extract the contributions of the spin-1 and spin-2 N=4 supermultiplets running in the loop. We show that all of those constructions lead to the same four-dimensional result for the four-graviton amplitudes in pure supergravity even though they come from different string theory models.
