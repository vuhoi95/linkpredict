Title: A note on inflationary scenario with non-minimal coupling
Authors: Abhishek Basak and Jitesh R. Bhatt
Abstract: We consider first order perturbation theory for a non-minimally coupled inflaton field without assuming an adiabatic equation of state. In general perturbations in non-minimally coupled theory may be non-adiabatic. However under the slow-roll assumptions the perturbation theory may look like adiabatic one. We show in the frame-work of perturbation theory, that our results of spectral index and bound on no-minimal coupling parameter agree with the results obtained using the adiabatic equation of state by the earlier authors.
