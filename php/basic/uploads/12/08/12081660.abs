Title: Generalized Uncertainty Principle and the Ramsauer-Townsend Effect
Authors: J. Vahedi and Kourosh Nozari and P. Pedram
Abstract: The scattering cross section of electrons in noble gas atoms exhibits a minimum value at electron energies of approximately 1eV. This is the Ramsauer-Townsend effect. In this letter, we study the Ramsauer-Townsend effect in the framework of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle.
