Abstract: A scenario of leptogenesis was introduced in [1] which works during inflationary period within standard model of particle physics setup. In this scenario lepton number is created by the gravitational chiral anomaly which has a non-zero expectation value for models of inflation driven by pseudoscalar field(s). Here, we observe that models of inflation involving non-Abelian gauge fields, e.g. the chromo-natural inflation [2] or the gauge-flation [3], have a parity-violating tensor mode (graviton) spectrum and naturally lead to a non-vanishing expectation value for the gravitational chiral anomaly. Therefore, one has a natural leptogenesis scenario associated with these inflationary setups, inflato-natural leptogenesis. We argue that the observed value of baryon-to-photon number density can be explained in a natural range of parameters in these models.
