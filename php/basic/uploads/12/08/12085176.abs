Title: D3-D7 Holographic dual of a perturbed 3D CFT
Authors: Hamid Omid and Gordon W. Semenoff
Abstract: An appropriately oriented D3-D7-brane system is the holographic dual of relativistic Fermions occupying a 2+1-dimensional defect embedded in 3+1-dimensional spacetime. The Fermions interact via fields of ${\mathcal N}=4$ Yang-Mills theory in the 3+1-dimensional bulk. Recently, using internal flux to stabilize the system in the probe $N_7<<N_3$ limit, a number of solutions which are dual to conformal field theories with Fermion content have been found. We use holographic techniques to study perturbations of a particular one of the conformal field theories by relevant operators. Generally, the response of a conformal field theory to such a perturbation grows and becomes nonperturbative at low energy scales. We shall find that a perturbation which switches on a background magnetic field $B$ and Fermion mass $m$ induces a renormalization group flow that can be studied perturbatively in the limit of small $m^2/B$. We solve the leading order explicitly. We find that, for one particular value of internal flux, the system exhibits magnetic catalysis, the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry enhanced by the presence of the magnetic field. In the process, we derive formulae predicting the Debye screening length of the Fermion-antiFermion plasma at finite density and the diamagnetic moment of the ground state of the Fermion system in the presence of a magnetic field.
