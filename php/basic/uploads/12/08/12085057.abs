Title: A Hurwitz theory avatar of open-closed strings
Authors: A. Mironov and A. Morozov and S. Natanzon
Abstract: We review and explain an infinite-dimensional counterpart of the Hurwitz theory realization of algebraic open-closed string model a la Moore and Lizaroiu, where the closed and open sectors are represented by conjugation classes of permutations and the pairs of permutations, i.e. by the algebra of Young diagrams and bipartite graphes respectively. An intriguing feature of this Hurwitz string model is coexistence of two different multiplications, reflecting the deep interrelation between the theory of symmetric and linear groups S_\infty and GL(\infty).
