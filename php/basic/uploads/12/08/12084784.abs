Title: Anomaly Inflow and Membrane Dynamics in the QCD Vacuum
Authors: H. B. Thacker and Chi Xiong
Abstract: Large $N_c$ and holographic arguments, as well as Monte Carlo results, suggest that the topological structure of the QCD vacuum is dominated by codimension-one membranes which appear as thin dipole layers of topological charge. Such membranes arise naturally as $D6$ branes in the holographic formulation of QCD based on IIA string theory. The polarizability of these membranes leads to a vacuum energy $\propto \theta^2$, providing the origin of nonzero topological susceptibility. Here we show that the axial U(1) anomaly can be formulated as anomaly inflow on the brane surfaces. A 4D gauge transformation at the brane surface separates into a 3D gauge transformation of components within the brane and the transformation of the transverse component. The in-brane gauge transformation induces currents of an effective Chern-Simons theory on the brane surface, while the transformation of the transverse component describes the transverse motion of the brane and is related to the Ramond-Ramond closed string field in the holographic formulation of QCD. The relation between the surface currents and the transverse motion of the brane is dictated by the descent equations of Yang-Mills theory.
