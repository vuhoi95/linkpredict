Title: Higher time derivatives in effective equations of canonical quantum  systems
Authors: Martin Bojowald and Suddhasattwa Brahma and Elliot Nelson
Abstract: Quantum-corrected equations of motion generically contain higher time derivatives, computed here in the setting of canonically quantized systems. The main example in which detailed derivations are presented is a general anharmonic oscillator, but conclusions can be drawn also for systems in quantum gravity and cosmology.
