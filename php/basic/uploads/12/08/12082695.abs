Title: F-Theory and the Mordell-Weil Group of Elliptically-Fibered Calabi-Yau  Threefolds
Authors: David R. Morrison and Daniel S. Park
Abstract: The Mordell-Weil group of an elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefold X contains information about the abelian sector of the six-dimensional theory obtained by compactifying F-theory on X. After examining features of the abelian anomaly coefficient matrix and U(1) charge quantization conditions of general F-theory vacua, we study Calabi-Yau threefolds with Mordell-Weil rank-one as a first step towards understanding the features of the Mordell-Weil group of threefolds in more detail. In particular, we generate an interesting class of F-theory models with U(1) gauge symmetry that have matter with both charges 1 and 2. The anomaly equations --- which relate the Neron-Tate height of a section to intersection numbers between the section and fibral rational curves of the manifold --- serve as an important tool in our analysis.
