Abstract: We study certain features of a strongly coupled theory whose gravitational dual is given by two-charge dilatonic black hole in AdS5 which has recently been used to study holographic Fermi liquids. By making use of the gravity description, we have studied conductivity, holographic entanglement entropy and dynamics of a charged scalar field. In particular at low energy we find that the temperature dependence of the real part of the conductivity goes as T^3 and the background is stable against scalar condensations.
