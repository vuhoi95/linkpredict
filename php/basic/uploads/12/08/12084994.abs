Title: Introduction to Khovanov Homologies. I. Unreduced Jones superpolynomial
Authors: V. Dolotin and A. Morozov
Abstract: An elementary introduction to Khovanov construction of superpolynomials. Despite its technical complexity, this method remains the only source of a definition of superpolynomials from the first principles and therefore is important for development and testing of alternative approaches. In this first part of the review series we concentrate on the most transparent and unambiguous part of the story: the unreduced Jones superpolynomials in the fundamental representation and consider the 2-strand braids as the main example. Already for the 5_1 knot the unreduced superpolynomial contains more items than the ordinary Jones.
