Title: Energy from the gauge invariant observables
Authors: Takayuki Baba and Nobuyuki Ishibashi
Abstract: For a classical solution |Psi> in Witten's cubic string field theory, the gauge invariant observable <I|V|Psi> is conjectured to be equal to the difference of the one-point functions of the closed string state corresponding to V, between the trivial vacuum and the one described by |Psi>. For a static solution |Psi>, if V is taken to be the graviton vertex operator with vanishing momentum, the gauge invariant observable is expected to be proportional to the energy of |Psi>. We prove this relation assuming that |Psi> satisfies equation of motion and some regularity conditions. We discuss how this relation can be applied to various solutions obtained recently.
