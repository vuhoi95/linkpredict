Title: Light-cone fluctuations and the renormalized stress tensor of a massless  scalar field
Authors: V. A. De Lorenci and G. Menezes and N. F. Svaiter
Abstract: We investigate the effects of light-cone fluctuations over the renormalized vacuum expectation value of the stress-energy tensor of a real massless minimally coupled scalar field defined in a ($d+1$)-dimensional flat space-time with topology ${\cal R}\times {\cal S}^d$. For modeling the influence of light-cone fluctuations over the quantum field, we consider a random Klein-Gordon equation. We study the case of centered Gaussian processes. After taking into account all the realizations of the random processes, we present the correction caused by random fluctuations. The averaged renormalized vacuum expectation value of the stress-energy associated with the scalar field is presented.
