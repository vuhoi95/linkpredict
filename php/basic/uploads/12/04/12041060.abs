Title: Spectrum of Higher Derivative 6D Chiral Supergravity
Authors: Y. Pang and C. N. Pope and E. Sezgin
Abstract: Gauged off-shell Maxwell-Einstein supergravity in six dimensions with N=(1,0) supersymmetry has a higher derivative extension afforded by a supersymmetrized Riemann squared term. This theory admits a supersymmetric Minkowski x S^2 compactification with a U(1) monopole of unit charge on S^2. We determine the full spectrum of the theory on this background. We also determine the spectrum on a non-supersymmetric version of this compactification in which the monopole charge is different from unity, and we find the peculiar feature that there are massless gravitini in a representation of the S^2 isometry group determined by the monopole charge.
