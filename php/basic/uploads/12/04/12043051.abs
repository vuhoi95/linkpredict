Title: Dynamical Symmetry Breaking in Models with the Yukawa Interaction
Authors: V. G. Ksenzov and A. I. Romanov
Abstract: We discuss models with a massless fermion and a self-interacting massive scalar field with the Yukawa interaction. The chiral condensate and the fermion mass are calculated analytically. It is shown that the models have a phase transition as a function of the squared mass of the scalar field.
