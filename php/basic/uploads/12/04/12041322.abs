Abstract: We reconsider the problem of determining the semiclassical 3-point function in the Euclidean AdS_3 model. Exploiting the affine symmetry of the model we use solutions of the classical Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) equation to compute the saddle point of the action in the presence of three vertex operators. This alternative derivation reproduces the "heavy charge" classical limit of the quantum 3-point correlator. It is different from the recently proposed expression obtained by generalised Pohlmeyer reduction in AdS_2
