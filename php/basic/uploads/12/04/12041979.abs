Title: Non-Geometric Fluxes in Supergravity and Double Field Theory
Authors: David Andriot and Olaf Hohm and Magdalena Larfors and Dieter Lust and Peter Patalong
Abstract: In this paper we propose ten-dimensional realizations of the non-geometric fluxes Q and R. In particular, they appear in the NSNS Lagrangian after performing a field redefinition that takes the form of a T-duality transformation. Double field theory simplifies the computation of the field redefinition significantly, and also completes the higher-dimensional picture by providing a geometrical role for the non-geometric fluxes once the winding derivatives are taken into account. The relation to four-dimensional gauged supergravities, together with the global obstructions of non-geometry, are discussed.
