Title: Singularity-free model of electric charge in physical vacuum: Non-zero  spatial extent and mass generation
Authors: Vladimir Dzhunushaliev and Konstantin G. Zloshchastiev
Abstract: We propose a model of a spinless electrical charge as a self-consistent field configuration of the electromagnetic (EM) field interacting with a physical vacuum effectively described by the logarithmic quantum Bose liquid. We show that, in contrast to the EM field propagating in a trivial vacuum, a regular solution does exist, and both its mass and spatial extent emerge naturally from dynamics. It is demonstrated that the charge and energy density distribution acquire Gaussian-like form. The solution in the logarithmic model is stable and energetically favourable, unlike that obtained in a model with a quartic (Higgs-like) potential.
