Title: New symmetries in Fierz-Pauli massive gravity
Authors: Gianmassimo Tasinato and Kazuya Koyama and Gustavo Niz
Abstract: We expose a new symmetry for linear perturbations around a solution of non-linear Fierz-Pauli massive gravity plus a bare cosmological constant. The cosmological constant is chosen such that the background metric is flat while the Stuckelberg fields have a non-trivial profile. Around this background, at linear order the new symmetry reduces the propagating degrees of freedom to those of General Relativity, namely the massless helicity 2 modes only. We discuss the physical consequences and possible applications of these findings.
