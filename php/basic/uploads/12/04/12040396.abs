Title: Geodesic motion in the space-time of cosmic strings interacting via  magnetic fields
Authors: Betti Hartmann and Valeria Kagramanova
Abstract: We study the geodesic motion of test particles in the space-time of two Abelian-Higgs strings interacting via their magnetic fields. These bound states of cosmic strings constitute a field theoretical realization of p-q-strings which are predicted by inflationary models rooted in String Theory, e.g. brane inflation. In contrast to previously studied models describing p-q-strings our model possesses a Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) limit. If cosmic strings exist it would be exciting to detect them by direct observation. We propose that this can be done by the observation of test particle motion in the space-time of these objects. In order to be able to make predictions we have to solve the field equations describing the configuration as well as the geodesic equation numerically. The geodesics can then be classified according to the test particle's energy, angular momentum and momentum along the string axis. We find that the interaction of two Abelian-Higgs strings can lead to the existence of bound orbits that would be absent without the interaction. We also discuss the minimal and maximal radius of orbits and comment on possible applications in the context of gravitational wave emission.
