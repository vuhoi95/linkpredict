Title: A numerical test of differential equations for one- and two-loop sunrise  diagrams using configuration space techniques
Authors: S. Groote and J. G. KÃ¶rner and A. A. Pivovarov
Abstract: We use configuration space methods to write down one-dimensional integral representations for one- and two-loop sunrise diagrams (also called Bessel moments) which we use to numerically check on the correctness of the second order differential equations for one- and two-loop sunrise diagrams that have recently been discussed in the literature.
