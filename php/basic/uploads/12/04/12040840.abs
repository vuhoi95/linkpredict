Title: Effect of Position-dependent Mass on Dynamical Breaking of Type B and  Type X_2 N-fold Supersymmetry
Authors: Bikashkali Midya and Barnana Roy and Toshiaki Tanaka
Abstract: We investigate effect of position-dependent mass profiles on dynamical breaking of N-fold supersymmetry in several type B and type X_2 models. We find that N-fold supersymmetry in rational potentials in the constant-mass background are steady against the variation of mass profiles. On the other hand, some physically relevant mass profiles can change the pattern of dynamical N-fold supersymmetry breaking in trigonometric, hyperbolic, and exponential potentials of both type B and type X_2. The latter results open the possibility of detecting experimentally phase transition of N-fold as well as ordinary supersymmetry at a realistic energy scale.
