Title: Logarithmic quasinormal modes of a spin-3 field around the BTZ black  hole
Authors: Yong-Wan Kim and Yun Soo Myung and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: Using the operator approach, we obtain logarithmic quasinormal modes and frequencies of a traceless spin-3 field around the BTZ black hole at the critical point of the spin-3 topologically massive gravity. The logarithmic quasinormal frequencies are also confirmed by considering logarithmic conformal field theory.
