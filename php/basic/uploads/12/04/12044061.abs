Title: Heat Kernel Expansion and Extremal Kerr-Newmann Black Hole Entropy in  Einstein-Maxwell Theory
Authors: Sayantani Bhattacharyya and Binata Panda and Ashoke Sen
Abstract: We compute the second Seely-DeWitt coefficient of the kinetic operator of the metric and gauge fields in Einstein-Maxwell theory in an arbitrary background field configuration. We then use this result to compute the logarithmic correction to the entropy of an extremal Kerr-Newmann black hole.
