Abstract: For three dimensional N=6 superconformal field theories we compute one-loop scattering amplitudes for any number of external particles. We focus on a particular subsector of N=2 invariant superamplitudes for which the ordinary perturbative evaluation becomes very easy. The result we obtain is in general non-vanishing. For six external particles our findings are sufficient for determining the complete expression of the N=6 superamplitude at this order. We discuss the symmetries of the result and its anomalous variation under superconformal generators.
