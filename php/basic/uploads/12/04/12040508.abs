Title: Natural supersymmetric spectrum in mirage mediation
Authors: Masaki Asano and Tetsutaro Higaki
Abstract: Current results of LHC experiments exclude large area of light new particle region, namely natural parameter space, in supersymmetric extension models. One of the possibilities for achieving the correct electroweak symmetry breaking naturally is low scale messenger scenario. Actually, the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model with TeV scale mirage mediation realizes the natural electroweak symmetry breaking with various mass spectra. In this paper, we show the possible mass spectrum in the scenario, e.g. degenerate and/or hierarchical mass spectrum, and discuss these features.
