Title: Local and global structure of domain wall space-times
Authors: Yu-Huei Wu and Chih-Hung Wang
Abstract: We present a general proof on the equivalence of the comoving-coordinate approach, where the wall is fixed at a constant coordinate variable, and moving-wall approach, where the wall is moving in a background static space-time, in the domain wall space-times without reflection symmetry. We further provide a general procedure to construct the comoving coordinates in the domain wall space-times, where the two regions separated by an infinite thin wall have different cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and Schwartzschild mass $M$. By solving Israel's junction conditions in the thin-wall limit, the gravitational fields of spherical, planar and hyperbolic domain wall space-times with M=0 in the two different comoving coordinate systems are obtained. We finally discuss the global structure of these domain wall space-times.
