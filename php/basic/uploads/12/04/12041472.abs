Title: Reheating after f(R) inflation
Authors: Hayato Motohashi and Atsushi Nishizawa
Abstract: The reheating dynamics after the inflation induced by $R^2$-corrected $f(R)$ model is considered. To avoid the complexity of solving the fourth order equations, we analyze the inflationary and reheating dynamics in the Einstein frame and its analytical solutions are derived. We also perform numerical calculation including the backreaction from the particle creation and compare the results with the analytical solutions. Based on the results, observational constraints on the model are discussed.
