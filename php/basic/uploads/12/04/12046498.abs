Title: Orbifold matrix models and fuzzy extra dimensions
Authors: Athanasios Chatzistavrakidis and Harold Steinacker and George Zoupanos
Abstract: We revisit an orbifold matrix model obtained as a restriction of the type IIB matrix model on a Z_3-invariant sector. An investigation of its moduli space of vacua is performed and issues related to chiral gauge theory and gravity are discussed. Modifications of the orbifolded model triggered by Chern-Simons or mass deformations are also analyzed. Certain vacua of the modified models exhibit higher-dimensional behaviour with internal geometries related to fuzzy spheres.
