Abstract: In this paper, which is a companion to ArXiv:1204.2711[hep-th], we formulate a criterion for constructing 11D/10D maximal supergravity black-brane solutions with the near-extremal $S\sim n^3T^5$ entropy-temperature relation. We present explicit examples of such solutions with special attention paid to thermodynamics of black M-waves (KK-waves), intersecting/interpolating black branes with KK-waves, M2/M5 branes and their descents. We find the conditions on charges and numbers of branes in intersections, under which the dielectric effect of brane polarization becomes manifest on the supergravity side. We also briefly discuss the shear viscosity per entropy bound of M5 and D4 black branes within the AdS/CFT hydrodynamical limit.
