Title: Quasinormal frequencies and thermodynamic quantities for the Lifshitz  black holes
Authors: Yun Soo Myung and Taeyoon Moon
Abstract: We find the connection between thermodynamic quantities and quasinormal frequencies in Lifshitz black holes. It is shown that the globally stable Lifshitz black holes have pure imaginary quasinormal frequencies. We also show that by employing the Maggiore's method, both the horizon area and the entropy can be quantized for these black holes.
