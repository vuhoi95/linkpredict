Title: Self-energy of a scalar charge near higher-dimensional black holes
Authors: Valeri P. Frolov and Andrei Zelnikov
Abstract: We study the problem of self-energy of charges in higher dimensional static spacetimes. Application of regularization methods of quantum field theory to calculation of the classical self-energy of charges leads to model-independent results. The correction to the self-energy of a scalar charge due to the gravitational field of black holes of the higher dimensional Majumdar-Papapetrou spacetime is calculated exactly. It proves to be zero in even dimensions, but it acquires non-zero value in odd dimensional spacetimes. The origin of the self-energy correction in odd dimensions is similar to the origin the conformal anomalies in quantum field theory in even dimensional spacetimes.
