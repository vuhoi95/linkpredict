Title: The Omega Deformation From String and M-Theory
Authors: Simeon Hellerman and Domenico Orlando and Susanne Reffert
Abstract: We present a string theory construction of Omega-deformed four-dimensional gauge theories with generic values of \epsilon_1 and \epsilon_2. Our solution gives an explicit description of the geometry in the core of Nekrasov and Witten's realization of the instanton partition function, far from the asymptotic region of their background. This construction lifts naturally to M-theory and corresponds to an M5-brane wrapped on a Riemann surface with a selfdual flux. Via a 9-11 flip, we finally reinterpret the Omega deformation in terms of non-commutative geometry. Our solution generates all modified couplings of the \Omega-deformed gauge theory, and also yields a geometric origin for the quantum spectral curve of the associated quantum integrable system.
