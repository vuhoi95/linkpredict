Abstract: We show that the improper ferroelectric phase transition in the multiferroic hexagonal manganites displays the same symmetry-breaking characteristics as those proposed in early-universe theories. We present an analysis of the Kibble-Zurek theory of topological defect formation applied to the hexagonal manganites, discuss the conditions determining the range of cooling rates in which Kibble-Zurek behavior is expected, and show that recent literature data are consistent with our predictions. We explore experimentally for the first time to our knowledge the cross-over out of the Kibble-Zurek regime and find a surprising "anti-Kibble-Zurek" behavior.
