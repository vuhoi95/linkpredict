Title: Holographic Entanglement Entropy in P-wave Superconductor Phase  Transition
Authors: Rong-Gen Cai and Song He and Li Li and Yun-Long Zhang
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of entanglement entropy across the holographic p-wave superconductor phase transition in an Einstein-Yang-Mills theory with a negative cosmological constant. The holographic entanglement entropy is calculated for a strip geometry at AdS boundary. It is found that the entanglement entropy undergoes a dramatic change as we tune the ratio of the gravitational constant to the Yang-Mills coupling, and that the entanglement entropy does behave as the thermal entropy of the background black holes. That is, the entanglement entropy will show the feature of the second order or first order phase transition when the ratio is changed. It indicates that the entanglement entropy is a good probe to investigate the properties of the holographic phase transition.
