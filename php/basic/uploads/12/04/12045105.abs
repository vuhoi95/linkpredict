Title: The action for higher spin black holes in three dimensions
Authors: M. Banados and R. Canto and S. Theisen
Abstract: In the context of (2+1)--dimensional Chern-Simons SL(N,R)\times SL(N,R) gauge fields and spin N black holes we compute the on-shell action and show that it generates sensible and consistent thermodynamics. In particular, the Chern-Simons action solves the integrability conditions recently considered in the literature.
