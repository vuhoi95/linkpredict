Title: Intersecting D-branes and Lifshitz-like space-time
Authors: Parijat Dey and Shibaji Roy
Abstract: In a previous paper (Dey and Roy, arXiv:1203.5381) we have shown how Lifshitz-like space-times (space-times having Lifshitz scaling with hyperscaling violation) arise from 1/4 BPS, threshold F-D$p$ bound state solutions of type II string theories in the near horizon limit. In this paper we show that similar structures also arise from the near horizon limit of 1/4 BPS, threshold intersecting D-brane solutions of type II string theories. Some of these solutions are standard (D$p$-D($p+4$) for $p=0, 2$) and some are non-standard (D$p$-D($p+2)$ for $p = 1, 2, 3$) including D2-D2$'$, D3-D3$'$ and D4-D4$'$ solutions. The dilatons of these solutions in general run (except in D2-D4 and D3-D3$'$ cases) and produce RG flows. We discuss the phase structures of these solutions. D2-D4 and D3-D3$'$ in the near horizon limit do not produce Lifshitz-like space-time, but give AdS$_3$ spaces.
