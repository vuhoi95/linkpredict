Title: Analytic study of Gauss-Bonnet holographic superconductors in  Born-Infeld electrodynamics
Authors: Sunandan Gangopadhyay and Dibakar Roychowdhury
Abstract: Using Sturm-Liouville (SL) eigenvalue problem, we investigate several properties of holographic s-wave superconductors in Gauss-Bonnet gravity with Born-Infeld electrodynamics in the probe limit. Our analytic scheme has been found to be in good agreement with the numerical results. From our analysis it is quite evident that the scalar hair formation at low temperatures is indeed affected by both the Gauss-Bonnet as well as the Born-Infeld coupling parameters. We also compute the critical exponent associated with the condensation near the critical temperature. The value of the critical exponent thus obtained indeed suggests a universal mean field behavior.
