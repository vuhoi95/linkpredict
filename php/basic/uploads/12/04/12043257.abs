Abstract: We present a coherent and operational strategy to calculate, in a nonperturbative way, physical observables in light-front dynamics. This strategy is based on the decomposition of the state vector of any compound system in Fock components, and on the covariant formulation of light-front dynamics, together with the so-called Fock sector dependent renormalization scheme. We apply our approach to the calculation of the electromagnetic form factors of a fermion in the Yukawa model, in the nontrivial three-body Fock space truncation, for rather large values of the coupling constant. We find that, once the renormalization conditions are properly taken into account, the form factors do not depend on the regularization scale, when the latter is much larger than the physical masses. We then extend the Fock space by including antifermion degrees of freedom.
