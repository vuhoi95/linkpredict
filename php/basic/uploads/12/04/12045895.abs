Title: Perturbed N=(2,2) supersymmetric sigma models on Lie groups
Authors: M. Ebrahimi and A. Rezaei-Aghdam
Abstract: We perturbed N=(2,2) supersymmetric WZW and sigma models on Lie groups by adding a term to their actions. Then by using non-coordinate basis we obtain conditions, from the algebraic point of view, under which the N=(2,2) supersymmetry is preserved. By applying this method, we have obtained conditions on the existence of N=(2,2) supersymmetry on the Drinfeld action (master action for the Poisson-Lie T-dual sigma models).
