Title: Dynamical Dark Energy and Spontaneously Generated Gravity
Authors: Alexander Y. Kamenshchik and Alessandro Tronconi and Giovanni Venturi
Abstract: We study the cosmological evolution of an induced gravity model with a scale symmetry breaking potential for the scalar field. The radiation to matter transition, following inflation and reheating, influences the dynamics of such a field through its non minimal coupling. We illustrate how, under certain conditions on the potential, such a dynamics can lead to a suitable amount of dark energy explaining the present accelerated expansion.
