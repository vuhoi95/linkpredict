Title: One paramter family of solitons from minimal surfaces
Authors: Rukmini Dey and Pradip Kumar
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss a one parameter family of complex Born-Infeld solitons arising from a one parameter family of minimal surfaces. The process enables us to generate a new solution of the B-I equation from a given complex solution of a special type (which are abundant). We illustrate this with many examples. We find that the action or the energy of this family of solitons remains invariant in this family and find that the well-known Lorentz symmetry of the B-I equations is responsible for it.
