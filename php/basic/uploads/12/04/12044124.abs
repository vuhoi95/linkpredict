Title: The Gaussian entropy of fermionic systems
Authors: Tomislav Prokopec and Michael G. Schmidt and Jan Weenink
Abstract: We consider the entropy and decoherence in fermionic quantum systems. By making a Gaussian Ansatz for the density operator of a collection of fermions we study statistical 2-point correlators and express the entropy of a system fermion in terms of these correlators. In a simple case when a set of N thermalised environmental fermionic oscillators interacts bi-linearly with the system fermion we can study its time dependent entropy, which also represents a quantitative measure for decoherence. We then consider a relativistic fermionic quantum field theory and take a mass mixing term as a simple model for the Yukawa interaction. It turns out that even in this Gaussian approximation, the fermionic system decoheres quite effectively, such that in a large coupling and high temperature regime the system field approaches the temperature of the environmental fields.
