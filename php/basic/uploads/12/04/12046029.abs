Title: A Gapless Hard Wall: Magnetic Catalysis in Bulk and Boundary
Authors: Stefano Bolognesi and Jo√£o N. Laia and David Tong and Kenny Wong
Abstract: We study various aspects of fermions and their chiral condensates, both in the bulk of AdS4 spacetime and in the dual boundary theory. For the most part, we focus on a geometry with an infra-red hard wall. We show that, contrary to common lore, there exist boundary conditions in which the hard wall gives rise to a discrete, but gapless, fermionic spectrum. In such a setting, the presence of a magnetic field induces a bulk fermion condensate which spontaneously breaks CP invariance. We develop the holographic dictionary between composite operators and show that this bulk condensate has the interpretation of boundary magnetic catalysis involving a double-trace operator. Finally, we explain how one can replace the hard wall with bulk magnetic monopoles. In such a framework, magnetic catalysis can be viewed as a consequence of the Callan-Rubakov effect.
