Title: Entropy Spectrum of a Carged Black Hole of Heterotic String Theory via  Adiabatic Invariance
Authors: Alexis Larranaga and Luis Cabarique and Manuel Londono
Abstract: Using adiabatic invariance and the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule we investigate the entropy spectroscopy of a charged black hole of heterotic string theory. It is shown that the entropy spectrum is equally spaced identically to the Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr black holes. Since the adiabatic invariance method does not use quasinormal mode analysis, there is no need to impose the small charge limit and no confusion on whether the real part or imaginary part is responsible for the entropy spectrum.
