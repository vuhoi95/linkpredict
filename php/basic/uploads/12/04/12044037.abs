Title: On Form Factors in nested Bethe Ansatz systems
Authors: Balazs Pozsgay and Willem-Victor van Gerven Oei and Marton Kormos
Abstract: We investigate form factors of local operators in the multi-component Quantum Non-linear Schr\"odinger model, a prototype theory solvable by the so-called nested Bethe Ansatz. We determine the analytic properties of the infinite volume form factors using the coordinate Bethe Ansatz solution and we establish a connection with the finite volume matrix elements. In the two-component models we derive a set of recursion relations for the "magnonic form factors", which are the matrix elements on the nested Bethe Ansatz states. In certain simple cases (involving states with only one spin-impurity) we obtain explicit solutions for the recursion relations.
