Title: Large Nc Equivalence and Baryons
Authors: Mike Blake and Aleksey Cherman
Abstract: In the large Nc limit, gauge theories with different gauge groups and matter content sometimes turn out to be `large Nc equivalent', in the sense of having a set of coincident correlation functions. Large Nc equivalence has mainly been explored in the glueball and meson sectors. However, a recent proposal to dodge the fermion sign problem of QCD with a quark-number chemical potential using large Nc equivalence motivates investigating the applicability of large Nc equivalence to correlation functions involving baryon operators. Here we present evidence that large Nc equivalence extends to the baryon sector, under the same type of symmetry-realization assumptions as in the meson sector, by adapting the classic Witten analysis of large Nc baryons.
