Title: The Constraints and Spectra of a Deformed Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Chee-Leong Ching and Rajesh R. Parwani and Kuldip Singh
Abstract: We examine a deformed quantum mechanics in which the commutator between coordinates and momenta is a function of momenta. The Jacobi identity constraint on a two-parameter class of such modified commutation relations (MCR's) shows that they encode an intrinsic maximum momentum; a sub-class of which also imply a minimum position uncertainty. Maximum momentum causes the bound state spectrum of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator to terminate at finite energy, whereby classical characteristics are observed for the studied cases. We then use a semi-classical analysis to discuss general concave potentials in one dimension and isotropic power-law potentials in higher dimensions. Among other conclusions, we find that in a subset of the studied MCR's, the leading order energy shifts of bound states are of opposite sign compared to those obtained using string-theory motivated MCR's, and thus these two cases are more easily distinguishable in potential experiments.
