Title: Instantonic dyons of Yang-Mills--Chern-Simons models in d=2n+1  dimensions, n>2
Authors: Eugen Radu and D. H. Tchrakian
Abstract: We investigate finite energy solutions of Yang-Mills--Chern-Simons systems in odd spacetime dimensions, d=2n+1, with n>2. This can be carried out systematically for all n, but the cases n=3,4 corresponding to a 7,8 dimensional spacetime are treated concretely. These are static and spherically symmetric configurations, defined in a flat Minkowski background. The value of the electric charge is fixed by the Chern-Simons coupling constant.
