Title: The Unruh Effect in General Boundary Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Daniele Colosi and Dennis Raetzel
Abstract: In the framework of the general boundary formulation (GBF) of scalar quantum field theory we obtain a coincidence of expectation values of local observables in the Minkowski vacuum and in a particular state in Rindler space. This coincidence could be seen as a consequence of the identification of the Minkowski vacuum as a thermal state in Rindler space usually associated with the Unruh effect. However, we underline the difficulty in making this identification in the GBF. Beside the Feynman quantization prescription for observables that we use to derive the coincidence of expectation values, we investigate an alternative quantization prescription called Berezin-Toeplitz quantization prescription, and we find that the coincidence of expectation values does not exist for the latter.
