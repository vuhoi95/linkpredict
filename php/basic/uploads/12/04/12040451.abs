Title: Holographic Double Diffractive Production of Higgs and the AdS  Graviton/Pomeron
Authors: Richard Brower and Marko DjuriÄ‡ and Chung-I Tan
Abstract: The holographic approach to double diffractive Higgs production is presented for the AdS graviton/Pomeron. The goal is to provide a predictive phenomenology for the strong coupling expansion of QCD. This is the first step to set up the framework for the double diffractive Higgs production in anticipation of experimental observations at the LHC. Comparisons are made with the weak coupling approach based on the BFKL Pomeron models and soft Regge parameterizations.
