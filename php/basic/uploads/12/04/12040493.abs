Title: Supersymmetric solutions to gauged N=2 d=4 sugra: the full timelike  shebang
Authors: P. Meessen and T. Ort√≠n
Abstract: We discuss the structure of supersymmetric solutions in the timelike case to general gauged N=2 d=4 supergravity theories coupled to non-Abelian vector multiplets and hypermultiplets.
