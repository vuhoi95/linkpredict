Title: Converting Classical Theories to Quantum Theories by Solutions of the  Hamilton-Jacobi Equation
Authors: Zhi-Qiang Guo and Ivan Schmidt
Abstract: By employing special solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and tools from lattice theories, we suggest an approach to convert classical theories to quantum theories for mechanics and field theories. Some nontrivial results are obtained for a gauge field and a fermion field. For a topologically massive gauge theory, we can obtain a first order Lagrangian with mass term. For the fermion field, in order to make our approach feasible, we supplement the conventional Lagrangian with a surface term. This surface term can also produce the massive term for the fermion.
