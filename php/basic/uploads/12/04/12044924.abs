Title: Quantum Singularities in Horava-Lifshitz Cosmology
Authors: Jo√£o Paulo M. Pitelli and Alberto Saa
Abstract: The recently proposed Horava-Lifshitz (HL) theory of gravity is analyzed from the quantum cosmology point of view. By employing usual quantum cosmology techniques, we study the quantum Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe filled with radiation in the context of HL gravity. We find that this universe is quantum mechanically nonsingular in two different ways: the expectation value of the scale factor $<a>(t)$ never vanishes and, if we abandon the detailed balance condition suggested by Horava, the quantum dynamics of the universe is uniquely determined by the initial wave packet and no boundary condition at $a=0$ is indeed necessary.
