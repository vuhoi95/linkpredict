Title: Accelerated detectors in Dirac vacuum: the effects of horizon  fluctuations
Authors: C. H. G. Bessa and J. G. Duenas and N. F. Svaiter
Abstract: We consider an Unruh-DeWitt detector interacting with a massless Dirac field. Assuming that the detector is moving along an hyperbolic trajectory, we modeled the effects of fluctuations in the event horizon using a Dirac equation with random coefficients. First, we develop the perturbation theory for the fermionic field in a random media. Further we evaluate corrections due to the randomness in the response function associated to different model detectors.
