Title: QCD With A Chemical Potential, Topology, And The 't Hooft 1/N Expansion
Authors: Adi Armoni and Agostino Patella
Abstract: We discuss the dependence of observables on the chemical potential in 't Hooft's large-N QCD. To this end we use the worldline formalism to expand the fermionic determinant in powers of 1/N. We consider the hadronic as well as the deconfining phase of the theory. We discuss the origin of the sign problem in the worldline approach and elaborate on the planar equivalence between QCD with a baryon chemical potential and QCD with an isospin chemical potential. We show that for C-even observables the sign problem occurs at a subleading order in the 1/N expansion of the fermionic determinant. Finally, we comment on the finite N theory.
