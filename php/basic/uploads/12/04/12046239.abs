Title: Glueball condensates as holographic duals of supersymmetric Q-balls and  boson stars
Authors: Betti Hartmann and Juergen Riedel
Abstract: We study non-spinning Q-balls and boson stars in 4-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time. We use an exponential scalar field potential that appears in gauge-mediated supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM). We investigate the dependence of the charge and mass of these non-topological solitons on the negative cosmological constant, the frequency that appears in the periodic time-dependence as well as on the ratio between the SUSY breaking scale and the Planck mass. Next to fundamental solutions without nodes in the scalar field function we also construct radially excited solutions. In the second part of the paper we put the emphasis on the holographic interpretation of these solutions in terms of Bose-Einstein condensates of scalar glueballs that are described by a strongly coupled Quantum Field Theory (QFT) on the boundary of global AdS.
