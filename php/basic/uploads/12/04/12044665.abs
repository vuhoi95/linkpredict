Title: Temperature of Electron Fluctuations in an Accelerated Vacuum
Authors: Lance Labun and Johann Rafelski
Abstract: The electron vacuum fluctuations measured by $\cond$ do not vanish in an externally applied electric field $\calE$. For an exactly constant field, that is for vacuum fluctuations in presence of a constant accelerating force, we show that $\cond$ has a Boson-like structure with spectral state density $\tanh^{-1}(E/m)$ and temperature $\TEH = e\calE/m\pi = a_v/\pi$. Considering the vacuum fluctuations of `classical' gyromagnetic ratio $g=1$ particles we find Fermi-like structure with the same spectral state density at a smaller temperature $T_1=a_v/2\pi$ which corresponds to the Unruh temperature of an accelerated observer.
