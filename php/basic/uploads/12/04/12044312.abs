Title: Entropy spectrum of a Kerr anti-de Sitter black hole
Authors: Deyou Chen and Haitang Yang
Abstract: The entropy spectrum of a spherically symmetric black hole was derived without the quasinormal modes in the work of Majhi and Vagenas. Extending this work to rotating black holes, we quantize the entropy and the horizon area of a Kerr anti-de Sitter black hole by two methods. The spectra of entropy and area are obtained via the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule and the adiabatic invariance in the first way. By addressing the wave function of emitted (absorbed) particles, the entropy and the area are quantized in the second one. Both results show that the entropy and the area spectra are equally spaced.
