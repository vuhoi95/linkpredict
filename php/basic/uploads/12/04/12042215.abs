Title: New Exact Solutions of Quadratic Curvature Gravity
Authors: Metin Gurses and Tahsin Cagri Sisman and Bayram Tekin
Abstract: It is a known fact that the Kerr-Schild type solutions in general relativity satisfy both exact and linearized Einstein field equations. We show that this property remains valid also for a special class of the Kerr-Schild metrics in arbitrary dimensions in generic quadratic curvature theory. In addition to the AdS-wave (or Siklos) metric which represents plane waves in an AdS background, we present here a new exact solution, in this class, to the quadratic gravity in D-dimensions which represents a spherical wave in an AdS background. The solution is a special case of the Kundt metrics belonging to spacetimes with constant curvature invariants.
