Title: Secret Symmetries in AdS/CFT
Authors: Marius de Leeuw and Takuya Matsumoto and Sanefumi Moriyama and Vidas Regelskis and Alessandro Torrielli
Abstract: We discuss special quantum group (secret) symmetries of the integrable system associated to the AdS/CFT correspondence. These symmetries have by now been observed in a variety of forms, including the spectral problem, the boundary scattering problem, n-point amplitudes, the pure-spinor formulation and quantum affine deformations.
