Title: A lattice Poisson algebra for the Pohlmeyer reduction of the AdS_5 x S^5  superstring
Authors: Francois Delduc and Marc Magro and Benoit Vicedo
Abstract: The Poisson algebra of the Lax matrix associated with the Pohlmeyer reduction of the AdS_5 x S^5 superstring is computed from first principles. The resulting non-ultralocality is mild, which enables to write down a corresponding lattice Poisson algebra.
