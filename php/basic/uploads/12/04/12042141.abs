Title: N=2 supersymmetry breaking at two different scales
Authors: Ignatios Antoniadis and Jean-Pierre Derendinger and Jean-Claude Jacot
Abstract: We study N=2 spontaneous supersymmetry breaking at two different scales with matter fields in hypermultiplets charged under the gauge group that should involve at least two U(1) factors. Off-shell analysis is possible in the dual single-tensor formulation of the hypermultiplets. Massless fermions can naturally arise from pseudo-real representations of the gauge group that allow a reformulation of the problem of chirality in N=2 theories. The above properties are necessary ingredients towards constructing viable extensions of the Standard Model based on N=2 supersymmetry.
