Title: On Cosmological Constants from alpha'-Corrections
Authors: Fri√∞rik Freyr Gautason and Daniel Junghans and Marco Zagermann
Abstract: We examine to what extent perturbative alpha'-corrections can generate a small cosmological constant in warped string compactifications. Focusing on the heterotic string at lowest order in the string loop expansion, we show that, for a maximally symmetric spacetime, the alpha'-corrected 4D scalar potential has no effect on the cosmological constant. The only relevant terms are instead higher order products of 4D Riemann tensors, which, however, are found to vanish in the usual perturbative regime of the alpha'-expansion. The heterotic string therefore only allows for 4D Minkowski vacua to all orders in alpha', unless one also introduces string loop and/or nonperturbative corrections or allows for curvatures or field strengths that are large in string units. In particular, we find that perturbative alpha'-effects cannot induce weakly curved AdS_4 solutions.
