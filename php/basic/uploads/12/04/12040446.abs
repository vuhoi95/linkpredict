Title: The limit of N=(2,2) superconformal minimal models
Authors: Stefan Fredenhagen and Cosimo Restuccia and Rui Sun
Abstract: The limit of families of two-dimensional conformal field theories has recently attracted attention in the context of AdS/CFT dualities. In our work we analyse the limit of N=(2,2) superconformal minimal models when the central charge approaches c=3. The limiting theory is a non-rational N=(2,2) superconformal theory, in which there is a continuum of chiral primary fields. We determine the spectrum of the theory, the three-point functions on the sphere, and the disc one-point functions.
