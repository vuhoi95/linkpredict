Title: Hopfion canonical quantization
Authors: A. Acus and A. Halavanau and E. Norvaisas and Ya. Shnir
Abstract: We study the effect of the canonical quantization of the rotational mode of the charge Q=1 and Q=2 spinning Hopfions. The axially-symmetric solutions are constructed numerically, it is shown the quantum corrections to the mass of the configurations are relatively large.
