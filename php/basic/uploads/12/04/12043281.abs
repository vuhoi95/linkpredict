Title: Dynamics determines geometry
Authors: Sergio A. Hojman and J. Gamboa and F. Mendez
Abstract: The inverse problem of calculus of variations and $s$-equivalence are re-examined by using results obtained from non-commutative geometry ideas. The role played by the structure of the modified Poisson brackets is discussed in a general context and it is argued that classical $s$-equivalent systems may be non-equivalent at the quantum mechanical level. This last fact is explicitly discussed comparing different approaches to deal with the Nair-Polychronakos oscillator.
