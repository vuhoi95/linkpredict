Title: Spin and holographic metals
Authors: Victor Alexandrov and Piers Coleman
Abstract: In this paper we discuss two-dimensional holographic metals from a condensed matter physics perspective. We examine the spin structure of the Green's function of the holographic metal, demonstrating that the excitations of the holographic metal are "chiral", lacking the inversion symmetry of a conventional Fermi surface, with only one spin orientation for each point on the Fermi surface, aligned parallel to the momentum. While the presence of a Kramer's degeneracy across the Fermi surface permits the formation of a singlet superconductor, it also implies that ferromagnetic spin fluctuations are absent from the holographic metal, leading to a complete absence of Pauli paramgnetism. In addition, we show how the Green's function of the holographic metal can be regarded as a reflection coefficient in anti-de-Sitter space, relating the ingoing and outgoing waves created by a particle moving on the external surface.
