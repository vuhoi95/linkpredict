Title: On the coupling constant bounds implying area decay of Wilson loop for  Z2 lattice gauge theories with Wilson action Boltzmann factor given by bond  variables described by transverse Ising model
Authors: F. C. SÃ¡ Barreto and A. L. Mota
Abstract: We obtain correlation functions for lattice gauge theories with action Boltzmann factor given by bond variables described by transverse Ising model and apply them to obtain area decay of the Wilson loop observable in a range of the coupling parameter larger than that obtained from mean field theory considerations.
