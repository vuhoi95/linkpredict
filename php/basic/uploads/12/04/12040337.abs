Title: Quantum mechanics of a charged particle in a background magnetic field  interacting with linearized gravitational waves
Authors: Sunandan Gangopadhyay and Anirban Saha
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of a charged particle interacting with background electromagnetic field under the influence of linearized gravitational waves in the long wave-length and low-velocity limit. Following the prescription in \cite{speli}, the system is quantized and the Hamiltonian is then solved by using standard algebraic iterative methods. The solution is in conformity with the classical analysis and shows the possibility of tuning the frequency by changing the magnetic field to set up resonance.
