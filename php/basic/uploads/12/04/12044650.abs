Title: New Spherically Symmetric Solutions in f(R)-gravity by Noether  Symmetries
Authors: S. Capozziello and N. Frusciante and D. Vernieri
Abstract: Spherical symmetry for f(R)-gravity is discussed by searching for Noether symmetries. The method consists in selecting conserved quantities in form of currents that reduce dynamics of f(R)-models compatible with symmetries. In this way we get a general method to obtain constants of motion without setting a priori the form of f(R). In this sense, the Noether symmetry results a physical criterium. Relevant cases are discussed.
