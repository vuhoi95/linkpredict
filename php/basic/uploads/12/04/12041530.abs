Title: Hawking radiation from dynamical horizons
Authors: Ayan Chatterjee and Bhramar Chatterjee and Amit Ghosh
Abstract: In completely local settings, we establish that a dynamically evolving black hole horizon can be assigned a Hawking temperature. Moreover, we calculate the Hawking flux and show that the radius of the horizon shrinks.
