Title: Exact solutions in gravity with a sigma model source
Authors: A. A. Golubtsova and V. D. Ivashchuk
Abstract: We consider a D-dimensional model of gravity with non-linear "scalar fields" as a matter source. The model is defined on the product manifold M, which contains n Einstein factor spaces. General cosmological type solutions to the field equations are obtained when n-1 factor spaces are Ricci-flat, e.g. when one space M_1 of dimension d_1 > 1 has nonzero scalar curvature. The solutions are defined up to solutions to geodesic equations corresponding to a sigma model target space. Several examples of sigma models are presented. A subclass of spherically-symmetric solutions is studied and a restricted version of "no-hair theorem" for black holes is proved. For the case d_1 =2 a subclass of latent soliton solutions is singled out.
