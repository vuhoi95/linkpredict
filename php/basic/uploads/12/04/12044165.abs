Title: r Duality and "Instead-of-Confinement" Mechanism in N=1 Supersymmetric  QCD
Authors: M. Shifman and A. Yung
Abstract: We consider N=2 SQCD with the U(N) gauge group and N_f flavors (N_f>N) perturbed by an N=2 breaking deformation - a small mass term \mu for the adjoint matter. We study r-vacua, with the constraint $2N_f/3 < r \le N. At large values of the parameter \xi\sim\mu m (m is a typical value of the quark masses) r quark flavors condense, by construction. The effective low-energy theory with the gauge group U(r)\times U(1)^{N-r} is at weak coupling. Upon reducing \xi the original theory undergoes a crossover transition from weak to strong coupling. As the original theory becomes strongly coupled, at low energies it is described by a weakly coupled infrared-free dual theory with the gauge group U(N_f-r)\times U(1)^{N-N_f+r} and N_f light dyon flavors. These dyons condense triggering formation of non-Abelian strings which still confine monopoles, rather than quarks, contrary to naive duality arguments. "Instead-of-confinement" mechanism for quarks and gauge bosons of the original theory takes place: screened quarks and gauge bosons of the original theory decay, on curves of the marginal stability (CMS), into confined monopole-antimonopole pairs that form stringy mesons. Next, we increase the deformation parameter \mu thus decoupling the adjoint fields. Then our theory flows to N=1 SQCD. The gauge group of the dual theory becomes U(N_f-r). We show that the dual theory is weakly coupled if we are sufficiently close to the Argyres-Douglas point. The "instead-of-confinement" mechanism for quarks and gauge bosons survives in the limit of large \mu. It determines low-energy non-Abelian dynamics in the r-vacua of N=1 SQCD.
