Abstract: We classify vortex-core structures according to the topology of the order parameter space. By developing a method to characterize how the order parameter changes inside the vortex core. We apply this method to the spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates and show that the vortex-core structures are classified by winding numbers that are locally defined in the core region. We also show that a vortex-core structure with a nontrivial winding number can be stabilized under a negative quadratic Zeeman effect.
