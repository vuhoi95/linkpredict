Title: The Dirac-Coulomb Problem: a mathematical revisit
Authors: A. D. Alhaidari and H. Bahlouli and M. E. H. Ismail
Abstract: We obtain a symmetric tridiagonal matrix representation of the Dirac-Coulomb operator in a suitable complete square integrable basis. Orthogonal polynomials techniques along with Darboux method are used to obtain the bound states energy spectrum, the relativistic scattering amplitudes and phase shifts from the asymptotic behavior of the polynomial solutions associated with the resulting three-term recursion relation.
