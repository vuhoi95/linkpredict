Abstract: We investigate the effect of Lorentz-violating terms on Bhabha scattering in two distinct cases correspondent to vectorial and axial nonminimal couplings in QED. In both cases, we find significant modifications with respect to the usual relativistic result. Our results reveal an anisotropy of the differential cross section which imply new constraints on the possible Lorentz violating terms.
