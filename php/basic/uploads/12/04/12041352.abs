Title: Classical Duals, Legendre Transforms and the Vainshtein Mechanism
Authors: Antonio Padilla and Paul M. Saffin
Abstract: We show how to generalize the classical duals found by Gabadadze {\it et al} to a very large class of self-interacting theories. This enables one to adopt a perturbative description beyond the scale at which classical perturbation theory breaks down in the original theory. This is particularly relevant if we want to test modified gravity scenarios that exhibit Vainshtein screening on solar system scales. We recognise the duals as being related to the Legendre transform of the original Lagrangian, and present a practical method for finding the dual in general; our methods can also be applied to self-interacting theories with a hierarchy of strong coupling scales, and with multiple fields. We find the classical dual of the full quintic galileon theory as an example.
