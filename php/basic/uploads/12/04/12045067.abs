Title: Fermionic gluing principle of the topological vertex
Authors: Fusheng Deng and Jian Zhou
Abstract: We will establish the fermionic gluing principle of the topological vertex, that is, provided the framed ADKMV conjecture, the generating functions of the Gromov-Witten invariants of all toric Calabi-Yau threefolds are Bogoliubov transforms of the vacuum.
