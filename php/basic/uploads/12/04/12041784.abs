Title: Issues Concerning Loop Corrections to the Primordial Power Spectra
Authors: S. P. Miao and R. P. Woodard
Abstract: We expound ten principles in an attempt to clarify the debate over infrared loop corrections to the primordial scalar and tensor power spectra from inflation. Among other things we note that existing proposals for nonlinear extensions of the scalar fluctuation field $\zeta$ introduce new ultraviolet divergences which no one understands how to renormalize. Loop corrections and higher correlators of these putative observables would also be enhanced by inverse powers of the slow roll parameter $\epsilon$. We propose an extension which should be better behaved.
