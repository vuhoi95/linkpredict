Abstract: We examine the process of Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) in the small-x limit, where Pomeron exchange dominates. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we study Pomeron exchange in the dual string theory in AdS space, which allows us to study DIS at strong coupling. Two possibilities are examined, a purely conformal model, and a model with a hard-wall cutoff introduced to take into account the effects of confinement. Comparing our calculations with HERA DIS data, we find a very good agreement not only at large $Q^2$ dominated by conformal symmetry, but due to our strong coupling approach which allows us to go beyond traditional pQCD methods, at small $Q^2$ as well, taking into account all available HERA small x data.
