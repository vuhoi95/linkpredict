Title: Wormholes in de Sitter branes
Authors: C. Molina and J. C. S. Neves
Abstract: In this work we present a class of geometries which describes wormholes in a Randall-Sundrum brane model, focusing on de Sitter backgrounds. Maximal extensions of the solutions are constructed and their causal structures are discussed. A perturbative analysis is developed, where matter and gravitational perturbations are studied. Analytical results for the quasinormal spectra are obtained and an extensive numerical survey is conducted. Our results indicate that the wormhole geometries presented are stable.
