Title: Nonrelativistic conformal groups and their dynamical realizations
Authors: K. Andrzejewski and J. Gonera and P. Maslanka
Abstract: Nonrelativistic conformal groups, indexed by l=N/2, are analyzed. Under the assumption that the "mass" parametrizing the central extension is nonvanishing the coadjoint orbits are classified and described in terms of convenient variables. It is shown that the corresponding dynamical system describes, within Ostrogradski framework, the nonrelativistic particle obeying (N+1)-th order equation of motion. As a special case, the Schroedinger group and the standard Newton equations are obtained for N=1 (l=1/2).
