Title: Non-Minimal Chaotic Inflation, Peccei-Quinn Phase Transition and  non-Thermal Leptogenesis
Authors: C. Pallis and Q. Shafi
Abstract: We consider a phenomenological extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) which incorporates non-minimal chaotic inflation, driven by a quadratic potential in conjunction with a linear term in the frame function. Inflation is followed by a Peccei-Quinn phase transition, based on renormalizable superpotential terms, which resolves the strong CP and mu problems of MSSM and provide masses lower than about 10^12 GeV for the right-handed (RH) (s)neutrinos. Baryogenesis occurs via non-thermal leptogenesis, realized by the out-of-equilibrium decay of the RH sneutrinos which are produced by the inflaton's decay. Confronting our scenario with the current observational data on the inflationary observables, the light neutrino masses, the baryon asymmetry of the universe and the gravitino limit on the reheat temperature, we constrain the strength of the gravitational coupling to rather large values (~45-2950) and the Dirac neutrino masses to values between about 1 and 10 GeV.
