Title: The Conformal Anomaly of M5-Branes
Authors: Travis Maxfield and Savdeep Sethi
Abstract: We show that the conformal anomaly for N M5-branes grows like $N^3$. The method we employ relates Coulomb branch interactions in six dimensions to interactions in four dimensions using supersymmetry. This leads to a relation between the six-dimensional conformal anomaly and the conformal anomaly of N=4 Yang-Mills. Along the way, we determine the structure of the four derivative interactions for the toroidally compactified (2,0) theory, while encountering interesting novelties in the structure of the six derivative interactions.
