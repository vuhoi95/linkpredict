Title: Cosmological New Massive Gravity and Galilean Conformal Algebra in  2-dimensions
Authors: M. R. Setare and V. Kamali
Abstract: In the present paper we consider the realization of $2-$dimensional Galilean conformal algebra ($GCA_2$) on the boundary of cosmological new massive gravity. At first we consider the contracted BTZ black hole solution. We obtain entropy formula for the $GCA_2$ in term of contracted scaling dimension $\Delta$ and central charge $C_1$. This entropy formula exactly matches with the non-relativistic limit of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of BTZ black hole. Then we extend our study to the contracted warped $AdS_3$ black hole solution of CNMG. We obtain the entropy of dual $GCA_2$ in terms of central charges and finite temperatures, $T_1, T_2$. Again this expression coincides with the non-relativistic limit of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula of warped $AdS_3$ black hole.
