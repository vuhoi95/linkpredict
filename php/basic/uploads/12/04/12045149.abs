Title: Extremal Sasakian horizons
Authors: Hari K. Kunduri and James Lucietti
Abstract: We point out a simple construction of an infinite class of Einstein near-horizon geometries in all odd dimensions greater than five. Cross-sections of the horizons are inhomogeneous Sasakian metrics (but not Einstein) on S^3xS^2 and more generally on Lens space bundles over any compact positive Kaehler-Einstein manifold. They are all consistent with the known topology and symmetry constraints for asymptotically flat or globally AdS black holes.
