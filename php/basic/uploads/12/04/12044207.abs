Title: On Soft Limits of Inflationary Correlation Functions
Authors: Valentin Assassi and Daniel Baumann and Daniel Green
Abstract: Soft limits of inflationary correlation functions are both observationally relevant and theoretically robust. Various theorems can be proven about them that are insensitive to detailed model-building assumptions. In this paper, we re-derive several of these theorems in a universal way. Our method makes manifest why soft limits are such an interesting probe of the spectrum of additional light fields during inflation. We illustrate these abstract results with a detailed case study of the soft limits of quasi-single-field inflation.
