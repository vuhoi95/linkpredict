Abstract: We present a study of the physical properties of the vibrational excitation in $\alpha$--helicoidal macromolecular chains, caused by the interaction with acoustical and optical phonon modes. The influence of the temperature and the basic system parameters on the vibron dressing has been analyzed by employing the simple mean--field approach based on the variational extension of the Lang--Firsov unitary transformation. Applied approach predicts a region in system parameter space where one takes place an abrupt transition from partially dressed (light and mobile) to fully dressed (immobile) vibron states. We found that the boundary of this region depends on system temperature and type of bond among structural elements in the macromolecular chain.
