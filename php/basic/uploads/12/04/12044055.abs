Title: Global behavior of cosmological dynamics with interacting Veneziano  ghost
Authors: Chao-Jun Feng and Xin-Zhou Li and Ping Xi
Abstract: In this paper, we shall study the dynamical behavior of the universe accelerated by the so called Veneziano ghost dark energy component locally and globally by using the linearization and nullcline method developed in this paper. The energy density is generalized to be proportional to the Hawking temperature defined on the trapping horizon instead of Hubble horizon of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe. We also give a prediction of the fate of the universe and present the bifurcation phenomenon of the dynamical system of the universe. It seems that the universe could be dominated by dark energy at present in some region of the parameter space.
