Title: Statistical Mechanics of an Ideal Gas of Non-Abelian Anyons
Authors: Francesco Mancarella and Andrea Trombettoni and Giuseppe Mussardo
Abstract: We study the thermodynamical properties of an ideal gas of non-Abelian Chern-Simons particles and we compute the second virial coefficient, considering the effect of general soft-core boundary conditions for the two-body wavefunction at zero distance. The behaviour of the second virial coefficient is studied as a function of the Chern-Simons coupling, the isospin quantum number and the hard-coreness parameters. Expressions for the main thermodynamical quantities at the lower order of the virial expansion are also obtained: we find that at this order the relation between the internal energy and the pressure is the same found (exactly) for 2D Bose and Fermi ideal gases. A discussion of the comparison of obtained findings with available results in literature for systems of hard-core non-Abelian Chern-Simons particles is also supplied.
