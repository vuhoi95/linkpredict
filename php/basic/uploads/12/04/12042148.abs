Title: Moduli Spaces of Instantons on Toric Noncommutative Manifolds
Authors: Simon Brain and Giovanni Landi and Walter D. van Suijlekom
Abstract: We study analytic aspects of U(n) gauge theory over a toric noncommutative manifold $M_\theta$. We analyse moduli spaces of solutions to the self-dual Yang-Mills equations on U(2) vector bundles over four-manifolds $M_\theta$, showing that each such moduli space is either empty or a smooth Hausdorff manifold whose dimension we explicitly compute. In the special case of the four-sphere $S^4_\theta$ we find that the moduli space of U(2) instantons with fixed second Chern number $k$ is a smooth manifold of dimension $8k-3$.
