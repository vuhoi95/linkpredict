Title: The CPT theorem
Authors: Hilary Greaves and Teruji Thomas
Abstract: We provide a rigorous proof of the CPT theorem within the framework of 'Lagrangian' quantum field theory. This is in contrast to the usual rigorous proofs in purely axiomatic frameworks, and non-rigorous proof-sketches within the Lagrangian framework.
