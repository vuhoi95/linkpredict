Title: Soft Graviton effects on Gauge theories in de Sitter Space
Authors: Hiroyuki Kitamoto and Yoshihisa Kitazawa
Abstract: We extend our investigation of soft graviton effects on the microscopic dynamics of matter fields in de Sitter space. We evaluate the quantum equation of motion in generic gauge theories. We find that the Lorentz invariance can be respected and the velocity of light is not renormalized at the one-loop level. The gauge coupling constant is universally screened by soft gravitons and diminishes with time. These features are in common with other four dimensional field theories with dimensionless couplings. In particular the couplings scale with time with definite scaling exponents. Although individual scaling exponents are gauge dependent, we argue that the relative scaling exponents are gauge independent and should be observable. We also mention soft graviton effects on cosmic microwave background.
