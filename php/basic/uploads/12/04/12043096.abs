Title: Matching three-point functions of BMN operators at weak and strong  coupling
Authors: Gianluca Grignani and A. V. Zayakin
Abstract: The agreement between string theory and field theory is demonstrated in the leading order by providing the first calculation of the correlator of three two-impurity BMN states with all non-zero momenta. The calculation is performed in two completely independent ways: in field theory by using the large-$N$ perturbative expansion, up to the terms subleading in finite-size, and in string theory by using the Dobashi-Yoneya 3-string vertex in the leading order of the Penrose expansion. The two results come out to be completely identical.
