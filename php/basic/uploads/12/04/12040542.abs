Title: New superconformal models in six dimensions: Gauge group and  representation structure
Authors: Henning Samtleben and Ergin Sezgin and Robert Wimmer and Linus Wulff
Abstract: We review recent progress in the construction and classification of six-dimensional (1,0) superconformal models with non-abelian tensor fields. Here we solve the generalized Jacobi identities which are required for consistency of the non-abelian vector/tensor gauge system and we present a large class of explicit examples.
