Title: A Klein Gordon Particle Captured by Embedded Curves
Authors: Burak Tevfik Kaynak and O. Teoman Turgut
Abstract: In the present work, a Klein Gordon particle with singular interactions supported on embedded curves on Riemannian manifolds is discussed from a more direct and physical perspective, via the heat kernel approach. It is shown that the renormalized problem is well-defined, and the ground state energy is unique and finite. The renormalization group invariance of the model is discussed, and it is observed that the model is asymptotically free.
