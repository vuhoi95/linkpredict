Title: Fast Scramblers, Horizons and Expander Graphs
Authors: Jose L. F. Barbon and Javier M. Magan
Abstract: We propose that local quantum systems defined on expander graphs provide a simple microscopic model for thermalization on quantum horizons. Such systems are automatically fast scramblers and are motivated from the membrane paradigm by a conformal transformation to the so-called optical metric.
