Title: A note on the hidden conformal structure of non-extremal black holes
Authors: Tomás Ortín and C. S. Shahbazi
Abstract: We study, following Bertini et al. \cite{Bertini:2011ga}, the hidden conformal symmetry of the massless Klein-Gordon equation in the background of the general, charged, spherically symmetric, static black-hole solution of a class of d-dimensional Lagrangians which includes the relevant parts of the bosonic Lagrangian of any ungauged supergravity. We find that a hidden SL(2,\mathbb{R}) symmetry appears at the near event and Cauchy-horizon limit.
