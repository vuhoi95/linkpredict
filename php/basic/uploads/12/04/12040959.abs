Title: Magnetohydrodynamics from gravity
Authors: Cheng-Yong Zhang and Yi Ling and Chao Niu and Yu Tian and Xiao-Ning Wu
Abstract: Imposing the Petrov-like boundary condition on the hypersurface at finite cutoff, we derive the hydrodynamic equation on the hypersurface from the bulk Einstein equation with electromagnetic field in the near horizon limit. We first get the general framework for spacetime with matter field, and then derive the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for black holes with electric charge and magnetic charge respectively. Especially, in the magnetic case, the standard magnetohydrodynamic equations will arise due to the existence of the background electromagnetic field on the hypersurface.
