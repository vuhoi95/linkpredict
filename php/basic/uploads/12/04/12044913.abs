Title: Walking near a Conformal Fixed Point: the 2-d O(3) Model at theta near  pi as a Test Case
Authors: Philippe de Forcrand and Michele Pepe and Uwe-Jens Wiese
Abstract: Slowly walking technicolor models provide a mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking whose nonperturbative lattice investigation is rather challenging. Here we demonstrate walking near a conformal fixed point considering the 2-d lattice O(3) model at vacuum angle $\theta \approx \pi$. The essential features of walking technicolor models are shared by this toy model and can be accurately investigated by numerical simulations. We show results for the running coupling and the beta-function and we perform a finite size scaling analysis of the massgap close to the conformal point.
