Title: The Structure of the Non-SUSY Baryonic Branch of Klebanov-Strassler
Authors: Stephen Bennett and Daniel Schofield
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional space of supergravity solutions corresponding to non-supersymmetric deformations of the baryonic branch of Klebanov-Strassler. By combining analytical methods with a numerical survey of the parameter space, we find that this solution space includes as limits the softly-broken N=1 solutions of Gubser et al. and those of Dymarsky and Kuperstein. We also identify a one-dimensional family of solutions corresponding to a natural non-supersymmetric generalisation of Klebanov-Strassler, and one corresponding to the limit in which supersymmetry is completely absent, even in the far UV. For almost all of the parameter space we find indications that much of the structure of the supersymmetric baryonic branch survives.
