Title: 3-loop 3PI effective action for 3D SU(3) QCD
Authors: Mark C. Abraao York and Guy D. Moore and Marcus Tassler
Abstract: The 3PI method is a technique to resum an infinite class of diagrams, which may be useful in studying nonperturbative thermodynamics and dynamics in quantum field theory. But it has never been successfully applied to gauge theories, where there are serious questions about gauge invariance breaking. We show how to perform the 3PI resummation of QCD in 3 Euclidean spacetime dimensions, a warmup problem to the 4 or 3+1 dimensional case. We present the complete details of the technical problems and how they are overcome. We postpone a comparison of gauge invariant correlation functions with their lattice-determined counterparts to a future publication.
