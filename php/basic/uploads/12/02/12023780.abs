Abstract: In the N=1 four-dimensional new-minimal supergravity framework, we supersymmetrise the coupling of the scalar kinetic term to the Einstein tensor. This coupling, although introduces a non-minimal derivative interaction of curvature to matter, it does not introduce harmful higher-derivatives. For this construction, we employ off-shell chiral and real linear multiplets. Physical scalars are accommodated in the chiral multiplet whereas curvature resides in a linear one.
