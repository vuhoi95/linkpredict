Title: A Massive Non-Abelian Vector Model
Authors: F. A. Chishtie and D. G. C. McKeon
Abstract: The introduction of a Lagrange multiplier field to ensure that the classical equations of motion are satisfied serves to restrict radiative corrections in a model to being only one loop. The consequences of this for a massive non-Abelian vector model are considered.
