Title: A no-hair theorem for the galileon
Authors: Lam Hui and Alberto Nicolis
Abstract: We consider a galileon field coupled to gravity. The standard no-hair theorems do not apply, because of the galileon's peculiar derivative interactions. We prove that, nonetheless, static spherically symmetric black holes cannot sustain non-trivial galileon profiles. Our theorem holds regardless of whether there are non-minimal couplings between the galileon and gravity of the covariant galileon type.
