Abstract: We consider some aspects of nonlocal modified gravity, where nonlocality is of the type $R \mathcal{F}(\Box) R$. In particular, using ansatz of the form $\Box R = c R^\gamma,$ we find a few $R(t)$ solutions for the spatially flat FLRW metric. There are singular and nonsingular bounce solutions. For late cosmic time, scalar curvature R(t) is in low regime and scale factor a(t) is decelerated. R (t) = 0 satisfies all equations when k = -1.
