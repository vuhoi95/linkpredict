Title: Simultaneous expansion and rotation of shear-free universes in modified  gravity
Authors: Amare Abebe and Rituparno Goswami and Peter K. S. Dunsby
Abstract: We show in a fully covariant way that, there exist a class of $f(R)$ models for which a shear-free, almost FLRW universe can expand and rotate at the same time .
