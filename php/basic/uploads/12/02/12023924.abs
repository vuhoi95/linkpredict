Title: On Classical Equivalence Between Noncritical and Einstein Gravity : The  AdS/CFT Perspectives
Authors: Seungjoon Hyun and Wooje Jang and Jaehoon Jeong and Sang-Heon Yi
Abstract: We find that noncritical gravity, a special class of higher derivative gravity, is classically equivalent to Einstein gravity at the full nonlinear level. We obtain the viscosity-to-entropy ratio and the second order transport coefficients of the dual fluid of noncritical gravity to all orders in the coupling of higher derivative terms. We also compute the holographic entanglement entropy in the dual CFT of noncritical gravity. All these results confirm the nonlinear equivalence between noncritical gravity and Einstein gravity at the classical level.
