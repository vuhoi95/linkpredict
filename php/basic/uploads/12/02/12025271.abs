Title: Holographic Higgs Phases
Authors: Moshe Rozali and Darren Smyth and Evgeny Sorkin
Abstract: We discuss phases of gauge theories in the holographic context, and formulate a criterion for the existence of a Higgs phase, where the gauge redundancy is "spontaneously broken", in purely bulk language. This condition, the existence of a finite tension solitonic string representing a narrow magnetic flux tube, is necessary for a bulk theory to be interpreted as a Higgs phase of a boundary gauge theory. We demonstrate the existence of such solitons in both top-down and bottom-up examples of holographic theories. In particular, we numerically construct new solitonic solutions in AdS black hole background, for various values of the boundary gauge coupling, which are used to demonstrate that the bulk theory models a superconductor, rather than a superfluid. The criterion we find is expected to be useful in finding holographic duals of color superconducting phases of gauge theories at finite density.
