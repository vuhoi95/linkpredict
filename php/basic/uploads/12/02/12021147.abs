Abstract: We consider $f(T)$ gravity for a Weitzenbock spherically symmetric and static spacetime, where the metric is projected in the tangent space to the manifold for a set of non-diagonal tetrads. The matter content is coupled through the energy momentum tensor of an anisotropic fluid, generating various classes of new black hole and wormhole solutions. One of these classes is that of cold black holes. We also perform the reconstruction scheme of the algebraic function $f(T)$ for two cases where the radial pressure is proportional to $f(T)$ and its first derivative.
