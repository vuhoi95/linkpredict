Title: Deformations of Lifshitz Holography in $(n+1)$-dimensions
Authors: Miok Park and Robert B. Mann
Abstract: We investigate deformations of Lifshitz holography in $(n+1)$ dimensional spacetime. After discussing the situation for general Lifshitz scaling symmetry parameter $z$, we consider $z=n-1$ and the associated marginally relevant operators. These operators are dynamically generated by a momentum scale $\Lambda \sim 0$ and correspond to slightly deformed Lifshitz spacetimes via a holographic picture. We obtain renormalization group flow at finite temperature from UV Lifshitz to IR AdS, and evaluate how physical quantities such as the free energy density and the energy density depend on $\log(\Lambda^z/T)$ in the quantum critical regime as $\Lambda^z/T \rightarrow 0$.
