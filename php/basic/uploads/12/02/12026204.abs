Title: Cosmological braneworld solutions with bulk scalar field in DGP setup
Authors: Kourosh Nozari and M. Khamesian and N. Rashidi
Abstract: We study cosmological dynamics of a canonical bulk scalar field in the DGP setup within a superpotential approach. We show that the normal branch of this DGP-inspired model realizes a late-time de Sitter expansion on the brane. We extend this study to the case that the bulk contains a phantom scalar field. Our detailed study in the supergravity-style analysis reveals some yet unexplored aspects of cosmological dynamics of bulk scalar field in the normal DGP setup. Some clarifying examples along with numerical analysis of the model parameter space are presented in each case.
