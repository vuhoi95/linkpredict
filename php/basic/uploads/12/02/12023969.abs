Title: Reduction of Lie-Jordan Banach algebras and quantum states
Authors: F. Falceto and L. Ferro and A. Ibort and G. Marmo
Abstract: A theory of reduction of Lie-Jordan Banach algebras with respect to either a Jordan ideal or a Lie-Jordan subalgebra is presented. This theory is compared with the standard reduction of C*-algebras of observables of a quantum system in the presence of quantum constraints. It is shown that the later corresponds to the particular instance of the reduction of Lie-Jordan Banach algebras with respect to a Lie-Jordan subalgebra as described in this paper. The space of states of the reduced Lie-Jordan Banach algebras is described in terms of equivalence classes of extensions to the full algebra and their GNS representations are characterized in the same way. A few simple examples are discussed that illustrates some of the main results.
