Title: OPE in planar QCD from integrability
Authors: Changrim Ahn and Omar Foda and Rafael I. Nepomechie
Abstract: We consider the operator product expansion of local single-trace operators composed of the self-dual components of the field strength tensor in planar QCD. Using the integrability of the one-loop matrix of anomalous dimensions of such operators, we obtain a determinant expression for certain tree-level structure constants in the OPE.
