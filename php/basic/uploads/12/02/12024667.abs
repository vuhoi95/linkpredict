Title: On the Relativistic Micro-Canonical Ensemble and Relativistic Kinetic  Theory for N Relativistic Particles in Inertial and Non-Inertial Rest Frames
Authors: David Alba and Horace W. Crater and Luca Lusanna
Abstract: A new formulation of relativistic classical mechanics allows a revisiting of old unsolved problems in relativistic kinetic theory and in relativistic statistical mechanics. In particular a definition of the relativistic micro-canonical partition function is given strictly in terms of the Poincar\'e generators of an interacting N-particle system both in the inertial and non-inertial rest frames. The non-relativistic limit allows a definition of both the inertial and non-inertial micro-canonical ensemble strictly in terms of the Galilei generators. Also the one-particle relativistic distribution function is defined and a new approach to the relativistic Boltzmann equation is delineated. Finally there are some comments on relativistic dissipative fluids.
