Title: Poisson 2-groups
Authors: Zhuo Chen and Mathieu Stienon and Ping Xu
Abstract: We prove a 2-categorical analogue of a classical result of Drinfeld: there is a one-to-one correspondence between connected, simply-connected Poisson Lie 2-groups and Lie 2-bialgebras. In fact, we also prove that there is a one-to-one correspondence between connected, simply connected quasi-Poisson 2-groups and quasi-Lie 2-bialgebras. Our approach relies on a "universal lifting theorem" for Lie 2-groups: an isomorphism between the graded Lie algebras of multiplicative polyvector fields on the Lie 2-group on one hand and of polydifferentials on the corresponding Lie 2-algebra on the other hand.
