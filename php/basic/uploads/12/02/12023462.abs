Abstract: The effective Lagrangian for \eta' incorporating the effect of the QCD \theta-angle has been developed previously. We revisit this Lagrangian and carry out its canonical quantization with particular attention to the test function spaces of constraints and the topology of the \eta'-field. In this way, we discover a new chirally symmetric coupling of this field to chiral multiplets which involves in particular fermions. This coupling violates P and T symmetries. In a subsequent paper, we will evaluate its contribution to the electric dipole moment (EDM) of fermions. Our motivation is to test whether the use of mixed states restores P and T invariance, so that EDM vanishes. This calculation will be shown to have striking new physical consequences.
