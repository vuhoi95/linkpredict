Title: Neutrino oscillations in the field of a rotating deformed mass
Authors: Andrea Geralico and Orlando Luongo
Abstract: The neutrino oscillations in the field of a rotating deformed mass is investigated. The phase shift is evaluated in the case of weak field limit, slow rotation and small deformation. To this aim the Hartle-Thorne metric is used, which is an approximate solution of the vacuum Einstein equations accurate to second order in the rotation parameter $a/M$ and to first order in the mass quadrupole moment $q$. Implications on atmospheric, solar and astrophysical neutrinos are discussed.
