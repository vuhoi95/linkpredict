Title: Graphene tests of Klein phenomena
Authors: Stefano De Leo and Pietro Rotelli
Abstract: Graphene is characterized by chiral electronic excitations. As such it provides a perfect testing ground for the production of Klein pairs (electron/holes). If confirmed, the standard results for barrier phenomena must be reconsidered with, as a byproduct, the accumulation within the barrier of holes.
