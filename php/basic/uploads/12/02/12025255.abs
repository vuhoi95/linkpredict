Title: Slinky evolution of domain wall brane cosmology
Authors: Avihay Kadosh and Aharon Davidson and Elisabetta Pallante
Abstract: Invoking an initial symmetry between the time $ t $ and some extra spatial dimension $ y $, we discuss a novel scenario where the dynamical formation of the 4-dim brane and its cosmological evolution are induced simultaneously by a common $ t<->y $ symmetry breaking mechanism. The local maximum of the underlying scalar potential is mapped onto a 'watershed' curve in the $ (t,y) $ plane; the direction tangent to this curve is identified as the cosmic time, whereas the perpendicular direction serves locally as the extra spatial dimension. Special attention is devoted to the so-called slinky configurations, whose brane cosmology is characterized by a decaying cosmological constant along the watershed curve. Such a slinky solution is first constructed within a simplified case where the watershed is constrained by $ y = 0 $. The physical requirements for a slinky configuration to generate a realistic model of cosmological evolution are then discussed in a more elaborated framework.
