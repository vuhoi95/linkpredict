Abstract: Renormalizability of the (minimal) single-fermion QED extension is investigated at all orders of perturbation theory in the framework of algebraic renormalization, a regularization-independent method. Relative to the standard QED, new structures that could lead to gauge anomalies are identified. Nevertheless, even if the anomaly coefficients fail to vanish in the general case, they shall be absent provided we require invariance of the action under C and/or PT transformations. Stability is also verified in this case, hence full renormalizability is attained.
