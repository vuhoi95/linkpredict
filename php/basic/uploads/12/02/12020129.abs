Title: Thick Brane Split Caused by Spacetime Torsion
Authors: Jie Yang and Yun-Liang Li and Yuan Zhong and Yang Li
Abstract: In this paper we apply the five-dimensional $f(T)$ gravity with $f(T)=T+k T^n$ to brane scenario to explore the solutions under a given warp factor, and we find that the analytic domain wall solution will be a double-kink solution when the geometric effect of spacetime torsion is strongly enhanced. We also investigate the localization of fermion fields on the split branes corresponding to the double-kink solution.
