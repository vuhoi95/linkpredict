Title: On bouncing solutions in non-local gravity
Authors: Alexey S. Koshelev and Sergey Yu. Vernov
Abstract: A non-local modified gravity model with an analytic function of the d'Alembert operator is considered. This model has been recently proposed as a possible way of resolving the singularities problem in cosmology. We present an exact bouncing solution, which is simpler compared to the already known one in this model in the sense it does not require an additional matter to satisfy all the gravitational equations.
