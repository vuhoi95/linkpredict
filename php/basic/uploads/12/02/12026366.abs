Title: Asymmetric Orbifolds, Non-Geometric Fluxes and Non-Commutativity in  Closed String Theory
Authors: Cezar Condeescu and Ioannis Florakis and Dieter Lust
Abstract: In this paper we consider a class of exactly solvable closed string flux backgrounds that exhibit non-commutativity in the closed string coordinates. They are realized in terms of freely-acting asymmetric Z_N-orbifolds, which are themselves close relatives of twisted torus fibrations with elliptic Z_N-monodromy (elliptic T-folds). We explicitly construct the modular invariant partition function of the models and derive the non-commutative algebra in the string coordinates, which is exact to all orders in {\alpha}'. Finally, we relate these asymmetric orbifold spaces to inherently stringy Scherk-Schwarz backgrounds and non-geometric fluxes.
