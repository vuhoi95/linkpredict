Title: Interpreting LHC Higgs Results from Natural New Physics Perspective
Authors: Dean Carmi and Adam Falkowski and Eric Kuflik and Tomer Volansky
Abstract: We analyze the 2011 LHC Higgs data in the context of simplified new physics models addressing the naturalness problem. These models are expected to contain new particles with sizable couplings to the Higgs boson, which can easily modify the Higgs production cross sections and branching fractions. We focus on searches in the Higgs to 4 leptons and Higgs to diphoton channels, in the latter case including the vector boson fusion production mode. Combining the available ATLAS and CMS data in these channels, we derive constraints on an effective low-energy theory of the Higgs boson. We then map several simplified scenarios to the effective theory, capturing numerous natural new physics models such as supersymmetry and Little Higgs, and extract the constraints on the corresponding parameter space. We show that simple models where one fermionic or one scalar partner is responsible for stabilizing the Higgs potential are already constrained in a non-trivial way by LHC Higgs data.
