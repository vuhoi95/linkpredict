Title: A Comparative Note on Tunneling in AdS and in its Boundary Matrix Dual
Authors: B. Chandrasekhar and Sudipta Mukherji and Anurag Sahay and Swarnendu Sarkar
Abstract: For charged black hole, within the grand canonical ensemble, the decay rate from thermal AdS to the black hole at a fixed high temperature increases with the chemical potential. We check that this feature is well captured by a phenomenological matrix model expected to describe its strongly coupled dual. This comparison is made by explicitly constructing the kink and bounce solutions around the de-confinement transition and evaluating the matrix model effective potential on the solutions.
