Title: Hawking radiation in dispersive theories, the two regimes
Authors: Stefano Finazzi and Renaud Parentani
Abstract: We compute the black hole radiation spectrum in the presence of high-frequency dispersion in a large set of situations. In all cases, the spectrum diverges like the inverse of the Killing frequency. When studying the low-frequency spectrum, we find only two regimes: an adiabatic one where the corrections with respect to the standard temperature are small, and an abrupt one regulated by dispersion, in which the near-horizon metric can be replaced by step functions. The transition from one regime to the other is governed by a single parameter which also governs the net redshift undergone by dispersive modes. These results can be used to characterize the quasiparticles spectrum of recent and future experiments aiming to detect the analogue Hawking radiation. They also apply to theories of quantum gravity which violate Lorentz invariance.
