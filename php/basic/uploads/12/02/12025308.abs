Title: A quantum electron star
Authors: Andrea Allais and John McGreevy and S. Josephine Suh
Abstract: We construct and probe a holographic description of state of matter which results from coupling a Fermi liquid to a relativistic conformal field theory (CFT). The bulk solution is described by a quantum gas of fermions supported from collapse into the gravitational well of AdS by their own electrostatic repulsion. In the probe limit studied here, the Landau quasiparticles survive this coupling to a CFT.
