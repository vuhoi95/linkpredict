Title: Localization of fermions in different domain wall models
Authors: Oscar Castillo-Felisola and Ivan Schmidt
Abstract: Localization of fermions is studied in different gravitational domain wall models. These are generalizations of the brane-world models considered by Randall and Sundrum, but which also allow gravitational localization. Therefore, they might be considered as possible realistic scenarios for phenomenology.
