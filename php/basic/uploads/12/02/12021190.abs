Title: Gauge and Poincare' Invariant Regularization and Hopf Symmetries
Authors: Fedele Lizzi and Patrizia Vitale
Abstract: We consider the regularization of a gauge quantum field theory following a modification of the Polchinski proof based on the introduction of a cutoff function. We work with a Poincare' invariant deformation of the ordinary point-wise product of fields introduced by Ardalan, Arfaei, Ghasemkhani and Sadooghi, and show that it yields, through a limiting procedure of the cutoff functions, to a regularized theory, preserving all symmetries at every stage. The new gauge symmetry yields a new Hopf algebra with deformed co-structures, which is inequivalent to the standard one.
