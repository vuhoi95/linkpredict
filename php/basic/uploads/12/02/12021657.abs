Title: A Chiral SU(N) Gauge Theory Planar Equivalent to Super-Yang-Mills
Authors: A. Armoni and M. Shifman
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of a strongly coupled SU(N) chiral gauge theory. By using its large-N equivalence with N=1 super-Yang-Mills theory we find the vacuum structure of the former. We also consider its finite-N dynamics.
