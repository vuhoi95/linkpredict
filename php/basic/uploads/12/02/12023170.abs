Title: Generalised Geometry and type II Supergravity
Authors: Andr√© Coimbra and Charles Strickland-Constable and Daniel Waldram
Abstract: Ten-dimensional type II supergravity can be reformulated as a generalised geometrical analogue of Einstein gravity, defined by an $O(9,1)\times O(1,9)\subset O(10,10)\times\mathbb{R}^+$ structure on the generalised tangent space. To leading order in the fermion fields, this allow one to rewrite the action, equations of motion and supersymmetry variations in a simple, manifestly $Spin(9,1)\times Spin(1,9)$-covariant form.
