Title: Black holes production in self-complete quantum gravity
Authors: Euro Spallucci and Anais Smailagic
Abstract: A regular black hole model, which has been proposed by Hayward, is reconsidered in the framework of higher dimensional TeV unification and self-complete quantum gravity scenario (Dvali, Spallucci). We point out the "quantum" nature of these objects and compute their cross section production by taking into account the key role played by the existence of a "minimal length" l_0. We show as the threshold energy is related to l_0. We recover, in the high energy limit, the standard "black-disk" form of the cross section, while it vanishes, below threshold, faster than any power of the invariant mass-energy \sqrt{-s}.
