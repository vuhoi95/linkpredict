Title: Generalized parton distributions in an AdS/QCD hard-wall model
Authors: Alfredo Vega and Ivan Schmidt and Thomas Gutsche and Valery E. Lyubovitskij
Abstract: We use a matching procedure of sum rules relating the electromagnetic form factors to generalized parton distributions (GPDs) and AdS modes. In this way, in the framework of an AdS/QCD hard-wall model, the helicity-independent GPDs of quarks for the nucleon in the zero skewness case are calculated.
