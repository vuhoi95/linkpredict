Abstract: We present NS1+NS5-brane solutions of heterotic supergravity on curved geometries. They interpolate between a near horizon AdS3 x X^k x T^{7-k} region and R^{1,1} x c(X^k) x T^{7-k}, where X^k (with k = 3,5,6,7) is a k-dimensional geometric Killing spinor manifold, c(X^k) its Ricci-flat cone and T^{7-k} a (7-k)-torus. The solutions require first order alpha'-corrections to the field equations, and special point-like instantons play an important role, whose singular support is a calibrated submanifold wrapped by the NS5-brane. It is also possible to add a gauge anti-5-brane. We determine the super isometries of the near horizon geometry which are supposed to appear as symmetries of the holographically dual two-dimensional conformal field theory.
