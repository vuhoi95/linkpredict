Abstract: The Julia-Toulouse mechanism is used to show that the topological Abelian BF term may be induced by the condensation of electric charges. As an application we discuss the subtle question of including consistently magnetic defects into the Maxwell-BF theory in a way to avoid the usual problems of current conservation, charge quantization, Elitzur's theorem violation and the reality of the Dirac brane, produced by the non-minimal coupling. We also discuss a new way of obtaining the Dirac's veto, which is based on the so-called Dirac brane symmetry.
