Title: Absence of Three-Loop Four-Point Divergences in N=4 Supergravity
Authors: Zvi Bern and Scott Davies and Tristan Dennen and Yu-tin Huang
Abstract: We compute the coefficient of the potential three-loop divergence in pure N=4 supergravity and show that it vanishes, contrary to expectations from symmetry arguments. The recently uncovered duality between color and kinematics is used to greatly streamline the calculation. We comment on all-loop cancellations hinting at further surprises awaiting discovery at higher loops.
