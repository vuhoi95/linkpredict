Title: Latest Observational Constraints to the Ghost Dark Energy Model by Using  Markov Chain Monte Carlo Approach
Authors: Chao-Jun Feng and Xin-Zhou Li and Xian-Yong Shen
Abstract: Recently, the vacuum energy of the QCD ghost in a time-dependent background is proposed as a kind of dark energy candidate to explain the acceleration of the universe. In this model, the energy density of the dark energy is proportional to the Hubble parameter $H$, which is the Hawking temperature on the Hubble horizon of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe. In this paper, we perform a constraint on the ghost dark energy model with and without bulk viscosity, by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and the combined latest observational data from the type Ia supernova compilations including Union2.1(580) and Union2(557), cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillation, and the observational Hubble parameter data.
