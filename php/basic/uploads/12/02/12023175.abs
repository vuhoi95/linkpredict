Title: Noncanonical Phase-Space Noncommutative Black Holes
Authors: Catarina Bastos and Orfeu Bertolami and Nuno Dias and Jo√£o Prata
Abstract: In this contribution we present a noncanonical phase-space noncommutative (NC) extension of a Kantowski Sachs (KS) cosmological model to describe the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole (BH). We evaluate the thermodynamical quantities inside this NC Schwarzschild BH and compare with the well known quantities. We find that for a NCBH the temperature and entropy have the same mass dependence as the Hawking quantities for a Schwarzschild BH.
