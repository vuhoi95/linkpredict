Title: Thermodynamics of phantom Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS black hole
Authors: Deborah F. Jardim and Manuel E. Rodrigues and M. J. S. Houndjo
Abstract: We obtain a new solution of the Einstein-anti-Maxwell theory with cosmological constant, called anti-Reissner-Nordstrom-(A)de Sitter (anti-RN-(A)dS) solution. The basic properties of this solution is reviewed. Its thermodynamics is consistently established, with the extreme cases and phase transitions, where the analysis is performed through two methods, the usual one and that of Geometrothermodynamics . The Geometrothermodynamics analysis does not provide a result in agreement with the usual method or by the specific heat. We establish local and global thermodynamic stabilities of anti-RN-AdS solution through the specific heat and the canonical and grand-canonical ensembles.
