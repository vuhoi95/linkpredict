Title: Model of an exotic chiral superconducting phase in a graphene bilayer
Authors: Mir Vahid Hosseini and Malek Zareyan
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate the formation of a new type of unconventional superconductivity in graphene materials, which exhibits gapless property. The studied superconductivity is based on an interlayer pairing of chiral electrons in bilayer graphene, which results in an exotic s-wave spin-triplet condensate order with anomalous thermodynamic properties. These include the possibility of a temperature induced condensation causing an increase of the pairing gap with increasing temperature, and an entropy of the stable superconducting state which can be higher than its value in the normal state. Our study reveals the analogy of the interlayer superconductivity in graphene materials to the color superconductivity in dense quark matter and the gapless pairing states in nuclear matter and ultra-cold atomic gases.
