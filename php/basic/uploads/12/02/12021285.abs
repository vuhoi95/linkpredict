Title: Higgs Boson in RG running Inflationary Cosmology
Authors: Yi-Fu Cai and Damien A. Easson
Abstract: An intriguing hypothesis is that gravity may be non-perturbatively renormalizable via the notion of asymptotic safety. We show that the Higgs sector of the SM minimally coupled to asymptotically safe gravity can generate the observed near scale-invariant spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background through the curvaton mechanism. The resulting primordial power spectrum places an upper bound on the Higgs mass, which for finely tuned values of the curvaton parameters, is compatible with the recently released Large Hadron Collider data.
