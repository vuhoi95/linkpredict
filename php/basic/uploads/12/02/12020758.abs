Title: The Impact of Fluctuations on QCD Matter
Authors: Tina Katharina Herbst and Jan M. Pawlowski and Bernd-Jochen Schaefer
Abstract: We study the effect of quantum and thermal fluctuations as well as the mass dependence of the phase structure of QCD at finite temperature and density within a dynamical Polyakov-loop--extended quark-meson model. The glue dynamics is simulated by the Polyakov-loop potential, also including the back-coupling of the matter sector to the glue dynamics. In the chiral limit, the chiral phase transition at large chemical potential and low temperature splits into two transition branches. For non-vanishing pion masses the chiral transition at small chemical potential changes from a phase transition to a crossover. We close with a discussion of a systematical improvement of the current model towards full QCD.
