Title: Lagrangian Distributions and Connections in Symplectic Geometry
Authors: Michael Forger and Sandra Z. Yepes
Abstract: We discuss the interplay between lagrangian distributions and connections in symplectic geometry, beginning with the traditional case of symplectic manifolds and then passing to the more general context of poly- and multisymplectic structures on fiber bundles, which is relevant for the covariant hamiltonian formulation of classical field theory. In particular, we generalize Weinstein's tubular neighborhood theorem for symplectic manifolds carrying a (simple) lagrangian foliation to this situation. In all cases, the Bott connection, or an appropriately extended version thereof, plays a central role.
