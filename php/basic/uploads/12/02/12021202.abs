Title: Solution of the Dyson--Schwinger equation on de Sitter background in IR  limit
Authors: E. T. Akhmedov and Ph. Burda
Abstract: We propose an ansatz which solves the Dyson-Schwinger equation for the real scalar fields in Poincare patch of de Sitter space in the IR limit. The Dyson-Schwinger equation for this ansatz reduces to the kinetic equation, if one considers scalar fields from the principal series. Solving the latter equation we show that under the adiabatic switching on and then off the coupling constant the Bunch-Davies vacuum relaxes in the future infinity to the state with the flat Gibbons-Hawking density of out-Jost harmonics on top of the corresponding de Sitter invariant out-vacuum.
