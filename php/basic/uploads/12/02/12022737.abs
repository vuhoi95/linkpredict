Title: The Energy Loss of a Heavy Quark Moving in a Viscous Fluid
Authors: Navid Abbasi and Ali Davody
Abstract: To study the rate of energy and momentum loss of a heavy quark in QGP, specifically in the hydrodynamic regime, we use fluid/gravity duality and construct a perturbative procedure to find the string solution in gravity side. We show that by this construction the drag force exerted on the quark can be computed perturbatively, order by order in a boundary derivative expansion. At ideal order, our result is just the drag force exerted on a moving quark in thermal plasma with thermodynamics variables promoted to become local functions of space and time. Furthermore, we apply this procedure to a transverse quark in Bjorken flow and compute the first-derivative corrections, namely the viscous corrections, to the drag force.
