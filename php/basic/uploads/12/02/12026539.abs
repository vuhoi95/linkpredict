Title: Dipole Coupling Effect of Holographic Fermion in Charged Dilatonic  Gravity
Authors: Wen-Yu Wen and Shang-Yu Wu
Abstract: In this note, we study the dipole coupling effect of holographic fermion in a charged dilatonic black hole proposed by Gubser and Rocha (arXiv:0911.2898). It is found that the property of Fermi liquid is rigid under perturbation of dipole coupling, and the Fermi momentum is linearly shifted. A gap is dynamically generated as the coupling becomes large enough and the Fermi surface ceases to exist as the bulk dipole coupling further increases.
