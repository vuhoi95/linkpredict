Title: Helical buckling of Skyrme-Faddeev solitons
Authors: David Foster and Derek Harland
Abstract: Solitons in the Skyrme-Faddeev model on R^2xS^1 are shown to undergo buckling transitions as the circumference of the S^1 is varied. These results support a recent conjecture that solitons in this field theory are well-described by a much simpler model of elastic rods.
