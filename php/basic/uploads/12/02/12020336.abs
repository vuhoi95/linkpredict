Title: Generating higher-derivative couplings in N=2 supergravity
Authors: Daniel Butter and Sergei M. Kuzenko
Abstract: Using a recently developed off-shell formulation for general 4D N=2 supergravity-matter systems, we propose a construction to generate higher derivative couplings. We address here mainly the interactions of tensor and vector multiplets, but the construction is quite general. For a certain subclass of terms, the action is naturally written as an integral over 3/4 of the Grassmann coordinates of superspace.
