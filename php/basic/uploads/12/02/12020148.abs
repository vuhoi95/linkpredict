Title: Matter swapping between two braneworlds from the equivalence between  two-brane worlds and noncommutative two-sheeted spacetimes
Authors: Michael Sarrazin and Fabrice Petit
Abstract: It is shown that a two-brane world made of two domain walls can be seen as a noncommutative two-sheeted spacetime under certain assumptions. This equivalence implies a model-independent phenomenology: Matter swapping between the two 3-branes (or sheets) is predicted through fermionic oscillations induced by magnetic vector potentials. This phenomenon, which might be experimentally studied, could reveal the existence of extra dimensions in a new and very affordable way.
