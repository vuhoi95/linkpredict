Title: The improved Gaussian approximation Calculation of Bogoliubov Mode in  One Dimensional Bosonic Gas
Authors: Qiong Li and Daoguang Tu and Dingping Li
Abstract: In this paper, we study the homogeneous one-dimensional bosonic gas interacting via a repulsive contact potential by using the improved Gaussian approximation. We obtain the gapless excitation spectrum of Bogoliubov mode. Our result is in good agreement with the exact numerical calculation based on the Bethe ansatz. We speculate that the improved Gaussian approximation could be a quantitatively good approximation for higher dimensional systems.
