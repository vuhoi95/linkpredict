Authors: Chris Hull and Ulf Lindström and Martin Roček and Rikard von Unge and Maxim Zabzine
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2,2) supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models can be described in (2,2), (2,1) or (1,1) superspaces. Each description emphasizes different aspects of generalized K\"ahler geometry. We investigate the reduction from (2,2) to (2,1) superspace. This has some interesting nontrivial features arising from the elimination of nondynamical fields. We compare quantization in the different superspace formulations.
