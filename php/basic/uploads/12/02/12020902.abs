Title: Topological aspects of generalized Harper operators
Authors: Giuseppe De Nittis and Giovanni Landi
Abstract: A generalized version of the TKNN-equations computing Hall conductances for generalized Dirac-like Harper operators is derived. Geometrically these equations relate Chern numbers of suitable (dual) bundles naturally associated to spectral projections of the operators.
