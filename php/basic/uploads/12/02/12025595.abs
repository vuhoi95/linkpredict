Title: On the BPS Spectrum at the Root of the Higgs Branch
Authors: Nick Dorey and Kirill Petunin
Abstract: We study the BPS spectrum and walls of marginal stability of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric theory in four dimensions with gauge group SU(n) and $n\le N_{f}<2n$ fundamental flavours at the root of the Higgs branch. The strong-coupling spectrum of this theory was conjectured in hep-th/9902134 to coincide with that of the two-dimensional supersymmetric $\mathbb{CP}^{2n-N_{f}-1}$ sigma model. Using the Kontsevich--Soibelman wall-crossing formula, we start with the conjectured strong-coupling spectrum and extrapolate it to all other regions of the moduli space. In the weak-coupling regime, our results precisely agree with the semiclassical analysis of hep-th/9902134: in addition to the usual dyons, quarks, and $W$ bosons, if the complex masses obey a particular inequality, the resulting weak-coupling spectrum includes a tower of bound states consisting of a dyon and one or more quarks. In the special case of $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$-symmetric masses, there are bound states with one quark for odd $n$ and no bound states for even $n$.
