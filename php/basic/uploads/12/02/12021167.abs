Abstract: We study Casimir interactions between cylinders in thermal non-equilibrium, where the objects as well as the environment are held at different temperatures. We provide the general formula for the force, in a one reflection approximation, for cylinders of arbitrary radii and optical properties. As is the case for equilibrium, we find that the force for optically diluted cylinders can be obtained by appropriate summation of the corresponding result for spheres. We find that the non-equilibrium forces are generally larger than their equilibrium counterpart at separations greater than the thermal wavelength. They may also exhibit oscillations as function of separation, leading to stable points of zero net force. These effects are particularly pronounced for thin conducting cylinders (e.g. 40nm diameter nano-wires of tungsten) due to their large emissivity.
