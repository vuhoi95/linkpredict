Title: Resolving anti-brane singularities through time-dependence
Authors: Johan Blåbäck and Ulf H. Danielsson and Thomas Van Riet
Abstract: In this note we discuss a possible resolution of the flux singularities associated with the insertion of branes in backgrounds supported by fluxes that carry charges opposite to the branes. We present qualitative arguments that such a setup could be unstable both in the closed and open string sector. The singularities in the fluxes then get naturally resolved by taking the true solution to be a time-dependent process in which flux gets attracted towards the brane and subsequently annihilates.
