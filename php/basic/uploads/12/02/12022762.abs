Title: Casimir scaling and renormalization of Polyakov loops in large-N gauge  theories
Authors: Anne Mykkanen and Marco Panero and Kari Rummukainen
Abstract: We study Casimir scaling and renormalization properties of Polyakov loops in different irreducible representations in SU(N) gauge theories; in particular, we investigate the approach to the large-N limit, by performing lattice simulations of Yang-Mills theories with an increasing number of colors, from 2 to 6. We consider the twelve lowest irreducible representations for each gauge group, and find strong numerical evidence for nearly perfect Casimir scaling of the bare Polyakov loops in the deconfined phase. Then we discuss the temperature dependence of renormalized loops, which is found to be qualitatively and quantitatively very similar for the various gauge groups. In particular, close to the deconfinement transition, the renormalized Polyakov loop increases with the temperature, and its logarithm reveals a characteristic dependence on the inverse of the square of the temperature. At higher temperatures, the renormalized Polyakov loop overshoots one, reaches a maximum, and then starts decreasing, in agreement with weak-coupling predictions. The implications of these findings are discussed.
