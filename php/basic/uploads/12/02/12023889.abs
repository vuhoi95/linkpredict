Title: On Mass Gap in Type IIB Quantum Hall Solitons
Authors: A. Belhaj and M. J. I. Khan and E. H. Saidi and A. Segui
Abstract: We discuss the mass gap in quantum Hall solitons (QHS) embedded in superstring theory. In particular, we give two holographic models which are obtained from D-brane configurations in type IIB superstring compactifications. The first one deals with the monolayered system in the D3/D7 brane set up. The second model corresponds to a multilayered system which is described by intersecting D5-branes wrapping a particular set of 3-cycles. In both models, we have shown that the mass gap is related to the filling factor.
