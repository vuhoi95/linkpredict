Title: A geometric action for non-geometric fluxes
Authors: David Andriot and Olaf Hohm and Magdalena Larfors and Dieter Lust and Peter Patalong
Abstract: We give a geometrical interpretation of the non-geometric Q and R fluxes. To this end we consider double field theory in a formulation that is related to the conventional one by a field redefinition taking the form of a T-duality inversion. The R flux is a tensor under diffeomorphisms and satisfies a non-trivial Bianchi identity. The Q flux can be viewed as part of a connection that covariantizes the winding derivatives with respect to diffeomorphisms. We give a higher-dimensional action with a kinetic term for the R flux and a 'dual' Einstein-Hilbert term containing the connection Q.
