Title: Drag force in a strongly coupled anisotropic plasma
Authors: Mariano Chernicoff and Daniel Fernandez and David Mateos and Diego Trancanelli
Abstract: We calculate the drag force experienced by an infinitely massive quark propagating at constant velocity through an anisotropic, strongly coupled N=4 plasma by means of its gravity dual. We find that the gluon cloud trailing behind the quark is generally misaligned with the quark velocity, and that the latter is also misaligned with the force. The drag coefficient $\mu$ can be larger or smaller than the corresponding isotropic value depending on the velocity and the direction of motion. In the ultra-relativistic limit we find that generically $\mu \propto p$. We discuss the conditions under which this behaviour may extend to more general situations.
