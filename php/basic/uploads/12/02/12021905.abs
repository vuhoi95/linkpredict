Title: Covariant Symplectic Structure and Conserved Charges of New Massive  Gravity
Authors: Gokhan Alkac and Deniz Olgu Devecioglu
Abstract: We show that the symplectic current obtained from the boundary term, which arises in the first variation of a local diffeomorphism invariant action, is covariantly conserved for any gravity theory described by that action. Therefore, a Poincare invariant 2-form can be constructed on the phase space, which is shown to be closed without reference to a specific theory. Finally, we show that one can obtain a charge expression for gravity theories in various dimensions, which plays the role of the Abbott-Deser-Tekin (ADT) charge for spacetimes with non-constant curvature backgrounds, by using the diffeomorphism invariance of the symplectic 2-form. As an example, we calculate the conserved charges of some solutions of New Massive Gravity (NMG) and compare the results with the previous works.
