Abstract: We derive a BPS-like first order system of equations for a family of flat static domain walls (DWs) of dimensionally extended cubic Lovelock Gravity coupled to massive scalar self-interacting matter. The explicit construction of such DWs is achieved by introducing of an appropriate matter superpotential. We further analyse the dependence of the geometric properties of the asymptotically AdSd space-times representing distinct DWs on the shape of the matter potential, on the values of the Lovelock couplings and on the scalar field boundary conditions. Few explicit examples of Lovelock DWs interpolating between AdS-type vacua of different cosmological constants are presented. In five dimensions our method provides interesting solutions of the Myers-Robinson Quasi-topological Gravity in the presence of matter important for the description of the specific renormalization group flows in its holographic dual four-dimensional CFT perturbed by relevant operators.
