Title: Interacting dark energy models in fractal cosmology
Authors: O. A. Lemets and D. A. Yerokhin
Abstract: We investigate interacting dark energy models in the framework of fractal cosmology. We discuss a fractal FRW universe filled with the dark energy and dark matter which interact with each other. We obtain the equation for the relative density of dark matter and dark energy and the deceleration parameter. This model demonstrates new types of evolution, which are not common to cosmological models with this type of interaction.
