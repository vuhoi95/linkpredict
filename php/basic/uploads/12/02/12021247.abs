Abstract: Using a recently proposed gauge invariant formulation of light-cone averaging, together with adapted "geodesic light-cone" coordinates, we show how an "induced backreaction" effect emerges, in general, from correlated fluctuations in the luminosity distance and covariant integration measure. Considering a realistic stochastic spectrum of inhomogeneities of primordial (inflationary) origin we find that both the induced backreaction on the luminosity-redshift relation and the dispersion are larger than naively expected. On the other hand the former, at least to leading order and in the linear perturbative regime, cannot account by itself for the observed effects of dark energy at large-redshifts. A full second-order calculation, or even better a reliable estimate of contributions from the non-linear regime, appears to be necessary before firm conclusions on the correct interpretation of the data can be drawn.
