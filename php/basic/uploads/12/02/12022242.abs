Title: Counting master integrals: integration-by-parts procedure with effective  mass
Authors: Bernd A. Kniehl and Anatoly V. Kotikov
Abstract: We show that the new relation between master integrals recently obtained in Ref. [1] can be reproduced using the integration-by-parts technique implemented with an effective mass. In fact, this relation is recovered as a special case of a whole family of new relations between master integrals.
