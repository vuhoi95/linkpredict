Title: Dynamical generation of mass in the noncommutative supersymmetric  Schwinger model
Authors: A. C. Lehum and J. R. Nascimento and A. Yu. Petrov
Abstract: Within the superfield formalism, we study the dynamical generation of mass to the gauge superfield in the noncommutative two-dimensional supersymmetric Schwinger model. We show that the radiatively generated mass does not depend on the noncommutative parameter up to one-loop order.
