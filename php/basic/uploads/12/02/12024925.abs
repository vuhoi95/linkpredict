Title: Beyond the Planar Limit in ABJM
Authors: Robert de Mello Koch and Badr Awad Elseid Mohammed and Jeff Murugan and Andrea Prinsloo
Abstract: In this article we consider gauge theories with a U(N)X U(N) gauge group. We provide, for the first time, a complete set of operators built from scalar fields that are in the bi fundamental of the two groups. Our operators diagonalize the two point function of the free field theory at all orders in 1/N. We then use this basis to investigate non-planar anomalous dimensions in the ABJM theory. We show that the dilatation operator reduces to a set of decoupled harmonic oscillators, signaling integrability in a nonplanar large N limit.
