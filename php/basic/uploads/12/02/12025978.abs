Title: On the presence of twinlike models in cosmology
Authors: D. Bazeia and J. D. Dantas
Abstract: We study cosmological models described by a single real scalar field. We work within the first-order framework, and we show how the first-order equations simplify the investigation, leading to a direct search of twinlike theories. The procedure is used to introduce distinct models that support the same first-order equations, with the very same energy densities and pressure in flat spacetime. The presence of curvature forbids the construction of twinlike models in the cosmological scenario here investigated.
