Authors: Hua-Jun Huang and You-Ning Li and Dong Ruan
Abstract: In this paper various representations of the exceptional Lie algebra G_2 are investigated in a purely algebraic manner, and multi-boson/multi-fermion realizations are obtained. Matrix elements of the master representation, which is defined on the space of the universal enveloping algebra of G_2, are explicitly determined. From this master representation, different indecomposable representations defined on invariant subspaces or quotient spaces with respect to these invariant subspaces are discussed. Especially, the elementary representations of G_2 are investigated in detail, and the corresponding six-boson realization is given. After obtaining explicit forms of all twelve extremal vectors of the elementary representation with the highest weight {\Lambda}, all representations with their respective highest weights related to {\Lambda} are systematically discussed. For one of these representations the corresponding five-boson realization is constructed. Moreover, a new three-fermion realization from the fundamental representation (0,1) of G_2 is constructed also.
