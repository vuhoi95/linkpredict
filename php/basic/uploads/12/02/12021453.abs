Title: Supersymmetric extensions of K field theories
Authors: C. Adam and J. M. Queiruga and J. Sanchez-Guillen and A. Wereszczynski
Abstract: We review the recently developed supersymmetric extensions of field theories with non-standard kinetic terms (so-called K field theories) in two an three dimensions. Further, we study the issue of topological defect formation in these supersymmetric theories. Specifically, we find supersymmetric K field theories which support topological kinks in 1+1 dimensions as well as supersymmetric extensions of the baby Skyrme model for arbitrary nonnegative potentials in 2+1 dimensions.
