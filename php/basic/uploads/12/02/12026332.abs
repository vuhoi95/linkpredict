Title: Spectral functions of non essentially selfadjoint operators
Authors: H. Falomir and P. A. G. Pisani
Abstract: One of the many problems to which J.S. Dowker devoted his attention is the effect of a conical singularity in the base manifold on the behavior of the quantum fields. In particular, he studied the small-$t$ asymptotic expansion of the heat-kernel trace on a cone and its effects on physical quantities, as the Casimir energy. In this article we review some peculiar results found in the last decade, regarding the appearance of non-standard powers of $t$, and even negative integer powers of $\log{t}$, in this asymptotic expansion for the selfadjoint extensions of some symmetric operators with singular coefficients. Similarly, we show that the $\zeta$-function associated to these selfadjoint extensions presents an unusual analytic structure.
