Title: Fermi Surface under Magnetism Instability
Authors: Yushu Song and Shu-Qing Guo
Abstract: In this paper, we study the fermionic excitations near the quantum criticality using gauge/gravity duality. This is motivated by exploring the Fermi surface evolution near the quantum criticality. We construct the gravity dual of "paramagnetic-nematic" phase transition in a continuum limit and study the Fermi surface evolution across this quantum phase transition. We find that there exists non-Fermi liquid with the Fermi surface in the "paramagnetic" phase and the Fermi surface disappears in the "nematic" phase.
