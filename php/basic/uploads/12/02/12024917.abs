Authors: M. R. Setare and V. Kamali
Abstract: Boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) is the study of conformal field theory (CFT) in semi-infinite space-time. In non-relativistic limit ($x\rightarrow\epsilon x, t\rightarrow t, \epsilon\rightarrow 0$), boundary conformal algebra changes to boundary Galilean conformal algebra (BGCA). In this work, some aspects of AdS/BCFT in non-relatvistic limit were explored. We constrain correlation functions of Galilean conformal invariant fields with BGCA generators. For a situation with a boundary condition at surface $x=0$ ($z=\bar{z}$), our result is agree with non-relativistic limit of BCFT two-point function. We also, introduce holographic dual of boundary Galilean conformal field theory.
