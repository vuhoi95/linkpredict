Title: Matrix theory compactifications on twisted tori
Authors: Athanasios Chatzistavrakidis and Larisa Jonke
Abstract: We study compactifications of Matrix theory on twisted tori and non-commutative versions of them. As a first step, we review the construction of multidimensional twisted tori realized as nilmanifolds based on certain nilpotent Lie algebras. Subsequently, matrix compactifications on tori are revisited and the previously known results are supplemented with a background of a non-commutative torus with non-constant non-commutativity and an underlying non-associative structure on its phase space. Next we turn our attention to 3- and 6-dimensional twisted tori and we describe consistent backgrounds of Matrix theory on them by stating and solving the conditions which describe the corresponding compactification. Both commutative and non-commutative solutions are found in all cases. Finally, we comment on the correspondence among the obtained solutions and flux compactifications of 11-dimensional supergravity, as well as on relations among themselves, such as Seiberg-Witten maps and T-duality.
