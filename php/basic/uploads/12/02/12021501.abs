Title: On "New Massive" 4D Gravity
Authors: Eric A. Bergshoeff and J. J. Fernandez-Melgarejo and Jan Rosseel and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: We construct a four-dimensional (4D) gauge theory that propagates, unitarily, the five polarization modes of a massive spin-2 particle. These modes are described by a "dual" graviton gauge potential and the Lagrangian is 4th-order in derivatives. As the construction mimics that of 3D "new massive gravity", we call this 4D model (linearized) "new massive dual gravity". We analyse its massless limit, and discuss similarities to the Eddington-Schroedinger model.
