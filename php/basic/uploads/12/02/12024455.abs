Title: An exact formula for the radiation of a moving quark in N=4 super Yang  Mills
Authors: Diego Correa and Johannes Henn and Juan Maldacena and Amit Sever
Abstract: We derive an exact formula for the cusp anomalous dimension at small angles. This is done by relating the latter to the computation of certain 1/8 BPS Wilson loops which was performed by supersymmetric localization. This function of the coupling also determines the power emitted by a moving quark in N=4 super Yang Mills, as well as the coefficient of the two point function of the displacement operator on the Wilson loop. By a similar method we compute the near BPS expansion of the generalized cusp anomalous dimension.
