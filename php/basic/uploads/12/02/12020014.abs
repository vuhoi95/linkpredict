Abstract: Understanding the consequences of the E_{7(7)} duality on the UV properties of N=8 supergravity requires unravelling when and how duality-covariant actions can be constructed so as to accommodate duality-invariant counter-terms. For non-supersymmetric abelian gauge theories exhibiting U(1)-duality, with and without derivative couplings, it was shown that such a covariant construction is always possible. In this paper we describe a similar procedure for the construction of covariant non-linear deformations of U(1)-duality invariant theories in the presence of rigid N=2 supersymmetry. This is a concrete step towards studying the interplay of duality and extended supersymmetry.
