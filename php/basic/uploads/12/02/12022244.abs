Title: A Particle Probing Thermodynamics in Three-Dimensional Black Hole
Authors: Bogeun Gwak and Bum-Hoon Lee
Abstract: We have shown the thermodynamic changes in a 2+1-dimensional rotating black hole when it absorbs a particle. The microscopic changes which the black hole undergoes are interpreted using the AdS/CFT correspondence. Using particle absorption phenomena, we formulate an irreducible mass and black hole entropy directly related to the particle momenta. We describe the black hole evolution that preserves the 2nd law of thermodynamics. The numbers of microstates which evaluate the entropy are analyzed at each of the black hole evolution stages.
