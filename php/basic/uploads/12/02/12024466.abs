Title: Massive Supermultiplets in Four-Dimensional Superstring Theory
Authors: Wan-Zhe Feng and Dieter Lust and Oliver Schlotterer
Abstract: We extend the discussion of arXiv:1007.5254 on massive Regge excitations on the first mass level of four-dimensional superstring theory. For the lightest massive modes of the open string sector, universal supermultiplets common to all four-dimensional compactifications with N = 1, 2 and N = 4 spacetime supersymmetry are constructed respectively -- both their vertex operators and their supersymmetry variations. Massive spinor helicity methods shed light on the interplay between individual polarization states.
