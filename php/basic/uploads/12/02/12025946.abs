Title: Nonperturbative renormalization group approach to Lifshitz critical  behaviour
Authors: K. Essafi and J. -P. Kownacki and D. Mouhanna
Abstract: The behaviour of a d-dimensional vectorial N=3 model at a m-axial Lifshitz critical point is investigated by means of a nonperturbative renormalization group approach that is free of the huge technical difficulties that plague the perturbative approaches and limit their computations to the lowest orders. In particular being systematically improvable, our approach allows us to control the convergence of successive approximations and thus to get reliable physical quantities in d=3.
