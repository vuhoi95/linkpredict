Title: On the boundedness of effective potentials arising from string  compactifications
Authors: Marcelo M. Disconzi and Michael R. Douglas and Vamsi P. Pingali
Abstract: We study effective potentials coming from compactifications of string theory. We show that, under mild assumptions, such potentials are bounded from below in four dimensions, giving an affirmative answer to a conjecture proposed by the second author in arXiv:0911.3378v4 [hep-th]. We also derive some sufficient conditions for the existence of critical points. All proofs and mathematical hypotheses are discussed in the context of their relevance to the physics of the problem.
