Title: On Rotating and Oscillating Four-Spin Strings in AdS5 X S5
Authors: Kamal L. Panigrahi and Pabitra M. Pradhan
Abstract: We study rigidly rotating strings in AdS5 X S5 background with one spin along AdS5 and three angular momenta along S5. We find dispersion relations among various charges and interpret them as giant magnon and spiky string solutions in various limits. Further we present an example of oscillating string which oscillates in the radial direction of the AdS5 and at the same time rotates in S5.
