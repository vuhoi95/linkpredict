Title: Noncommutative fluid dynamics in the Snyder space-time
Authors: M. C. B. Abdalla and L. Holender and M. A. Santos and I. V. Vancea
Abstract: In this paper, we construct for the first time the non-commutative fluid with the deformed Poincare invariance. To this end, the realization formalism of the noncommutative spaces is employed and the results are particularized to the Snyder space. The non-commutative fluid generalizes the fluid model in the action functional formulation to the noncommutative space. The fluid equations of motion and the conserved energy-momentum tensor are obtained.
