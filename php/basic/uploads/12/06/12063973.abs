Title: Euler - Heisenberg effective action and magnetoelectric effect in  multilayer graphene
Authors: M. I. Katsnelson and G. E. Volovik and M. A. Zubkov
Abstract: The low energy effective field model for the multilayer graphene (at ABC stacking) is considered. We calculate the effective action in the presence of constant external magnetic field $B$ (normal to the graphene sheet). We also calculate the first two corrections to this effective action caused by the in-plane electric field $E$ at $E/B \ll 1$ and discuss the magnetoelectric effect. In addition, we calculate the imaginary part of the effective action in the presence of constant electric field $E$ and the lowest order correction to it due to the magnetic field ($B/E \ll 1$).
