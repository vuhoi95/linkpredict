Title: The Sound of Topology in the AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: Igal Arav and Yaron Oz
Abstract: Using the gauge/gravity correspondence, we study the properties of 2-point correlation functions of finite-temperature strongly coupled gauge field theories, defined on a curved space of general spatial topology with a dual black hole description. We derive approximate asymptotic expressions for the correlation functions and their poles, supported by exact numerical calculations, and study their dependence on the dimension of spacetime and the spatial topology. The asymptotic structure of the correlation functions depends on the relation between the spatial curvature and the temperature, and is noticeable when they are of the same order. In the case of a hyperbolic topology, a specific temperature is identified for which exact analytical solutions exist for all types of perturbations. The asymptotic structure of the correlation functions poles is found to behave in a non-smooth manner when approaching this temperature.
