Title: Muon (g-2) from the bulk neutrino field in a warped extra dimensional  model
Authors: R. S. Hundi and Sourov Roy and Soumitra SenGupta
Abstract: In the Randall-Sundrum model, a bulk neutrino field in the 5-dimensional space-time can give rise to tiny Dirac masses to neutrinos. In such a scenario, we have computed the contribution of the bulk neutrino field to the anomalous magnetic moment $(g-2)_\mu$ of muon. We have computed this contribution in the 't Hooft-Feynman gauge and have found that the contribution has the right sign to fit the current discrepancy between the experiment and the standard model value of $(g-2)_\mu$. We have also studied possible constraints on the model parameters by including contributions to $(g-2)_\mu$ from other sources such as bulk gravitons.
