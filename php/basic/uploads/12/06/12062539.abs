Title: Spiky Strings on I-brane
Authors: Sagar Biswas and Kamal L. Panigrahi
Abstract: We study rigidly rotating strings in the near horizon geometry of the 1+1 dimensional intersection of two orthogonal stacks of NS5-branes, the so called I-brane background. We solve the equations of motion of the fundamental string action in the presence of two form NS-NS fluxes that the I-brane background supports and write down general form of conserved quantities. We further find out two limiting cases corresponding to giant magnon and single spike like strings in various parameter space of solutions.
