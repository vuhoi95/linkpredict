Title: Dark Energy in Modified Supergravity
Authors: Sergei V. Ketov and Natsuki Watanabe
Abstract: We propose a supersymmetric extension of the dynamical dark energy function and the corresponding scalar (super)potential in F(R) supergravity. Our model is viable in the Einstein approximation, and also has an analytic (regular) Wess-Zumino-type scalar superpotential. The hidden sector responsible for spontaneous supersymmetry breaking is given.
