Title: Equations of state and compact stars in gauge/gravity duality
Authors: Kyung Kiu Kim and Youngman Kim and Ik Jae Shin
Abstract: We propose a new doorway to study the interplay between equations of state of dense matter and compact stars in gauge/gravity correspondence. For this we construct a bulk geometry near the boundary of five-dimensional spacetime. By solving a constraint equation derived from the bulk equation of motion together with the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, we determine the equations of state for compact stars. The input parameters in this study are the energy density and pressure at the center of the compact objects. We also study how the equation of state depends on the parameters.
