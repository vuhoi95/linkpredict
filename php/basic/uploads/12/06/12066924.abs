Title: The Incompressible Rindler fluid versus the Schwarzschild-AdS fluid
Authors: Yoshinori Matsuo and Makoto Natsuume and Masahiro Ohta and Takashi Okamura
Abstract: We study the proposal by Bredberg et al. (1006.1902), where the fluid is defined by the Brown-York tensor on a timelike surface at r=r_c in black hole backgrounds. We consider both Rindler space and the Schwarzschild-AdS (SAdS) black hole. The former describes an incompressible fluid, whereas the latter describes the vanishing bulk viscosity at arbitrary r_c, but these two results do not contradict with each other. We also find an interesting "coincidence" with the black hole membrane paradigm which gives a negative bulk viscosity. In order to show these results, we rewrite the hydrodynamic stress tensor via metric perturbations using the conservation equation. The resulting expressions are suitable to compare with the Brown-York tensor.
