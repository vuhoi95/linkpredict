Title: Scale-Invariant Fluctuations from Galilean Genesis
Authors: Yi Wang and Robert Brandenberger
Abstract: We study the spectrum of cosmological fluctuations in scenarios such as Galilean Genesis in which a spectator scalar field acquires a scale-invariant spectrum of perturbations during an early phase which asymptotes in the far past to Minkowski space-time. In the case of minimal coupling to gravity and standard scalar field Lagrangian, the induced curvature fluctuations depend quadratically on the spectator field and are hence non-scale-invariant and highly non-Gaussian. We show that if higher dimensional operators (the same operators that lead to the {\eta}-problem for inflation) are considered, a linear coupling between background and spectator field fluctuations is induced which leads to scale-invariant and Gaussian curvature fluctuations.
