Title: Horava-Lifshitz theory as a Fermionic Aether in Ashtekar gravity
Authors: Stephon Alexander and Joao Magueijo and Antonino Marciano
Abstract: We show how Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz (HL) theory appears naturally in the Ashtekar formulation of relativity if one postulates the existence of a fermionic field playing the role of aether. The spatial currents associated with this field must be switched off for the equivalence to work. Therefore the field supplies the preferred frame associated with breaking refoliation (time diffeomorphism) invariance, but obviously the symmetry is only spontaneously broken if the field is dynamic. When Dirac fermions couple to the gravitational field via the Ashtekar variables, the low energy limit of HL gravity, recast in the language of Ashtekar variables, naturally emerges (provided the spatial fermion current identically vanishes). HL gravity can therefore be interpreted as a time-like current, or a Fermi aether, that fills space-time, with the Immirzi parameter, a chiral fermionic coupling, and the fermionic charge density fixing the value of the parameter $\lambda$ determining HL theory. This reinterpretation sheds light on some features of HL theory, namely its good convergence properties.
