Title: Anisotropic Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe from nonlinear massive  gravity
Authors: A. Emir Gumrukcuoglu and Chunshan Lin and Shinji Mukohyama
Abstract: In the scope of the nonlinear massive gravity, we study fixed points of evolution equations for a Bianchi type--I universe. We find a new attractor solution with non-vanishing anisotropy, on which the physical metric is isotropic but the Stuckelberg configuration is anisotropic. As a result, at the background level, the solution describes a homogeneous and isotropic universe, while a statistical anisotropy is expected from perturbations, suppressed by smallness of the graviton mass.
