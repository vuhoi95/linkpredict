Title: The NLO N =4 SUSY BFKL Green function in the adjoint representation
Authors: G. Chachamis and A. Sabio Vera
Abstract: We study the solution of the BFKL equation in the adjoint representation for the N=4 SUSY theory at NLO accuracy. Consistency with the large momentum transfer solution obtained by Fadin and Lipatov is found. We investigate, for large and small values of the momentum transfer, the growth with energy of the Green function, its collinear behaviour and the expansion in azimuthal angle Fourier components.
