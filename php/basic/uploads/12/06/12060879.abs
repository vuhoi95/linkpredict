Title: Hawking radiation, chirality, and the principle of effective theory of  gravity
Authors: Adamantia Zampeli and Douglas Singleton and Elias C. Vagenas
Abstract: In this paper we combine the chirality of field theories in near horizon regions with the principle of effective theory of gravity to define a new energy-momentum tensor for the theory. This new energy-momentum tensor has the correct radiation flux to account for Hawking radiation for space-times with horizons. This method is connected to the chiral anomaly cancellation method, but it works for space-times for which the chiral anomaly cancellation method fails. In particular the method presented here works for the non-asymptotically flat de Sitter space-time and its associated Hawking-Gibbons radiation, as well as Rindler space-time and its associated Unruh radiation. This indicates that it is the chiral nature of the field theory in the near horizon regions which is of primary importance rather than the chiral anomaly.
