Title: Gravitational Cherenkov Radiation from Extended Theories of Gravity
Authors: M. De Laurentis and S. Capozziello and G. Basini
Abstract: We linearize the field equations for higher order theories of gravity that contain scalar invariants other than the Ricci scalar. We find that besides a massless spin-2 field (the standard graviton), the theory contains also spin-0 and spin-2 massive modes with the latter being, in general, ghost modes. The rate at which such particles would emit gravitational Cherenkov radiation is calculated for some interesting physical cases.
