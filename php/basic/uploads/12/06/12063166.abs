Title: The black-hole/qubit correspondence: an up-to-date review
Authors: L. Borsten and M. J. Duff and P. LÃ©vay
Abstract: We give a review of the black-hole/qubit correspondence that incorporates not only the earlier results on black hole entropy and entanglement measures, seven qubits and the Fano plane, wrapped branes as qubits and the attractor mechanism as a distillation procedure, but also newer material including error-correcting codes, Mermin squares, Freudenthal triples and 4-qubit entanglement classification.
