Title: Geodesic Congruences and Their Deformations in Bertrand Space-times
Authors: Prashant Kumar and Kaushik Bhattacharya and Tapobrata Sarkar
Abstract: We study the energy conditions and geodesic deformations in Bertrand space-times. We show that these can be thought of as interesting physical space-times in certain regions of the underlying parameter space, where the weak and strong energy conditions hold. We further compute the ESR parameters and analyze them numerically. The focusing of radial time-like and radial null geodesics is shown explicitly, which verifies the Raychaudhuri equation.
