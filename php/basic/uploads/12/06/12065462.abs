Title: Effects of quintessence on holographic p-wave superconductors
Authors: Songbai Chen and Qiyuan Pan and Jiliang Jing
Abstract: We construct a holographic p-wave superconductor model in the background of quintessence AdS black hole with an SU(2) Yang-Mills gauge field and then probe the effects of quintessence on the holographic p-wave superconductor. We investigate the relation between the critical temperature and the state parameter of quintessence, and present the numerical results for electric conductivity. It is shown that the condensation of the vector field becomes harder as the absolute value of the state parameter increases. Unlike the scalar condensate in the s-wave model, the condensation of the vector field in p-wave model can occur in the total value range of the state parameter $w_q$ of quintessence. These results could help us know more about holographic superconductor and dark energy.
