Title: Curvature formula for the space of 2-d conformal field theories
Authors: Daniel Friedan and Anatoly Konechny
Abstract: We derive a formula for the curvature tensor of the natural Riemannian metric on the space of two-dimensional conformal field theories and also a formula for the curvature tensor of the space of boundary conformal field theories.
