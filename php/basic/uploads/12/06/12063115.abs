Title: Soft-collinear resummation in deeply virtual Compton scattering
Authors: T. Altinoluk and B. Pire and L. Szymanowski and S. Wallon
Abstract: We derive an all order resummation formula for the deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) amplitude, which takes into account soft gluon exchanges in the non-singlet quark coefficient function. We identify the ladder diagrams responsible in light-like gauge for [alphaS log^2 (x +/- xi)]^n contributions. The resummed series results in a simple closed expression.
