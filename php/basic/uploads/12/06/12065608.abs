Title: Quantum Discord and Quantum Entanglement in the Background of an  Asymptotically Flat Static Black Holes
Authors: Eylee Jung and Mi-Ra Hwang and DaeKil Park
Abstract: The quantum discord and tripartite entanglement are discussed in the presence of an asymptotically flat static black holes. The total correlation, quantum discord and classical correlation exhibit decreasing behavior with increasing Hawking temperature. It is shown that the classical correlation is less than the quantum discord in the full range of Hawking temperature. The tripartite entanglements for Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and W-states also exhibit decreasing behavior with increasing Hawking temperature. At the infinite limit of Hawking temperature the tripartite entanglements for Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and W-states reduce to 52% and 33% of the corresponding values in the flat space limit, respectively.
