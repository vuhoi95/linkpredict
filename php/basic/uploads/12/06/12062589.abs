Title: Two-scalar-field model for the interaction of dark energy and dark  matter
Authors: Orfeu Bertolami and Pedro Carrilho and Jorge PÃ¡ramos
Abstract: In this paper, we study the effects of an interaction between dark matter and dark energy through a two scalar field model with a potential $V(\phi,\chi)=e^{-\lambda\phi}P(\phi,\chi)$, where $P(\phi,\chi)$ is a polynomial. We show that the cosmic expansion dynamics of the Universe is reproduced for a large range of the bare mass of the dark matter field and that there exist solutions with transient accelerated expansion. A modification in the exponential behavior of the potential is studied, with important physical implications, including the possibility of more realistic transient acceleration solutions.
