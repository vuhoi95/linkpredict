Abstract: Using the techniques developed in arxiv: 1203.3544 we compute the universal part of the equilibrium partition function characteristic of a theory with multiple abelian U(1) anomalies in arbitrary even spacetime dimensions. This contribution is closely linked to the universal anomaly induced transport coefficients in hydrodynamics which have been studied before using entropy techniques. Equilibrium partition function provides an alternate and a microscopically more transparent way to derive the constraints on these transport coefficients. We re-derive this way all the known results on these transport coefficients including their polynomial structure which has recently been conjectured to be linked to the anomaly polynomial of the theory. Further we link the local description of anomaly induced transport in terms of a Gibbs current to the more global description in terms of the partition function .
