Title: The Development of Supergravity Grand Unification: Circa 1982-85
Authors: R. Arnowitt and A. H. Chamseddine and Pran Nath
Abstract: The development in the early eighties of supergravity grand unified models with gravity mediated breaking of supersymmetry, has led to a remarkable progress in the study of supersymmetry at colliders, in dark matter and in a variety of other experimental searches in the intervening years since that time. The purpose of this note is to review this development and describe our construction of this theory in the period 1982-85.
