Title: GUT theories from Calabi-Yau 4-folds with SO(10) Singularities
Authors: Radu Tatar and William Walters
Abstract: We consider an SO(10) GUT model from F-theory compactified on an elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau with a D5 singularity. To obtain the matter curves and the Yukawa couplings, we use a global description to resolve the singularity. We identify the vector and spinor matter representations and their Yukawa couplings and we explicitly build the G-fluxes in the global model and check the agreement with the semi-local results. As our bundle is of type SU(2k), some extra conditions need to be applied to match the fluxes.
