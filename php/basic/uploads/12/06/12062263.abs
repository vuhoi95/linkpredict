Title: Conformally-coupled dark spinor and FRW universe
Authors: Joohan Lee and Tae Hoon Lee and Phillial Oh
Abstract: We study conformal coupling of dark spinor fields to gravity and calculate the energy density and the pressure of the spinor in FRW spacetime. We consider the renormalizable potential of the spinor field. In the cases where the field is proportional to some power of the cosmic scale factor $a(t)$, we determine the Hubble parameter as a function of the scale factor and find analytic solutions for $a(t)$ when the spinor field matter dilutes as the universe expands. We discuss the possibility that both matter- and dark energy-dominated eras of our universe can be described by the dark spinor.
