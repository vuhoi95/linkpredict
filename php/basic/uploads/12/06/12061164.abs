Title: Black hole uniqueness theorems in higher dimensional spacetimes
Authors: Stefan Hollands and Akihiro Ishibashi
Abstract: We review uniqueness theorems as well as other general results about higher dimensional black hole spacetimes. This includes in particular theorems about the topology of higher dimensional spacetimes, theorems about their symmetries (rigidity theorem), and the classification of supersymmetric black holes. We outline the basic ideas underlying the proofs of these statements, and we also indicate ways to generalize some of these results to more general contexts, such as more complicated theories.
