Abstract: We present a self-dual non-Abelian N=1 supersymmetric tensor multiplet in D=2+2 space-time dimensions. Our system has three on-shell multiplets: (i) The usual non-Abelian Yang-Mills multiplet (A_\mu{}^I, \lambda{}^I) (ii) A non-Abelian tensor multiplet (B_{\mu\nu}{}^I, \chi^I, \varphi^I), and (iii) An extra compensator vector multiplet (C_\mu{}^I, \rho^I). Here the index I is for the adjoint representation of a non-Abelian gauge group. The duality symmetry relations are G_{\mu\nu\rho}{}^I = - \epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho}{}^\sigma \nabla_\sigma \varphi^I, F_{\mu\nu}{}^I = + (1/2) \epsilon_{\mu\nu}{}^{\rho\sigma} F_{\rho\sigma}{}^I, and H_{\mu\nu}{}^I = +(1/2) \epsilon_{\mu\nu}{\rho\sigma} H_{\rho\sigma}{}^I, where G and H are respectively the field strengths of B and C. The usual problem with the coupling of the non-Abelian tensor is avoided by non-trivial Chern-Simons terms in the field strengths G_{\mu\nu\rho}{}^I and H_{\mu\nu}{}^I. For an independent confirmation, we re-formulate the component results in superspace. As applications of embedding integrable systems, we show how the {\cal N} = 2, r = 3 and {\cal N} = 3, r = 4 flows of generalized Korteweg-de Vries equations are embedded into our system.
