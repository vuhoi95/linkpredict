Title: Quasi-topological Reissner-Nordstr√∂m Black Holes
Authors: W. G. Brenna and R. B. Mann
Abstract: We consider Reissner-Nordstrom solutions in quasi-topological gravity, obtaining exact solutions to the field equations yielding charged quasi-topological black holes. We study their thermodynamic behaviour over a range of parameters that yield ghost-free and stable space times. We find that a sufficiently negative quasi-topological parameter can yield black holes with 2 horizons, even for zero charge. We discuss the thermodynamic stability for the class of solutions we obtain. We also describe the structure of exact charged solutions to $k^{th}$ order quasi-topological gravity.
