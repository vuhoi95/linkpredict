Title: On unitary subsectors of polycritical gravities
Authors: Axel Kleinschmidt and Teake Nutma and Amitabh Virmani
Abstract: We study higher-derivative gravity theories in arbitrary space-time dimension d with a cosmological constant at their maximally critical points where the masses of all linearized perturbations vanish. These theories have been conjectured to be dual to logarithmic conformal field theories in the (d-1)-dimensional boundary of an AdS solution. We determine the structure of the linearized perturbations and their boundary fall-off behaviour. The linearized modes exhibit the expected Jordan block structure and their inner products are shown to be those of a non-unitary theory. We demonstrate the existence of consistent unitary truncations of the polycritical gravity theory at the linearized level for odd rank.
