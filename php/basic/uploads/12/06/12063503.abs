Title: 5d quivers and their AdS(6) duals
Authors: Oren Bergman and Diego Rodriguez-Gomez
Abstract: We consider an infinite class of 5d supersymmetric gauge theories involving products of symplectic and unitary groups that arise from D4-branes at orbifold singularities in Type I' string theory. The theories are argued to be dual to warped AdS(6)x S4/Zn backgrounds in massive Type IIA supergravity. In particular, this demonstrates the existence of supersymmetric 5d fixed points of quiver type. We analyze the spectrum of gauge fields and charged states in the supergravity dual, and find a precise agreement with the symmetries and charged operators in the quiver theories. We also comment on other brane objects in the supergravity dual and their interpretation in the field theories.
