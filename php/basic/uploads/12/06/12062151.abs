Title: Canonical transformations in gauge theories with non-trivial backgrounds
Authors: Daniele Binosi and Andrea Quadri
Abstract: We show how to implement the background field method by means of canonical transformations and comment on the applications of the method to non-perturbative techniques in non-Abelian gauge theories. We discuss the case of the lattice in some details.
