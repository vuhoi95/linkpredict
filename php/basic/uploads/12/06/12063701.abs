Title: Partial resolution of complex cones over Fano ${\cal{B}}$
Authors: Siddharth Dwivedi and P. Ramadevi
Abstract: In our recent paper arXiv:1108.2387, we systematized inverse algorithm to obtain quiver gauge theory living on the M2-branes probing the singularities of special kind of Calabi-Yau four-folds which were complex cones over toric Fano $\mathbb{P}^3$, ${\cal{B}}_1$, ${\cal{B}}_2$, ${\cal{B}}_3$. These quiver gauge theories cannot be given a dimer tiling presentation. We use the method of partial resolution to show that the toric data of $\mathbb{C}^4$ and Fano $\mathbb{P}^3$ can be embedded inside the toric data of Fano ${\cal{B}}$ theories. This method indirectly justfies that the two node quiver Chern-Simons theories corresponding to $\mathbb{C}^4$, Fano $\mathbb{P}^3$ and their orbifolds can be obtained by higgsing matter fields of the three node parent quiver corresponding to Fano ${\cal{B}}_1$, ${\cal{B}}_2$, ${\cal{B}}_3$, ${\cal{B}}_4$ three-folds.
