Title: Charged black rings in supergravity with a single non-zero gauge field
Authors: Andrew L. Feldman and Andrei A. Pomeransky
Abstract: General charged black ring solution with two angular momenta, a charge and a dipole charge is found by the inverse scattering method. The solution is presented in a relatively concise form in which its symmetries are manifest. The regularity conditions are found and the physical characteristics of the regular solution are expressed via its parameters.
