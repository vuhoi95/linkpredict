Title: On Non-commutative Corrections of Gravitational Energy in Teleparallel  Gravity
Authors: S. C. Ulhoa and R. G. G. Amorim
Abstract: In this work we use the theory of Teleparallelism Equivalent to General Relativity based in non-commutative space-time coordinates. In this context, we write the corrections of the Schwarzschild solution. As a important result, we find the corrections of the gravitational energy in the realm of teleparallel gravity due to the non-commutativity of space-time. Then we interpret such corrections as a manifestation of quantum theory in gravitational field.
