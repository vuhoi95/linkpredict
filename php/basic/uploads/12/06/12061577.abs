Title: The Complete KLT-Map Between Gravity and Gauge Theories
Authors: Poul H. Damgaard and Rijun Huang and Thomas Sondergaard and Yang Zhang
Abstract: We present the complete map of any pair of super Yang-Mills theories to supergravity theories as dictated by the KLT relations in four dimensions. Symmetries and the full set of associated vanishing identities are derived. A graphical method is introduced which simplifies counting of states, and helps in identifying the relevant set of symmetries.
