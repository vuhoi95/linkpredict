Title: Brane singularities with mixtures in the bulk
Authors: Ignatios Antoniadis and Spiros Cotsakis and Ifigeneia Klaoudatou
Abstract: By extending previous analysis of the authors, a systematic study of the singularity structure and possible asymptotic behaviors of five-dimensional braneworld solutions is performed in the case where the bulk is a mixture of an analog of perfect fluid (with a density and pressure depending on the extra coordinate) and a massless scalar field. The two bulk components interact by exchanging energy so that the total energy is conserved. In a particular range of the interaction parameters, we find flat brane general solutions avoiding the singularity at finite distance from the brane, in the same region of the equation of state constant parameter $\gamma=P/\rho$ that we found previously in the absence of the bulk scalar field $(-1<\gamma<-1/2)$.
