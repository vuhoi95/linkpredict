Title: Effect of Light Fermions on the Confinement Transition in QCD-like  Theories
Authors: Jinfeng Liao and Edward Shuryak
Abstract: Dependence of the confinement transition parameters on the fermion content provides information on the mechanism of confinement. Recent progress in lattice gauge theories has allowed to study it for light flavor number $N_f\sim O(10)$ and found this transition to shift toward significantly stronger coupling. We propose an explanation for that: light fermions can occupy the chromo-magnetic monopoles, via zero modes, making them "distinguishable" and unsuitable for Bose-Einstein Condensation. Such dilution of unoccuplied monopoles is compensated by stronger coupling that makes them lighter and more numerous. We also suggest that flavor-carrying quark-monopole objects account for the density beyond quark Fermi sphere seen in cold dense phase of $N_c=2$ lattice QCD.
