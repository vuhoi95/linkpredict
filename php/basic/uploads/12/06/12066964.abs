Title: D-branes in Generalized Geometry and Dirac-Born-Infeld Action
Authors: Tsuguhiko Asakawa and Shuhei Sasa and Satoshi Watamura
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to formulate the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action in a framework of generalized geometry and clarify its symmetry. A D-brane is defined as a Dirac structure where scalar fields and gauge field are treated on an equal footing in a static gauge. We derive generalized Lie derivatives corresponding to the diffeomorphism and B-field gauge transformations and show that the DBI action is invariant under non-linearly realized symmetries for all types of diffeomorphisms and B-field gauge transformations. Consequently, we can interpret not only the scalar field but also the gauge field on the D-brane as the generalized Nambu-Goldstone boson.
