Title: 5D SYM on 3D Sphere and 2D YM
Authors: Teruhiko Kawano and Nariaki Matsumiya
Abstract: It is shown by using localization that in five-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on a three-dimensional sphere, correlation functions in a sector are identical to correlation functions in two-dimensional bosonic Yang-Mills theory.
