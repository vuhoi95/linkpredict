Title: Spin and Rotations in Galois Field Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Lay Nam Chang and Zachary Lewis and Djordje Minic and Tatsu Takeuchi
Abstract: We discuss the properties of Galois Field Quantum Mechanics constructed on a vector space over the finite Galois field GF(q). In particular, we look at 2-level systems analogous to spin, and discuss how SO(3) rotations could be embodied in such a system. We also consider two-particle `spin' correlations and show that the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality is nonetheless not violated in this model.
