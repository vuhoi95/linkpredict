Abstract: We review the background field method for three-dimensional Yang-Mills and Chern-Simons models in N=2 superspace. Superfield proper time (heat kernel) techniques are developed and exact expressions of heat kernels for constant backgrounds are presented. The background field method and heat kernel techniques are applied for evaluating the low-energy effective actions in N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills and Chern-Simons models as well as in N=4 and N=8 SYM theories.
