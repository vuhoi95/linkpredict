Title: On the Beaming of Gluonic Fields at Strong Coupling
Authors: Cesar A. Agon and Alberto Guijosa and Bryan O. Larios
Abstract: We examine the conditions for beaming of the gluonic field sourced by a heavy quark in strongly-coupled conformal field theories, using the AdS/CFT correspondence. Previous works have found that, contrary to naive expectations, it is possible to set up collimated beams of gluonic radiation despite the strong coupling. We show that, on the gravity side of the correspondence, this follows directly (for arbitrary quark motion, and independently of any approximations) from the fact that the string dual to the quark remains unexpectedly close to the AdS boundary whenever the quark moves ultra-relativistically. We also work out the validity conditions for a related approximation scheme that proposed to explain the beaming effect though the formation of shock waves in the bulk fields emitted by the string. We find that these conditions are fulfilled in the case of ultra-relativistic uniform circular motion that motivated the proposal, but unfortunately do not hold for much more general quark trajectories.
