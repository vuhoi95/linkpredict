Title: A no-singularity scenario in loop quantum gravity
Authors: Martin Bojowald and George M. Paily
Abstract: Canonical methods allow the derivation of effective gravitational actions from the behavior of space-time deformations reflecting general covariance. With quantum effects, the deformations and correspondingly the effective actions change, revealing dynamical implications of quantum corrections. A new systematic way of expanding these actions is introduced showing as a first result that inverse-triad corrections of loop quantum gravity simplify the asymptotic dynamics near a spacelike collapse singularity. By generic quantum effects, the singularity is removed.
