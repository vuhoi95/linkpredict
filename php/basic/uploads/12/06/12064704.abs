Title: Integrable boundaries in AdS/CFT: revisiting the Z=0 giant graviton and  D7-brane
Authors: Marius de Leeuw and Vidas Regelskis
Abstract: We consider the worldsheet boundary scattering and the corresponding boundary algebras for the Z=0 giant graviton and the Z=0 D7-brane in the AdS/CFT correspondence. We consider two approaches to the boundary scattering, the usual one governed by the (generalized) twisted Yangians and the q-deformed model of these boundaries governed by the quantum affine coideal subalgebras. We show that the q-deformed approach leads to boundary algebras that are of a more compact form than the corresponding twisted Yangians, and thus are favourable to use for explicit calculations. We obtain the q-deformed reflection matrices for both boundaries which in the q->1 limit specialize to the ones obtained using twisted Yangians.
