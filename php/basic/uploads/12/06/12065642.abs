Title: Cosmic string interactions induced by gauge and scalar fields
Authors: Daniel Kabat and Debajyoti Sarkar
Abstract: We study the interaction between two parallel cosmic strings induced by gauge fields and by scalar fields with non-minimal couplings to curvature. For small deficit angles the gauge field behaves like a collection of non-minimal scalars with a specific value for the non-minimal coupling. We check this equivalence by computing the interaction energy between strings at first order in the deficit angles. This result provides another physical context for the "contact terms" which play an important role in the renormalization of black hole entropy due to a spin-1 field.
