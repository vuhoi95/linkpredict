Title: Gyrating Schrodinger Geometries and Non-Relativistic Field Theories
Authors: H. Lu and C. N. Pope
Abstract: We propose homogeneous metrics of Petrov type III that describe gyrating Schrodinger geometries as duals to some non-relativistic field theories, in which the Schrodinger symmetry is broken further so that the phase space has a linear dependence of the momentum in a selected direction. We show that such solutions can arise in four-dimensional Einstein-Weyl supergravity as well as higher-dimensional extended gravities with quadratic curvature terms coupled to a massive vector. In Einstein-Weyl supergravity, the gyrating Schrodinger solutions can be supersymmetric, preserving 1/4 of the supersymmetry. We obtain the exact Green function in the phase space associated with a bulk free massive scalar.
