Title: Holographic superconductors in quintessence AdS black hole
Authors: Songbai Chen and Qiyuan Pan and Jiliang Jing
Abstract: We present a solution of Einstein equations describing a $d$-dimensional planar quintessence AdS black hole which depends on the state parameter $w_q$ of quintessence. We investigate holographic superconductors in this background and probe effects of the state parameter $w_q$ on the critical temperature $T_c$, the condensation formation and conductivity. The larger absolute value of $w_q$ leads to the lower critical temperature $T_c$ and the higher ratio between the gap frequency in conductivity to the critical temperature for the condensates. Moreover, we also find that the scalar condensate there exists an additional constraint condition originating from the quintessence $(d-1)w_q+\lambda_{\pm}>0$ for the operators $\mathcal{O}_{\pm}$, respectively. Our results show that the scalar condensation is harder to form and the occurrence of holographic dual superconductor needs the stronger coupling in the quintessence AdS black hole spacetime.
