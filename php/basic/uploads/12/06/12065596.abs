Title: Difference between standard and quasi-conformal BFKL kernels
Authors: V. S. Fadin and R. Fiore and A. Papa
Abstract: As it was recently shown, the colour singlet BFKL kernel, taken in Moebius representation in the space of impact parameters, can be written in quasi-conformal shape, which is unbelievably simple compared with the conventional form of the BFKL kernel in momentum space. It was also proved that the total kernel is completely defined by its Moebius representation. In this paper we calculated the difference between standard and quasi-conformal BFKL kernels in momentum space and discovered that it is rather simple. Therefore we come to the conclusion that the simplicity of the quasi-conformal kernel is caused mainly by using the impact parameter space.
