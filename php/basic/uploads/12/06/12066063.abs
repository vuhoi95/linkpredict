Title: Bootstrap Dynamical Symmetry Breaking with New Heavy Chiral Quarks
Authors: Yukihiro Mimura and Wei-Shu Hou and Hiroaki Kohyama
Abstract: A Higgs-like new boson with mass around 126 GeV is now established, but its true nature probably cannot be settled with 2011--2012 LHC data. We assume it is a dilaton with couplings weaker than the Higgs boson (except to $\gamma\gamma$ and $gg$), and explore dynamical symmetry breaking (DSB) by strong Yukawa coupling of a yet unseen heavy chiral quark doublet $Q$. Assuming the actual Higgs boson to be heavy, the Goldstone boson $G$ of electroweak symmetry breaking still couples to $Q$ with Yukawa coupling $\lambda_Q$. A ``bootstrap" gap equation without a Higgs particle is constructed. Electroweak symmetry breaking via strong $\lambda_Q$ generates both heavy mass for $Q$, while self-consistently justifying $G$ as a massless Goldstone particle in the loop. The spontaneous breaking of scale invariance in principle \emph{allows} for a dilaton. We numerically solve such a gap equation and find the mass of the heavy quark to be a couple of TeV. We offer a short critique on the results of the scale-invariant model of Hung and Xiong, where a similar gap equation is built with a massless scalar doublet. Through this we show that a light SM Higgs at 126 GeV cannot be viable within our approach to DSB, while a dilaton with weaker couplings is consistent with our main result.
