Title: More about One-Loop Effective Action of Open Superstring in $AdS_5\times  S^5$
Authors: Charlotte Kristjansen and Yuri Makeenko
Abstract: We reconsider the calculation of the one-loop effective action for an open Green-Schwarz superstring in the $AdS_5\times S^5$ background for a circular boundary loop. By an explicit computation of the ratio of relevant determinants, describing semi-classical fluctuations about the minimal surface in AdS and flat spaces, we show that it does not depend upon the AdS regularizing parameter $\epsilon$. The only dependence upon $\epsilon$ resides in the reparametrization path integral of the exponential of the classical boundary action. We analyze how the result depends on the choice of the boundary condition imposed on fluctuating fields and show that, despite the fact that the contribution of individual angular modes changes, the product over the modes remains unchanged.
