Title: Infra-red Divergences in Light-Front QED and Coherent State Basis
Authors: Jai D. More and Anuradha Misra
Abstract: We present a next to leading order calculation of electron mass renormalization in Light-Front Quantum Electrodynamics (LFQED) using old-fashioned time ordered perturbation theory (TOPT). We show that the true infrared divergences in $\delta m^2$ get canceled up to $O(e^4)$ if one uses coherent state basis instead of fock basis to calculate the transition matrix elements.
