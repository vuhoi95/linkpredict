Title: More About Branes on a General Magnetized Torus
Authors: L. De Angelis and R. Marotta and F. Pezzella and R. Troise
Abstract: In the framework of low-energy effective actions of branes compactified on magnetized extra-dimensions, we determine Yukawa couplings for the chiral matter described by open strings attached to D9 branes having different oblique magnetization and living on a general torus T6 with an arbitrary complex structure. These results generalize the ones existing in literature.
