Title: Supersymmetry of the Schrodinger and PP Wave Solutions in Einstein-Weyl  Supergravities
Authors: Hai-Shan Liu and H. Lu
Abstract: We obtain the Schrodinger and general pp-wave solutions with or without the massive vector in Einstein-Weyl supergravity. The vector is an auxiliary field in the off-shell supermultiplet and it acquires a kinetic term in the Weyl-squared super invariant. We study the supersymmetry of these solutions and find that turning on the massive vector has a consequence of breaking all the supersymmetry. The Schrodinger and also the pp-wave solutions with the massive vector turned off on the other hand preserve 1/4 of the supersymmetry.
