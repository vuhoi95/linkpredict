Title: Symmetries of N=4 supersymmetric CP(n) mechanics
Authors: S. Bellucci and N. Kozyrev and S. Krivonos and A. Sutulin
Abstract: We explicitly constructed the generators of $SU(n+1)$ group which commute with the supercharges of N=4 supersymmetric $\mathbb{CP}^n$ mechanics in the background U(n) gauge fields. The corresponding Hamiltonian can be represented as a direct sum of two Casimir operators: one Casimir operator on $SU(n+1)$ group contains our bosonic and fermionic coordinates and momenta, while the second one, on the SU(1,n) group, is constructed from isospin degrees of freedom only.
