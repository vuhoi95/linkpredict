Title: Brane Tilings and Specular Duality
Authors: Amihay Hanany and Rak-Kyeong Seong
Abstract: We study a new duality which pairs 4d N=1 supersymmetric quiver gauge theories. They are represented by brane tilings and are worldvolume theories of D3 branes at Calabi-Yau 3-fold singularities. The new duality identifies theories which have the same combined mesonic and baryonic moduli space, otherwise called the master space. We obtain the associated Hilbert series which encodes both the generators and defining relations of the moduli space. We illustrate our findings with a set of brane tilings that have reflexive toric diagrams.
