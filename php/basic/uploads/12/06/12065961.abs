Title: Relativistic kinematics beyond Special Relativity
Authors: J. M. Carmona and J. L. Cortes and F. Mercati
Abstract: In the context of departures from Special Relativity written as a momentum power expansion in the inverse of an ultraviolet energy scale M, we derive the constraints that the relativity principle imposes between coefficients of a deformed composition law, dispersion relation, and transformation laws, at first order in the power expansion. In particular, we find that, at that order, the consistency of a modification of the energy-momentum composition law fixes the modification in the dispersion relation. We therefore obtain the most generic modification of Special Relativity that preserves the relativity principle at leading order in 1/M.
