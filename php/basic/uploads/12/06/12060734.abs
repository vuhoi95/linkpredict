Title: Viscoelastic-electromagnetism and Hall viscosity
Authors: Yoshimasa Hidaka and Yuji Hirono and Taro Kimura and Yuki Minami
Abstract: We introduce a kind of electromagnetism, which we call viscoelastic-electromagnetism, to investigate viscoelastic transport phenomena. It is shown that Cartan's formalism of general relativity is essential for viscoelastic theory, and then the corresponding electric and magnetic fields are regarded as a velocity gradient and a Burgers vector density, respectively. As an application of this formalism, the Streda formula for the Hall viscosity is obtained.
