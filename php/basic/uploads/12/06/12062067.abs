Title: Diffusion constant of supercharge density in N=4 SYM at finite chemical  potential
Authors: Konstantina Kontoudi and Giuseppe Policastro
Abstract: We compute holographically the diffusion constant of supercharges in N=4 SYM at finite chemical potential for the R-charge, by solving the equations of motion for the transverse mode of the gravitino in the STU black hole in 5 dimensions. We consider the case of one charge and three charges, and we present analytical solutions for small values of the charges and numerical solutions for arbitrary values. We compare our results with other known results in 4 dimensions.
