Title: The supersymmetric black holes of N=8 supergravity
Authors: Tomas Ortin and C. S. Shahbazi
Abstract: Using the general results on the classification of timelike supersymmetric solutions of all 4-dimensional N >1 supergravity theories, we show how to construct all the supersymmetric (single- and multi-) black-hole solutions of N=8 supergravity.
