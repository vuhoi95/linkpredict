Title: Classical Solution for the Bounce Up to Second Order
Authors: Hatem Widyan and Mashhoor Al-Wardat
Abstract: Scalar field theory with asymmetric potential is studied for $\phi^4$ theory with $\phi^3$ symmetry breaking. The equations of motion are solved analytically up to the second order to get the bounce-solution.
