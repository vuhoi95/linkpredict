Title: Dissipative hydrodynamics for multi-component systems
Authors: Andrej El and Ioannis Bouras and Christian Wesp and Zhe Xu and Carsten Greiner
Abstract: Second-order dissipative hydrodynamic equations for each component of a multi-component system are derived using the entropy principle. Comparison of the solutions with kinetic transport results demonstrates validity of the obtained equations. We demonstrate how the shear viscosity of the total system can be calculated in terms of the involved cross sections and partial densities. Presence of the inter-species interactions leads to a characteristic time-dependence of the shear viscosity of the mixture, which also means that the shear viscosity of a mixture cannot be calculated using the Green-Kubo formalism the way it has been done recently. This finding is of interest for understanding of the shear viscosity of a quark-gluon-plasme extracted from comparisons of hydrodynamic simulations with experimental results from RHIC and LHC.
