Title: Baryon as dyonic instanton
Authors: A. Gorsky and A. Krikun
Abstract: We discuss the baryon in the holographic QCD framework and focus on the role of the bifundamental scalar field, realizing chiral symmetry breaking. We suggest the interpretation of a baryon as a dyonic instanton within the Atiyah-Manton-like approach for the flavor gauge group in the peculiar cylindrical ansatz in five-dimensional theory. Our approach provides the new mechanism of the stabilization of the baryon size.
