Abstract: In this work, we adopt the simplest model that spontaneously breaks supersymmetry, namely, the minimal O'Raifeartaigh model. The effective potential is computed in the framework of the linear delta expansion (LDE) approach up to the order $\delta^2$, conjugated with superspace and supergraph techniques. The latter can be duly mastered even if supersymmetry is no longer exact and the efficacy of the superfield approach in connection with the LDE procedure is confirmed according to our investigation. That opens up a way for a semi-nonperturbative superspace computation which allows us to deal with spontaneously broken supersymmetric models and encourages us to go further and apply this treatment to the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) precision tests.
