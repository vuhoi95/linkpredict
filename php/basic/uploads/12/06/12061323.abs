Abstract: In this note, we explain how asymptotically globally AdS spacetimes can be given an alternate dual description as entangled states of a pair of hyperbolic space CFTs, which are associated with complementary Rindler wedges of the AdS geometry. The reduced density matrix encoding the state of the degrees of freedom in one of these CFTs describes the physics in a single wedge, which we can think of as the region of spacetime accessible to an accelerated observer in AdS. For pure AdS, this density matrix is thermal, and we argue that the microstates in this thermal ensemble correspond to spacetimes that are almost indistinguishable from a Rindler wedge of pure AdS away from the horizon, but with the horizon replaced by some kind of singularity where the geometrical description breaks down. This alternate description of AdS, based on patches associated with particular observers, may give insight into the holographic description of cosmologies where no observer has access to the full spacetime.
