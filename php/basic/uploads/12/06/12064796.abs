Title: On topological restrictions of the spacetime in cosmology
Authors: T. Asselmeyer-Maluga and J. Krol
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the restrictions of the spacetime for the standard model of cosmology by using results of the differential topology of 3- and 4-manifolds. The smoothness of the cosmic evolution is the strongest restriction. The Poincare model (dodecaeder model), the Picard horn and the 3-torus are ruled out by the restrictions but a sum of two Poincare spheres is allowed.
