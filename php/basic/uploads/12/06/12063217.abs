Title: Symmetrically reduced Galileon equations and solutions
Authors: S. Deser and J. Franklin
Abstract: The maximally complicated arbitrary-dimensional "maximal" Galileon field equations simplify dramatically for symmetric configurations. Thus, spherical symmetry reduces the equations from the D- to the two-dimensional Monge-Ampere equation, axial symmetry to its cubic extension etc. We can then obtain explicit solutions, such as spherical or axial waves, and relate them to the (known) general, but highly implicit, lower-D solutions.
