Title: Closed string field theory in a-gauge
Authors: Masako Asano and Mitsuhiro Kato
Abstract: We show that a-gauge, a class of covariant gauges developed for bosonic open string field theory, is consistently applied to the closed string field theory. A covariantly gauge-fixed action of massless fields can be systematically derived from a-gauge-fixed action of string field theory.
