Title: Exceptional and Spinorial Conformal Windows
Authors: Matin Mojaza and Claudio Pica and Thomas A. Ryttov and Francesco Sannino
Abstract: We study the conformal window of gauge theories containing fermionic matter fields, where the gauge group is any of the exceptional groups with the fermions transforming according to the fundamental and adjoint representations and the orthogonal groups where the fermions transform according to a spinorial representation. We investigate the phase diagram using a purely perturbative four loop analysis, the all-orders beta function and the ladder approximation.
