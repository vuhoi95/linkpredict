Title: Quasi-Topological Quantum Field Theories and $Z_2$ Lattice Gauge  Theories
Authors: Miguel J. B. Ferreira and Victor A. Pereira and P. Teotonio-Sobrinho
Abstract: We consider a two parameter family of $Z_2$ gauge theories on a lattice discretization $T(M)$ of a 3-manifold $M$ and its relation to topological field theories. Familiar models such as the spin-gauge model are curves on a parameter space $\Gamma$. We show that there is a region $\Gamma_0$ of $\Gamma$ where the partition function and the expectation value $<W_R(\gamma)>$ of the Wilson loop for a curve $\gamma$ can be exactly computed. Depending on the point of $\Gamma_0$, the model behaves as topological or quasi-topological. The partition function is, up to a scaling factor, a topological number of $M$. The Wilson loop on the other hand, does not depend on the topology of $\gamma$. However, for a subset of $\Gamma_0$, $<W_R(\gamma)>$ depends on the size of $\gamma$ and follows a discrete version of an area law. At the zero temperature limit, the spin-gauge model approaches the topological and the quasi-topological regions depending on the sign of the coupling constant.
