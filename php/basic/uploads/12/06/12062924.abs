Title: Cosmic Strings as Emitters of Extremely High Energy Neutrinos
Authors: Cecilia Lunardini and Eray Sabancilar
Abstract: We study massive particle radiation from cosmic string kinks, and its observability in extremely high energy neutrinos. In particular, we consider the emission of moduli --- weakly coupled scalar particles predicted in supersymmetric theories --- from the kinks of cosmic string loops. Since kinks move at the speed of light on strings, moduli are emitted with large Lorentz factors, and eventually decay into many pions and neutrinos via hadronic cascades. The produced neutrino flux has energy $E \gtrsim 10^{11} \rm{GeV}$, and is affected by oscillations and absorption (resonant and non-resonant). It is observable at upcoming neutrino telescopes such as JEM-EUSO, and the radio telescopes LOFAR and SKA, for a range of values of the string tension, and of the mass and coupling constant of the moduli.
