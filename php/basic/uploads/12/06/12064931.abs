Abstract: We study SU(3)-invariant integrable models solvable by nested algebraic Bethe ansatz. Scalar products of Bethe vectors in such models can be expressed in terms of a bilinear combination of their highest coefficients. We obtain various different representations for the highest coefficient in terms of sums over partitions. We also obtain multiple integral representations for the highest coefficient.
