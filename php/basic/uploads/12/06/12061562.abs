Title: On a Recent Construction of "Vacuum-like" Quantum Field States in Curved  Spacetime
Authors: Christopher J. Fewster and Rainer Verch
Abstract: Afshordi, Aslanbeigi and Sorkin have recently proposed a construction of a distinguished "S-J state" for scalar field theory in (bounded regions of) general curved spacetimes. We establish rigorously that the proposal is well-defined on globally hyperbolic spacetimes or spacetime regions that can be embedded as relatively compact subsets of other globally hyperbolic spacetimes, and also show that, whenever the proposal is well-defined, it yields a pure quasifree state. However, by explicitly considering portions of ultrastatic spacetimes, we show that the S-J state is not in general a Hadamard state. In the specific case where the Cauchy surface is a round 3-sphere, we prove that the representation induced by the S-J state is generally not unitarily equivalent to that of a Hadamard state, and indeed that the representations induced by S-J states on nested regions of the ultrastatic spacetime also fail to be unitarily equivalent in general. The implications of these results are discussed.
