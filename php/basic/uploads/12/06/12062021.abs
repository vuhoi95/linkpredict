Title: String tension and area-law probed using quantum superposition
Authors: Erez Zohar and Benni Reznik
Abstract: We propose a method for measuring the string tension in gauge theories, by considering an interference effect of mesons, which is governed by a space-time area law, due to confinement. Although it is only a gedanken experiment for real elementary particles, in the context of quantum simulations of confining gauge theories such an experiment can be realized.
