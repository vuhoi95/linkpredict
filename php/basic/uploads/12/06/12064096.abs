Title: Extended gravity theories from dynamical noncommutativity
Authors: Paolo Aschieri and Leonardo Castellani
Abstract: In this paper we couple noncommutative (NC) vielbein gravity to scalar fields. Noncommutativity is encoded in a star product between forms, given by an abelian twist (a twist with commuting vector fields). A geometric generalization of the Seiberg-Witten map for abelian twists yields an extended theory of gravity coupled to scalars, where all fields are ordinary (commutative) fields. The vectors defining the twist can be related to the scalar fields and their derivatives, and hence acquire dynamics. Higher derivative corrections to the classical Einstein-Hilbert and Klein-Gordon actions are organized in successive powers of the noncommutativity parameter \theta^{AB}.
