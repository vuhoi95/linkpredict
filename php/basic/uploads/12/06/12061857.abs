Title: Deconstructing Supersymmetric S-matrices in D <= 2 + 1
Authors: Abhishek Agarwal and Donovan Young
Abstract: Global supersymmetries of the S-matrices of N = 2, 4, 8 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories in three spacetime dimensions (without matter hypermultiplets) are shown to be SU(1|1), SU(2|2) and SU(2|2) X SU(2|2) respectively. These symmetries are not manifest in the off-shell Lagrangian formulations of these theories. A direct map between these symmetries and their representations in terms of the Yang-Mills degrees of freedom and the corresponding quantities in Chern-Simons-Matter theories with N >= 4 supersymmetry is also obtained. Dimensional reduction of the on-shell observables of the Yang-Mills theories to two spacetime dimensions is also discussed.
