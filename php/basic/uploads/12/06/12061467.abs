Title: BPS States on M5-brane in Large C-field Background
Authors: Pei-Ming Ho and Chen-Te Ma and Chi-Hsien Yeh
Abstract: We extensively study BPS solutions of the low energy effective theory of M5-brane in large C-field background. This provides us an opportunity to explore the interactions turned on by C-field background through the Nambu-Poisson structure. The BPS states considered in this paper include the M-waves, the self-dual string (M2 ending on M5), tilted M5-brane, holomorphic embedding of M5-brane and the intersection of two M5-branes along a 3-brane.
