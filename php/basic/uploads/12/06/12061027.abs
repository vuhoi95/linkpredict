Title: Lifshitz fermionic theories with z=2 anisotropic scaling
Authors: H. Montani and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We construct fermionic Lagrangians with anisotropic scaling z=2, the natural counterpart of the usual z=2 Lifshitz field theories for scalar fields. We analyze the issue of chiral symmetry, construct the Noether axial currents and discuss the chiral anomaly giving explicit results for two-dimensional case. We also exploit the connection between detailed balance and the dynamics of Lifshitz theories to find different z=2 fermionic Lagrangians and construct their supersymmetric extensions.
