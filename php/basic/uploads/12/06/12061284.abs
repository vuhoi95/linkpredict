Abstract: We present a concise summary of recent results for the vector correlator in massless QCD at order ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^4)$, with all colour factors being given for a generic colour group. As a direct consequence we arrive at: (i) the full QCD contribution to the QED $\beta$--function of order $\alpha^2\, \alpha_s^4$ in the MSbar- and MOM-schemes; (ii) the full five-loop result of order $\alpha^6$ for the $\beta$-function of QED with a generic number of single-charged fermions, again for the MSbar- and MOM-schemes.
