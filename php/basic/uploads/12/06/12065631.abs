Title: Black body radiation in a model universe with large extra dimensions and  quantum gravity effects
Authors: Kourosh Nozari and F. Anvari
Abstract: We analyze the problem of black body radiation in a model universe with large extra dimensions where quantum gravity effects are taken into account through modified dispersion relations. In this context, modified form of Planck distribution, Jeans number, equipartition theorem, spectral energy density, Stefan-Boltzmann law and Wien's law are found and the corresponding results are interpreted. As a generic feature, the correction terms are temperature dependent. Then, the entropy and specific heat of black body radiation are obtained in this setup. Finally, modified form of Debye law and Dulong-Petit law are obtained and departure from standard results are explained.
