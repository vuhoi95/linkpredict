Authors: F. Cannata and M. V. Ioffe and D. N. Nishnianidze
Abstract: We study a class of quantum two-dimensional models with complex potentials of specific form. They can be considered as the generalization of a recently studied model with quadratic interaction not amenable to conventional separation of variables. In the present case, the property of shape invariance provides the equidistant form of the spectrum and the algorithm to construct eigenfunctions analytically. It is shown that the Hamiltonian is non-diagonalizable, and the resolution of identity must include also the corresponding associated functions. In the specific case of anharmonic second-plus-fourth order interaction, expressions for the wave functions and associated functions are constructed explicitly for the lowest levels, and the recursive algorithm to produce higher level wave functions is given.
