Title: "Meta" relativity: Against special relativity?
Authors: Jakub Rembielinski and Marta Wlodarczyk
Abstract: We introduce a Lorentz-covariant description of tachyons, free of inconsistencies. Our approach is based on an appropriate extension of the special relativity beyond the light barrier, owing to the freedom of synchronization of distant clocks.
