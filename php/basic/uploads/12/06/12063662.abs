Title: BV formulation of higher form gauge theories in a superspace
Authors: Sudhaker Upadhyay and Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: We discuss the extended BRST and anti-BRST symmetry (including shift symmetry) in the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formulation for two and three form gauge theories. Further we develop the superspace formulation for the BV actions for these theories. We show that the extended BRST invariant BV action for these theories can be written manifestly covariant manner in a superspace with one Grassmann coordinate. On the hand a superspace with two Grassmann coordinates are required for a manifestly covariant formulation of the extended BRST and extended anti-BRST invariant BV actions for higher form gauge theories.
