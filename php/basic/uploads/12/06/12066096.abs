Title: On Determining the Running Coupling from the Effective Action
Authors: D. G. C. McKeon and A. Patrushev
Abstract: The conformal anomaly has provided an expression for the effective action of gauge theories in the presence of a strong background field in terms of the running coupling constant. We exploit this result to find a novel expansion for the running coupling.
