Title: Supersymmetric Domain Walls
Authors: Eric A. Bergshoeff and Axel Kleinschmidt and Fabio Riccioni
Abstract: We classify the half-supersymmetric "domain walls", i.e. branes of codimension one, in toroidally compactified IIA/IIB string theory and show to which gauged supergravity theory each of these domain walls belong. We use as input the requirement of supersymmetric Wess-Zumino terms, the properties of the E11 Kac-Moody algebra and the embedding tensor formalism. We show that the number of half-supersymmetric domain walls is a multiple of the number of corresponding central charges in the supersymmetry algebra, where the multiplicity is related to the degeneracy of the BPS conditions.
