Title: TeV scale black holes thermodynamics with extra dimensions and quantum  gravity effects
Authors: Kourosh Nozari and P. Shahini
Abstract: TeV scale black hole thermodynamics in the presence of quantum gravity effects encoded in the existence of a minimal length and a maximal momentum is studied in a model universe with large extra dimensions.
