Title: Emergence of supersymmetry on the surface of three dimensional  topological insulators
Authors: Pedro Ponte and Sung-Sik Lee
Abstract: We propose two possible experimental realizations of a 2+1 dimensional spacetime supersymmetry at a quantum critical point on the surface of three dimensional topological insulators. The quantum critical point between the semi-metallic state with one Dirac fermion and the s-wave superconducting state on the surface is described by a supersymmetric conformal field theory within $\epsilon$-expansion. We predict the exact voltage dependence of the differential conductance at the supersymmetric critical point.
