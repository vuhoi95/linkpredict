Abstract: We study dynamics of non-minimally coupled scalar field cosmological models with Higgs-like potentials and a negative cosmological constant. In these models the inflationary stage of the Universe evolution changes into a quasi-cyclic stage of the Universe evolution with oscillation behaviour of the Hubble parameter from positive to negative values. Depending on the initial conditions the Hubble parameter can perform either one or several cycles before to become negative forever.
