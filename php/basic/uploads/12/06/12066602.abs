Title: Angles in Fuzzy Disc and Angular Noncommutative Solitons
Authors: Shinpei Kobayashi and Tsuguhiko Asakawa
Abstract: The fuzzy disc, introduced by the authors of Ref.[1], is a disc-shaped region in a noncommutative plane, and is a fuzzy approximation of a commutative disc. In this paper we show that one can introduce a concept of angles to the fuzzy disc, by using the phase operator and phase states known in quantum optics. We gave a description of a fuzzy disc in terms of operators and their commutation relations, and studied properties of angular projection operators. A similar construction for a fuzzy annulus is also given. As an application, we constructed fan-shaped soliton solutions of a scalar field theory on a fuzzy disc, which corresponds to a fan-shaped D-brane. We also applied this concept to the theory of noncommutative gravity that we proposed in Ref.[2]. In addition, possible connections to black hole microstates, holography and an experimental test of noncommutativity by laser physics are suggested.
