Title: Deformed Bubbles and Lorentz Invariance in Vacuum Decay
Authors: Michael Dine and Patrick Draper and Chang-Soon Park
Abstract: Recently, questions have been raised about the role of Lorentz invariance in false vacuum decay. It has been argued that infinities may arise in an integration over Lorentz-boosted final states. This suggestion motivates a Minkowski-space analysis of the decay rate. We attempt to illuminate features of the amplitude computation, and argue that the total rate including excitations is both finite and Lorentz invariant.
