Title: Radial excitations of Q-balls, and their D-term
Authors: Manuel Mai and Peter Schweitzer
Abstract: We study the structure of the energy-momentum tensor of radial excitations of Q-balls in scalar field theories with U(1) symmetry. The obtained numerical results for the $1\le N \le 23$ excitations allow us to study in detail patterns how the solutions behave with N. We show that although the fields and energy-momentum tensor densities exhibit a remarkable degree of complexity, the properties of the solutions scale with N with great regularity. This is to best of our knowledge the first study of the D-term d1 for excited states, and we demonstrate that it is negative --- in agreement with results from literature on the d1 of ground state particles.
