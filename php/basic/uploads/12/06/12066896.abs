Authors: Ruxandra Moraru and Natalia Saulina
Abstract: We compute the simplest non-trivial Operator Product Expansion of Wilson-'t Hooft loop operators in N=4 and N=2 Super-Yang-Mills theory with gauge group G=PSU(3). This amounts to finding the Euler characters of certain vector bundles, describing electric degrees of freedom of loop operators entering the OPE, over moduli spaces of BPS states in the presence of loop operators.
