Abstract: We discuss the phenomenology and cosmology of a Standard-like Model inspired by string theory, in which the gauge fields are localized on D-branes wrapping certain compact cycles on an underlying geometry, whose intersection can give rise to chiral fermions. The energy scale associated with string physics is assumed to be near the Planck mass. To develop our program in the simplest way, we work within the construct of a minimal model with gauge-extended sector U (3)_B \times Sp (1)_L \times U (1)_{I_R} \times U (1)_L. The resulting U (1) content gauges the baryon number B, the lepton number L, and a third additional abelian charge I_R which acts as the third isospin component of an SU(2)_R. All mixing angles and gauge couplings are fixed by rotation of the U(1) gauge fields to a basis diagonal in hypercharge Y and in an anomaly free linear combination of I_R and B-L. The anomalous $Z'$ gauge boson obtains a string scale St\"uckelberg mass via a 4D version of the Green-Schwarz mechanism. To keep the realization of the Higgs mechanism minimal, we add an extra SU(2) singlet complex scalar, which acquires a VEV and gives a TeV-scale mass to the non-anomalous gauge boson Z". The model is fully predictive and can be confronted with dijet and dilepton data from LHC8 and, eventually, LHC14. We show that M_{Z"} \approx 3 - 4 TeV saturates current limits from the CMS and ATLAS collaborations. We also show that for M_{Z"} \alt 5 TeV, LHC14 will reach discovery sensitivity \agt 5\sigma. After that, we demostrate in all generality that Z" milli-weak interactions could play an important role in observational cosmology. Finally, we examine some phenomenological aspects of the supersymmetric extension of the D-brane construct.
