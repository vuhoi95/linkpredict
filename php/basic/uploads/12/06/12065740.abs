Title: Emergent Critical Phase and Ricci Flow in a 2D Frustrated Heisenberg  Model
Authors: Peter P. Orth and Premala Chandra and Piers Coleman and JÃ¶rg Schmalian
Abstract: We introduce a two-dimensional frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet on interpenetrating honeycomb and triangular lattices. Classically the two sublattices decouple, and "order from disorder" drives them into a coplanar state. Applying Friedan's geometric approach to nonlinear sigma models, we show that the scaling of the spin-stiffnesses corresponds to the Ricci flow of a 4D metric tensor. At low temperatures, the relative phase between the spins on the two sublattices is described by a six-state clock model with an emergent critical phase.
