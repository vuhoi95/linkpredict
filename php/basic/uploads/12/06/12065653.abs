Title: The fate of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point in non-commutative Ï†^4
Authors: Badis Ydri and Adel Bouchareb
Abstract: In this article we study non-commutative vector sigma model with the most general \phi^4 interaction on Moyal-Weyl spaces. We compute the 2- and 4-point functions to all orders in the large N limit and then apply the approximate Wilson renormalization group recursion formula to study the renormalized coupling constants of the theory. The non-commutative Wilson-Fisher fixed point interpolates between the commutative Wilson-Fisher fixed point of the Ising universality class which is found to lie at zero value of the critical coupling constant a_* of the zero dimensional reduction of the theory, and a novel strongly interacting fixed point which lies at infinite value of a_* corresponding to maximal non-commutativity beyond which the two-sheeted structure of a_* as a function of the dilation parameter disappears.
