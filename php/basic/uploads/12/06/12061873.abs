Title: Seminal magnetic fields from Inflato-electromagnetic Inflation
Authors: Federico Agust√≠n Membiela and Mauricio Bellini
Abstract: We extend some previous attempts to explain the origin and evolution of primordial magnetic fields during inflation induced from a 5D vacuum. We show that the usual quantum fluctuations of a generalized 5D electromagnetic field cannot provide us with the desired magnetic seeds. We show that special fields without propagation on the extra non-compact dimension are needed to arrive to appreciable magnetic strengths. We also identify a new magnetic tensor field $B_{ij}$ in this kind of extra dimensional theories. Our results are in very good agreement with observational requirements, in particular from TeV Blazars and CMB radiation limits we obtain that primordial cosmological magnetic fields should be close scale invariance.
