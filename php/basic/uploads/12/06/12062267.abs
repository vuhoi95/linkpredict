Title: Information metric from Riemannian superspaces
Authors: Diego Julio Cirilo-Lombardo and Victor I. Afonso
Abstract: The Fisher's information metric is introduced in order to find the real meaning of the probability distribution in classical and quantum systems described by Riemaniann non-degenerated superspaces. In particular, the physical r\^{o}le played by the coefficients $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a}^\ast$ of the pure fermionic part of a genuine emergent metric solution, obtained in previous work is explored. To this end, two characteristic viable distribution functions are used as input in the Fisher definition: first, a Lagrangian generalization of the Hitchin Yang-Mills prescription and, second, the probability current associated to the emergent non-degenerate superspace geometry. Explicitly, we have found that the metric solution of the superspace allows establish a connexion between the Fisher metric and its quantum counterpart, corroborating early conjectures by Caianiello {\em et al.} This quantum mechanical extension of the Fisher metric is described by the $CP^1$ structure of the Fubini-Study metric, with coordinates $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{a}^\ast$.
