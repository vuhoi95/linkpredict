Title: On semiclassical four-point correlators in AdS_5 x S^5
Authors: D. Arnaudov and R. C. Rashkov
Abstract: Following the recent advances in the holographic calculation of n-point correlation functions with two "heavy" (with large quantum numbers) states at strong coupling, we extend these findings by computing specific four-point correlators of four heavy BMN operators in N=4 SYM.
