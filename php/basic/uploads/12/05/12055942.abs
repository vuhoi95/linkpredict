Title: Time operator in QFT with Virasoro constraints
Authors: Zhi-Yong Wang and Qi Qiu and Cai-Dong Xiong
Abstract: Time operator is studied on the basis of field quantization, where the difficulty stemming from Pauli's theorem is circumvented by borrowing ideas from the covariant quantization of the bosonic string, i.e., one can remove the negative energy states by imposing Virasoro constraints. Applying the index theorem, one can show that in a different subspace of a Fock space, there is a different self-adjoint time operator. However, the self-adjoint time operator in the maximal subspace of the Fock space can also represent the self-adjoint time operator in the other subspaces, such that it can be taken as the single, universal time operator. Furthermore, a new insight on Pauli's theorem is presented.
