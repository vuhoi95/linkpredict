Title: Quantum geometry of elliptic Calabi-Yau manifolds
Authors: Albrecht Klemm and Jan Manschot and Thomas Wotschke
Abstract: We study the quantum geometry of the class of Calabi-Yau threefolds, which are elliptic fibrations over a two-dimensional toric base. A holomorphic anomaly equation for the topological string free energy is proposed, which is iterative in the genus expansion as well as in the curve classes in the base. T-duality on the fibre implies that the topological string free energy also captures the BPS-invariants of D4-branes wrapping the elliptic fibre and a class in the base. We verify this proposal by explicit computation of the BPS invariants of 3 D4-branes on the rational elliptic surface.
