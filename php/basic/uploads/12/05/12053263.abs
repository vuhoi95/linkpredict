Title: Shell-crossings in Gravitational Collapse
Authors: Pankaj S. Joshi and Ravindra V. Saraykar
Abstract: While studying the continual gravitational collapse of a massive matter cloud in general relativity towards examining collapse final states, an important issue is that of whether shell-crossing singularities can develop as the collapse evolves. We examine this here to show that for any spherically symmetric collapse in general, there is always a finite neighborhood of the center in which there are no shell-crossings taking place. It follows that in order to study the final genuine shell-focusing singularity of collapse where the physical radius of the matter cloud shrinks to a vanishing value, we can always consider without any loss of generality a collapsing ball of a finite comoving radius in which there are no shell-crossings taking place. This clarifies an important point for gravitational collapse studies.
