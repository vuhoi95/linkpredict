Title: Near-BPS Skyrmions: Non-shell configurations and Coulomb effects
Authors: Eric Bonenfant and Louis Harbour and Luc Marleau
Abstract: The relatively small binding energy in nuclei suggests that they may be well represented by near-BPS Skyrmions since their mass is roughly proportional to the baryon number $A.$ For that purpose, we propose a generalization of the Skyrme model with terms up to order six in derivatives of the pion fields and treat the nonlinear $\sigma$ and Skyrme terms as small perturbations. For our special choice of mass term (or potential) $V$, we obtain well-behaved analytical BPS-type solutions with non-shell configurations for the baryon density, as opposed to the more complex shell-like configurations found in most extensions of the Skyrme model . Along with static and (iso)rotational energies, we add to the mass of the nuclei the often neglected Coulomb energy and isospin breaking term. Fitting the four model parameters, we find a remarkable agreement for the binding energy per nucleon $B/A$ with respect to experimental data. These results support the idea that nuclei could be near-BPS Skyrmions.
