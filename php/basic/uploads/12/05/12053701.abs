Title: Quasinormal modes and hidden conformal symmetry in the  Reissner-Nordstrom black hole
Authors: Yong-Wan Kim and Yun Soo Myung and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: It is shown that the scalar wave equation in the near-horizon limit respects a hidden SL(2,R) invariance in the Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) black hole spacetimes. We use the SL(2,R) symmetry to determine algebraically the purely imaginary quasinormal frequencies of the RN black hole. We confirm that these are exactly quasinormal modes of scalar perturbation around the near-extremal black hole.
