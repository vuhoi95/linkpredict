Title: Probes on D3-D7 Quark-Gluon Plasmas
Authors: A. Maga√±a and J. Mas and L. Mazzanti and J. Tarrio
Abstract: We study the holographic dual model of quenched flavors immersed in a quark-gluon plasma with massless dynamical quarks in the Veneziano limit. This is modeled by embedding a probe D7 brane in a background where the backreaction of massless D7 branes has been taken into account. The background, and hence the effects, are perturbative in the Veneziano parameter N_f/N_c, therefore giving small shifts of all magnitudes like the constituent mass, the quark condensate, and several transport coefficients. We provide qualitative results for the effect of flavor degrees of freedom on the probes. For example, the meson melting temperature is enhanced, while the screening length is diminished. The drag force is also enhanced.
