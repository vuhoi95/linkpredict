Abstract: We construct a holographic model for the superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) Josephson junction at zero temperature by considering a complex scalar field coupled with a Maxwell field in the four-dimensional anti-de Sitter soliton background. From the gravity side we reproduce the sine relation between the Josephson current and the phase difference across the junction. We also study the dependence of the maximal current on the dimension of the condensate operator and on the width of the junction, and obtain expected results.
