Title: Spontaneous Symmetry Breakdown in non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics
Authors: R. Munoz-Vega and A. Garcia-Quiroz and Ernesto Lopez-Chavez and Encarnacion Salinas-Hernandez
Abstract: The advantages and disadvantages of some pedagogical non-relativistic quantum-mechanical models, used to illustrate spontaneous symmetry breakdown, are discussed. A simple quantum-mechanical toy model (a spinor on the line, subject to a magnetostatic interaction) is presented, that exhibits the spontaneous breakdown of an internal symmetry.
