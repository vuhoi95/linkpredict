Title: Galois Field Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Lay Nam Chang and Zachary Lewis and Djordje Minic and Tatsu Takeuchi
Abstract: We construct a discrete quantum mechanics using a vector space over the Galois field GF(q). We find that the correlations in our model do not violate the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) version of Bell's inequality, despite the fact that the predictions of this discrete quantum mechanics cannot be reproduced with any hidden variable theory.
