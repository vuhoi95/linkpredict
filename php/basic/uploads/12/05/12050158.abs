Title: Minimal length, maximal momentum and Hilbert space representation of  quantum mechanics
Authors: Kourosh Nozari and Amir Etemadi
Abstract: Kempf et al. in Ref. [1] have formulated a Hilbert space representation of quantum mechanics with a minimal measurable length. Recently it has been revealed, in the context of doubly special relativity, that a test particles' momentum cannot be arbitrarily imprecise and therefore there is an upper bound for momentum fluctuations. Taking this achievement into account, we generalize the seminal work of Kempf {\it et al.} to the case that there is also a maximal particles' momentum. Existence of an upper bound for the test particles' momentum provides several novel and interesting features, some of which are studied in this paper.
