Title: Thermalization with a chemical potential from AdS spaces
Authors: Damian Galante and Martin Schvellinger
Abstract: The time-scale of thermalization in holographic dual models with a chemical potential in diverse number of dimensions is systematically investigated using the gauge/gravity duality. We consider a model with a thin-shell of charged dust collapsing from the boundary toward the bulk interior of asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spaces. In the outer region there is a Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS black hole (RNAdS-BH), while in the inner region there is an anti-de Sitter space. We consider renormalized geodesic lengths and minimal area surfaces as probes of thermalization, which in the dual quantum field theory (QFT) correspond to two-point functions and expectation values of Wilson loops, respectively. We show how the behavior of these extensive probes changes for charged black holes in comparison with Schwarzschild-AdS black holes (AdS-BH), for different values of the black hole mass and charge. The full range of values of the chemical potential over temperature ratio in the dual QFT is investigated. In all cases, the structure of the thermalization curves shares similar features with those obtained from the AdS-BH. On the other hand, there is an important difference in comparison with the AdS-BH: the thermalization times obtained from the renormalized geodesic lengths and the minimal area surfaces are larger for the RNAdS-BH, and they increase as the black hole charge increases.
