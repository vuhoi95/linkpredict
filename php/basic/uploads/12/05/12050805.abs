Authors: J. Sadeghi and A. Banijamali and H. Vaez
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the strong gravitational lensing in a charged squashed Kaluza-Klein black hole. We suppose that the supermassive black hole in the galaxy center can be considered by a charged squashed Kaluza-Klein black hole and then we study the strong gravitational lensing theory and estimate the numerical values for parameters and observables of it. We explore the effects of the scale of extra dimension $\rho_0$ and the charge of black hole $\rho_q$ on these parameters and observables.
