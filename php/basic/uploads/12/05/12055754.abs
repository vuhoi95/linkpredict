Title: General U(N) gauge transformations in the realm of covariant Hamiltonian  field theory
Authors: JÃ¼rgen Struckmeier and Hermine Reichau
Abstract: A consistent, local coordinate formulation of covariant Hamiltonian field theory is presented. While the covariant canonical field equations are equivalent to the Euler-Lagrange field equations, the covariant canonical transformation theory offers more general means for defining mappings that preserve the action functional - and hence the form of the field equations - than the usual Lagrangian description. Similar to the well-known canonical transformation theory of point dynamics, the canonical transformation rules for fields are derived from generating functions. As an interesting example, we work out the generating function of type F_2 of a general local U(N) gauge transformation and thus derive the most general form of a Hamiltonian density that is form-invariant under local U(N) gauge transformations.
