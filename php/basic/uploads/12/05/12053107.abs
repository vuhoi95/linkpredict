Title: Enhancement of Critical Temperature of a Striped Holographic  Superconductor
Authors: Suman Ganguli and Jimmy A. Hutasoit and George Siopsis
Abstract: We study the interplay between the stripe order and the superconducting order in a strongly coupled striped superconductor using gauge/gravity duality. In particular, we study the effects of inhomogeneity introduced by the stripe order on the superconducting transition temperature beyond the mean field level by including the effects of backreaction onto the spacetime geometry in the dual gravitational picture. We find that inhomogeneity \emph{enhances} the critical temperature relative to its value for the uniform system.
