Abstract: Following the work of Maldacena and Zhiboedov, we study the implementation of the Coleman-Mandula theorem in the free O(N)/Higher Spin correspondence. In the bi-local framework we first define an S-matrix for scattering of collective dipoles. Its evaluation in the case of free UV fixed point theory leads to the result S=1 stated in the title. We also present an appropriate field transformation that is seen to transform away all the non-linear 1/N interactions of this theory. A change of boundary conditions and/or external potentials results in a nontrivial S-matrix.
