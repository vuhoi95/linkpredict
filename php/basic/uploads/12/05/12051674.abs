Title: Expectation values of chiral primary operators in holographic interface  CFT
Authors: Koichi Nagasaki and Satoshi Yamaguchi
Abstract: We consider the expectation values of chiral primary operators in the presence of the interface in the 4 dimensional N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. This interface is derived from D3-D5 system in type IIB string theory. These expectation values are computed classically in the gauge theory side. On the other hand, this interface is a holographic dual to type IIB string theory on AdS_5 x S^5 spacetime with a probe D5-brane. The expectation values are computed by GKPW prescription in the gravity side. We find non-trivial agreement of these two results: the gauge theory side and the gravity side.
