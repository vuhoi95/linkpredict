Title: Bubble Nucleation of Spatial Vector Fields
Authors: Ali Masoumi and Xiao Xiao and I-Sheng Yang
Abstract: We study domain-walls and bubble nucleation in a non-relativistic vector field theory with different longitudinal and transverse speeds of sound. We describe analytical and numerical methods to calculate the orientation dependent domain-wall tension, $\sigma(\theta)$. We then use this tension to calculate the critical bubble shape. The longitudinally oriented domain-wall tends to be the heaviest, and sometime suffers an instability. It can spontaneously break into zigzag segments. In this case, the critical bubble develops kinks, and its energy, and therefore the tunneling rate, scales with the sound speeds very differently than what would be expected for a smooth bubble.
