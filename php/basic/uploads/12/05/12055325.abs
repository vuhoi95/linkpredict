Title: Horizon energy as the boost boundary term in general relativity and loop  gravity
Authors: Eugenio Bianchi and Wolfgang Wieland
Abstract: We show that the near-horizon energy introduced by Frodden, Ghosh and Perez arises from the action for general relativity as a horizon boundary term. Spin foam variables are used in the analysis. The result provides a derivation of the horizon boost Hamiltonian introduced by one of us to define the dynamics of the horizon degrees of freedom, and shows that loop gravity provides a realization of the horizon Schrodinger equation proposed by Carlip and Teitelboim.
