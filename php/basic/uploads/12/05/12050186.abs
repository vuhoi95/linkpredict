Title: The Multi-Regge limit of NMHV Amplitudes in N=4 SYM Theory
Authors: Lev Lipatov and Alexander Prygarin and Howard J. Schnitzer
Abstract: We consider the multi-Regge limit for N=4 SYM NMHV leading color amplitudes in two different formulations: the BFKL formalism for multi-Regge amplitudes in leading logarithm approximation, and superconformal N=4 SYM amplitudes. It is shown that the two approaches agree to two-loops for the 2->4 and 3->3 six-point amplitudes. Predictions are made for the multi-Regge limit of three loop 2->4 and 3->3 NMHV amplitudes, as well as a particular sub-set of two loop 2 ->2 +n N^kMHV amplitudes in the multi-Regge limit in the leading logarithm approximation from the BFKL point of view.
