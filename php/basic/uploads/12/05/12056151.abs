Title: Chiral Symmetry and the Residual Mass in Lattice QCD with the Optimal  Domain-Wall Fermion
Authors: Yu-Chih Chen and Ting-Wai Chiu
Abstract: We derive the axial Ward identity for lattice QCD with domain-wall fermions, and from which we obtain a formula for the residual mass (45)-(46), that can be used to measure the chiral symmetry breaking due to the finite extension Ns in the fifth dimension. Furthermore, we obtain an upper bound for the residual mass in lattice QCD with the optimal domain-wall fermion.
