Abstract: The ALADIN experiment aims at observing how the critical magnetic field of a superconducting Aluminum film is modified, when it constitutes one of the reflecting surfaces of a Casimir cavity. If successful, such an observation would reveal the influence of vacuum energy on the superconducting phase transition. In this paper a rigorous analysis of experimental data is reported, the results are discussed and compared with theoretical predictions based on Lifshitz theory of dispersion forces, and the BCS formula for the optical conductivity of superconductors. The main novelty with respect to a previous data analysis by some of the authors, is the use of a cross-correlation method which is more rigorous and leads to better estimates.
