Title: Coulomb-Gas Approach For Percolation Theory
Authors: Smain Balaska and Toufik Sahabi
Abstract: The aim of this work is to present a non trivial confirmation of the powerful of the Coulomb gas-techniques for Boundary Conformal Field Theory (BCFT). We show that we can re-derive the known Cardy result of percolation problem via the technics developed by S. Kawai in the Coulomb-Gas formalism.
