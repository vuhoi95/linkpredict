Title: Phase transition and scaling behavior of topological charged black holes  in Horava-Lifshitz gravity
Authors: Bibhas Ranjan Majhi and Dibakar Roychowdhury
Abstract: Gravity can be thought as an emergent phenomenon and it has a nice "thermodynamic" structure. In this context, it is then possible to study the thermodynamics without knowing the details of the underlying microscopic degrees of freedom. Here, based on the ordinary thermodynamics, we investigate the phase transition of the static, spherically symmetric charged black hole solution with arbitrary scalar curvature $2k$ in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity at the Lifshitz point $z=3$. The analysis is done using the canonical ensemble frame work; i.e. the charge is kept fixed. We find (a) for both $k=0$ and $k=1$, there is no phase transition, (b) while $k=-1$ case exhibits the second order phase transition within the {\it physical region} of the black hole. The critical point of second order phase transition is obtained by the divergence of the heat capacity at constant charge. Near the critical point, we find the various critical exponents. It is also observed that they satisfy the usual thermodynamic scaling laws.
