Title: Fermion condensation around a Coulomb impurity in a Weyl semimetal as a  manifestation of the Landau zero-charge problem
Authors: Eugene B. Kolomeisky and Joseph P. Straley
Abstract: A Coulomb impurity placed in an undoped Weyl semimetal spontaneously surrounds itself with a cloud of condensed Weyl fermions. We study this system within the Thomas-Fermi approximation. We find that the ground-state of the system is electrically neutral and exhibits an experimentally accessible Landau zero-charge effect: the impurity charge is screened out at any finite distance in the limit of vanishing impurity size. Specifically, we show how in this limit the Thomas-Fermi equation for the electrostatic potential transforms into the Gell-Mann-Low equation for the charge.
