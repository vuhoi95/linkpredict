Title: Quasi-Single Field Inflation with Large Mass
Authors: Xingang Chen and Yi Wang
Abstract: We study the effect of massive isocurvaton on density perturbations in quasi-single field inflation models, when the mass of the isocurvaton M becomes larger than the order of the Hubble parameter H. We analytically compute the correction to the power spectrum, leading order in coupling but exact for all values of mass. This verifies the previous numerical results for the range 0<M<3H/2 and shows that, in the large mass limit, the correction is of order H^2/M^2.
