Title: G-flux and Spectral Divisors
Authors: Moritz Kuntzler and Sakura Schafer-Nameki
Abstract: We propose a construction of G-flux in singular elliptic Calabi-Yau fourfold compactifications of F-theory, which in the local limit allow a spectral cover description. The main tool of construction is the so-called spectral divisor in the resolved Calabi-Yau geometry, which in the local limit reduces to the Higgs bundle spectral cover. We exemplify the workings of this in the case of an E_6 singularity by constructing the resolved geometry, the spectral divisor and in the local limit, the spectral cover. The G-flux constructed with the spectral divisor is shown to be equivalent to the direct construction from suitably quantized linear combinations of holomorphic surfaces in the resolved geometry, and in the local limit reduces to the spectral cover flux.
