Title: Shape of Clusters as a Probe of Screening Mechanisms in Modified Gravity
Authors: Claudio Llinares and David F. Mota
Abstract: Scalar fields are crucial components in high energy physics and extensions of General Relativity. The fact they are not observed in the solar system may be due to a mechanism which screens their presence in high dense regions. We show how observations of the ellipticity of galaxy clusters can discriminate between models with and without scalar fields and even between different screening mechanisms. Using nowadays X-ray observations we put novel constraints on the different models.
