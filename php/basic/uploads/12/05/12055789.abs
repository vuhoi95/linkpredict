Title: Mixed Wino-Axion Dark Matter in String/M Theory and the 130 GeV  Gamma-line "Signal"
Authors: Bobby Samir Acharya and Gordon Kane and Piyush Kumar and Ran Lu and Bob Zheng
Abstract: String/M theory compactifications with low energy supersymmetry tend to predict that dark matter has two components: axions and WIMPs \cite{1004.5138,1204.2795}. In accord with this, we show that the tentative 130 GeV gamma-line signal reported in \cite{1204.2797} can be interpreted as arising from the annihilation of 145 GeV mass, Wino-like WIMPs into a Z-boson and a photon. In this context, the signal implies a second component of dark matter which we interpret as being composed of axions - the relative Wino/Axion abundances being approximately equal. Further predictions are implied: signals in both diffuse and monochromatic photons from dwarf spheroidal galaxies; monochromatic photons with energy 145 GeV; for the LHC, the Higgs boson mass has been predicted in this framework \cite{1112.1059}, and the current Higgs limits provide interesting constraints on the mass of the Gluino.
