Title: Hidden Symmetries of Euclideanised Kerr-NUT-(A)dS Metrics in Certain  Scaling Limits
Authors: Mihai Visinescu and Gabriel Eduard Vilcu
Abstract: The hidden symmetries of higher dimensional Kerr-NUT-(A)dS metrics are investigated. In certain scaling limits these metrics are related to the Einstein-Sasaki ones. The complete set of Killing-Yano tensors of the Einstein-Sasaki spaces are presented. For this purpose the Killing forms of the Calabi-Yau cone over the Einstein-Sasaki manifold are constructed. Two new Killing forms on Einstein-Sasaki manifolds are identified associated with the complex volume form of the cone manifolds. Finally the Killing forms on mixed 3-Sasaki manifolds are briefly described.
