Title: Sigma Model BPS Lumps on Torus
Authors: Atsushi Nakamula and Shin Sasaki
Abstract: We study doubly periodic Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) lumps in supersymmetric CP^{N-1} non-linear sigma models on a torus T^2. Following the philosophy of the Harrington-Shepard construction of calorons in Yang-Mills theory, we obtain the n-lump solutions on compact spaces by suitably arranging the n-lumps on R^2 at equal intervals. We examine the modular invariance of the solutions and find that there are no modular invariant solutions for n=1,2 in this construction.
