Abstract: We define a distinguished "ground state" or "vacuum" for a free scalar quantum field in a globally hyperbolic region of an arbitrarily curved spacetime. Our prescription is motivated by the recent construction of a quantum field theory on a background causal set using only knowledge of the retarded Green's function. We generalize that construction to continuum spacetimes and find that it yields a distinguished vacuum or ground state for a non-interacting, massive or massless scalar field. This state is defined for all compact regions and for many noncompact ones. In a static spacetime we find that our vacuum coincides with the usual ground state. We determine it also for a radiation-filled, spatially homogeneous and isotropic cosmos, and show that the super-horizon correlations are approximately the same as those of a thermal state. Finally, we illustrate the inherent non-locality of our prescription with the example of a spacetime which sandwiches a region with curvature in-between flat initial and final regions.
