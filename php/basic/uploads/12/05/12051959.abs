Title: Giant Gravitons on AdS_4 x CP^3 and their Holographic Three-point  Functions
Authors: Shinji Hirano and Charlotte Kristjansen and Donovan Young
Abstract: We find a simple parametrization of the anti-symmetric giant graviton in AdS_4 x CP^3, first constructed in arXiv:1108.3084 [hep-th], dual to the anti-symmetric Schur polynomial involving two bi-fundamental complex scalar fields of ABJM theory. Using this parametrization we evaluate in a semi-classical approach the three-point function of two such giant gravitons and one point-like graviton considering both extremal and non-extremal configurations. We likewise discuss the case of the symmetric giant graviton in AdS_4 x CP^3. Finally, we provide an expression for the planar three-point function of chiral primary operators in ABJM at strong coupling and find that the results for the giant graviton three-point functions reduce to this expression in the point-like limit.
