Title: Three-point functions of BMN operators at weak and strong coupling II.  One loop matching
Authors: Gianluca Grignani and A. V. Zayakin
Abstract: In a previous paper, arXiv:1204.3096, we have shown that the fully dynamical three-point correlation functions of BMN operators are identical at the tree level in the planar limit of perturbative field theory and, on the string theory side, calculated by means of the Dobashi-Yoneya three string vertex in the Penrose limit. Here we present a one-loop calculation of the same quantity both on the field-theory and string-theory side, where a complete identity between the two results is demonstrated.
