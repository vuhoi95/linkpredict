Abstract: The concept of gauge invariance is one of the most subtle and useful concepts in modern theoretical physics. It is one of the Standard Model cornerstones. The main benefit due to the gauge invariance is that it can permit the comprehension of difficult systems in physics with an arbitrary choice of a reference frame at every instant of time. It is the objective of this work to show a path of obtaining gauge invariant theories from non-invariant ones. Both are named also as first- and second-class theories respectively, obeying Dirac's formalism. Namely, it is very important to understand why it is always desirable to have a bridge between gauge invariant and non-invariant theories. Once established, this kind of mapping between first-class (gauge invariant) and second-class systems, in Dirac's formalism can be considered as a sort of equivalence. This work describe this kind of equivalence obtaining a gauge invariant theory starting with a non-invariant one using the symplectic embedding formalism developed by some of us some years back. To illustrate the procedure it was analyzed both Abelian and non-Abelian theories. It was demonstrated that this method is more convenient than others. For example, it was shown exactly that this embedding method used here does not require any special modification to handle with non-Abelian systems.
