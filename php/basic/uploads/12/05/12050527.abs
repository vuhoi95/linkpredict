Title: An electrically charged doubly spinning dipole black ring
Authors: Jorge V. Rocha and Maria J. Rodriguez and Oscar Varela
Abstract: We present a new asymptotically flat, doubly spinning black ring of D = 5 Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory with Kaluza-Klein dilaton coupling. Besides the mass and two angular momenta, the solution displays both electric charge and (magnetic) dipole charge. The class of solutions that are free from conical singularities is described by four parameters. We first derive the solution in six dimensions employing the inverse scattering method, thereby generalising the inverse-scattering construction by two of the current authors of Emparan's singly spinning dipole black ring. The novel black ring itself arises upon circle Kaluza-Klein reduction. We also compute the main physical properties and asymptotic charges of our new class of solutions. Finally, we present a five-parameter generalisation of our solution.
