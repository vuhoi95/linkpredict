Title: Computation of open Gromov-Witten invariants for toric Calabi-Yau  3-folds by topological recursion, a proof of the BKMP conjecture
Authors: Bertrand Eynard and Nicolas Orantin
Abstract: The BKMP conjecture (2006-2008), proposed a new method to compute closed and open Gromov-Witten invariants for every toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds, through a topological recursion based on mirror symmetry. So far, this conjecture had been verified to low genus for several toric CY3folds, and proved to all genus only for C^3. In this article we prove the general case. Our proof is based on the fact that both sides of the conjecture can be naturally written in terms of combinatorial sums of weighted graphs: on the A-model side this is the localization formula, and on the B-model side the graphs encode the recursive algorithm of the topological recursion. One can slightly reorganize the set of graphs obtained in the B-side, so that it coincides with the one obtained by localization in the A-model.Then it suffices to compare the weights of vertices and edges of graphs on each side, which is done in 2 steps: the weights coincide in the large radius limit, due to the fact that the toric graph is the tropical limit of the mirror curve. Then the derivatives with respect to K\"ahler radius coincide due to special geometry property implied by the topological recursion.
