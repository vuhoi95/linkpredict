Title: Theta dependence of the deconfinement temperature in Yang-Mills theories
Authors: Massimo D'Elia and Francesco Negro
Abstract: We determine the theta dependence of the deconfinement temperature of SU(3) pure gauge theory, finding that it decreases in presence of a topological theta term. We do that by performing lattice simulations at imaginary theta, then exploiting analytic continuation. We also give an estimate of such dependence in the limit of a large number of colors N, and compare it with our numerical results.
