Title: Exceptional Operators in N=4 super Yang-Mills
Authors: Gleb Arutyunov and Sergey Frolov and Alessandro Sfondrini
Abstract: We consider one particularly interesting class of composite gauge-invariant operators in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. An exceptional feature of these operators is that in the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz approach the one-loop rapidities of the constituent magnons are shown to be exact in the 't Hooft coupling constant. This is used to propose the mirror TBA description for these operators. The proposal is shown to pass several non-trivial checks.
