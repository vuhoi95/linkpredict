Title: A Note on Vacuum Polarisation and Hawking Radiation
Authors: Arundhati Dasgupta and Shohreh Rahmati
Abstract: We re-examine vacuum polarisation of a scalar field in a quasi-local volume including the horizon. We find that Hawking radiation rate is derived as a pure decay of vacuum due to scalar field interaction with classical gravity exactly in the same way as the origin of vacuum polarisation effect in Electrodynamics.
