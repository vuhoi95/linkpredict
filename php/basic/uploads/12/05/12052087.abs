Abstract: We construct a one-parameter family of five-dimensional N=2 supergravity Lagrangians with an SU(2,1) / U(2) hypermultiplet. For certain values of the parameter, these are argued to describe the dynamics of scalar modes of superstrings on AdS_5 x T^{1,1}, and therefore to be dual to specific chiral primary operators of Klebanov-Witten superconformal field theory. We demonstrate that, below a critical temperature, the thermodynamics is dominated by charged black holes with hair for the scalars that are dual to the operator of lowest conformal dimension 3/2. The system thus enters into a superconducting phase where <Tr[A_k B_l]> condenses.
