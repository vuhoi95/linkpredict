Title: The One-Loop Effective KÃ¤hler Potential. I: Chiral Multiplets
Authors: Raphael Flauger and Simeon Hellerman and Cornelius Schmidt-Colinet and Matthew Sudano
Abstract: We derive a universal formula for the one-loop renormalization of the effective K\"ahler potential that applies to general supersymmetric effective field theories of chiral multiplets, with arbitrary interactions respecting N=1 supersymmetry in four dimensions. The resulting expression depends only on the tree-level mass spectrum and the form of the regulator. This formula simplifies and generalizes existing results in the literature. We include two examples to illustrate its use.
