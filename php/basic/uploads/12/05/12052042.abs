Title: The issue of zeroth law for Killing horizons in Lanczos-Lovelock gravity
Authors: Sudipta Sarkar and Swastik Bhattacharya
Abstract: We study the zeroth law for Killing horizons in Lanczos-Lovelock gravity. We show that the surface gravity of a general Killing horizon in Lanczos-Lovelock gravity (except for general relativity) may not be constant even when the matter source satisfies dominant energy condition.
