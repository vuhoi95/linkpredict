Title: 3D Dynamics of 4D Topological BF Theory With Boundary
Authors: Andrea Amoretti and Alberto Blasi and Nicola Maggiore and Nicodemo Magnoli
Abstract: We consider the four dimensional abelian topological BF theory with a planar boundary introduced following the Symanzik's method. We find the most general boundary conditions compatible with the fields equations broken by the boundary. The residual gauge invariance is described by means of two Ward identities which generate an algebra of conserved currents. We interpret this algebra as canonical commutation relations of fields, which we use to construct a three dimensional Lagrangian. As a remarkable by-product, the (unique) boundary condition which we found, can be read as a duality relation between 3D dynamical variables.
