Title: Holographic QCD: Past, Present, and Future
Authors: Youngman Kim and Ik Jae Shin and Takuya Tsukioka
Abstract: At the dawn of a new theoretical tool based on the AdS/CFT correspondence for nonperturbative aspects of quantum chromodynamics, we give an interim review on the new tool, holographic QCD, with some of its accomplishment. We try to give an A-to-Z picture of the holographic QCD, from string theory to a few selected top-down holographic QCD models with one or two physical applications in each model. We may not attempt to collect diverse results from various holographic QCD model studies.
