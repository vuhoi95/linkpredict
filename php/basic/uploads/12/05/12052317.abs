Title: Absorption cross section in Lifshitz black hole
Authors: Taeyoon Moon and Yun Soo Myung
Abstract: We derive the absorption cross section of a minimally coupled scalar in the Lifshitz black hole obtained from the new massive gravity. The absorption cross section reduces to the horizon area in the low energy and massless limit of s-wave mode propagation, indicating that the Lifshitz black hole also satisfies the universality of low energy absorption cross section for black holes.
