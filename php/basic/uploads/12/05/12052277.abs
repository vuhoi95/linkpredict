Title: Off-Shell Hodge Dualities in Linearised Gravity and E11
Authors: Nicolas Boulanger and Paul P. Cook and Dmitry Ponomarev
Abstract: In a spacetime of dimension n, the dual graviton is characterised by a Young diagram with two columns, the first of length n-3 and the second of length one. In this paper we perform the off-shell dualisation relating the dual graviton to the double-dual graviton, displaying the precise off-shell field content and gauge invariances. We then show that one can further perform infinitely many off-shell dualities, reformulating linearised gravity in an infinite number of equivalent actions. The actions require supplementary mixed-symmetry fields which are contained within the generalised Kac-Moody algebra E11 and are associated with null and imaginary roots.
