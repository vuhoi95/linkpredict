Title: More about "short" spinning quantum strings
Authors: Matteo Beccaria and Arkady A. Tseytlin
Abstract: We continue investigation of the spectrum of semiclassical quantum strings in AdS5 x S5 on the examples of folded (S,J) string (with spin S in AdS5 and orbital momentum J in S5) dual to an sl(2) sector state in gauge theory and its (J',J) counterpart with spin J' in S5 dual to an su(2) sector state. We study the limits of small spins and large J at weak and strong coupling, pointing out that terms linear in spins provide a generalization of "protected" coefficients in the energy that are given by finite polynomials in 't Hooft coupling \lambda\ (or square of string tension) for any value of \lambda. We propose an expression for the coefficient of the term linear in spin J' in the (J',J) string energy which should be the su(2) sector counterpart of the "slope function" in the sl(2) sector suggested by Basso in arXiv:1109.3154.
