Title: Three-loop Î²-functions for top-Yukawa and the Higgs self-interaction  in the Standard Model
Authors: K. G. Chetyrkin and M. F. Zoller
Abstract: We analytically compute the dominant contributions to the \beta-functions for the top-Yukawa coupling, the strong coupling and the Higgs self-coupling as well as the anomalous dimensions of the scalar, gluon and quark fields in the unbroken phase of the Standard Model at three-loop level. These are mainly the QCD and top-Yukawa corrections. The contributions from the Higgs self-interaction which are negligible for the running of the top-Yukawa and the strong coupling but important for the running of the Higgs self-coupling are also evaluated.
