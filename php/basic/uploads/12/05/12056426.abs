Title: Approaching the RSOS critical points through entanglement: one model for  many universalities
Authors: Andrea De Luca and Fabio Franchini
Abstract: We analytically compute the Renyi entropies for the RSOS models, representing a wide class of exactly solvable models with multicritical conformal points described by unitary minimal models and $\mathbb{Z}_n$ parafermions. The exact expressions allow for an explicit comparison of the expansions around the critical points with the predictions coming from field theory. In this way it is possible to point out the nature of the so-called "unusual corrections", clarifying the link with the operator content, the role of the symmetries and the boundary conditions. By choosing different boundary conditions, we can single out the ground states as well as certain combinations of high energy states. We find that the {\it entanglement spectrum} is given by operators that are not present in the bulk Hamiltonian, although they belong to the same representation of a Virasoro Algebra. In the parafermionic case we observe unexpected logarithmic corrections.
