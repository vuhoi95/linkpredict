Title: Relativistic Quantum Information in Detectors-Field Interactions
Authors: B. L. Hu and Shih-Yuin Lin and Jorma Louko
Abstract: We review Unruh-DeWitt detectors and other models of detector-field interaction in a relativistic quantum field theory setting as a tool for extracting detector-detector, field-field and detector-field correlation functions of interest in quantum information science, from entanglement dynamics to quantum teleportation. We in particular highlight the contrast between the results obtained from linear perturbation theory which can be justified provided switching effects are properly accounted for, and the nonperturbative effects from available analytic expressions which incorporate the backreaction effects of the quantum field on the detector behaviour.
