Title: Building SO(10) models from F-theory
Authors: I. Antoniadis and G. K. Leontaris
Abstract: We revisit local F-theory SO(10) and SU(5) GUTs and analyze their properties within the framework of the maximal underlying E_8 symmetry in the elliptic fibration. We consider the symmetry enhancements along the intersections of seven-branes with the GUT surface and study in detail the embedding of the abelian factors undergoing monodromies in the covering gauge groups. We combine flux data from the successive breaking of SO(10) to SU(5) gauge symmetry and subsequently to the Standard Model one, and further constrain the parameters determining the models' particle spectra. In order to eliminate dangerous baryon number violating operators we propose ways to construct matter parity like symmetries from intrinsic geometric origin. We study implementations of the resulting constrained scenario in specific examples obtained for a variety of monodromies.
