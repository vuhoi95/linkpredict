Title: Gravitational collapse of charged dust cloud in the Lovelock gravity
Authors: Seiju Ohashi and Tetsuya Shiromizu and Sanjay Jhingan
Abstract: We study the effect of charge on gravitational collapse of inhomogeneous dust cloud in the Einstein, Gauss-Bonnet and Lovelock gravity. Dynamics of the collapsing shell is analyzed. The conditions for the occurrence of bounce during collapse are given. We also show that shell crossing occurs inevitably if the shell near the center is weakly charged.
