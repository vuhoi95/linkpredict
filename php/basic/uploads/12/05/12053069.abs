Title: On a family of (1+1)-dimensional scalar field theory models: kinks,  stability, one-loop mass shifts
Authors: Alberto Alonso-Izquierdo and Juan Mateos-Guilarte
Abstract: In this paper we construct a one-parametric family of (1+1)-dimensional one-component scalar field theory models supporting kinks. Inspired by the sine-Gordon and $\phi^4$ models, we look at all possible extensions such that the kink second-order fluctuation operators are Schr\"odinger differential operators with P\"oschl-Teller potential wells. In this situation, the associated spectral problem is solvable and therefore we shall succeed in analyzing the kink stability completely and in computing the one-loop quantum correction to the kink mass exactly. When the parameter is a natural number, the family becomes the hierarchy for which the potential wells are reflectionless, the two first levels of the hierarchy being the sine-Gordon and $\phi^4$ models.
