Title: Possibility of Electroweak Phase Transition at Low Temperature
Authors: Jeremiah Birrell and Johann Rafelski
Abstract: We study models of strong first order `low' temperature electroweak phase transition. To achieve this we propose a class of Higgs effective potential models which preserve the known features of the present day massive phase. However, the properties of the symmetry restored massless phase are modified in a way that for a large parameter domain we find a strong first order transition occurring at a temperature hundreds of times lower than previously considered possible.
