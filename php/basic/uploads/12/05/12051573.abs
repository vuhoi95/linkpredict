Abstract: In this paper, we study the logarithmic terms in the partition functions of CFTs with boundaries (BCFTs). In three dimensions, their coefficients give the boundary central charges, which are conjectured to be monotonically decreasing functions under the RG flows. We present a few supporting evidences from field theory calculations. In two dimensions, we give a holographic construction (AdS/BCFT) for an arbitrary shape of boundary and calculate its logarithmic term as well as boundary energy momentum tensors, confirming its consistency with the Weyl anomaly. Moreover, we give perturbative solutions of gravity duals for the three dimensional BCFTs with any shapes of boundaries. We find that the standard Fefferman-Graham expansion breaks down for generic choices of BCFT boundaries.
