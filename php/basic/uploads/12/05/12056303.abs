Title: Minimum black hole mass from colliding Gaussian packets
Authors: R. Casadio and O. Micu and A. Orlandi
Abstract: We study the formation of a black hole in the collision of two Gaussian packets. Rather than following their dynamical evolution in details, we assume a horizon forms when the mass function for the two packets becomes larger than half the flat areal radius, as it would occur in a spherically symmetric geometry. This simple approximation allows us to determine the existence of a minimum black hole mass solely related to the width of the packets. We then comment on the possible physical implications, both in classical and quantum physics, and models with extra spatial dimensions.
