Title: Nongeometric background arising in the solution of Neumann boundary  conditions
Authors: Lj. Davidović and B. Sazdović
Abstract: We investigate the open string propagation in the weakly curved background with the Kalb-Ramond field containing an infinitesimal part, linear in coordinate. Solving the Neumann boundary conditions, we find the expression for the space-time coordinates in terms of the effective ones. So, the initial theory reduces to the effective one. This effective theory is defined on the nongeometric doubled space $(q^\mu,\tilde{q}_\mu)$, where $q^\mu$ is the effective coordinate and $\tilde{q}_\mu$ is its T-dual. The effective metric depends on the coordinate $q^\mu$ and there exists non-trivial effective Kalb-Ramond field which depends on the T-dual coordinate $\tilde{q}_\mu$. The fact that $\tilde{q}_\mu$ is $\Omega$-odd leads to the nonvanishing effective Kalb-Ramond field.
