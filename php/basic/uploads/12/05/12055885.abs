Title: Supermembrane interaction with dynamical D=4 N=1 supergravity.  Superfield Lagrangian description and spacetime equations of motion
Authors: Igor A. Bandos and Carlos Meliveo
Abstract: We obtain the complete set of equations of motion for the interacting system of supermembrane and dynamical D=4 N = 1 supergravity by varying its complete superfield action and writing the resulting superfield equations in the special gauge where the supermembrane Goldstone field is set to zero. We solve the equations for auxiliary fields and discuss the effect of dynamical generation of cosmological constant in the Einstein equation of interacting system and its renormalization due to some regular contributions from supermembrane. These two effects (discussed in late 70th and 80th, in the bosonic perspective and in the supergravity literature) result in that, generically, the cosmological constant has different values in the branches of the spacetime separated by the supermembrane worldvolume.
