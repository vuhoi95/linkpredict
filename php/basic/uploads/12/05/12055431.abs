Title: Asymptotic Safety, Fractals, and Cosmology
Authors: Martin Reuter and Frank Saueressig
Abstract: These lecture notes introduce the basic ideas of the Asymptotic Safety approach to Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG). In particular they provide the background for recent work on the possibly multifractal structure of the QEG space-times. Implications of Asymptotic Safety for the cosmology of the early Universe are also discussed.
