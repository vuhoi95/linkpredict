Title: Towards a Realization of the Condensed-Matter/Gravity Correspondence in  String Theory via Consistent Abelian Truncation
Authors: Asadig Mohammed and Jeff Murugan and Horatiu Nastase
Abstract: We present an embedding of the 3-dimensional relativistic Landau-Ginzburg model for condensed matter systems in an $\mathcal{N}=6$, $U(N)\times U(N)$ Chern-Simons-matter theory (the ABJM model) by consistently truncating the latter to an abelian effective field theory encoding the collective dynamics of ${\cal O}(N)$ of the ${\cal O}(N^2)$ modes. In fact, depending on the VEV on one of the ABJM scalars, a mass deformation parameter $\mu$ and the Chern-Simons level number $k$, our abelianization prescription allows us to interpolate between the abelian Higgs model with its usual multi-vortex solutions and a $\phi^4$ theory. We sketch a simple condensed matter model that reproduces all the salient features of the abelianization. In this context, the abelianization can be interpreted as giving a dimensional reduction from four dimensions.
