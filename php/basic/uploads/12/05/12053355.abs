Title: Twisted bosonization in two dimensional noncommutative spacetime
Authors: Asrarul Haque and T. R. Govindarajan
Abstract: We study the twisted bosonization of massive Thirring model to relate to sine-Gordon model in Moyal spacetime using twisted commutation relations. We obtain the relevant twisted bosonization rules. We show that there exists dual rela- tionship between twisted bosonic and fermionic operators. The strong-weak duality is also observed to be preserved as its commutative counterpart.
