Abstract: The two-dimensional supersymmetric gauged linear sigma model (GLSM) with abelian gauge groups and matter fields has provided many insights into string theory on Calabi--Yau manifolds of a certain type: complete intersections in toric varieties. In this paper, we consider two GLSM constructions with nonabelian gauge groups and charged matter whose infrared CFTs correspond to string propagation on determinantal Calabi-Yau varieties, furnishing another broad class of Calabi-Yau geometries in addition to complete intersections. We show that these two models -- which we refer to as the PAX and the PAXY model -- are dual descriptions of the same low-energy physics. Using GLSM techniques, we determine the quantum K\"ahler moduli space of these varieties and find no disagreement with existing results in the literature.
