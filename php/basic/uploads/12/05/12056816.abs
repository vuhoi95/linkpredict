Title: A New Theory of Anyons
Authors: A. Liam Fitzpatrick and Shamit Kachru and Jared Kaplan and Emanuel Katz and Jay G. Wacker
Abstract: We study a 2+1 dimensional theory of bosons and fermions with an omega ~ k^2 dispersion relation. The most general interactions consistent with specific symmetries impart fractional statistics to the fermions. Unlike examples involving Chern-Simons gauge theories, our statistical phases derive from the exchange of gapless propagating bosons with marginal interactions. Even though no gap exists, we show that the anyonic statistics are precisely defined. Symmetries combine with the vacuum structure to guarantee the non-renormalization of our anyonic phases.
