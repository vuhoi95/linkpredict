Title: Caged black hole with Maxwell charge
Authors: Ryotaku Suzuki and Shunichiro Kinoshita and Tetsuya Shiromizu
Abstract: We construct the perturbative solution of the charged black hole in the Kaluza-Klein spacetime with the matched asymptotic expansion method. The corrections to the thermodynamic variables are calculated up to the post-Newtonian order. We confirmed that the method can work very well in the Einstein-Maxwell theory.
