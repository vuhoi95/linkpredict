Title: The holographic quantum effective potential at finite temperature and  density
Authors: Elias Kiritsis and Vasilis Niarchos
Abstract: We develop a formalism that allows the computation of the quantum effective potential of a scalar order parameter in a class of holographic theories at finite temperature and charge density. The effective potential is a valuable tool for studying the ground state of the theory, symmetry breaking patterns and phase transitions. We derive general formulae for the effective potential and apply them to determine the phase transition temperature and density in the scaling region.
