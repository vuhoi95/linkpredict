Title: A Dirac type xp-Model and the Riemann Zeros
Authors: Kumar S. Gupta and E. Harikumar and Amilcar R. de Queiroz
Abstract: We propose a Dirac type modification of the xp-model to a $x \slashed{p}$ model on a semi-infinite cylinder. This model is inspired by recent work by Sierra et al on the xp-model on the half-line. Our model realizes the Berry-Keating conjecture on the Riemann zeros. We indicate the connection of our model to that of gapped graphene with a supercritical Coulomb charge, which might provide a physical system for the study of the zeros of the Riemann Zeta function.
