Title: Weyl-Weyl Correlator in de Donder Gauge on de Sitter
Authors: P. J. Mora and N. C. Tsamis and R. P. Woodard
Abstract: We compute the linearized Weyl-Weyl correlator using a new solution for the graviton propagator on de Sitter background in de Donder gauge. The result agrees exactly with a previous computation in a noncovariant gauge. We also use dimensional regularization to compute the one loop expectation value of the square of the Weyl tensor.
