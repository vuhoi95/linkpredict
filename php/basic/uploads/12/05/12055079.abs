Title: Universality in all-order $Î±'$ corrections to BPS/non-BPS brane  world volume theories
Authors: Ehsan Hatefi and I. Y. Park
Abstract: Knowledge of all-$\alpha'$ higher derivative corrections to leading order BPS and non-BPS brane actions would serve in future endeavor of determining the complete form of the non-abelian BPS and tachyonic effective actions. In this paper, we note that there is a universality in the all-$\alpha'$ order corrections to BPS and non-BPS branes. We compute amplitudes between one Ramond-Ramond $C$-field vertex operator and several SYM gauge/scalar vertex operators. Specifically, we evaluate in closed form string correlators of two-point amplitudes $\cal A^{C\phi}$, $\cal A^{CA}$, a three-point amplitude $\cal A^{C\phi\phi}$ and a four-point amplitude $\cal A^{C\phi\phi\phi}$. We carry out pole and contact term analysis. In particular we reproduce some of the contact terms and the infinite massless poles of $\cal A^{C\phi\phi\phi}$ by SYM vertices obtained through the universality.
