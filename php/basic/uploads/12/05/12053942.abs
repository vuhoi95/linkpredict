Title: Quantum harmonic oscillator for dipoles
Authors: Cleverson Filgueiras and D. Cogollo and E. O. Silva
Abstract: In this work we investigate which radial field configuration yields bound states for neutral particles showing non-zero magnetic and electric dipole moments. The main result is that, in contrast with previous works, the Landau analog levels only exist if these radial magnetic and electric external fields are proportional to the third power of distance, not proportional to the distance. We derive the wave functions and the energy levels in the context of commutative and non-commutative quantum mechanics. We also show that, in the case of non-commutative phase space, these harmonic oscillator like spectrum do exist even if there is no external radial magnetic and electric fields. They are only consequence of the non-commutativity in the momenta.
