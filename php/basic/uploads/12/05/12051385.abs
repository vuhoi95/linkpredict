Title: Non-linear Realizations, Goldstone bosons of broken Lorentz rotations  and effective actions for p-branes
Authors: Joaquim Gomis and Kiyoshi Kamimura and Josep M. Pons
Abstract: We consider the non-linear realizations of the Poincare group for p-branes with local subgroup SO(1,p)*SO(D-(p+1)). The Nambu-Goto p-brane action is constructed using the Maurer Cartan forms of the unbroken translations. We perform a throughout phase space analysis of the action and show that it leads to the canonical action of a p-brane. We also construct some higher order derivative terms of the effective p-brane action using the MC forms of the broken Lorentz transformations.
