Title: T-duality in the weakly curved background
Authors: Lj. Davidović and B. Sazdović
Abstract: We consider the closed string propagating in the weakly curved background which consists of constant metric and Kalb-Ramond field with infinitesimally small coordinate dependent part. We propose the procedure for constructing the T-dual theory, performing T-duality transformations along coordinates on which the Kalb-Ramond field depends. The obtained theory is defined in the non-geometric double space, described by the Lagrange multiplier $y_\mu$ and its $T$-dual $\tilde{y}_\mu$. We apply the proposed T-duality procedure to the T-dual theory and obtain the initial one. We discuss the standard relations between T-dual theories that the equations of motion and momenta modes of one theory are the Bianchi identities and the winding modes of the other.
