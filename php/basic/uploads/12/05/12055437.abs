Title: Black rings in more than five dimensions
Authors: Burkhard Kleihaus and Jutta Kunz and Eugen Radu
Abstract: We construct balanced black ring solutions in $d\geq 6$ spacetime dimensions, by solving the Einstein field equations numerically with suitable boundary conditions. The black ring solutions have a regular event horizon with $S^1\times S^{d-3}$ topology, and they approach the Minkowski background asymptotically. We analyze their global and horizon properties. The Smarr formula is well satisfied.
