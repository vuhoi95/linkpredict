Title: Holographic dilepton production in a thermalizing plasma
Authors: Rudolf Baier and Stefan A. Stricker and Olli Taanila and Aleksi Vuorinen
Abstract: We determine the out-of-equilibrium production rate of dileptons at rest in strongly coupled N=4 Super Yang-Mills plasma using the AdS/CFT correspondence. Thermalization is achieved via the gravitational collapse of a thin shell of matter in AdS_5 space and the subsequent formation of a black hole, which we describe in a quasistatic approximation. Prior to thermalization, the dilepton spectral function is observed to oscillate as a function of frequency, but the amplitude of the oscillations decreases when thermal equilibrium is approached. At the same time, we follow the flow of the quasinormal spectrum of the corresponding U(1) vector field towards its equilibrium limit.
