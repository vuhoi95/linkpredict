Title: Supersymmetry on Curved Spaces and Holography
Authors: Claudius Klare and Alessandro Tomasiello and Alberto Zaffaroni
Abstract: We study superconformal and supersymmetric theories on Euclidean four- and three-manifolds with a view toward holographic applications. Preserved supersymmetry for asymptotically locally AdS solutions implies the existence of a (charged) "conformal Killing spinor" on the boundary. We study the geometry behind the existence of such spinors. We show in particular that, in dimension four, they exist on any complex manifold. This implies that a superconformal theory has at least one supercharge on any such space, if we allow for a background field (in general complex) for the R-symmetry. We also show that this is actually true for any supersymmetric theory with an R-symmetry. We also analyze the three-dimensional case and provide examples of supersymmetric theories on Sasaki spaces.
