Title: A modified N=2 extended supersymmetry
Authors: Nazim Djeghloul and Mohamed Tahiri
Abstract: A modification of the usual extended N = 2 supersymmetry algebra implementing the two dimensional permutation group is performed. It is shown that one can found a multiplet that forms an off-shell realization of this alternative extension of standard supersymmetry.
