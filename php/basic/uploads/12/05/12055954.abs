Title: Causality Constraint on Noncritical Einstein-Weyl Gravity
Authors: Fu-Wen Shu and Yungui Gong
Abstract: We explore, in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence, the causality constraints on the Noncritical Einstein-Weyl (NEW) gravity model in five dimensions. The scalar and shear channels are considered as small metric perturbations around an AdS black brane background. Our results show that causality analysis on the propagation of these two channels imposes a new bound on the coupling of the Weyl-squared terms in the NEW gravity. This new bound imposes more stringent restrictions than those of the tachyon-free condition, improving predictive power of the theory.
