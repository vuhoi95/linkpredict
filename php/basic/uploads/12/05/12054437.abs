Title: New E77 invariants and amplitudes
Authors: Renata Kallosh and Tomas Ortin
Abstract: We construct a new class of manifest E77 duality invariants, which generalize the Cartan quartic invariant, familiar from studies of the black hole entropy. The new ones, being four-linear, are designed for studies of the four-vector amplitudes and to be used, upon supersymmetrization, as initial sources of deformation for the non-linear higher-derivative generalizations of the linear twisted self-duality condition. We show, however, that the new invariants are inconsistent with the expected UV divergent amplitudes in extended supergravities with non-degenerate duality groups of type E7. When E77 degenerates into U(1) the new invariants reproduce the recently discovered source of deformation for the Born-Infeld duality invariant model with higher derivatives relevant to UV divergences of the D3 brane action. These facts may explain the UV properties of perturbative supergravity.
