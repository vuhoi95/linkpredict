Title: BRST Symmetry and Cohomology
Authors: Norbert Dragon and Friedemann Brandt
Abstract: We present the mathematical considerations which determine all gauge invariant actions and anomaly candidates in gauge theories of standard type such as ordinary or gravitational Yang Mills theories. Starting from elementary concepts of field theory the discussion tries to be explicit and complete, only the cohomology of simple Lie algebras it quoted from the literature.
