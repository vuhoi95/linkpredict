Title: P-V criticality of charged AdS black holes
Authors: David Kubiznak and Robert B. Mann
Abstract: Treating the cosmological constant as a thermodynamic pressure and its conjugate quantity as a thermodynamic volume, we reconsider the critical behaviour of charged AdS black holes. We complete the analogy of this system with the liquid-gas system and study its critical point, which occurs at the point of divergence of specific heat at constant pressure. We calculate the critical exponents and show that they coincide with those of the Van der Waals system.
