Title: (m,n)-type holographic dark energy models
Authors: Yi Ling and Wen-Jian Pan
Abstract: We construct $(m,n)$-type holographic dark energy models at a phenomenological level, which can be viewed as a generalization of agegraphic models with the conformal-like age as the holographic characteristic size. For some values of $(m,n)$ the holographic dark energy can automatically evolve across $\omega=-1$ into a phantom phase even without introducing an interaction between the dark energy and background matter. Our construction is also applicable to the holographic dark energy with generalized future event horizon as the characteristic size. Finally, we address the issue on the stability of our model and show that they are generally stable under the scalar perturbation.
