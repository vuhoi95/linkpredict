Title: Universal properties of Fermi gases in arbitrary dimensions
Authors: Manuel Valiente and Nikolaj T. Zinner and Klaus Molmer
Abstract: We consider spin-1/2 Fermi gases in arbitrary, integer or non-integer spatial dimensions, interacting via a Dirac delta potential. We first generalize the method of Tan's distributions and implement short-range boundary conditions to arbitrary dimension and we obtain a set of universal relations for the Fermi gas. Three-dimensional scattering under very general conditions of transversal confinement is described by an effectively reduced-dimensional scattering length, which we show depends on the three-dimensional scattering length in a universal way. Our formula for non-integer dimensions interpolates between the known results in integer dimensions 1, 2 and 3. Without any need to solve the associated multichannel scattering problem, we find that confinement-induced resonances occur in all dimensions different from D=2, while reduced-dimensional contacts, related to the tails of the momentum distributions, are connected to the three-dimensional contact by a correction factor of purely geometric origin.
