Abstract: The spectrum of open strings with integrable Y=0 brane boundary conditions is analyzed in planar AdS/CFT. We give evidence that it can be described by the same Y-system that governs the spectrum of closed strings in AdS_5xS^5, except with different asymptotic and analytical properties. We determine the asymptotic solution of the Y-system that is consistent both with boundary asymptotic Bethe ansatz and boundary Luscher corrections.
