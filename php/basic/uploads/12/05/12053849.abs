Title: $Î¸_{13}$ and the Higgs mass from high scale supersymmetry
Authors: Chun Liu and Zhen-hua Zhao
Abstract: In the framework in which supersymmetry is used for understanding fermion masses rather than stabilizing the electroweak scale, we elaborate the phenomenological analysis for the neutrino physics. A relatively large $\sin{\theta_{13}}$ is the natural result. The model further predicts vanishingly small CP violation in neutrino oscillations. And $\theta_{23}$ is not necessarily maximal. While the high scale supersymmetry generically results in a Higgs mass of about 141 GeV, our model reduces this mass via introducing SU(2)$_L$ triplet fields which also contribute to neutrino masses.
