Title: Gauge symmetry restoration in the un-particle vacuum
Authors: Patricio Gaete and Euro Spallucci
Abstract: In this note we investigate the impact of some "new-physics", beyond the electro-weak Standard Model of elementary particles, on the Higgs vacuum. We consider both un-particle and quantum gravity induced effects. We find that even if the Higgs field takes a non-vanishing v.e.v., gauge interaction keeps its long range character leading to an effective gauge symmetry restoration. Next, by using a physically-based alternative to the usual Wilson loop approach, we examine the effect of a quantum gravity induced minimal length on a physical observable in the un-particle sector. As a consequence, we obtain an ultraviolet finite interaction energy described by a confluent hyper-geometric function. This result displays a marked qualitative departure from its standard counterpart.
