Title: Higher loop corrections to a Schwinger--Dyson equation
Authors: Marc P. Bellon and Fidel A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We consider the effects of higherloop corrections to a Schwinger--Dyson equations for propagators. This is made possible by the efficiency of the methods we developed in preceding works, still using the supersymmetric Wess--Zumino model as a laboratory. We obtain the dominant contributions of the three and four loop primitive divergences at high order in perturbation theory, without the need for their full evaluations. Our main conclusion is that the asymptotic behavior of the perturbative series of the renormalization function remains unchanged, and we conjecture that this will remain the case for all finite order corrections.
