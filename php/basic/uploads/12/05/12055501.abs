Title: Solution of Dirac Equation for Charged and Neutral Fermions with  Anomalous Magnetic Moments in Uniform Magnetic Field
Authors: M. Pitschmann and A. N. Ivanov
Abstract: The Dirac equation for charged and neutral fermions with anomalous magnetic moments is solved in a uniform magnetic field. We find the relativistic wave functions and energy spectra. In the non-relativistic limit the wave functions and energy spectra of charged fermions agree with the known solutions of the Schroedinger equation.
