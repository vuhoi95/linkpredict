Title: Covariant actions for models with non-linear twisted self-duality
Authors: Paolo Pasti and Dmitri Sorokin and Mario Tonin
Abstract: We describe a systematic way of the generalization, to models with non-linear duality, of the space-time covariant and duality-invariant formulation of duality-symmetric theories in which the covariance of the action is ensured by the presence of a single auxiliary scalar field. It is shown that the duality-symmetric action should be invariant under the two local symmetries characteristic of this approach, which impose constraints on the form of the action similar to those of Gaillard and Zumino and in the non-covariant formalism. We show that the (twisted) self-duality condition obtained from this action upon integrating its equations of motion can always be recast in a manifestly covariant form which is independent of the auxiliary scalar and thus corresponds to the conventional on-shell duality-symmetric covariant description of the same model. Supersymmetrization of this construction is briefly discussed.
