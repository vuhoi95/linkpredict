Abstract: In this paper we compute the radiative correction to the mass of the kink in $\phi^4$ theory in 1+1 dimensions, using an alternative renormalization program. In this newly proposed renormalization program the breaking of the translational invariance and the topological nature of the problem, due to the presence of the kink, is automatically taken into account. This will naturally lead to uniquely defined position dependent counterterms. We use the mode number cutoff in conjunction with the above program to compute the mass of the kink up to and including the next to the leading order quantum correction. We discuss the differences between the results of this procedure and the previously reported ones.
