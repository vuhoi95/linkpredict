Title: Formulation of gauge theories on transitive Lie algebroids
Authors: CÃ©dric Fournel and Serge Lazzarini and Thierry Masson
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study some mathematical structures on top of transitive Lie algebroids in order to formulate gauge theories in terms of generalized connections and their curvature: metrics, Hodge star operator and integration along the algebraic part of the transitive Lie algebroid (its kernel). Explicit action functionals are given in terms of global objects and in terms of their local description as well. We investigate applications of these constructions to Atiyah Lie algebroids and to derivations on a vector bundle. The obtained gauge theories are discussed with respect to ordinary and to similar non-commutative gauge theories.
