Title: Dipole Coupling Effect of Holographic Fermion in the Background of  Charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS Black Hole
Authors: Xiao-Mei Kuang and Bin Wang and Jian-Pin Wu
Abstract: We investigate the holographic fermions in the charged Gauss-Bonnet $AdS_{d}$ black hole background with the dipole coupling between fermion and gauge field in the bulk. We show that in addition to the strength of the dipole coupling, the spacetime dimension and the higher curvature correction in the gravity background also influence the onset of the Fermi gap and the gap distance. We find that the higher curvature effect modifies the fermion spectral density and influences the value of the Fermi momentum for the appearance of the Fermi surface. There are richer physics in the boundary fermion system due to the modification in the bulk gravity.
