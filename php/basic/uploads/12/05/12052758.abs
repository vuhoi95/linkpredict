Title: Non-Gaussianities in the Cosmological Perturbation Spectrum due to  Primordial Anisotropy II
Authors: Anindya Dey and Ely D. Kovetz and Sonia Paban
Abstract: We continue to investigate possible signatures of a pre-inflationary anisotropic phase in two-point and three point correlation functions of the curvature perturbation for high-momentum modes which exit the horizon well after isotropization. The late time dynamics of these modes is characterized by a non-Bunch Davies vacuum state which encodes all the information about initial anisotropy in the background space-time. We observe that, unlike the non-planar momenta, there exist regimes of planar momenta for which scale invariance of the power spectrum is strongly broken. This regime of planar momenta gives rise to enhanced non-Gaussianity in certain squeezed triangle configurations, although the enhancement of the $f_{NL}$ parameter is limited by the breakdown of linear perturbation theory at "exact planarity". Finally, we demonstrate that for the range of planar modes for which scale invariance of the power spectrum is preserved, non-Gaussianity in the curvature perturbation spectrum is naturally constrained to be extremely small.
