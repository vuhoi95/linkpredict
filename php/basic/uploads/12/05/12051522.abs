Title: Bianchi Identities for Non-Geometric Fluxes - From Quasi-Poisson  Structures to Courant Algebroids
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Andreas Deser and Erik Plauschinn and Felix Rennecke
Abstract: Starting from a (non-associative) quasi-Poisson structure, the derivation of a Roytenberg-type algebra is presented. From the Jacobi identities of the latter, the most general form of Bianchi identities for fluxes (H,f,Q,R) is then derived. It is also explained how this approach is related to the mathematical theory of quasi-Lie and Courant algebroids.
