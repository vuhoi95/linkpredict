Title: Holographic Correlators for General Gauge Mediation
Authors: Riccardo Argurio and Matteo Bertolini and Lorenzo Di Pietro and Flavio Porri and Diego Redigolo
Abstract: We use holographic techniques to compute two-point functions of operators belonging to a conserved current supermultiplet in theories which break supersymmetry at strong coupling. These are the relevant quantities one has to compute in models of gauge mediation to determine the soft spectrum in supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model (SSM). Such holographic approach can be used for diverse gravitational backgrounds, but here we focus, for definiteness, on asymptotically AdS backgrounds. After presenting the general framework, we apply our formulas to two explicit examples which differ by the nature of the SSM gauginos, which have Dirac or Majorana masses, corresponding to models that respectively preserve or break R-symmetry.
