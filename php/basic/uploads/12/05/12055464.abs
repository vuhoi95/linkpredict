Title: Solitonic solutions of Faddeev model
Authors: Chang-Guang Shi and Minoru Hirayama
Abstract: An application of the equation proposed by the present authors, which is equivalent to the static field equation of the Faddeev model, is discussed. Under some assumptions on the space and on the form of the solution, the field equation is reduced to a non-linear ODE of second order. By solving this equation numerically, some solitonic solutions are obtained. It is discussed that the product of two integers specifying solutions may be identified with the Hopf topological invariant.
