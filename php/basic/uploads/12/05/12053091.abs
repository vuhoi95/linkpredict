Title: N=2 superconformal blocks and instanton partition functions
Authors: V. Belavin and Niclas Wyllard
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing (irregular) conformal blocks in 2d CFTs whose chiral symmetry algebra is the N=2 superconformal algebra. Our construction uses two ingredients: (i) the relation between the representation theories of the N=2 superconformal algebra and the affine sl(2) algebra, extended to the level of the conformal blocks, and (ii) the relation between affine sl(2) conformal blocks and instanton partition functions in the 4d N=2 SU(2) gauge theory with a surface defect. By combining these two facts we derive combinatorial expressions for the N=2 superconformal blocks in the Gaiotto limit.
