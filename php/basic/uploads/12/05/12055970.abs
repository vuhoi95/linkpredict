Title: Combinatorics and formal geometry of the master equation
Authors: Joseph Chuang and Andrey Lazarev
Abstract: We give a general treatment of the master equation in homotopy algebras and describe the operads and formal differential geometric objects governing the corresponding algebraic structures. We show that the notion of Maurer-Cartan twisting is encoded in certain automorphisms of these universal objects.
