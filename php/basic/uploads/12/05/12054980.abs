Abstract: The viability of achieving gravitational consistent braneworld models in the framework of a f(R) theory of gravity is investigated. After a careful generalization of the usual junction conditions encompassing the embedding of the 3-brane into a f(R) bulk, we provide a prescription giving the necessary constraints in order to implement the projected second order effective field equations on the brane.
