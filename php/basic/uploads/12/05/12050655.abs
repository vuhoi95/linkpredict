Title: Anomalous spin of the Chern-Simons-Georgi-Glashow model
Authors: Huo Qiu-Hong and Jiang Yunguo
Abstract: With the Coulomb gauge, the Chern-Simons-Georgi-Glashow (CSGG) model is quantized in the Dirac formalism for the constrained system. Combining the Gauss law and Coulomb gauge consistency condition, the difference between the Schwinger angular momentum and canonical angular momentum of the system is found to be an anomalous spin. The reason for this result lies in that the Schwinger energy momentum tensor and the canonical one have different symmetry properties in presence of the Chern-Simons term.
