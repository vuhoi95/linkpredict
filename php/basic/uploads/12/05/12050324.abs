Abstract: We present a simple isomorphism between the algebra of one real chiral Fermi field and the algebra of n real chiral Fermi fields. This isomorphism preserves the vacuum state. This is possible by a "change of localization", and gives rise to new multilocal symmetries generated by the corresponding multilocal current and stress-energy tensor. The result gives a common underlying explanation of several remarkable recent results on the representation of the free Bose field in terms of free Fermi fields, and on the modular theory of the free Fermi algebra in disjoint intervals.
