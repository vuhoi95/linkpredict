Title: STU/QCD Correspondence
Authors: B. Pourhassan and J. Sadeghi
Abstract: In this review article we consider a special case of $D=5$, $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity called the STU model. We apply the gauge/gravity correspondence to the STU model to gain insight into properties of the quark-gluon plasma. Given that the quark-gluon plasma is in reality described by QCD, therefore we call our study STU/QCD correspondence. First, we investigate the thermodynamics and hydrodynamics of the STU background. Then we use dual picture of the theory, which is type IIB string theory, to obtain the drag force and jet-quenching parameter of an external probe quark.
