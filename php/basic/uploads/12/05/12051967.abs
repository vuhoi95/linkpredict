Title: 3+1 dimensional topological field theory as the effective action of  neutral fermions
Authors: O. F. Dayi and M. Elbistan
Abstract: We proposed an action of neutral fermions interacting with external electromagnetic fields to construct a 3+1 dimensional topological field theory as the effective action attained by integrating out the fermionic fields in the related path integral. These neutral quasiparticles are assumed to emerge from the collective behavior of the original physical particles and holes (antiparticles). Although our construction is general it is particularly useful to formulate effective actions of the time reversal invariant topological insulators.
