Abstract: We theoretically study the vortex formation from the collision of the domain walls in phase-separated two-component Bose-Einstein condensates. The collision process mimics the tachyon condensation for the annihilation of D-brane and anti-D-brane in string theory. A pair annihilation leaves the quantized vortices with superflow along their core, namely `superflowing cosmic strings'. It is revealed that the line density and the core size of the vortices depend on the initial distance between the walls.
