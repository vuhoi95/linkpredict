Title: A Cusp in QED at g=2
Authors: Johann Rafelski and Lance Labun
Abstract: We explore nonperturbative properties of the dimension-4 QED allowing a gyromagnetic ratio $g\ne g_{\rm D}=2$. We determine the effective action $\Veff$ for an arbitrarily strong constant and homogeneous field. Using the external field method, we find a cusp as a function of the gyromagnetic factor $g$ in a) the QED $b_0$-renormalization group coefficient, and in a b) subclass of light-light scattering coefficients obtained in the long wavelength limit expansion. We discuss precision QED results indicating an opportunity for resolution of known theory-experiment disagreements. We show possibility of asymptotic freedom in an Abelian theory for certain domains of $g$.
