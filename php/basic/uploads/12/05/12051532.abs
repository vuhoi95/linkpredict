Abstract: The baby Skyrme model is a well-known nonlinear field theory supporting topological solitons in two space dimensions. In the limit where the term quadratic in derivatives (the "sigma model term") vanishes some additional structure emerges. The resulting ("extreme" or "restricted" or "BPS") baby Skyrme model has exact soliton solutions saturating a BPS bound which exists for this restricted model. Further, the restricted model has infinitely many symmetries and infinitely many conservation laws. Here we consider the gauged version of the restricted baby Skyrme model with gauge group U(1) and the usual Maxwell term for the gauge field. We find that, again, there exists a BPS bound and BPS solutions saturating this bound. We further find that the whole problem is essentially determined by a new kind of superpotential equation. The BPS bound and the corresponding BPS solitons only may exist for potentials such that the superpotential equation has a solution which exists globally, i.e., on the whole target space. We also calculate soliton solutions both exactly and numerically, completely confirming our qualitative analytical results.
