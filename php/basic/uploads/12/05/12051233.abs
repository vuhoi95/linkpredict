Title: Extremal Multicenter Black Holes: Nilpotent Orbits and Tits Satake  Universality Classes
Authors: Pietro Fre and Alexander S. Sorin
Abstract: Four dimensional supergravity theories whose scalar manifold is a symmetric coset manifold U[D=4]/Hc are arranged into a finite list of Tits Satake universality classes. Stationary solutions of these theories, spherically symmetric or not, are identified with those of an euclidian three-dimensional sigma-model, whose target manifold is a Lorentzian coset U[D=3]/H* and the extremal ones are associated with H* nilpotent orbits in the K* representation emerging from the orthogonal decomposition of the algebra U[D=3] with respect to H*. It is shown that the classification of such orbits can always be reduced to the Tits-Satake projection and it is a class property of the Tits Satake universality classes. The construction procedure of Bossard et al of extremal multicenter solutions by means of a triangular hierarchy of integrable equations is completed and converted into a closed algorithm by means of a general formula that provides the transition from the symmetric to the solvable gauge. The question of the relation between H* orbits and charge orbits W of the corresponding black holes is addressed and also reduced to the corresponding question within the Tits Satake projection. It is conjectured that on the vanishing locus of the Taub-NUT current the relation between H*-orbit and W-orbit is rigid and one-to-one. All black holes emerging from multicenter solutions associated with a given H* orbit have the same W-type. For the S^3 model we provide a complete survey of its multicenter solutions associated with all of the previously classified nilpotent orbits of sl(2) x sl(2) within g[2,2]. We find a new intrinsic classification of the W-orbits of this model that might provide a paradigm for the analogous classification in all the other Tits Satake universality classes.
