Title: Moduli of $G_2$ structures and the Strominger system in dimension 7
Authors: Andrew Clarke and Mario Garcia-Fernandez and Carl Tipler
Abstract: We consider $G_2$ structures with torsion coupled with $G_2$-instantons, on a compact $7$-dimensional manifold. The coupling is via an equation for $4$-forms which appears in supergravity and generalized geometry, known as the Bianchi identity. The resulting system of partial differential equations can be regarded as an analogue of the Strominger system in $7$-dimensions. We initiate the study of the moduli space of solutions and show that it is finite dimensional using elliptic operator theory. We also relate the associated geometric structures to generalized geometry.
