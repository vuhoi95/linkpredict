Title: Analytical studies of the complex Langevin equation with a Gaussian  Ansatz and multiple solutions in the unstable region
Authors: Yuya Abe and Kenji Fukushima
Abstract: We investigate a simple model using the numerical simulation in the complex Langevin equation (CLE) and the analytical approximation with the Gaussian Ansatz. We find that the Gaussian Ansatz captures the essential and even quantitative features of the CLE results quite well including unwanted behavior in the unstable region where the CLE converges to a wrong answer. The Gaussian Ansatz is therefore useful for looking into this convergence problem and we find that the exact answer in the unstable region is nicely reproduced by another solution that is naively excluded from the stability condition. We consider the Gaussian probability distributions corresponding to multiple solutions along the Lefschetz thimble to discuss the stability and the locality. Our results suggest a prescription to improve the convergence of the CLE simulation to the exact answer.
