Title: Logarithmic enhancements in conformal perturbation theory and their real  time interpretation
Authors: David Berenstein and Alexandra Miller
Abstract: We study various corrections of correlation functions to leading order in conformal perturbation theory, both on the cylinder and on the plane. Many problems on the cylinder are mathematically equivalent to those in the plane if we give the perturbations a position dependent scaling profile. The integrals to be done are then similar to the study of correlation functions with one additional insertion at the center of the profile. We will be primarily interested in the divergence structure of these corrections when computed in dimensional regularization. In particular, we show that the logarithmic divergences (enhancements) that show up in the plane under these circumstances can be understood in terms of resonant behavior in time dependent perturbation theory, for a transition between states that is induced by an oscillatory perturbation on the cylinder.
