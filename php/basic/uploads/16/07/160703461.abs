Title: Holomorphic Yukawa Couplings for Complete Intersection Calabi-Yau  Manifolds
Authors: Stefan Blesneag and Evgeny I. Buchbinder and Andre Lukas
Abstract: We develop methods to compute holomorphic Yukawa couplings for heterotic compactifications on complete intersection Calabi-Yau manifolds, generalising result of an earlier paper for Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces. Our methods are based on constructing the required bundle-values forms explicitly and evaluating the relevant integrals over the projective ambient space. We also show how our approach relates to an earlier, algebraic one to calculate the holomorphic Yukawa couplings. A vanishing theorem, which we prove, implies certain Yukawa couplings allowed by low-energy symmetries are zero due to topological reasons. To illustrate our methods, we calculate Yukawa couplings for SU(5)-based standard models on a co-dimension two complete intersection manifold.
