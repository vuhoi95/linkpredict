Title: Dark energy from the motions of neutrinos
Authors: Fergus Simpson and Raul Jimenez and Carlos Pena-Garay and Licia Verde
Abstract: We demonstrate that a scalar field is unable to reverse its direction of motion while continuously exchanging energy with another fluid. If the rate of transfer is modulated by the scalar's acceleration, the field can undergo a rapid process of freezing, despite being displaced from the local minimum of its potential. This enables dark energy to form from any potential, regardless of its shape. The field's equation of state mimicks that of a cosmological constant. We present a physically motivated realisation in the form of a derivative neutrino-majoron coupling. Coherent motions, which form only once the neutrinos become non-relativistic, could be responsible for instigating the freezing process. This would provide a natural resolution to the dark energy coincidence problem, while avoiding the dynamical instabilities associated with mass-varying neutrino models. Finally we discuss possible means by which this model could be experimentally verified.
