Abstract: I will review essential features of the Hamiltonian approach to QCD in Coulomb gauge showing that Gribov's confinement scenario is realized in this gauge. For this purpose I will discuss in detail the emergence of the horizon condition and the Coulomb string tension. I will show that both are induced by center vortex gauge field configurations, which establish the connection between Gribov's confinement scenario and the center vortex picture of confinement. I will then extend the Hamiltonian approach to QCD in Coulomb gauge to finite temperatures, first by the usual grand canonical ensemble and second by the compactification of a spatial dimension. I will present results for the pressure, energy density and interaction measure as well as for the Polyakov loop.
