Title: D3-D5 theories with unquenched flavors
Authors: Eduardo Conde and Hai Lin and Jose Manuel Penin and Alfonso V. Ramallo and Dimitrios Zoakos
Abstract: We construct the string duals of the defect theories generated when N_f flavor D5-branes intersect N_c color D3-branes along a 2+1 dimensional subspace. We work in the Veneziano limit in which N_c and N_f are large and N_f/N_c is fixed. By smearing the D5-branes, we find supergravity solutions that take into account the backreaction of the flavor branes and preserve two supercharges. When the flavors are massless the resulting metric displays an anisotropic Lifshitz-like scale invariance. The case of massive quarks is also considered.
