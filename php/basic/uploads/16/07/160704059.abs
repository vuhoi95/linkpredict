Abstract: The strong coupling dynamics of a 2+1 dimensional U(1) gauge theory coupled to charged matter is holographically modeled via a top-down construction with intersecting D3- and D5-branes. We explore the resulting phase diagram at finite temperature and charge density using correlation functions of monopole operators, dual to magnetically charged particles in the higher-dimensional bulk theory, as a diagnostic.
