Title: Cosmological relaxation and high scale inflation
Authors: Tetsutaro Higaki and Naoyuki Takeda and Yusuke Yamada
Abstract: We study whether the relaxion mechanism solves the Higgs hierarchy problem against a high scale inflation or a high reheating temperature. To accomplish the mechanism, we consider the scenario that the Higgs vacuum expectation value is determined after inflation. We take into account the effects of the Hubble induced mass and thermal one in the dynamics of the relaxion.
