Title: Magnetic Monopoles from Global Monopoles in the presence of Kalb-Ramond  Torsion
Authors: Nick E. Mavromatos and Sarben Sarkar
Abstract: Possible classical solutions for electromagnetic monopoles induced by gravitational (global) monopoles in the presence of torsion are found. Such solutions rely on a non-zero (Kalb-Ramond) torsion strength, which may characterise low energy theories inspired from string models. Bounds from the current run of the LHC experiments are used to constrain the parameters of the model, but because the production mechanism depends on the details of the model and its ultraviolet completion, such bounds are presently only indicative.
