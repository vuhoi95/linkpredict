Title: Revisiting constraints on uplifts to de Sitter vacua
Authors: Nana Cabo Bizet and Shinji Hirano
Abstract: We revisit the issue of uplifting the potential to de Sitter (dS) vacua in type IIB flux compactifications of Kachru, Kallosh, Linde and Trivedi (KKLT). We shed light on some tension between two constraints on dS vacua in type IIB string theory. One is the well-known and much-discussed constraint which leads to the no-go theorem that can in principle be evaded. The other follows from 4-dimensional Einstein's equations, which has, however, been much less discussed in connection with the former constraint. In addition to the challenges previously posed, it is suggested that the uplifting scenarios, in particular, obstruct the evasion of the no-go theorem more strongly than one might have assumed.
