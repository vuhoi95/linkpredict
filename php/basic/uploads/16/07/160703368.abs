Title: Graviton mass reduces tension between early and late time cosmological  data
Authors: Antonio De Felice and Shinji Mukohyama
Abstract: The standard Lambda-CDM predicts a growth of structures which tends to be higher than the values of redshift space distortion measurements, if the cosmological parameters are fixed by the CMB data. In this paper we point out that this discrepancy can be resolved/understood if we assume that the graviton has a small but non-zero mass. In the context of the Minimal Theory of Massive Gravity (MTMG), due to infrared Lorentz violations measurable only at present cosmological scales, the graviton acquires a mass without being haunted by unwanted extra degrees of freedom. It is possible to choose a branch of cosmological solutions in MTMG for which the background is the same as that in GR but the evolution of matter perturbations gets modified by the graviton mass. On studying the fit of such modified dynamics to the above-mentioned redshift distortion measurements, we find that the Lambda-CDM model is less probable than MTMG by three orders of magnitude. The data also pin-down the graviton mass around mu = 9.8e-33 eV, which is consistent with the latest upper bound mu < 1.2e-22 eV set by the recent LIGO observation.
