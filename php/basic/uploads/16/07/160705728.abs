Abstract: We present a formula for the Hilbert series that counts gauge invariant chiral operators in a large class of 3d ${\cal N} \ge 2$ Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theories. The formula counts 't Hooft monopole operators dressed by gauge invariants of a residual gauge theory of massless fields in the monopole background. We provide a general formula for the case of abelian theories, where nonperturbative corrections are absent, and consider a few examples of nonabelian theories where nonperturbative corrections are well understood. We also analyze in detail nonabelian ABJ(M) theories as well as worldvolume theories of M2-branes probing Calabi-Yau fourfold and hyperK\"ahler twofold singularities with ${\cal N} = 2$ and ${\cal N} = 3$ supersymmetry.
