Title: Challenges for D-brane large-field inflation with stabilizer fields
Authors: Aitor Landete and Fernando Marchesano and Clemens Wieck
Abstract: We study possible string theory compactifications which, in the low-energy limit, describe chaotic inflation with a stabilizer field. We first analyze type IIA setups where the inflationary potential arises from a D6-brane wrapping an internal three-cycle, and where the stabilizer field is either an open-string or bulk K\"ahler modulus. We find that after integrating out the relevant closed-string moduli consistently, tachyonic directions arise during inflation which cannot be lifted. This is ultimately due to the shift symmetries of the type IIA K\"ahler potential at large compactification volume. This motivates us to search for stabilizer candidates in the complex structure sector of type IIB orientifolds, since these fields couple to D7-brane Wilson lines and their shift symmetries are generically broken away from the large complex structure limit. However, we find that in these setups the challenge is to obtain the necessary hierarchy between the inflationary and Kaluza-Klein scales.
