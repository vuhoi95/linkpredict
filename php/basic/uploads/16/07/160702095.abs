Title: Implications of Lorentz symmetry violation on a 5D supersymmetric model
Authors: J. D. García-Aguilar and A. Pérez-Lorenzana
Abstract: Field models with $n$ extra spatial dimensions have a larger $SO(1,3+n)$ Lorentz symmetry which is broken down to the standard $SO(1,3)$ four dimensional symmetry by the compactification process. By considering all Lorentz violating operators in a $5D$ supersymmetric Wess-Zumino mo\-del, which otherwise conserve standard Poincare invariance in four dimensions, we show that Supersymmetry can be restored upon a simple deformation of the supersymmetric transformations. However, Supersymmetry shall not be preserved in the effective $4D$ theory that arises after compactification when the $5D$ Lorentz violating operators do not preserve $Z_2: y\rightarrow -y$ bulk parity. We also show that parity preserving models, on the other hand, do provide well defined supersymmetric KK models.
