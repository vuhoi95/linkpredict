Abstract: We study the origin of neutrino mass from $SO(10)$ arising from $M$ Theory compactified on a $G_2$-manifold. This is linked to the problem of the breaking of the extra $U(1)$ gauge group, in the $SU(5)\times U(1)$ subgroup of $SO(10)$, which we show can achieved via a (generalised) Kolda-Martin mechanism. The resulting neutrino masses arise from a combination of the seesaw mechanism and induced R-parity breaking contributions. The rather complicated neutrino mass matrix is analysed for one neutrino family and it is shown how phenomenologically acceptable neutrino masses can emerge.
