Abstract: Integrable structure has played a very important role in the study of various non-perturbative aspects of planar ABJM theories. In this paper we showed that this remarkable structure survive after orbifold operation with discrete group $\Gamma(\simeq\mathbb{Z}_n)<SU(4)_R\times U(1)_b$. For general $\Gamma$, we prove the integrability in the scalar sector at the planar two-loop order and get the Bethe ansatz equations. The eigenvalues of the anomalous dimension matrix are also obtained. For $\Gamma<SU(4)$, two-loop all-sector and all-loop BAEs are proposed. Supersymmetric orbifolds are discussed in this framework.
