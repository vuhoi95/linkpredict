Abstract: We compute the parametrized post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma$ in the case of a static point source for multiscalar-tensor gravity with completely general nonderivative couplings and potential in the Jordan frame. Similarly to the single massive field case $\gamma$ depends exponentially on the distance from the source and is determined by the length of a vector of non-minimal coupling in the space of scalar fields and its orientation relative to the mass eigenvectors. Using data from the Cassini tracking experiment, we estimate bounds on a general theory with two scalar fields. Our formalism can be utilized for a wide range of models, which we illustrate by applying it to nonminimally coupled Higgs SU(2) doublet, general hybrid metric-Palatini gravity, linear ($\Box^{-1}$) and quadratic ($\Box^{-2}$) nonlocal gravity.
