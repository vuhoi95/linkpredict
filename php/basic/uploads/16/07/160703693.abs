Title: Solar system constraints on some Horndeski gravity theories
Authors: Sourav Bhattacharya and Sumanta Chakraborty
Abstract: We discuss two spherically symmetric solutions admitted by the Horndeski (or scalar tensor) theory in the context of solar system physics. One of these solutions is derived for Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, while the other originates from the coupling of the Gauss-Bonnet invariant with a scalar field. Specifically, we discuss the perihelion precession of the Mercury and the bending angle of light for these two different spherically symmetric spacetimes derived in arXiv hep-th/0611188 and 1408.1698 respectively. Numerical bounds on relevant parameters of these theories from such computations are also presented.
