Abstract: We prove the renormalizability to all orders of a refined Gribov-Zwanziger type action in linear covariant gauges in four-dimensional Euclidean space. In this model, the Gribov copies are taken into account by requiring that the Faddeev-Popov operator is positive definite with respect to the transverse component of the gauge field, a procedure which turns out to be analogous to the restriction to the Gribov region in the Landau gauge. The model studied here can be regarded as the first approximation of a more general nonperturbative BRST invariant formulation of the refined Gribov-Zwanziger action in linear covariant gauges obtained recently in [Phys. Rev. D 92, no. 4, 045039 (2015) and arXiv:1605.02610 [hep-th]]. A key ingredient of the set up worked out in [Phys. Rev. D 92, no. 4, 045039 (2015) and arXiv:1605.02610 [hep-th]] is the introduction of a gauge invariant field configuration $\mathbf{A}_{\mu}$ which can be expressed as an infinite non-local series in the starting gauge field $A_\mu$. In the present case, we consider the approximation in which only the first term of the series representing $\mathbf{A}_{\mu}$ is considered, corresponding to a pure transverse gauge field. The all order renormalizability of the resulting action gives thus a strong evidence of the renormalizability of the aforementioned more general nonperturbative BRST invariant formulation of the Gribov horizon in linear covariant gauges.
