Title: Randall-Sundrum brane-world in modified gravity
Authors: Hiroshi Nakada and Sergei V. Ketov
Abstract: We modify Randall-Sundrum model of brane-world (with two branes) by adding the scalar curvature squared term in five dimensions. We find that it does not destabilize Randall-Sundrum solution to the hierarchy problem of the Standard Model in particle physics.
