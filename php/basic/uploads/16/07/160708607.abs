Title: Black hole accretion discs and screened scalar hair
Authors: Anne-Christine Davis and Ruth Gregory and Rahul Jha
Abstract: We present a novel way to investigate scalar field profiles around black holes with an accretion disc for a range of models where the Compton wavelength of the scalar is large compared to other length scales. By analysing the problem in "Weyl" coordinates, we are able to calculate the scalar profiles for accretion discs in the static Schwarzschild, as well as rotating Kerr, black holes. We comment on observational effects.
