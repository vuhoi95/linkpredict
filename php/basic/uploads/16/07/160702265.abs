Title: Interacting Quantum Fields on de Sitter Space
Authors: João C. A. Barata and Christian D. Jäkel and Jens Mund
Abstract: In 1975 Figari, H{\o}egh-Krohn and Nappi constructed the ${\mathscr P}(\varphi)_2$ model on the two-dimensional de Sitter space. Here we complement their work with a number of new results. In particular, we show that $i.)$ the unitary irreducible representations of $SO_0(1,2)$ for both the principal and the complementary series can be formulated on the Hilbert space spanned by wave functions supported on the Cauchy surface; $ii.)$ physical infrared problems are absent on de Sitter space; $iii.)$ the interacting quantum fields satisfy the equations of motion in their covariant form; $iv.)$ the generators of the boosts and the rotations for the interacting quantum field theory arise by contracting the stress-energy tensor with the relevant Killing vector fields and integrating over the relevant line segments. They generate a reducible, unitary representation of the Lorentz group on the Fock space for the free field. We establish also relations to the modular objects of (relative) Tomita-Takesaki theory. In addition, we provide a detailed discussion of the causality structure of de Sitter space and a brief review of the representation theory of $O(1,2)$. We describe the free classical dynamical system in both its covariant and canonical form, and present the associated quantum one-particle KMS structures. The ${\mathscr P}(\varphi)_2$ interaction is added on the Euclidean sphere and the Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction is carried out in some detail.
