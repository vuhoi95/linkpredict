Title: Local integrands for two-loop QCD amplitudes
Authors: Simon Badger and Gustav Mogull and Tiziano Peraro
Abstract: In this talk we review the recent computation of the five- and six-gluon two-loop amplitudes in Yang-Mills theory using local integrands which make the infrared pole structure manifest. We make some remarks on the connection with BCJ relations and the all-multiplicity structure.
