Title: On the Holography of Free Yang-Mills
Authors: Jin-Beom Bae and Euihun Joung and Shailesh Lal
Abstract: We study the AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$ duality where the boundary CFT is free Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU(N). At the planar level we use the spectrum and correlation functions of the boundary theory to explicate features of the bulk theory. Further, by computing the one-loop partition function of the bulk theory using the methods of arXiv:1603.05387, we argue that the bulk coupling constant should be shifted to $N^2$ from $N^2-1$. Similar conclusions are reached by studying the dualities in thermal AdS$_5$ with $S^1\times S^3$ boundary.
