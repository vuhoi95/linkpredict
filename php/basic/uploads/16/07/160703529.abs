Authors: Ricardo S. Martins and Elena Konstantinova and Humberto Belich and José A. Helayël-Neto
Abstract: Magnetic and thermodynamical properties of graphene-like materials, such as magnetization, magnetic susceptibility and specific heat, in a low-temperature regime are investigated by considering the effects of a Kekul\'e scalar exchange and QED vacuum polarization corrections to the interparticle potential. The spin lattice calculations are carried out by means of Monte Carlo simulations. We present a number of comparative plots of all the physical quantities we have considered and a detailed analysis is presented to illustrate the main features and the variation profiles of the properties with the applied external magnetic field and temperature.
