Title: The topological susceptibility in the large-N limit of SU(N) Yang-Mills  theory
Authors: Marco Cè and Miguel García Vera and Leonardo Giusti and Stefan Schaefer
Abstract: We compute the topological susceptibility of the SU(N) Yang-Mills theory in the large-N limit with a percent level accuracy. This is achieved by measuring the gradient-flow definition of the susceptibility at three values of the lattice spacing for N=3,4,5,6. Thanks to this coverage of parameter space, we can extrapolate the results to the large-N and continuum limits with confidence. Open boundary conditions are instrumental to make simulations feasible on the finer lattices at the larger N.
