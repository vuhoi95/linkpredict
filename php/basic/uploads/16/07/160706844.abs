Title: From the Komar Mass and Entropic Force Scenarios to the Einstein Field  Equations on the Ads Brane
Authors: H. Moradpour and A. Sheykhi
Abstract: By bearing the Komar's definition for the mass, together with the entropic origin of gravity in mind, we find the Einstein field equations in $(n+1$)-dimensional spacetime. Then, by reflecting the ($4+1$)-dimensional Einstein equations on the ($3+1$)-hypersurface, we get the Einstein equations onto the $3$-brane. The corresponding energy conditions are also addressed. Since the higher dimensional considerations modify the Einstein field equations in the ($3+1$)-dimensions and thus the energy-momentum tensor, we get a relation for the Komar mass on the brane. In addition, the strongness of this relation compared with existing definition for the Komar mass on the brane is addressed.
