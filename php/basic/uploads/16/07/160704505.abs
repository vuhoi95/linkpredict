Title: Unified treatment of a class of spherically symmetric potentials:  quasi-exact solution
Authors: Hossein Panahi and Marzieh Baradaran
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Schr\"odinger equation for a class of spherically symmetric potentials in a simple and unified manner using the Lie algebraic approach within the framework of quasi-exact solvability. We illustrate that all models give rise to the same basic differential equation, which is expressible as an element of the universal enveloping algebra of sl(2). Then, we obtain the general exact solutions of the problem by employing the representation theory of sl(2) Lie algebra.
