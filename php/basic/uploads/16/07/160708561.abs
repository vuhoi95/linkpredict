Title: $f(T)$ gravitational baryogenesis
Authors: V. K. Oikonomou and Emmanuel N. Saridakis
Abstract: We investigate how baryogenesis can occur by the presence of an $f(T)$-related gravitational term. We study various cases of $f(T)$ gravity and we discuss in detail the effect of the novel terms on the baryon-to-entropy ratio. Additionally, we study the constraints imposed by the observational values of the baryon-to-entropy ratio and we discuss how more generalized cosmologies can contribute successfully, in a viable and consistent way, in the gravitational baryogenesis mechanism.
