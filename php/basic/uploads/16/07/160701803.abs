Title: Multi-phase induced inflation in theories with non-minimal coupling to  gravity
Authors: Michal Artymowski and Zygmunt Lalak and Marek Lewicki
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the induced inflation with two flat regions: one Starobinsky-like plateau in big field regime and one shorter plateau around the saddle point of the Einstein frame potential. This multi-phase inflationary scenario can be used to solve the problem of classical cosmology. The inflation at the saddle-point plateau is consistent with the data and can have arbitrarily low scale. The results can be useful in the context of the Higgs-Axion relaxation and in a certain limit they are equivalent to the $\alpha$-attractors.
