Title: Construction of a Model of Monopolium and its Search via Multi-Photon  Channels at LHC
Authors: Neil D. Barrie and Akio Sugamoto and Kimiko Yamashita
Abstract: A model of monopolium is constructed based on an electro-magnetic dual formulation of Zwanziger and lattice gauge theory. To cope with the strong coupling nature of the magnetic charge, for which the monopole is confined, $ U(1) $ lattice gauge theory is applied. The monopole is assumed to have a finite-sized inner structure based on a 't Hooft-Polyakov like solution in which the magnetic charge is uniformly distributed on the surface of a sphere. The monopole and anti-monopole potential becomes linear plus Coulomb outside the sphere and is constant inside. Numerical estimation gives two kinds of solutions: One which has a small binding energy, and hence the para-($ J=0 $) and ortho-($ J=1 $) monopoliums have degenerate masses. For the parameter choices considered, they both have $\mathcal{O}(1-10) $ TeV masses and are very short-lived. The other solution has a small monopole mass and large binding energy, with an illustrative example of parameter choices giving a 750 GeV para-monopolium and 1.4 TeV ortho-monopolium. The production rate of the former is one order of magnetite smaller than the announced enhancement, but they may be a target of future LHC searches and the 100 TeV colliders.
