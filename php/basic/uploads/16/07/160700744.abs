Title: Fine-tuning problems in quantum field theory and Lorentz invariance
Authors: J. L. Cortes and J. Lopez-Sarrion
Abstract: A model with a scalar and a fermion field is used to show how a Lorentz invariance violating high momentum scale, which eliminates all the divergences of the quantum field theory, can be made compatible with a suppression of Lorentz invariance violations at low momenta. The fine tuning required to get this suppression and to have a light scalar particle in the spectrum is determined at one loop.
