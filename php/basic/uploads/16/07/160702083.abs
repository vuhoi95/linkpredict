Abstract: The problem of the existence of a stable vacuum monopole condensation in a pure quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is revised. Our approach is based on using classical stationary non-linear wave type solutions with intrinsic mass scale parameters. Such solutions can be treated as quantum mechanical wave functions describing massive spinless states in quantum theory. We verify whether non-linear wave type solutions can form vacuum condensates stable against quantum fluctuations within the effective action formalism. We demonstrate that there is a special class of stationary regular solutions representing a Wu-Yang monopole dressed in gluon field which provides a stable color magnetic condensate in a pure QCD.
