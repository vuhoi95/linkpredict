Abstract: We present a new mechanism to stabilize the electroweak hierarchy. We introduce $N$ copies of the Standard Model with varying values of the Higgs mass parameter. This generically yields a sector whose weak scale is parametrically removed from the cutoff by a factor of $1/\sqrt{N}$. Ensuring that reheating deposits a majority of the total energy density into this lightest sector requires a modification of the standard cosmological history, providing a powerful probe of the mechanism. Current and near-future experiments will explore much of the natural parameter space. Furthermore, supersymmetric completions which preserve grand unification predict superpartners with mass below $m_W \times M_{\text{pl}} / M_{\text{GUT}} \sim 10$ TeV.
