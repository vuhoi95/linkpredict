Title: Dualities in ABJM Matrix Model from Closed String Viewpoint
Authors: Kazuki Kiyoshige and Sanefumi Moriyama
Abstract: We propose a new formalism to study the ABJM matrix model. Contrary to expressing the fractional brane background with the Wilson loops in the open string formalism, we formulate the Wilson loop expectation value from the viewpoint of the closed string background. With this new formalism, we can prove some duality relations in the matrix model.
