Title: On circular strings in $(AdS_3 \times S^3)_{\varkappa}$
Authors: Aritra Banerjee and Kamal L. Panigrahi
Abstract: The so called one-parameter (often called $\varkappa$) deformed $AdS$ string sigma models have attracted a lot of attention lately in the study of integrability in string theory. We construct various circular string solutions in the $(AdS_3 \times S^3)_{\varkappa}$ background and describe the characteristics of such solutions qualitatively. We study the Bohr-Sommerfeld like quantization for these string states to characterise the motion. Further we find a `long' string limit of such circular strings in the $\varkappa$-deformed $AdS_3$ and find a novel dependence of the oscillation number on the energy in the next to leading order expansion.
