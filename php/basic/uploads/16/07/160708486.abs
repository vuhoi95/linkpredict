Title: Mirror theorem for elliptic quasimap invariants of local Calabi-Yau  varieties
Authors: Hyenho Lho and Jeongseok Oh
Abstract: The elliptic quasimap potential function is explicitly calculated for Calabi-Yau complete intersections in projective spaces by Kim and Lho. We extend this result to local Calabi-Yau varieties. Using this as well as the wall crossing formula by Ciocan-Fontanine and Kim, we can calculate the elliptic Gromov-Witten potential function.
