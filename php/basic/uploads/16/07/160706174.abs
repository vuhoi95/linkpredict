Title: Six-dimensional regularization of chiral gauge theories
Authors: Hidenori Fukaya and Tetsuya Onogi and Shota Yamamoto and Ryo Yamamura
Abstract: We propose a non-perturbative regularization of four dimensional chiral gauge theories. In our formulation, we consider a Dirac fermion in six dimensions with two different mass terms having domain-wall profiles in the fifth and the sixth directions, respectively. A Weyl fermion appears as a localized mode at the junction of two different domain-walls. One domain-wall naturally exhibits the Stora-Zumino chain of the anomaly descent equations, starting from the axial U(1) anomaly in six-dimensions to the gauge anomaly in four-dimensions. Another domain-wall implies a similar inflow of the global anomalies. The anomaly free condition is equivalent to requiring that the axial U(1) anomaly and the parity anomaly are canceled among the six-dimensional Dirac fermions. Since our formulation is a massive vector-like theory, a non-perturbative regularization is possible on a lattice. Putting the gauge field at the four-dimensional junction and extending it to the bulk using the Yang-Mills gradient flow, as recently proposed by Grabowska and Kaplan, we define the four-dimensional path integral of the target chiral gauge theory.
