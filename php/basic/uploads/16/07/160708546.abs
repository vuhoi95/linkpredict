Title: General Electromagnetic Nonminimal Couplings in the Dirac Equation
Authors: J. B. Araujo and Rodolfo Casana and M. M. Ferreira Jr
Abstract: We examine a new class of CPT-even and dimension-five nonminimal interactions between fermions and photons, deprived of higher-order derivatives, yielding electric dipole moment and magnetic dipole moment in the context of the Dirac equation. These couplings are Lorentz-violating nonminimal structures, composed of a rank-2 tensor, the electromagnetic tensor, and gamma matrices, being addressed in its axial and non-axial hermitian versions. We use the electron's anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moment measurements to reach upper bounds of $1$ part in $10^{11}$ and $10^{16}$ GeV$^{-1}$.
