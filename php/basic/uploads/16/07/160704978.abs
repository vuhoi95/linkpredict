Abstract: We study integrable models solvable by the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz and described by $\mathfrak{gl}(2|1)$ or $\mathfrak{gl}(1|2)$ superalgebras. We obtain explicit determinant representations for form factors of the monodromy matrix entries. We show that all form factors are related to each other at special limits of the Bethe parameters. Our results allow one to obtain determinant formulas for form factors of local operators in the supersymmetric t-J model.
