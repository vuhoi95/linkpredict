Title: Construction of $R$-matrices for symmetric tensor representations  related to $U_{q}(\widehat{sl_{n}})$
Authors: Gary Bosnjak and Vladimir V. Mangazeev
Abstract: In this paper we construct a new factorized representation of the $R$-matrix related to the affine algebra $U_{q}(\widehat{sl_{n}})$ for symmetric tensor representations with arbitrary weights. Using the 3D approach we obtain explicit formulas for the matrix elements of the $R$-matrix and give a simple proof that a "twisted" $R$-matrix is stochastic. We also discuss symmetries of the $R$-matrix, its degenerations and compare our formulas with other results available in the literature.
