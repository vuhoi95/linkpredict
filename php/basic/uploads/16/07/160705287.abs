Title: Thermalization of particle detectors: Unruh and Anti-Unruh effects
Authors: Luis J. Garay and Eduardo Martin-Martinez and Jose de Ramon
Abstract: We study the Anti-Unruh effect in general stationary scenarios. We find that, for accelerated trajectories, a particle detector coupled to a KMS state of a quantum field can cool down (click less often) as the KMS temperature increases. Remarkably, this is so even when the detector is switched on adiabatically for infinitely long times. We also show that the Anti-Unruh effect is characteristic of accelerated detectors, and cannot appear for inertially moving detectors (e.g., in a thermal bath).
