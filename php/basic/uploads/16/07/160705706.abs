Title: Born-Infeld condensate as a possible origin of neutrino masses and dark  energy
Authors: Andrea Addazi and Salvatore Capozziello and Sergei Odintsov
Abstract: We discuss the possibility that a Born-Infeld condensate coupled to neutrinos can generate both neutrino masses and an effective cosmological constant. In particular, an effective field theory is provided capable of dynamically realizing the neutrino superfluid phase firstly suggested by Ginzburg and Zharkov. In such a case, neutrinos acquire a mass gap inside the Born-Infeld ether forming a long-range Cooper pair. Phenomenological implications of the approach are also discussed.
