Title: Gauge anomalies in Lorentz-violating QED
Authors: Tiago R. S. Santos and Rodrigo F. Sobreiro
Abstract: In this work we study the issue of gauge anomalies in Lorentz-violating QED. To do so, we opt to use the BRST formalism within of the algebraic renormalization approach, reducing our study to a cohomology problem. Since that this approach is independent of the renormalization scheme, the results here obtained are expected to be general. We find that the Lorentz-violating QED is free of gauge anomalies to all orders in perturbation theory.
