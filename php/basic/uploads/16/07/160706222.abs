Title: Hints of quantum gravity from the horizon fluid
Authors: Bethan Cropp and Swastik Bhattacharya and S. Shankaranarayanan
Abstract: For many years researchers have tried to glean hints about quantum gravity from black hole thermodynamics. However, black hole thermodynamics suffers from the problem of Universality --- at leading order, several approaches with different microscopic degrees of freedom lead to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We attempt to bypass this issue by using a minimal statistical mechanical model for the horizon fluid based on Damour-Navier-Stokes (DNS) equation. For stationary asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes in General Relativity, we show explicitly that at equilibrium the entropy of the horizon fluid is the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Further we show that, for the bulk viscosity of the fluctuations of the horizon fluid to be identical to Damour, a confinement scale exists for these fluctuations, implying quantization of the horizon area. The implications and possible mechanisms from the fluid point of view are discussed.
