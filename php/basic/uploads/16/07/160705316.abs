Abstract: We study conformal field theories with Yukawa interactions in dimensions between 2 and 4; they provide UV completions of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio and Gross-Neveu models which have four-fermion interactions. We compute the sphere free energy and certain operator scaling dimensions using dimensional continuation. In the Gross-Neveu CFT with $N$ fermion degrees of freedom we obtain the first few terms in the $4-\epsilon$ expansion using the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model, and the first few terms in the $2+\epsilon$ expansion using the four-fermion interaction. We then apply Pade approximants to produce estimates in $d=3$. For $N=1$, which corresponds to one 2-component Majorana fermion, it has been suggested that the Yukawa theory flows to a ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric CFT. We provide new evidence that the $4-\epsilon$ expansion of the $N=1$ Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model respects the supersymmetry. Our extrapolations to $d=3$ appear to be in good agreement with the available results obtained using the numerical conformal bootstrap. Continuation of this CFT to $d=2$ provides evidence that the Yukawa theory flows to the tri-critical Ising model. We apply a similar approach to calculate the sphere free energy and operator scaling dimensions in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-Yukawa model, which has an additional $U(1)$ global symmetry. For $N=2$, which corresponds to one 2-component Dirac fermion, this theory has an emergent supersymmetry with 4 supercharges, and we provide new evidence for this.
