Title: Scalar-tensor extension of the $Î›$CDM model
Authors: W. C. Algoner and H. E. S. Velten and W. Zimdahl
Abstract: We construct a cosmological scalar-tensor-theory model in which the Brans-Dicke type scalar $\Phi$ enters the effective (Jordan-frame) Hubble rate as a simple modification of the Hubble rate of the $\Lambda$CDM model. This allows us to quantify differences between the background dynamics of scalar-tensor theories and general relativity (GR) in a transparent and observationally testable manner in terms of one single parameter. Problems of the mapping of the scalar-field degrees of freedom on an effective fluid description in a GR context are discused. Data from supernovae, the differential age of old galaxies and baryon acoustic oscillations are shown to strongly limit potential deviations from the standard model.
