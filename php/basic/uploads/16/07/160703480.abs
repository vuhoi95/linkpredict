Title: Exponential fading to white of black holes in quantum gravity
Authors: Carlos Barceló and Raúl Carballo-Rubio and Luis J. Garay
Abstract: Quantization of the gravitational field could allow the existence of a hypothetical decay channel of black holes into white holes with an explicit time-reversal symmetry. The definition of a meaningful decay probability for this channel is studied in spherically symmetric situations. As a first nontrivial calculation, we present the functional integration over a set of geometries using a single-variable function to interpolate between black-hole and white-hole geometries in a bounded region of spacetime. This computation gives a finite result which depends only on the Schwarzschild mass and a parameter measuring the width of the interpolating region. The associated probability distribution displays an exponential decay law on the latter parameter, with a mean lifetime inversely proportional to the Schwarzschild mass. In physical terms this would imply that matter collapsing to a black hole from a finite radius bounces back elastically and instantaneously, with negligible time delay as measured by external observers. This picture invites to reconsider the ultimate nature of astrophysical black holes and suggests that quantum gravity effects might show up in upcoming observations of gravitational waves.
