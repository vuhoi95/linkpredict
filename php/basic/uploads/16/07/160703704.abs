Title: Interior volumes of extremal and ($1+D$) dimensional Schwarzschild black  holes

Abstract: It has already been shown for the Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m and Kerr black holes that the maximum interior volume enclosed by the event horizon ceases to zero in the extremal limit. We show here that if we start with an extremal black hole at the beginning, corresponding volume is non-zero. Interestingly, both for the extremal Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m and Kerr, this value comes out to be equal to one quarter of the horizon area, which is the entropy of the black hole. Next the same quantity is calculated for the ($1+D$)-dimensional Schwarzschild case. Taking into account the mass change due to Hawking radiation, we show that the volume increases towards the end of the evaporation. This fact is not new as it has been observed earlier for four dimensional case. The interesting point we observe is that this increase rate decreases towards the higher value of space dimensions $D$; i.e. it is a decelerated expansion of volume with the increase of spacial dimensions. This implies that for a sufficiently large $D$, the maximum interior volume does not change. The possible implications of these results are also discussed.
