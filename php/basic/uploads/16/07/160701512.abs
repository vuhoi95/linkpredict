Title: Holographically emulating sequential versus instantaneous disappearance  of vector mesons in a hot environment
Authors: Rico ZÃ¶llner and Burkhard Kampfer
Abstract: Descent extensions of the soft-wall model are used to accommodate two variants of Regge trajectories of vector meson excitations. At non-zero temperatures, various options for either sequential or instantaneous disappearance of vector mesons as normalisable modes are found, thus emulating deconfinement at a certain temperature in the order of the (pseudo-) critical temperature of QCD. The crucial role of the blackness function, which steers the thermodynamic properties of the considered system, is highlighted.
