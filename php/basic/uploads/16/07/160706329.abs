Title: Universal features of quantum bounce in loop quantum cosmology
Authors: Tao Zhu and Anzhong Wang and Klaus Kirsten and Gerald Cleaver and Qin Sheng
Abstract: Loop quantum cosmology (LQC) provides an elegant resolution of the classical big bang singularity by a quantum bounce in the deep Planck era. The evolutions of the flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background and its linear scalar and tensor perturbations are universal during the pre-inflationary phase. In this period the potentials of the perturbations can be well approximated by a P\"oschl-Teller (PT) potential, from which we find analytically the mode functions and then calculate the Bogoliubov coefficients at the onset of the slow-roll inflation, valid for any inflationary models with a single scalar field. Matching them to those given in the slow-roll inflationary phase, we investigate the effects of the quantum bounce on the power spectra and find unique features that can be tested by current and forthcoming observations. In particular, fitting the power spectra to the Planck 2015 data, we find that the universe must have expanded at least 132 e-folds from the bounce until now.
