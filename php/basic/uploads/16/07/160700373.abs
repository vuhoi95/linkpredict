Abstract: We explore the supersymmetry invariance of a supergravity theory in the presence of a non-trivial boundary. The explicit construction of a bulk Lagrangian based on an enlarged superalgebra, known as $AdS$-Lorentz, is presented. Using a geometric approach we show that the supersymmetric extension of a Gauss-Bonnet like gravity is required in order to restore the supersymmetry invariance of the theory.
