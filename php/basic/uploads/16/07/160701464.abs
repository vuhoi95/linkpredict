Title: Interpretation of 750 GeV Diphoton Resonance within the RS Model and the  Associated Radion Phenomenology
Authors: Fayez Abu-Ajamieh and Rachel Houtz and Rui Zheng
Abstract: We present an interpretation of the 750 GeV diphoton resonance at the LHC within the context of the Randall-Sundrum model, where we add a scalar singlet that couples only to KK fermions in the bulk. We assume the scalar's ground state is the 750 GeV scalar and show that the anomalous signal can be explained through imposing the appropriate boundary conditions. In addition, we investigate the radion phenomenology in light of the new scalar and show how the scalar could present another probe to search for the radion.
