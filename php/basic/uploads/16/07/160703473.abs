Title: Infinitesimal moduli of G2 holonomy manifolds with instanton bundles
Authors: Xenia de la Ossa and Magdalena Larfors and Eirik Eik Svanes
Abstract: We describe the infinitesimal moduli space of pairs $(Y, V)$ where $Y$ is a manifold with $G_2$ holonomy, and $V$ is a vector bundle on $Y$ with an instanton connection. These structures arise in connection to the moduli space of heterotic string compactifications on compact and non-compact seven dimensional spaces, e.g. domain walls. Employing the canonical $G_2$ cohomology developed by Reyes-Carri\'on and Fern\'andez and Ugarte, we show that the moduli space decomposes into the sum of the bundle moduli $H^1_{\check{d}_A}(Y,\mathrm{End}(V))$ plus the moduli of the $G_2$ structure preserving the instanton condition. The latter piece is contained in $H^1_{\check{d}_\theta}(Y,TY)$, and is given by the kernel of a map ${\cal\check F}$ which generalises the concept of the Atiyah map for holomorphic bundles on complex manifolds to the case at hand. In fact, the map ${\cal\check F}$ is given in terms of the curvature of the bundle and maps $H^1_{\check{d}_\theta}(Y,TY)$ into $H^2_{\check{d}_A}(Y,\mathrm{End}(V))$, and moreover can be used to define a cohomology on an extension bundle of $TY$ by $\mathrm{End}(V)$. We comment further on the resemblance with the holomorphic Atiyah algebroid and connect the story to physics, in particular to heterotic compactifications on $(Y,V)$ when $\alpha'=0$.
