Title: Shift-symmetries and gauge coupling functions in orientifolds and  F-theory
Authors: Pierre Corvilain and Thomas W. Grimm and Diego Regalado
Abstract: We investigate the field dependence of the gauge coupling functions of four-dimensional Type IIB orientifold and F-theory compactifications with space-time filling seven-branes. In particular, we analyze the constraints imposed by holomorphicity and covariance under shift-symmetries of the bulk and brane axions. This requires introducing quantum corrections that necessarily contain Riemann theta functions on the complex torus spanned by the D7-brane Wilson line moduli. Our findings hint towards a new underlying geometric structure for gauge coupling functions in string compactifications. We generalize this discussion to a genuine F-theory compactification on an elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau fourfold. We perform the first general dimensional reduction of eleven-dimensional supergravity and dualization to the F-theory frame. The resulting effective action is compared with the circle reduction of a four-dimensional N=1 supergravity theory. The F-theory geometry elegantly unifies bulk and brane degrees of freedom and allows us to infer non-trivial results about holomorphicity and shift-symmetries. For instance, we gain new insight into kinetic mixing of bulk and brane gauge fields.
