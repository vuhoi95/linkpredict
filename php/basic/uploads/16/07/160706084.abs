Title: Positivity Constraints for Pseudo-linear Massive Spin-2 and Vector  Galileons
Authors: James Bonifacio and Kurt Hinterbichler and Rachel A. Rosen
Abstract: We derive analyticity constraints on a nonlinear ghost-free effective theory of a massive spin-2 particle known as pseudo-linear massive gravity, and on a generalized theory of a massive spin-1 particle, both of which provide simple IR completions of Galileon theories. For pseudo-linear massive gravity we find that, unlike dRGT massive gravity, there is no window of parameter space which satisfies the analyticity constraints. For massive vectors which reduce to Galileons in the decoupling limit, we find that no two-derivative actions are compatible with positivity, but that higher derivative actions can be made compatible.
