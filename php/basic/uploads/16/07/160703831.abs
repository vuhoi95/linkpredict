Title: Further Evidence For Zero Crossing On The Three Gluon Vertex
Authors: Anthony G. Duarte and Orlando Oliveira and Paulo J. Silva
Abstract: The three gluon one particle irreducible function is investigated using lattice QCD simulations over a large region of momentum in the Landau gauge for four dimensional pure Yang-Mills equations and the SU(3) gauge group. The results favor a zero crossing of the gluon form factor for momenta in the range $220 - 260$ MeV. This zero crossing is required to happen in order to have a properly defined set of Dyson-Schwinger equations. It is also shown that in the high momentum region the lattice results are compatible with the predictions of renormalisation group improved perturbation theory.
