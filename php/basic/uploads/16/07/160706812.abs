Title: Delta(54) flavor phenomenology and strings
Authors: Brenda Carballo-Perez and Eduardo Peinado and Saul Ramos-Sanchez
Abstract: Delta(54) can serve as a flavor symmetry in particle physics, but remains almost unexplored. We show that in a classification of semi-realistic Z3xZ3 heterotic string orbifolds, Delta(54) turns out to be the most natural flavor symmetry, providing additional motivation for its study. We revisit its phenomenological potential from a low-energy perspective and subject to the constraints of string models. We find that Delta(54) arising from heterotic orbifolds leads to the Gatto-Sartori-Tonin relation for quarks and charged-leptons. Additionally, in the neutrino sector, it generically leads to a normal hierarchy for neutrino masses and a correlation between the reactor and the atmospheric mixing angles, the latter taking values in the second octant and being compatible at three sigmas with experimental data.
