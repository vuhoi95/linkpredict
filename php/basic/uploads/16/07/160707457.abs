Title: Level/rank Duality and Chern-Simons-Matter Theories
Authors: Po-Shen Hsin and Nathan Seiberg
Abstract: We discuss in detail level/rank duality in three-dimensional Chern-Simons theories and various related dualities in three-dimensional Chern-Simons-matter theories. We couple the dual Lagrangians to appropriate background fields (including gauge fields, spin$_c$ connections and the metric). The non-trivial maps between the currents and the line operators in the dual theories is accounted for by mixing of these fields. In order for the duality to be valid we must add finite counterterms depending on these background fields. This analysis allows us to resolve a number of puzzles with these dualities, to provide derivations of some of them, and to find new consistency conditions and relations between them. In addition, we find new level/rank dualities of topological Chern-Simons theories and new dualities of Chern-Simons-matter theories, including new boson/boson and fermion/fermion dualities.
