Title: Constraining non-commutative space-time from GW150914
Authors: Archil Kobakhidze and Cyril Lagger and Adrian Manning
Abstract: The gravitational wave signal GW150914, recently detected by LIGO and Virgo collaborations, is used to place a bound on the scale of quantum fuzziness of non-commutative space-time. We show that the leading non-commutative correction to the phase of the gravitational waves produced by a binary system appears at the 2nd order of the post- Newtonian expansion. This correction is proportional to $\Lambda^2 \equiv |\theta^{0i}|^2/(l_P t_P)^2$, where $\theta^{\mu \nu}$ is the antisymmetric tensor of non-commutativity. To comply with GW150914 data, we find that $\sqrt{\Lambda} \lesssim 6$, namely less than one order of magnitude above the Planck scale. This is the most stringent bound on non-commutative scale, exceeding the previous constraints from particle physics processes by $\sim 15$ orders of magnitude.
