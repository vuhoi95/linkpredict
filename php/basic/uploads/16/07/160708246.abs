Title: Graviton and gluon scattering from first principles
Authors: Rutger H. Boels and Ricardo Medina
Abstract: Graviton and gluon scattering are studied from minimal physical assumptions such as Poincare and gauge symmetry as well as unitarity. The assumptions lead to an interesting and surprisingly restrictive set of linear equations. This shows gluon and graviton scattering to be related in many field and string theories, explaining and extending several known results. By systematic analysis exceptional graviton scattering amplitudes are derived which in general dimensions can not be related to gluon amplitudes. The simplicity of the formalism guarantees wide further applicability to gauge and gravity theories.
