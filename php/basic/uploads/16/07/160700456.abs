Abstract: In this paper, we analyze Dirac fermions in G\"odel-type spacetime backgrounds with torsion embedded in topological defect background. We show that relativistic bound states solutions to the Dirac equation can be obtained by dealing with three cases of the G\"odel-type solutions with torsion, where a cosmic string is passing through these three cases of spacetime. We obtain the relativistic energy levels for all cases of the G\"odel-type solutions with torsion with a cosmic string, where we show that there exists an analogy with the Landau levels for Dirac particles. We also show that the presence of torsion in the spacetime yields new contributions to the relativistic spectrum of energies and how the presence of the topological defect modifies the degeneracy of the relativistic energy levels.
