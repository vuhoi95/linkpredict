Title: Stringy Chern classes of singular toric varieties and their applications
Authors: Victor Batyrev and Karin Schaller
Abstract: Let X be a normal projective Q-Gorenstein variety with at worst log-terminal singularities. We prove a formula expressing the total stringy Chern class of a generic complete intersection in X via the total stringy Chern class of X. This formula is motivated by its applications to mirror symmetry for Calabi-Yau complete intersections in toric varieties. We compute stringy Chern classes and give a combinatorial interpretation of the stringy Libgober-Wood identity for arbitrary projective Q-Gorenstein toric varieties. As an application we derive a new combinatorial identity relating d-dimensional reflexive polytopes to the number 12 in dimension d>3.
