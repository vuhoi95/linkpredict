Title: Bilinear condensate in three-dimensional large-$N_c$ QCD
Authors: Nikhil Karthik and Rajamani Narayanan
Abstract: We find clear numerical evidence for a bilinear condensate in three-dimensional QCD in the 't Hooft limit. We use a non-chiral random matrix model to extract the value of the condensate $\Sigma$ from the low-lying eigenvalues of the massless anti-Hermitian overlap Dirac operator. We estimate $\Sigma/\lambda^2 = 0.0042 \pm 0.0004$ in units of the physical 't Hooft coupling.
