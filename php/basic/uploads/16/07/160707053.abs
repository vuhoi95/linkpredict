Title: Thin-shell instanton tunneling: something-to-something or  nothing-to-something?
Authors: Pisin Chen and Yao-Chieh Hu and Dong-han Yeom
Abstract: There exist two interpretations of instantons in the literature. The first interpretation regards instanton as divider between the initial and final hypersurfaces. The Coleman-De Luccia instanton is one such an example. The second interpretation, proposed by Brown and Weinberg, considers instanton as connector between the initial and final hypersurfaces. In this proceedings, we try to suitably and intuitively argue that these two interpretations are complementary to each other under certain conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the decay rate obtained from the Euclidean treatment and the Hamiltonian treatment both are consistent with each other, which may help to dissolve some concerns about the validity of regularization technique employed in the treatment of the cusp singularity of instantons. Based on these, we argue that instantons can be a sensible tool to address the information loss problem.
