Title: Worldline CPT and massless supermultiplets
Authors: Alex S. Arvanitakis and Luca Mezincescu and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: The action for a massless particle in 4D Minkowski space has a worldline time-reversing symmetry corresponding to CPT invariance of the quantum theory. The analogous symmetry of the N-extended superparticle is shown to be anomalous when N is odd, in the supertwistor formalism this is because a CPT-violating worldline-Chern-Simons term is needed to preserve the chiral U(1) gauge invariance. This accords with the fact that no massless N=1 super-Poincar\'e irrep is CPT-self-conjugate. There is a CPT self-conjugate supermultiplet when N is even, but it has $2^{N+1}$ states when N/2 is odd (e.g. the N=2 hypermultiplet) in contrast to just $2^N$ when N/2 is even (e.g. the N=4 Maxwell supermultiplet). This is shown to follow from a Kramers degeneracy of the superparticle state space when N/2 is odd.
