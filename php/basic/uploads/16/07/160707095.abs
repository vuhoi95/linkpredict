Title: Compact objects in pure Lovelock theory
Authors: Naresh Dadhich and Sudan Hansraj and Brian Chilambwe
Abstract: For static fluid interiors of compact objects in pure Lovelock gravity (involving ony one $N$th order term in the equation) we establish similarity in solutions for the critical odd and even $d=2N+1, 2N+2$ dimensions. It turns out that in critical odd $d=2N+1$ dimensions, there can exist no bound distribution with a finite radius, while in critical even $d=2N+2$ dimensions, all solutions have similar behavior. For exhibition of similarity we would compare star solutions for $N =1, 2$ in $d=4$ Einstein and $d=6$ in Gauss-Bonnet theory respectively. We also obtain the pure Lovelock analogue of the Finch-Skea model.
