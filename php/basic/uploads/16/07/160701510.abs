Title: Perturbation Theory for Arbitrary Coupling Strength ?
Authors: B. P. Mahapatra and N. B. Pradhan
Abstract: We demonstrate Borel summability for arbitrary coupling strength in a new formulation of perturbation theory (designated here as "Mean Field Perturbation Theory (MFPT)") by applying it to one dimensional anharmonic-interactions, which includes the case of the quartic and sextic anharmonic oscillators(AHO) and the quartic double-well-oscillator (QDWO).It is well known that the perturbation-series is not Borel-summable for the QDWO in the standard formulation of perturbation theory(SFPT). In contrast, MFPT leads to a Borel-summable perturbation series and accurate values for the energy-spectra for arbitrary (physical) value of the coupling strength in each case as stated above. The general nature and the simplicity of the formulation underlying MFPT leads us to conjecture that this scheme may be applicable to arbitrary interactions in quantum theory.
