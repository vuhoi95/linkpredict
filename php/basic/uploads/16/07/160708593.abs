Abstract: A general method has been developed to solve the Schr\"odinger equation for an arbitrary derivative of the $\delta$-function potential in 1-d using cutoff regularization. The work treats both the relativistic and nonrelativistic cases. A distinction in the treatment has been made between the case when the derivative $n$ is an even number from the one when $n$ is an odd number. A general gap equations for each case has been derived. The case of $\delta^{(2)}$-function potential has been used as an example. The results from the relativistic case show that the $\delta^{(2)}$-function system behaves exactly like the $\delta$-function and the $\delta'$-function potentials, which means it also shares the same features with quantum field theories, like being asymptotically free, in the massless limit, it undergoes dimensional transmutation and it possesses an infrared conformal fixed point. As a result the evidence of universality of contact interactions has been extended further to include the $\delta^{(2)}$-function potential.
