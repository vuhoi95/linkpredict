Title: The $\{Î²\}$-expansion formalism in perturbative QCD and its  extension
Authors: A. L. Kataev and S. V. Mikhailov
Abstract: We discuss the $\{ \beta \}$-expansion for renormalization group invariant quantities tracing this expansion to the different contractions of the corresponding incomplete BPHZ $R$-operation. All of the coupling renormalizations, which follow from these contractions, should be taken into account for the $\{ \beta \}$-expansion. We illustrate this feature considering the nonsinglet Adler function $D^\text{NS}$ in the third order of perturbation. We propose a generalization of the $\{ \beta \}$-expansion for the renormalization group covariant quantities -- the $\{ \beta,\gamma \}$-expansion.
