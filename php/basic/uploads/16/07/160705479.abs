Title: Self-Gravitating Static Spacetimes in 4D Einstein-Klein-Gordon System  with Nonminimal Derivative Coupling
Authors: Ainol Yaqin and Bobby E. Gunara
Abstract: We study static spacetime solutions of four dimensional gravitational model with nonminimal derivative coupling and a scalar potential turned on. By taking an ansatz, namely, the first derivative of the scalar field is proportional to square root of a metric function, we reduce the Einstein field equation and the scalar field equation of motions into a single highly nonlinear differential equation. We prove that there is no black hole solution in this setup. Finally, we give a simple model where the scalar potential is taken to be a hyperbolic function and then, obtain several analytic solutions of the model.
