Title: On time
Authors: Alberto S. Cattaneo and Michele Schiavina
Abstract: This note describes the restoration of time in one-dimensional parameterization-invariant (hence timeless) models, namely the classically-equivalent Jacobi action and gravity coupled to matter. It also serves as a timely introduction by examples to the classical and quantum BV-BFV formalism as well as to the AKSZ method.
