Title: Playing with the enveloping algebra of supersymmetry
Authors: E. Cattaruzza and E. Gozzi
Abstract: In this paper we show how to obtain from a scalar superfield its first component via a similarity transformation. We prove that in D=4 the generators of this similarity transformation live in the enveloping algebra of supersymmetry while for D=1 they belong to the basic algebra.
