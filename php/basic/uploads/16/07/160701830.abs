Title: Hodge Numbers for All CICY Quotients
Authors: Andrei Constantin and James Gray and Andre Lukas
Abstract: We present a general method for computing Hodge numbers for Calabi-Yau manifolds realised as discrete quotients of complete intersections in products of projective spaces. The method relies on the computation of equivariant cohomologies and is illustrated for several explicit examples. In this way, we compute the Hodge numbers for all discrete quotients obtained in Braun's classification arXiv:1003.3235.
