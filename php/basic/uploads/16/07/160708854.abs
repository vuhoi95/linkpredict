Title: Sneutrino Inflation with $Î±$-attractors
Authors: Renata Kallosh and Andrei Linde and Diederik Roest and Timm Wrase
Abstract: Sneutrino inflation employs the fermionic partners of the inflaton and stabilizer field as right-handed neutrinos to realize the seesaw mechanism for light neutrino masses. We show that one can improve the latest version of this scenario and its consistency with the Planck data by embedding it in the theory of cosmological $\alpha$-attractors.
