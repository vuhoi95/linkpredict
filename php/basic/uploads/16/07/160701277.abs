Title: Interactions of N Goldstini in Superspace
Authors: N. Cribiori and G. Dall'Agata and F. Farakos
Abstract: We study field theories with N extended non-linearly realized supersymmetries, describing the couplings of models that contain N goldstini. We review all the known formulations of the N=1 goldstino theories and we generalize them to an arbitrary number N of non-linearly realized supersymmetries. We explicitly prove the equivalence of all these extended supersymmetry breaking models containing N goldstini and reformulate the theory with N supersymmetries in terms of standard N=1 constrained superfields.
