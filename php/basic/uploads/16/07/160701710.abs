Abstract: This letter aims to analyse the so-called configurational entropy in the Weyl pure geometrical thick brane model. The Weyl structure plays a prominent role in the thickness of this model. We find a set of parameters associated to the brane width where the configurational entropy exhibits critical points. Furthermore, we show, by means of this information-theoretical measure, that a stricter bound on the parameter of Weyl pure geometrical brane model arises from the CE.
