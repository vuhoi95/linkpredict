Title: Modelling Inflation with a Power-law Approach to the Inflationary  Plateau
Authors: Konstantinos Dimopoulos and Charlotte Owen
Abstract: A new family of inflationary models is introduced and analysed. The behaviour of the parameters characterising the models suggest preferred values, which generate the most interesting testable predictions. Results are further improved if late reheating and/or a subsequent period of thermal inflation is taken into account. Specific model realisations consider a sub-Planckian inflaton variation or a potential without fine-tuning of mass scales, based on the Planck and grand unified theory scales. A toy model realisation in the context of global and local supersymmetry is examined and results fitting the Planck observations are determined.
