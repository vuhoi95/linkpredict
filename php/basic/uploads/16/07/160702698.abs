Title: Violation of cosmic censorship in the gravitational collapse of a dust  cloud in five dimension
Authors: Ryosuke Mizuno and Seiju Ohashi and Tetsuya Shiromizu
Abstract: We analyze the null geodesic equations in five dimensional spherically symmetric spacetime with collapsing inhomogeneous dust cloud. By using a new method, we prove the existence and non-existence of solutions to null geodesic equation emanating from central singularity for smooth initial distribution of dust. Moreover, we also show that the null geodesics can extend to null infinity in a certain case, which imply the violation of cosmic censorship conjecture.
