Title: Operator Mixing in Large $N$ Superconformal Field Theories on  $\mathbb{S}^4$ and Correlators with Wilson loops
Authors: Diego Rodriguez-Gomez and Jorge G. Russo
Abstract: We find a general formula for the operator mixing on the $\mathbb{S}^4$ of chiral primary operators (CPO) for the ${\cal N}=4$ theory at large $N$ in terms of Chebyshev polynomials. As an application, we compute the correlator of a CPO and a Wilson loop, reproducing an earlier result by Giombi and Pestun obtained from a two-matrix model proposal. Finally, we discuss a simple method to obtain correlators in general ${\cal N}=2$ superconformal field theories in perturbation theory in terms of correlators of the ${\cal N}=4$ theory.
