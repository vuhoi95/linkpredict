Title: An Integral Formalism for the Construction of Scheme Transformations in  Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Gongjun Choi and Robert Shrock
Abstract: We present an integral formalism for constructing scheme transformations in a quantum field theory. We apply this to generate several new useful scheme transformations. A comparative analysis is given of these scheme transformations in terms of their series expansion coefficients and their resultant effect on the interaction coupling, in particular at a zero of the beta function away from the origin in coupling-constant space.
