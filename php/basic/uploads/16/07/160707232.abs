Title: Completeness of projective special Kähler and quaternionic Kähler  manifolds
Authors: Vicente Cortés and Malte Dyckmanns and Stefan Suhr
Abstract: We prove that every projective special K\"ahler manifold with \emph{regular boundary behaviour} is complete and defines a family of complete quaternionic K\"ahler manifolds depending on a parameter $c\ge 0$. We also show that, irrespective of its boundary behaviour, every complete projective special K\"ahler manifold with \emph{cubic prepotential} gives rise to such a family. Examples include non-trivial deformations of non-compact symmetric quaternionic K\"ahler manifolds.
