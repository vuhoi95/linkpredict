Title: Classical and Quantum Szilard Engine under Generalized Uncertainty  Principle Effect
Authors: Chih-Wei Chen and Wen-Yu Wen
Abstract: We studied the Szilard engine under the effect of generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). In the classical Szilard engine, the work done by the engine is reduced by the GUP effect via a modified ideal gas law. In the quantum Szilard engine, the correction comes from the shifted eigen energy due to the nonlinear momentum dependence. We studied its effect on both bosonic and fermionic molecules.
