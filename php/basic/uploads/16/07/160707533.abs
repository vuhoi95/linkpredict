Title: Stellar equilibrium in Einstein-Chern-Simons gravity
Authors: Cristian Quinzacara and Patricio Salgado
Abstract: We consider a spherically symmetric internal solution within the context of Einstein-Chern-Simons gravity and derive a generalized five-dimensional Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation. It is shown that the generalized TOV equation leads, in a certain limit, to the standard five-dimensional TOV equation
