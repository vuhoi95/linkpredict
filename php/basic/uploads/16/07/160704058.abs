Title: $SU(2)$ particle sigma model: the role of non-point symmetries in global  quantization
Authors: Victor Aldaya and Julio Guerrero and Francisco F. López-Ruiz and F. Cossío
Abstract: In this paper we achieve the quantization of a particle moving on the $SU(2)$ group manifold, that is, the three-dimensional sphere $S^{3}$, by using group-theoretical methods. For this purpose, a fundamental role is played by contact, non-point symmetries, i.e., symmetries that leave the Poincar\'e-Cartan form semi-invariant at the classical level, although not necessarily the Lagrangian. Special attention is paid to the role played by the basic quantum commutators, which depart from the canonical, Heisenberg-Weyl ones, as well as the relationship between the integration measure in the Hilbert space of the system and the non-trivial topology of the configuration space. Also, the quantization on momentum space is briefly outlined.
