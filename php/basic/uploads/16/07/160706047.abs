Title: Twist-2 at seven loops in planar N=4 SYM theory: Full result and  analytic properties
Authors: Christian Marboe and Vitaly Velizhanin
Abstract: The anomalous dimension of twist-2 operators of arbitrary spin in planar N=4 SYM theory is found at seven loops by using the quantum spectral curve to compute values at fixed spin, and reconstructing the general result using the LLL-algorithm together with modular arithmetic. The result of the analytic continuation to negative spin is presented, and its relation with the recently computed correction to the BFKL and double-logarithmic equation is discussed.
