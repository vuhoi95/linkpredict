Title: Analysis of the Entanglement with Centers
Authors: Xing Huang and Chen-Te Ma
Abstract: Entanglement in gauge theories is difficult to define because of the issue of a tensor product decomposition of a Hilbert space. We choose centers to define quantities that quantify the entanglement, and also use quantization algebras and constraints to analyze the existence of the ambiguities in a system of first-order formulation. In interacting theories, lattice simulations is required to obtain quantitative behaviors of entanglement. Thus, we propose a method to study entanglement with centers on finite spacing lattice without breaking gauge symmetry. We also understand the relation between the extended lattice model and boundary condition, and discuss magnetic choices in the extended lattice model. Then we compute the entanglement entropy in $p$-form free theory in $2p+2$ dimensional Euclidean flat background with a $S^{2p}$ entangling surface, our results support that the ambiguities in non-gauge theories only affect the regulator dependent terms. The universal terms of the entanglement entropy in $p$-form free theories are also determined in terms of the universal terms in 0-form free theory. We also find a suitable strong subadditivity in free theories even if we have non-trivial centers. Finally, we discuss the mutual information with centers in massive scalar field theory with equal probability distribution of centers, and in two dimensional conformal field theory to obtain evidences that mutual information is independent of a choice of centers.
