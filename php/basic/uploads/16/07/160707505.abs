Title: Nielsen Identity and the Renormalization Group Functions in an Abelian  Supersymmetric Chern-Simons Model in the Superfield Formalism
Authors: A. G. Quinto and A. F. Ferrari
Abstract: In this paper we study the Nielsen identity for the supersymmetric Chern-Simons-matter model in the superfield formalism, in three spacetime dimensions. The Nielsen identity is essential to understand the gauge invariance of the symmetry breaking mechanism, and it is calculated by using the BRST invariance of the model. We discuss the technical difficulties in applying this identity to the complete effective superpotential, but we show how we can study in detail the gauge independence of one part of the effective superpotential, $K_{eff}$. We calculate the renormalization group functions of the model for arbitrary gauge-fixing parameter, finding them to be independent of the gauge choice. This result can be used to argue that $K_{eff}$ also does not depend on the gauge parameter. We discuss the possibility of the extension of these results to the complete effective superpotential.
