Title: Holographic Corrections to the Veneziano Amplitude
Authors: Adi Armoni and Edwin Ireson
Abstract: We propose a holographic computation of the $2\rightarrow 2$ meson scattering in a curved string background, dual to a QCD-like theory. We recover the Veneziano amplitude and compute a perturbative correction due to the background curvature. The result implies a small deviation from a linear trajectory, which is a requirement of the UV regime of QCD.
