Title: Predicting Planck scale and Newtonian constant from a Yang-Mills gauge  theory: 1 and 2-loops estimates
Authors: Rodrigo F. Sobreiro and Anderson A. Tomaz
Abstract: Recently, a model for an emergent gravity based on $SO(5)$ Yang-Mills action in Euclidian 4-dimensional spacetime was proposed. In this work we provide some 1 and 2-loops computations and show that the model can accommodate suitable predicting values for the Newtonian constant. Moreover, it is shown that the typical scale of the expected transition between the quantum and the geometrodynamical theory is consistent with Planck scale. We also provide a discussion on the cosmological constant problem.
