Title: On cosmological bounces and Lorentzian wormholes in Galileon theories  with extra scalar field
Authors: R. Kolevatov and S. Mironov
Abstract: We study whether it is possible to design a "classical" bouncing cosmology or static spherically symmetric Lorentzian wormhole in cubic Galileon theories interacting with an extra scalar field. We show that bouncing models are always plagued with gradient instabilities, while there are always ghosts in wormhole backgrounds.
