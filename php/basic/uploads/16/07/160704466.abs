Title: Chaotic dynamics of strings in charged black hole backgrounds
Authors: Pallab Basu and Pankaj Chaturvedi and Prasant Samantray
Abstract: We study the motion of a string in the background of Reissner-Nordstrom black hole, in both AdS as well as asymptotically flat spacetimes. We describe the phase space of this dynamical system through largest Lyapunov exponent, Poincare sections and basins of attractions. We observe that string motion in these settings is particularly chaotic and comment on its characteristics.
