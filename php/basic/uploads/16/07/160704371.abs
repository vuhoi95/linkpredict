Abstract: Supersymmetric lattice Ward-Takahashi identities are investigated perturbatively up to two-loop corrections for super doubler approach of $N=2$ lattice Wess-Zumino models in 1- and 2-dimensions. In this approach notorious chiral fermion doublers are treated as physical particles and momentum conservation is modified in such a way that lattice Leibniz rule is satisfied. The two major difficulties to keep exact lattice supersymmetry are overcome. This formulation defines, however, nonlocal field theory. Nevertheless we confirm that exact supersymmetry on the lattice is realized for all supercharges at the quantum level. Delicate issues of associativity are also discussed.
