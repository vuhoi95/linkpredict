Title: Analytic corrections to AdS by scalar matter and curvature squared term
Authors: Lata Kh Joshi and P. Ramadevi
Abstract: We revisit the background solution for scalar matter coupled higher derivative gravity originally reported in arXiv: 1409.8019[hep-th]. In this letter, we choose a convenient ansatz for metric which determines the first order perturbative corrections to scalar as well as geometry.
