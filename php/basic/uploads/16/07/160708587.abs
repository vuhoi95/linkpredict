Title: Emergence of Yang Mills theory from the Non-Abelian Nambu Model
Authors: C. A. Escobar and L. F. Urrutia
Abstract: The equivalence between the Non-Abelian Nambu model (NANM) and Yang Mills theory is proved, after demanding the Gauss laws at some initial time to the first one. Thereby, the Lorentz violation encoded into the constraint that defines the NANM is physically unobservable. As result, the Goldstone bosons in the NANM arising from the spontaneous symmetry breaking can be identified as the standard gauge fields.
