Title: Holographic Model of Dual Superconductor for Quark Confinement
Authors: Tsung-Sheng Huang and Wen-Yu Wen
Abstract: We show that a hairy black hole solution can provide a holographically dual description of quark confinement. There exists a one-parameter sensible metric which receives the backreaction of matter contents in the holographic action, where the scalar and gauge field are responsible for the condensation of chromomagnetic monopoles. This model features a preconfining phase triggered by second-order monopole condensation and a first-order confinement/deconfinement phase transition. To confirm the confinement, the quark-antiquark potential is calculated by probing a QCD string in both phases. At last, contribution from Kaluza-Klein monopoles in the confining phase is discussed.
