Title: M-strings in thermodynamic limit: Seiberg-Witten geometry
Authors: Babak Haghighat and Wenbin Yan
Abstract: We initiate the study of M-strings in the thermodynamic limit. In this limit the BPS partition function of M5 branes localizes on configurations with a large number of strings which leads to a reformulation of the partition function in terms of a matrix model. We solve this matrix model and obtain its spectral curve which can be interpreted as the Seiberg-Witten curve associated to the compactified M5 brane theory.
