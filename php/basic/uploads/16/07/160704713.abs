Title: Instability of Charged Gauss-Bonnet Black Hole in de Sitter Spacetime at  Large $D$
Authors: Bin Chen and Peng-Cheng Li
Abstract: We study the stabilities of (A)dS charged Gauss-Bonnet(GB) black holes in the large $D$ dimensions. After integrating the equation of motion with respect to the radial direction, we obtain the effective equations at large $D$ to describe the nonlinear dynamical deformations of the black hole. From the perturbation analysis of the effective equations, we get the analytic expressions of the frequencies for the quasinormal modes of scalar type. Furthermore we show that the charged GB black hole becomes unstable only if the cosmological constant is positive, otherwise the black hole is always stable. At the onset of instabilities there is a non-trivial static zero-mode perturbation, which suggests the existence of a new non-spherical symmetric solution branch of static dS charged GB black holes. We construct the non-spherical symmetric static solution of the large $D$ effective equations explicitly.
