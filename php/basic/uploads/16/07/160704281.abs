Title: N=1 Deformations and RG Flows of N=2 SCFTs
Authors: Kazunobu Maruyoshi and Jaewon Song
Abstract: We study certain N=1 preserving deformations of four-dimensional N=2 superconformal field theories (SCFTs) with non-abelian flavor symmetry. The deformation is described by adding an N=1 chiral multiplet transforming in the adjoint representation of the flavor symmetry with a superpotential coupling, and giving a nilpotent vacuum expectation value to the chiral multiplet which breaks the flavor symmetry. This triggers a renormalization group flow to an infrared SCFT. Remarkably, we find classes of theories flow to enhanced N=2 supersymmetric fixed points in the infrared under the deformation. They include generalized Argyres-Douglas theories and rank-one SCFTs with non-abelian flavor symmetries. Most notably, we find renormalization group flows from the deformed conformal SQCDs to the $(A_1, A_n)$ Argyres-Douglas theories. From these "Lagrangian descriptions," we compute the full superconformal indices of the $(A_1, A_n)$ theories and find agreements with the previous results. Furthermore, we study the cases, including the $T_N$ and $R_{0,N}$ theories of class $\mathcal{S}$ and some of rank-one SCFTs, where the deformation gives genuine N=1 fixed points.
