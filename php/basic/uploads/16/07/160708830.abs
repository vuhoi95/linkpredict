Title: Absorption cross-sections of small quasi-spherical black holes: the  massless scalar case
Authors: Tatiana Moskalets and Alexei Nurmagambetov
Abstract: We consider effects of non-uniformity of quasi-spherical small black hole horizons on scattering massless spineless particles in the long-wave approximation. Focusing on 4D flat and AdS neutral black hole backgrounds with conformally spherical geometry of the horizon, we observe the notable differences in compare to the scattering process on the spherically-symmetric black holes. In particular, the absorption cross-section becomes dependent on both, polar and azimuthal, spherical angles, projections of the angular momentum do not keep anymore and the angular momentum operator by itself, though remains quantised, is not quantised in integers. However, within the long-wave approximation, the main conclusion of previously obtained results on scattering on the spherically-symmetric black holes remains the same: the total absorption cross-section is proportional to the area of the black hole. The proportionality coefficient does not depend on the scalar wave frequency in the flat space black hole background, and is dependent on the admissible from the unitarity requirement frequencies in the background of AdS black hole. As a by-product of our studies we establish a quasi-spherical non-static Vaidya-type black hole solutions and outline the relation between real solutions to the elliptic Liouville equation on 2D plane and on two-dimensional sphere.
