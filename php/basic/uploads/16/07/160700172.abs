Title: On a four-loop form factor in N=4
Authors: Rutger H. Boels and Bernd A. Kniehl and Gang Yang
Abstract: We report on progress toward computing a four-loop supersymmetric form factor in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. A representative example particle content from the involved supermultiplets is a stress-tensor operator with two on-shell gluons. In previous work, the integrand for this form factor was obtained using color-kinematic duality in a particularly simple form. Here the result of applying integration-by-parts identities is discussed and cross-checks of the result is performed. Rational IBP relations and their reduction are introduced as a potentially useful aide.
