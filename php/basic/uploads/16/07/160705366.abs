Title: SUSY breaking after inflation in supergravity with inflaton in a massive  vector multiplet
Authors: Yermek Aldabergenov and Sergei V. Ketov
Abstract: We propose a limited class of models, describing interacting chiral multiplets with a non-minimal coupling to a vector multiplet, in curved superspace of $N=1$ supergravity. Those models are suitable for the inflationary model building in supergravity with inflaton assigned to a massive vector multiplet and spontaneous SUSY breaking in Minkowski vacuum after inflation, for any values of the inflationary parameters $n_s$ and $r$, and any scale of SUSY breaking.
