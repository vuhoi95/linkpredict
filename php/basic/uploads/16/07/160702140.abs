Title: Electromagnetic Luminosity of the Coalescence of Charged Black Hole  Binaries
Authors: Steven L. Liebling and Carlos Palenzuela
Abstract: The observation of a possible electromagnetic counterpart by the Fermi GBM group to the aLIGO detection of the merger of a black hole binary has spawned a number of ideas about its source. Furthermore, observations of fast radio bursts (FRBs) have similarly resulted in a range of new models that might endow black hole binaries with electromagnetic signatures. In this context, even the unlikely idea that astrophysical black holes may have significant charge is worth exploring, and here we present results from the simulation of weakly charged black holes as they orbit and merge. Our simulations suggest that a black hole binary with mass comparable to that observed in GW150914 could produce the level of electromagnetic luminosity observed by Fermi GBM ($10^{49}$ ergs/s) with a non-dimensional charge of $q \equiv Q/M = 10^{-4}$ assuming good radiative efficiency. However even a charge such as this is difficult to imagine avoiding neutralization long enough for the binary to produce its electromagnetic counterpart, and so this value would likely serve simply as an upper bound. On the other hand, one can equivalently consider the black holes as having acquired a magnetic monopole charge that would be easy to maintain and would generate an identical electromagnetic signature as the electric charges. The observation of such a binary would have significant cosmological implications, not the least of which would be an explanation for the quantization of charge itself. We also study such a magnetically charged binary in the force-free regime and find it much more radiative, reducing even further the requirements to produce the counterpart.
