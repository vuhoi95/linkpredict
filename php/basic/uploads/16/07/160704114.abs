Abstract: In this paper, the modified entropic force law is studied by using a new kind of generalized uncertainty principle which contains a minimal length, a minimal momentum and a maximal momentum. Firstly, the quantum corrections to the thermodynamics of a black hole is investigated. Then, according to Verlinde's theory, the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) corrected entropic force is obtained. The result shows that the GUP corrected entropic force is related not only to the properties of the black holes, but also to the Planck length and the dimensionless constants $\alpha _{\rm{0}}$ and $\beta _{\rm{0}}$. Moreover, based on the GUP corrected entropic force, we also derive the modified Einstein's field equation (EFE) and the modified Friedmann equation.
