Title: S-duality invariant perturbation theory improved by holography
Authors: Abhishek Chowdhury and Masazumi Honda and Somyadip Thakur
Abstract: We study anomalous dimensions of unprotected low twist operators in the four-dimensional $SU(N)$ $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We construct a class of interpolating functions to approximate the dimensions of the leading twist operators for arbitrary gauge coupling $\tau$. The interpolating functions are consistent with previous results on the perturbation theory, holographic computation and full S-duality. We use our interpolating functions to test the recent conjecture by the $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal bootstrap that upper bounds on the dimensions are saturated at one of the duality-invariant points $\tau =i$ and $\tau =e^{i\pi /3}$. It turns out that our interpolating functions have maximum at $\tau =e^{i\pi /3}$, which are close to the conjectural values by the conformal bootstrap. In terms of the interpolating functions, we draw image of conformal manifold in the space of the dimensions. We find that the image is almost a line despite the conformal manifold is two-dimensional. We also construct interpolating functions for the subleading twist operator. We find that the interpolating functions for the leading and subleading twist operators do not cross each other for finite $N$. Finally we study the dimension of the Konishi operator in the planar limit. We find that our interpolating functions match with numerical result obtained by Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz very well. It turns out that analytic properties of the interpolating functions reflect an expectation on a radius of convergence of the perturbation theory.
