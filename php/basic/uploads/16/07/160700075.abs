Title: A $U(3)$ Gauge Theory on Fuzzy Extra Dimensions
Authors: Seckin Kurkcuoglu and Gonul Unal
Abstract: In this article, we explore the low energy structure of a $U(3)$ gauge theory over spaces with fuzzy sphere(s) as extra dimensions. In particular, we determine the equivariant parametrization of the gauge fields, which transform either invariantly or as vectors under the combined action of $SU(2)$ rotations of the fuzzy spheres and those $U(3)$ gauge transformations generated by $SU(2) \subset U(3)$ carrying the spin $1$ irreducible representation of $SU(2)$. The cases of a single fuzzy sphere $S_F^2$ and a particular direct sum of concentric fuzzy spheres, $S_F^{2 \, Int}$, covering the monopole bundle sectors with windings $\pm 1$ are treated in full and the low energy degrees of freedom for the gauge fields are obtained. Employing the parametrizations of the fields in the former case, we determine a low energy action by tracing over the fuzzy sphere and show that the emerging model is abelian Higgs type with $U(1) \times U(1)$ gauge symmetry and possess vortex solutions on ${\mathbb R}^2$, which we discuss in some detail. Generalization of our formulation to the equivariant parametrization of gauge fields in $U(n)$ theories is also briefly addressed.
