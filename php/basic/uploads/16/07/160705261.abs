Title: Gauge field spectrum in massive Yang-Mills theory with Lorentz violation
Authors: T. R. S. Santos and R. F. Sobreiro and A. A. Tomaz
Abstract: The spectrum of the massive CPT-odd Yang-Mills propagator with Lorentz violation is performed at tree-level. The modification is due to mass terms generated by the exigence of multiplicative renormalizability of Yang-Mills theory with Lorentz violation. The causality analysis is performed from group and front velocities for both, spacelike and timelike background tensors. It is show that, by demanding causality, it is always possible to define a physical sector for the gauge propagator. Hence, it is expected that the model is also unitary, if one takes the Faddeev-Popov ghost into account.
