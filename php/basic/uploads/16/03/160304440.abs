Title: Field Theory Aspects of non-Abelian T-duality and N=2 Linear Quivers
Authors: Yolanda Lozano and Carlos Nunez
Abstract: In this paper we propose a linear quiver with gauge groups of increasing rank as field theory dual to the AdS_5 background constructed by Sfetsos and Thompson through non-Abelian T-duality. The formalism to study 4d N=2 SUSY CFTs developed by Gaiotto and Maldacena is essential for our proposal. We point out an interesting relation between (Hopf) Abelian and non-Abelian T-dual backgrounds that allows to see both backgrounds as different limits of a solution constructed by Maldacena and Nunez. This suggests different completions of the long quiver describing the CFT dual to the non-Abelian T-dual background that match different observables.
