Title: Bound states of spinning black holes in five dimensions
Authors: P. Marcos Crichigno and Flavio Porri and Stefan Vandoren
Abstract: We find and study supergravity BPS bound states of five-dimensional spinning black holes in asymptotically flat spacetime. These solutions follow from multi-string solutions in six-dimensional minimal supergravity and can be uplifted to F-theory or M-theory. We analyze the regularity conditions and work out the example of a bound state of two black holes in detail. The bound state is supported by fluxes through nontrivial topologies exterior to the horizons and KK momentum. Furthermore, we determine the entropy and compare with other macroscopic BPS solutions.
