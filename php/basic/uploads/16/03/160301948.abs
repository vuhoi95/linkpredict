Title: Dynamical angled brane
Authors: Kei-ichi Maeda and Kunihito Uzawa
Abstract: We discuss the dynamical D$p$-brane solutions describing any number of D$p$-branes whose relative orientations are given by certain SU(2) rotations. These are the generalization of the static angled D$p$-brane solutions. We study the collision of dynamical D3-brane with angles in type II string theory, and show that the particular orientation of the smeared D3-brane configuration can provide an example of colliding branes if they have the same charges. Otherwise a singularity appears before D3-branes collide.
