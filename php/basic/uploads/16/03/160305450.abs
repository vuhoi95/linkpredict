Title: Characterization of Unruh Channel in the context of Open Quantum Systems
Authors: Subhashish Banerjee and Ashutosh Kumar Alok and S. Omkar and R. Srikanth
Abstract: We show through the Choi matrix approach that the effect of Unruh acceleration on a qubit is similar to the interaction of the qubit with a vacuum bath, despite the finiteness of the Unruh temperature. Thus, rather counterintuitvely, from the perspective of decoherence in this framework, the particle experiences a vacuum bath with a temperature-modified interaction strength, rather than a thermal bath. We investigate how this "relativistic decoherence" is modified by the presence of environmentally induced decoherence, by studying the degradation of quantum information, as quantified by parameters such as nonlocality, teleportation fidelity, entanglement, coherence and quantum measurement-induced disturbance (a discord-like measure). Also studied are the performance parameters such as gate and channel fidelity. We highlight the distinction between dephasing and dissipative environmental interactions, by considering the actions of quantum non-demolition and squeezed generalized amplitude damping channels, respectively, where, in particular, squeezing is shown to be a useful quantum resource.
