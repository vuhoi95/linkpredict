Title: Torsion as a Gauge Field in a Lorentz-Chern-Simons Theory
Authors: Sim√≥n del Pino and Adolfo Toloza
Abstract: We explore a model of gravity that arises from the consideration of the Chern-Simons form in 2+1 dimensions for a spin connection with a contorsion described by a scalar and a vector field. The effective Lagrangian presents a local Weyl symmetry allowing us to gauge the scalar field to a constant value. From a gauge field theory perspective, it is shown that the vector part of the torsion (related to its trace) is a gauge field for the Weyl group, which allows the interpretation of the torsion as an electromagnetic field. In the gauge of constant scalar field we obtain Chiral Gravity coupled to a Chern-Simons-Proca theory for the vector field, that at the level of equations of motion is equivalent to Topologically Massive Electrodynamics minimally coupled to Chiral Gravity. Electrodynamics and gravity appear here unified as geometrical features of a Riemann-Cartan manifold.
