Title: Holographic anyonization: A systematic approach
Authors: Matthias Ihl and Niko Jokela and Tobias Zingg
Abstract: Anyons have garnered substantial interest theoretically as well as experimentally. Due to the intricate nature of their interactions, however, even basic notions such as the equation of state for any kind of anyon gas have eluded a profound understanding so far. Using holography as a guiding principle, we propose a general method for an alternative quantization of electromagnetic degrees of freedom in the gravitational dual to obtain an effective physical description of strongly correlated anyonic systems. We then demonstrate the application of this prescription in a toy model of an anyonic fluid at finite charge density and magnetic field, dual to a dyonic black brane in AdS_4, and compute the equation of state and various transport coefficients explicitly.
