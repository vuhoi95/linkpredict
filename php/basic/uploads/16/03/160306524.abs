Title: Kerr-Schild--Kundt Metrics are Universal
Authors: Metin Gurses and Tahsin Cagri Sisman and Bayram Tekin
Abstract: Universal metrics are the metrics that solve generic gravity theories which defined by covariant field equations built on the powers of the contractions and the covariant derivatives of the Riemann tensor. Here, we show that the Kerr-Schild--Kundt class metrics are universal extending the rather scarce family of universal metrics in the literature. Besides being interesting on their own, these metrics can provide consistent background for quantum field theory at extremely high energies.
