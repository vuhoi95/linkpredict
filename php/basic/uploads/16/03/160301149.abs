Title: Chern-Simons Theory with Complex Gauge Group on Seifert Fibred  3-Manifolds
Authors: Matthias Blau and George Thompson
Abstract: We consider Chern-Simons theory with complex gauge group and present a complete non-perturbative evaluation of the path integral (the partition function and certain expectation values of Wilson loops) on Seifert fibred 3-Manifolds. We use the method of Abelianisation. In certain cases the path integral can be seen to factorize neatly into holomorphic and anti-holomorphic parts. We obtain closed formulae of this factorization for the expectation values of torus knots.
