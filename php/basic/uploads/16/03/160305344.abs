Title: Entropy Production, Hydrodynamics, and Resurgence in the Primordial  Quark-Gluon Plasma from Holography
Authors: Alex Buchel and Michal P. Heller and Jorge Noronha
Abstract: Microseconds after the Big Bang quarks and gluons formed a strongly-coupled non-conformal liquid driven out-of-equilibrium by the expansion of the Universe. We use holography to determine the non-equilibrium behavior of this liquid in a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker Universe and develop an expansion for the corresponding entropy production in terms of the derivatives of the cosmological scale factor. We show that the resulting series has zero radius of convergence and we discuss its resurgent properties. Finally, we compute the resummed entropy production rate in de Sitter Universe at late times and show that the leading order approximation given by bulk viscosity effects can strongly overestimate/underestimate the rate depending on the microscopic parameters.
