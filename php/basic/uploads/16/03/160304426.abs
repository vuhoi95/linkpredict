Title: Holography on Non-Orientable Surfaces
Authors: Alexander Maloney and Simon F. Ross
Abstract: We consider the holographic computation of two dimensional conformal field theory partition functions on non-orientable surfaces. We classify the three dimensional geometries that give bulk saddle point contributions to the partition function, and find that there are fewer saddles than in the orientable case. For example, for the Klein bottle there is a single smooth saddle and a single additional saddle with an orbifold singularity. We argue that one must generally include singular bulk saddle points in order to reproduce the CFT results. We also discuss loop corrections to these partition functions for the Klein bottle.
