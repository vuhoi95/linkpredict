Title: Holographic Fermi Liquids in a Spontaneously Generated Lattice
Authors: James Alsup and Eleftherios Papantonopoulos and George Siopsis and Kubra Yeter
Abstract: We discuss fermions in a spontaneously generated holographic lattice background. The lattice structure at the boundary is generated by introducing a higher-derivative interaction term between a U(1) gauge field and a scalar field. We solve the equations of motion below the critical temperature at which the lattice forms, and analyze the change in the Fermi surface due to the lattice. The fermion band structure is found to exhibit a band gap due to lattice effects.
