Title: Quantum-classical transition in the Caldeira-Leggett model
Authors: J. Kovacs and B. Fazekas and S. Nagy and K. Sailer
Abstract: The quantum-classical transition in the Caldeira-Leggett model is investigated in the framework of the functional renormalization group method. It is shown that a divergent quadratic term arises in the action due to the heat bath in the model. By removing the divergence with a frequency cutoff we considered the critical behavior of the model. The critical exponents belonging to the susceptibility and the correlation length are determined and their independence of the frequency cutoff and the renormalization scheme is shown.
