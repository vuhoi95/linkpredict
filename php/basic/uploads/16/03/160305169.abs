Title: Stringy origin of 4d black hole microstates
Authors: Massimo Bianchi and Jos√® Francisco Morales and Lorenzo Pieri
Abstract: We derive a precise dictionary between micro-state geometries and open string condensates for a large class of excitations of four dimensional BPS black holes realised in terms of D3-branes intersecting on a six-torus. The complete multipole expansion of the supergravity solutions at weak coupling is extracted from string amplitudes involving one massless closed string and multiple open strings insertions on disks with mixed boundary conditions.
