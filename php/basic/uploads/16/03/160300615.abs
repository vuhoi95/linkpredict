Title: Orientifold ABJM Matrix Model: Chiral Projections and Worldsheet  Instantons
Authors: Sanefumi Moriyama and Tomoki Nosaka
Abstract: We study the partition function of the orientifold ABJM theory, which is a superconformal Chern-Simons theory associated with the orthosymplectic supergroup. We find that the partition function associated with any orthosymplectic supergroup can be realized as the partition function of a Fermi gas system whose density matrix is identical to that associated with the corresponding unitary supergroup with a projection to the even or odd chirality. Furthermore we propose an identity which gives directly all of the Gopakumar-Vafa invariants for the worldsheet instanton effects in the chirally projected theories.
