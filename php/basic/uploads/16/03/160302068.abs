Title: Holographic superconductivity in the presence of dark matter: basic  issues
Authors: Marek Rogatko and Karol I. Wysokinski
Abstract: The holographic approach to study strongly coupled superconductors in the presence of dark matter is reviewed. We discuss the influence of dark matter on the superconducting transition temperature of both s-wave and p-wave holographic superconductors. The upper critical field, coherence length, penetration depth of holographic superconductors as well as the metal-insulator transitions have also been analysed. Issues related to the validity of AdS/CFT correspondence for the description of superconductors studied in the laboratory and possible experiments directed towards the detection of dark matter are discussed. In doing so we shall compare our assumptions and assertions with those generally accepted in the elementary particle experiments aimed at the detection of dark matter particles.
