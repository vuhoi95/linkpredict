Abstract: Minimal chaotic models of D-term inflation predicts too large primordial tensor perturbations. Although it can be made consistent with observations utilizing higher order terms in the K\"ahler potential, expansion is not controlled in the absence of symmetries. We comprehensively study the conditions of K\"ahler potential for D-term plateau-type potentials and discuss its symmetry. They include the alpha-attractor model with a massive vector supermultiplet and its generalization leading to pole inflation of arbitrary order. We extend the models so that it can describe Coulomb phase, gauge anomaly is cancelled, and fields other than inflaton are stabilized during inflation. We also point out a generic issue for large-field D-term inflation that the masses of the non-inflaton fields tend to exceed the Planck scale.
