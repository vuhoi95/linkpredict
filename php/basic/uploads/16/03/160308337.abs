Title: Worldsheet theory of light-cone gauge noncritical strings on higher  genus Riemann surfaces
Authors: Nobuyuki Ishibashi and Koichi Murakami
Abstract: It is possible to formulate light-cone gauge string field theory in noncritical dimensions. Such a theory corresponds to conformal gauge worldsheet theory with nonstandard longitudinal part. We study the longitudinal part of the worldsheet theory on higher genus Riemann surfaces. The results in this paper shall be used to study the dimensional regularization of light-cone gauge string field theory.
