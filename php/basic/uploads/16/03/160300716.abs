Title: Quantum Monte Carlo simulation with a black hole
Authors: Sanjin Benic and Arata Yamamoto
Abstract: We perform quantum Monte Carlo simulations in the background of a classical black hole. The lattice discretized path integral is numerically calculated in the Schwarzschild metric and in its approximated metric. We study spontaneous symmetry breaking of a real scalar field theory. We observe inhomogeneous symmetry breaking induced by inhomogeneous gravitational field.
