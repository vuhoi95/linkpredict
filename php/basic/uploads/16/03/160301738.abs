Abstract: S-matrix amplitudes for the electron-electron scattering are calculated in order to verify the quantum equivalence of dual models. We used an extended Quantum Electrodynamics with CPT-even Lorentz-violating kinetic and mass terms, which was used in a process of gauge embedding, known as Noether dualizationn method (NDM), in order to generate its gauge-invariant dual model. The physical equivalence was established at tree-level and the cross section was calculated to second order in the Lorentz-violating parameter.
