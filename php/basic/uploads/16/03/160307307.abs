Title: $C_T$ for Non-unitary CFTs in Higher Dimensions
Authors: Hugh Osborn and Andreas Stergiou
Abstract: The coefficient $C_T$ of the conformal energy-momentum tensor two-point function is determined for the non-unitary scalar CFTs with four- and six-derivative kinetic terms. The results match those expected from large-$N$ calculations for the CFTs arising from the $O(N)$ non-linear sigma and Gross-Neveu models in specific even dimensions. $C_T$ is also calculated for the CFT arising from $(n-1)$-form gauge fields with derivatives in $2n+2$ dimensions. Results for $(n-1)$-form theory extended to general dimensions as a non-gauge-invariant CFT are also obtained; the resulting $C_T$ differs from that for the gauge-invariant theory. The construction of conformal primaries by subtracting descendants of lower-dimension primaries is also discussed. For free theories this also leads to an alternative construction of the energy-momentum tensor, which can be quite involved for higher-derivative theories.
