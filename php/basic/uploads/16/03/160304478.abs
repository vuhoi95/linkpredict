Title: Supersymmetry on the lattice
Authors: Georg Bergner and Simon Catterall
Abstract: We discuss the motivations, difficulties and progress in the study of supersymmetric lattice gauge theories focusing in particular on ${\cal N}=1$ and ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills in four dimensions. Brief reviews of the corresponding lattice formalisms are given and current results are presented and discussed. We conclude with a summary of the main aspects of current work and prospects for the future.
