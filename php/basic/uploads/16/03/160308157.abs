Title: Gravitational waves and electrodynamics: New perspectives
Authors: Francisco Cabral and Francisco S. N. Lobo
Abstract: Given the recent direct measurement of gravitational waves (GWs) by the LIGO-VIRGO collaboration, the coupling between electromagnetic fields and gravity have a special relevance since it opens new perspectives for future GW detectors and also potentially provide information on the physics of highly energetic GW sources. We explore such couplings using the field equations of electrodynamics on (pseudo) Riemann manifolds and apply it to the background of a GW, seen as a linear perturbation of Minkowski geometry. Electric and magnetic oscillations are induced that propagate as electromagnetic waves and contain information about the GW which generates them. We also briefly show the generation of charge density fluctuations induced by GW and the implications for astrophysics.
