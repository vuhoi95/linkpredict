Title: Entropic interpretation of the Hawking-Moss bounce
Authors: Naritaka Oshita and Jun'ichi Yokoyama
Abstract: We revisit the derivation of the Hawking-Moss transition rate. Using the static coordinates, we show that the Euclidean action is entirely determined by the contribution of the entropy of de Sitter space which is proportional to the surface area of the horizon. This holographic feature is common to any static spacetime with a horizon on which the shift vector vanishes.
