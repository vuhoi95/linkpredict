Title: Superbumps
Authors: Yang Bai and Joshua Berger
Abstract: For a wide range of supersymmetric models, there is a chiral superfield whose scalar and pseudo-scalar have approximately degenerate masses and couplings to Standard Model particles. At colliders, they may show up as "superbumps": a pair of resonances with similar masses and production cross-sections. Observing the superbumps may provide evidence of supersymmetry even without seeing superpartners with a different spin. We present two models which realize the superbump scenario. The first one contains an elementary superfield, 24, under SU(5)_GUT, while the second one is based on the supersymmetric QCD model with N_f = N_c +1 and identifying SU(N_f=5) as SU(5)_GUT. Both models have rich phenomenology including nearly mass-degenerate scalar and pseudo-scalar color octets that appear as three body resonances of two photons and one gluon. We also show that the recent 750 GeV diphoton excess at the LHC could be the first hint of a superbump signature.
