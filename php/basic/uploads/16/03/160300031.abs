Title: Superconducting quantum criticality in three-dimensional Luttinger  semimetals
Authors: Igor Boettcher and Igor F. Herbut
Abstract: We study a simple model of three-dimensional fermions close to a quadratic band touching point, built from the celebrated Luttinger single-particle Hamiltonian and an attractive contact interaction between the particles. Such a system displays a novel quantum critical point between the semimetallic and an s-wave superconducting phase at which the low-energy "Luttinger fermions" are inextricably coupled to the order parameter fluctuations. The quantum critical point is perturbatively accessible near four spatial dimensions, where it features nontrivial scaling with dynamical exponent 1<z<2 and emergent rotational and particle-hole symmetries. Some features of the criticality, such as oscillatory corrections to scaling and its enhanced symmetry, are discussed.
