Title: On a residual freedom of the next-to-leading BFKL eigenvalue in color  adjoint representation in planar $\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM
Authors: Sergey Bondarenko and Alex Prygarin
Abstract: We discuss a residual freedom of the next-to-leading BFKL eigenvalue that originates from ambiguity in redistributing the next-to-leading~(NLO) corrections between the adjoint BFKL eigenvalue and eigenfunctions in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills~(SYM) Theory. In terms of the remainder function of the Bern-Dixon-Smirnov~(BDS) amplitude this freedom is translated to reshuffling correction between the eigenvalue and the impact factors in the multi-Regge kinematics~(MRK) in the next-to-leading logarithm approximation~(NLA). We show that the modified NLO BFKL eigenvalue suggested by the authors can be introduced in the MRK expression for the remainder function by shifting the anomalous dimension in the impact factor in such a way that the two and three loop remainder function is left unchanged to the NLA accuracy.
