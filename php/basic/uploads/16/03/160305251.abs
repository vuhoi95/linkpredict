Title: The 750 GeV diphoton resonance as an sgoldstino: a reappraisal
Authors: Debjyoti Bardhan and Pritibhajan Byakti and Diptimoy Ghosh and Tarun Sharma
Abstract: Among the various explanations of the possible 750 GeV diphoton resonance, the possibility of it being an sgoldstino is an attractive one, as it is related to the spontaneous breaking of global supersymmetry. We discuss this possibility in this paper and point out the various theoretical issues associated with it. In particular, we indicate the difficulties of this explanation in realistic models of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking.
