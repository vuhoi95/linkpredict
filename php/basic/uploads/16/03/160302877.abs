Title: The full phase space of a model in the Calogero-Ruijsenaars family
Authors: L. Feher and T. F. Gorbe
Abstract: We complete the recent derivation of a Ruijsenaars type system that arises as a reduction of the natural free system on the Heisenberg double of SU(n,n). The previous analysis by Marshall focused on a dense open submanifold of the reduced phase space, and here we describe the full phase space wherein Liouville integrability of the system holds by construction.
