Title: Geodesic Motions in AdS Soliton Background Space-time
Authors: Han-qing Shi and Ding-fang Zeng
Abstract: We study both massive and massless particle's geodesic motion in the background of general dimensional AdS-Sol space-time. We find that the massive particles oscillate along the radial direction, while massless particles experience one-time bouncing as they approach the "horizon" line of the soliton. Our results provide a direct way to understand the negative energy/masses leading to the AdS-Sol geometry. As a potential application, we extend the point particle to a 3-brane and fix the background as a 5+1 dimension AdS-Sol, thus obtain a very natural bouncing/cyclic cosmological model.
