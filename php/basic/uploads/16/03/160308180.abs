Title: Electrodynamics and spacetime geometry: Astrophysical applications
Authors: Francisco Cabral and Francisco S. N. Lobo
Abstract: After a brief review of the foundations of (pre-metric) electromagnetism in differential forms, we proceed with the tensor formulation and explore physical consequences of Maxwell's equations in curved spacetime. The generalized Gauss and Maxwell-Amp\`{e}re laws, as well as the wave equations, reveal potentially interesting astrophysical applications. The physical implications of these equations are explored and specific solutions are obtained. In all cases, new electromagnetic couplings and related phenomena are induced by the spacetime curvature. The applications of astrophysical interest considered here correspond essentially to the Schwarzschild spacetime and the spacetime around a rotating spherical mass in the weak field and slow rotation regime. In the latter, we use the Parameterised Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism. In general, new electromagnetic effects induced by spacetime curvature include the following: Gravitational contributions for the decay of electric and magnetic fields in spherically symmetric spacetime, magnetic contributions to Gauss law due to the gravitomagnetic character of the spacetime around rotating objects, additional electric contributions to Maxwell's displacement current in the Maxwell-Amp\'{e}re law induced by gravitomagnetism (and also for dynamical geometries), and the coupling between the wave dynamics for different electric and magnetic components (affecting polarization), amongst others.
