Abstract: In this paper we consider the metric of a 2+1-dimensional rotating acoustic black hole in the neo-Newtonian theory and applying the quantum statistical method, we calculate the statistical entropy using a corrected state density due to the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). In our calculations we have shown that the obtained entropy is finite and correction terms are generated. Moreover, the computation of the entropy for this method does not present logarithmic corrections.
