Title: KÃ¤hler structure in the commutative limit of matrix geometry
Authors: Goro Ishiki and Takaki Matsumoto and Hisayoshi Muraki
Abstract: We consider the commutative limit of matrix geometry described by a large-$N$ sequence of some Hermitian matrices. Under some assumptions, we show that the commutative geometry possesses a K\"{a}hler structure. We find an explicit relation between the K\"{a}hler structure and the matrix configurations which define the matrix geometry. We also find a relation between the matrix configurations and those obtained from the geometric quantization.
