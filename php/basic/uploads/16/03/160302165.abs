Abstract: In this work we study the partially constrained vielbein formulation of the new quasidilaton theory of massive gravity which couples to both physical and fiducial metrics simultaneously via a composite effective metric. This formalism improves the new quasidilaton model since the Boulware-Deser ghost is removed fully non-linearly at all scales. This also yields crucial implications in the cosmological applications. We derive the governing cosmological background evolution and study the stability of the attractor solution.
