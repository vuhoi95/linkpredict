Title: Noncommutative effects of spacetime on holographic superconductors
Authors: Debabrata Ghorai and Sunandan Gangopadhyay
Abstract: The Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue method is employed to analytically investigate the properties of holographic superconductors in higher dimensions in the framework of Born-Infeld electrodynamics incorporating the effects of noncommutative spacetime. In the background of pure Einstein gravity in noncommutative spacetime, we obtain the relation between the critical temperature and the charge density. We also obtain the value of the condensation operator and the critical exponent. Our findings suggest that higher the value of noncommutative parameter and Born-Infeld parameter make the condensate harder to form. We also observe that the critical temperature depends on the mass of the black hole and higher value of black hole mass is favourable for the formation of the condensate.
