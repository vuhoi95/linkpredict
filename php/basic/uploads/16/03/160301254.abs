Abstract: We study the equilibrium and near-equilibrium properties of a holographic five-dimensional model consisting of Einstein gravity coupled to a scalar field with a non-trivial potential. The dual four-dimensional gauge theory is not conformal and, at zero temperature, exhibits a renormalisation group flow between two different fixed points. We quantify the deviations from conformality both in terms of thermodynamic observables and in terms of the bulk viscosity of the theory. By computing the quasi-normal modes of the system we identify two different relaxation channels. At high temperatures, the system first isotropises, meaning that all pressures become equal, and subsequently equilibrates, meaning that the equation of state becomes applicable. At low temperatures the order of these two processes is reversed.
