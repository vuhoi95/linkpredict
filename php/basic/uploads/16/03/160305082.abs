Abstract: We obtain the Maxwell-J\"uttner distribution function at first order in the post-Newtonian approximation within the framework of general relativity. Taking into account the aforesaid distribution function, we compute the particle four-flow and energy-momentum tensor. We focus on the search of static solutions for the gravitational potentials with spherical symmetry. In doing so, we obtain the density, pressure and gravitational potential energy profiles in terms of dimensionless radial coordinate by solving the aforesaid equations numerically. In particular, we find the parametric profile for the equation of state $p/\rho$ in terms of the dimensionless radial coordinate. Due to its physical relevance, we also find the galaxy rotation curves using the post-Newtonian approximation. We join two different kinds of static solutions in order to account for the linear regime near the center and the typical flatten behavior at large radii as well.
