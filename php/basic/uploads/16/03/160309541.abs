Title: From Prigogine to Raychaudhuri
Authors: Minyong Guo and Yu Tian and Xiaoning Wu and Hongbao Zhang
Abstract: It is highlighted by Prigogine that there are two additional universal behaviors associated with the entropy production rate besides the four laws of thermodynamics. One is that the entropy production rate decreases when the system approaches the steady state, and the other is that the entropy production rate reaches its minimal value at the steady state. Motivated by the black hole thermodynamics and AdS/CFT correspondence, we resort to Raychaudhuri equation to prove that these two universal behaviors are also obeyed by the black hole entropy. In particular, our result together with the four laws of black hole thermodynamics further indicates that the holographic gravity should be universal, not restricted only within the context of AdS/CFT correspondence.
