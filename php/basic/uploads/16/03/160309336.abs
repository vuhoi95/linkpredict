Title: High energy scattering of Dirac particles on smooth potentials
Authors: Nguyen Suan Han and Le Anh Dung and Nguyen Nhu Xuan and Vu Toan Thang
Abstract: The derivation of the Glauber type representation for the high energy scattering amplitude of particles of spin 1/2 is given within the framework of the Dirac equation in the Foldy Wouthuysen (FW) representation and two-component formalism. The differential cross sections on the Yukawa and Gaussian potentials are also considered and discussed.
