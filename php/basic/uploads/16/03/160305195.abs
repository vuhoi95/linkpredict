Title: Setting the Stage for a Non-Supersymmetric UV-Complete String  Phenomenology
Authors: Steven Abel and Keith R. Dienes and Eirini Mavroudi
Abstract: In this talk, I discuss our recent work concerning the construction of non-supersymmetric heterotic string models which have exponentially suppressed dilaton tadpoles and cosmological constants, and thus greatly enhanced stability properties. The existence of such models opens the door to non-supersymmetric string model-building, and I discuss how semi-realistic string models resembling the Standard Model or any of its unified variants may be constructed within this framework. These models maintain modular invariance and exhibit a misaligned supersymmetry which ensures UV finiteness, even without spacetime supersymmetry. I also discuss the potential implications for phenomenology.
