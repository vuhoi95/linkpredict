Title: Warm Ekpyrosis
Authors: Aaron M. Levy and Gustavo Turiaci
Abstract: We propose a mechanism to generate a nearly scale-invariant spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations about a stable, ekpyrotic background. The key ingredient is a coupling between a single ekpyrotic field and a perfect fluid of ultra-relativistic matter. This coupling introduces a friction term into the equation of motion for the field, opposing the Hubble anti-friction, which can be chosen such that an exactly scale-invariant (or nearly scale-invariant) spectrum of adiabatic density perturbations is continuously produced throughout the ekpyrotic phase. This mechanism eliminates the need for a second (entropic) scalar field and hence any need for introducing a second phase for converting entropic into curvature fluctuations. It also reduces the constraints on the equation of state during the ekpyrotic phase and, thereby, the need for parametric fine-tuning.
