Title: Orthogonal Nilpotent Superfields from Linear Models
Authors: Renata Kallosh and Anna Karlsson and Benjamin Mosk and Divyanshu Murli
Abstract: We derive supersymmetry/supergravity models with constrained orthogonal nilpotent superfields from the linear models in the formal limit where the masses of the sgoldstino, inflatino and sinflaton tend to infinity. The case where the sinflaton mass remains finite leads to a model with a `relaxed' constraint, where the sinflaton remains an independent field. Our procedure is equivalent to a requirement that some of the components of the curvature of the moduli space tend to infinity.
