Abstract: In this paper, conditions for existence of G\"{o}del and G\"{o}del-type solutions in Brans-Dicke (BD) scalar-tensor theory and their main features are studied. The consistency of equations of motion, causality violation and existence of CTCs (closed time-like curves) are investigated. The role which cosmological constant and Mach principle play to achieve the consistency of this model is studied.
