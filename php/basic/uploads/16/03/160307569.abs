Title: Black holes and information: A new take on an old paradox
Authors: K. L. H. Bryan and A. J. M. Medved
Abstract: Interest in the black hole information paradox has recently been catalyzed by the newer "firewall" argument. The crux of the updated argument is that previous solutions which relied on observer complementarity are in violation of the quantum condition of monogamy of entanglement; with the prescribed remedy being to discard the equivalence principle in favor of an energy barrier (or firewall) at the black hole horizon. Differing points of view have been put forward, including the "ER=EPR" counterargument and the final-state solution, both of which can be viewed as potential resolutions to the apparent conflict between quantum monogamy and Einstein equivalence. After reviewing these recent developments, this paper argues that the ER=EPR and final-state solutions can -- thanks to observer complementarity -- be seen as the same resolution of the paradox but from two different perspectives: inside and outside the black hole.
