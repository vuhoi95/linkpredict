Title: Two-loop five-point all plus helicity Yang-Mills amplitude
Authors: David C. Dunbar and Warren B. Perkins
Abstract: We re-compute the recently derived two-loop five-point all plus Yang-Mills amplitude using Unitarity and Recursion. Recursion requires augmented recursion to determine the sub-leading pole. Using these methods the simplicity of this amplitude is understood.
