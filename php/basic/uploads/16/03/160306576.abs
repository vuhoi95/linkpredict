Title: A new 6d fixed point from holography
Authors: Fabio Apruzzi and Giuseppe Dibitetto and Luigi Tizzano
Abstract: We propose a stringy construction giving rise to a class of interacting and non-supersymmetric CFT's in six dimensions. Such theories may be obtained as an IR conformal fixed point of an RG flow ending up in a $(1, 0)$ theory in the UV. We provide the due holographic evidence in the context of massive type IIA on $\textrm {AdS}_{7}\times M_3$, where $M_3$ is topologically an $S^3$. In particular, in this paper we present a 10d flow solution which may be interpreted as a non-BPS bound state of NS5, D6 and $\overline{\textrm{D6}}$ branes. Moreover, by adopting its 7d effective description, we are able to holographically compute the free energy and the operator spectrum in the novel IR conformal fixed point.
