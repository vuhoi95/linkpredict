Title: A Matrix Model for Non-Abelian Quantum Hall States
Authors: Nick Dorey and David Tong and Carl Turner
Abstract: We propose a matrix quantum mechanics for a class of non-Abelian quantum Hall states. The model describes electrons which carry an internal SU(p) spin. The ground states of the matrix model include spin-singlet generalisations of the Moore-Read and Read-Rezayi states and, in general, lie in a class previously introduced by Blok and Wen. The effective action for these states is a U(p) Chern-Simons theory. We show how the matrix model can be derived from quantisation of the vortices in this Chern-Simons theory and how the matrix model ground states can be reconstructed as correlation functions in the boundary WZW model.
