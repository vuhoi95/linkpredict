Title: The Galois coaction on $Ï†^4$ periods
Authors: Erik Panzer and Oliver Schnetz
Abstract: We report on calculations of Feynman periods of primitive log-divergent $\phi^4$ graphs up to eleven loops. The structure of $\phi^4$ periods is described by a series of conjectures. In particular, we discuss the possibility that $\phi^4$ periods are a comodule under the Galois coaction. Finally, we compare the results with the periods of primitive log-divergent non-$\phi^4$ graphs up to eight loops and find remarkable differences to $\phi^4$ periods. Explicit results for all periods we could compute are provided in ancillary files.
