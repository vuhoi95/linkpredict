Title: Demystifying the twistor construction of composite operators in N=4  super-Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Dmitry Chicherin and Emery Sokatchev
Abstract: We explain some details of the construction of composite operators in N=4 SYM that we have elaborated earlier in the context of Lorentz harmonic chiral (LHC) superspace. We give a step-by-step elementary derivation and show that the result coincides with the recent hypothesis put forward in arXiv:1603.04471 within the twistor approach. We provide the appropriate LHC-to-twistors dictionary.
