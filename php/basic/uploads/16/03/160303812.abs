Title: BMS Modules in Three Dimensions

Abstract: We build unitary representations of the BMS algebra and its higher-spin extensions in three dimensions, using induced representations as a guide. Our prescription naturally emerges from an ultrarelativistic limit of highest-weight representations of Virasoro and W algebras, which is to be contrasted with non-relativistic limits that typically give non-unitary representations. To support this dichotomy, we also point out that the ultrarelativistic and non-relativistic limits of generic W algebras differ in the structure of their non-linear terms.
