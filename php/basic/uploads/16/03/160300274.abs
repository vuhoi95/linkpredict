Title: WKB-like approach to Sauter-Schwinger pair production in  spacetime-dependent fields
Authors: Johannes Oertel and Ralf Sch√ºtzhold
Abstract: A well-known method for calculating an approximation to the pair creation rate in the Sauter-Schwinger effect is based on approximating solutions of the Riccati equation. Although several interesting field configurations can be examined in this formalism, its application is fundamentally restricted to the case of solely time-dependent fields. We propose a new WKB-like technique for approximating the pair creation rate in the presence of spacetime-dependent fields.
