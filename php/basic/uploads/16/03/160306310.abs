Title: More about structures localized on domain walls: strings, skyrmions,  analytic solutions for orientational moduli, symmetry analysis
Authors: Vladimir Bychkov and Michael Kreshchuk and Evgeniy Kurianovych
Abstract: We address a simple model allowing the existence of domain walls with orientational moduli localised on them. Within this model, we discuss an analytic solution and explore it in the context of the previous results. We discuss the existence of one-dimensional domain walls localised on two-dimensional ones, and construct a corresponding effective action. In the low-energy limit, which is $O(3)$ sigma-model, we discuss the existence of skyrmions localized on domain walls, and provide a solution for a skyrmion configuration, based on an analogy with instantons. We perform symmetry analysis of the initial model and low-energy theory on the domain wall world volume.
