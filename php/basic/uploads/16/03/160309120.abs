Title: Complementarity in Genuine Nonlocality: A device independent outlook
Authors: Sasha Sami and Anubhav Chaturvedi and Indranil Chakrabarty
Abstract: The notion of complementarity or mutually exclusiveness of physical phenomenon has always been of keen interest to the physicists. In this work we show that there exists a complementary relationship in terms of the genuine non-locality of a multipartite system vs. that of reduced subsystems. We further assert that the same is enforced due to no-signaling condition. To this end we consider Svetlichny games in a multiparty binary input and output scenario with a threshold value of the winning probability as a signature of genuine multiparty non locality. We analytically show that, in the Svetlichny games setup, there exists complementary relations between Svetlichny correlations of $n$ party and Svetlichny correlations of any subset of $k \leq n$ parties within the no-signaling framework. In other words, in general non local theories, the genuine multiparty non locality for multiparty systems comes at the cost of upper bounding the genuine multiparty non locality of the reduced subsystem. In addition to Svetlichny games we consider many other non local games like Mermin games, Bancal \emph{et al's} IP, Guess Your Neighbors Input game and provide numerical findings ( in case of no-signaling and quantum correlations ) in support of our main result.
