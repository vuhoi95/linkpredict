Title: Integral representations in supermanifolds: super Hodge duals, PCOs and  Liouville forms
Authors: L. Castellani and R. Catenacci and P. A. Grassi
Abstract: We present few types of integral transforms and integral representations that are very useful for extending to supergeometry many familiar concepts of differential geometry. Among them we discuss the construction of the super Hodge dual, the integral representation of picture changing operators of string theories and the construction of the super-Liouville form of a symplectic supermanifold.
