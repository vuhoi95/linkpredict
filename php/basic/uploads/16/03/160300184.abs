Title: On the Monogamy of Holographic $n$-partite Information
Authors: S. Mirabi and M. Reza Tanhayi and R. Vazirian
Abstract: We investigate the monogamy of holographic $n$-partite information for a system consisting of $n$ disjoint parallel strips with the same width and separation in AdS and AdS black brane geometries. More precisely, we study the sign of this quantity, \emph{e.g.} for $n=4, 5$, in various dimensions and for different parameters. Our results show that for quantum field theories with holographic duals, the holographic 4-partite information is always positive and the sign of holographic 5-partite information is found to be negative in the dual strongly coupled $1+1$ dimensional CFT. This latter result indicates that the holographic 4-partite information is monogamous. We also find the critical points corresponding to the possible phase transitions of these quantities.
