Abstract: We explore the possibility of finding Pure Lovelock gravity as a particular limit of a Chern-Simons action for a specific expansion of the AdS algebra in odd dimensions. We derive this relation at the level of the action in five and seven dimensions. Additionally we provide the general result for higher dimensions and discuss some issues arising from the obtained dynamics.
