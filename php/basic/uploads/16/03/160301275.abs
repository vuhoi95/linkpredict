Abstract: We present the first complete Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis of cosmological models with evolving cosmic (super)string networks, using the unconnected segment model in the unequal-time correlator formalism. For ordinary cosmic string networks, we derive joint constraints on Lambda cold dark matter (CDM) and string network parameters, namely the string tension Gmu, the loop-chopping efficiency c_r and the string wiggliness \alpha. For cosmic superstrings, we obtain joint constraints on the fundamental string tension Gmu_F, the string coupling g_s, the self-interaction coefficient c_s, and the volume of compact extra dimensions w. This constitutes the most comprehensive CMB analysis of LambdaCDM cosmology + strings to date. For ordinary cosmic string networks our updated constraint on the string tension is, in relativistic units, Gmu<1.1x10^-7, while for cosmic superstrings our constraint on the fundamental string tension is Gmu_F<2.8x10^-8, both obtained using Planck2015 temperature and polarisation data.
