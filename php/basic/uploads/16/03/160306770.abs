Title: DBI action of real linear superfield in 4D ${\cal N}=1$ conformal  supergravity
Authors: Shuntaro Aoki and Yusuke Yamada
Abstract: We construct the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action of a real linear multiplet in 4D $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity. Based on conformal supergravity, we derive the general condition under which the DBI action can be realized, and show that it can be constructed in the new minimal supergravity. We also generalize it to the matter coupled system.
