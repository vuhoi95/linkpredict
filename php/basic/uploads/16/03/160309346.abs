Title: Collinear Superspace
Authors: Timothy Cohen and Gilly Elor and Andrew J. Larkoski
Abstract: This letter provides a superfield based approach to constructing a collinear slice of $\mathcal{N}$ = 1 superspace. The strategy is analogous to integrating out anti-collinear fermionic degrees-of-freedom as was developed in the context of soft-collinear effective theory. The resulting Lagrangian can be understood as an integral over collinear superspace, where half the supercoordinates have been integrated out. The application to $\mathcal{N}$ = 1 super Yang-Mills is presented. Collinear superspace provides the foundation for future explorations of supersymmetric soft-collinear effective theory.
