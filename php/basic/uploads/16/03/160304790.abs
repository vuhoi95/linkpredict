Title: One-loop superstring six-point amplitudes and anomalies in pure spinor  superspace
Authors: Carlos R. Mafra and Oliver Schlotterer
Abstract: We present the massless six-point one-loop amplitudes in the open and closed superstring using BRST cohomology arguments from the pure spinor formalism. The hexagon gauge anomaly is traced back to a class of kinematic factors in pure spinor superspace which were recently introduced as BRST pseudo-invariants. This complements previous work where BRST invariance arguments were used to derive the non-anomalous part of the amplitude. The associated worldsheet functions are non-singular and demonstrated to yield total derivatives on moduli space upon gauge variation. These cohomology considerations yield an efficient organizing principle for closed-string amplitudes that match expectations from S-duality in the low-energy limit.
