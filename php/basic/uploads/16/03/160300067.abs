Title: On bound-states of the Gross Neveu model with massive fundamental  fermions
Authors: Yitzhak Frishman and Jacob Sonnenschein
Abstract: In the search for QFT's that admit boundstates, we reinvestigate the two dimensional Gross-Neveu model, but with massive fermions. By computing the self-energy for the auxiliary boundstate field and the effective potential, we show that unlike the massless model, where in the large N limit there is a boundstate at threshold, for massive fermions there is a non-trivial binding energy. In the limit of infinite coupling the boundstate becomes massless and the binding energy is twice the fermion physical mass.
