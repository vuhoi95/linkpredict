Title: Superfield Hamiltonian quantization in terms of quantum antibrackets
Authors: Igor A. Batalin and Peter M. Lavrov
Abstract: We develop a new version of the superfield Hamiltonian quantization. The main new feature is that the BRST-BFV charge and the gauge fixing Fermion are introduced on equal footing within the sigma model approach, which provides for the actual use of the quantum/derived antibrackets. We study in detail the generating equations for the quantum antibrackets and their primed counterparts. We discuss the finite quantum anticanonical transformations generated by the quantum antibracket.
