Title: Radiation of Charged Black Holes and Modified Dispersion Relation
Authors: A. D. Kamali and Pouria Pedram
Abstract: We investigate the effects of a modified dispersion relation proposed by Majhi and Vagenas on the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole thermodynamics in a universe with large extra dimensions. It is shown that entropy, temperature and heat capacity receive new corrections and charged black holes in this framework have less degrees of freedom and decay faster compared to black holes in the Hawking picture. We also study the emission rate of black hole and compare our results with other quantum gravity approaches. In this regard, the existence of the logarithmic prefactor and the relation between dimensions and charge are discussed. This procedure is not only valid for a single horizon spacetime but it is also valid for the spacetimes with inner and outer horizons.
