Abstract: We study a holographic D3/probe-D5-brane model of a double monolayer Dirac semimetal in a magnetic field and in the presence of a nonzero temperature. Intra- and inter-layer exciton condensates can form by varying the balanced charge density on the layers, the spatial separation and the temperature. Constant temperature phase diagrams for a wide range of layer separations and charge densities are found. The presence of a finite temperature makes the phase diagrams extremely rich and in particular leads to the appearance of a symmetric phase which was missing at zero temperature.
