Title: Duality and self-duality of action in classical and quantum mechanics.  Energy spectrum reflection symmetry of quasi-exactly solvable models,  revisited
Authors: Michael Kreshchuk and Tobias Gulden
Abstract: The phenomenon of duality reflects a link between the behaviour of a system in different regimes. The goal of this work is to expose the classical origins of such links, and to demonstrate how they come to life in some quasi-exactly solvable problems of quantum mechanics. By studying the global properties of the Riemannian surface of the classical momentum, we reveal that the abbreviated classical action possesses a symmetry which holds also at the quantum level and underlies the energy reflection symmetry of the quantum energy levels.
