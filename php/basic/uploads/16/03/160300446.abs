Title: Covariant perturbation expansion of off-diagonal heat kernel
Authors: Yu-Zi Gou and Wen-Du Li and Ping Zhang and Wu-Sheng Dai
Abstract: Covariant perturbation expansion is an important method in quantum field theory. In this paper an expansion up to arbitrary order for off-diagonal heat kernels in flat space based on the covariant perturbation expansion is given. In literature, only diagonal heat kernels are calculated based on the covariant perturbation expansion.
