Title: On quantum corrections in higher-spin theory in flat space
Authors: Dmitry Ponomarev and Arkady A. Tseytlin
Abstract: We consider an interacting theory of an infinite tower of massless higher-spin fields in flat space with cubic vertices and their coupling constants found previously by Metsaev. We compute the one-loop bubble diagram part of the self-energy of the spin 0 member of the tower by summing up all higher-spin loop contributions. We find that the result contains an exponentially UV divergent part and we discuss how it could be cancelled by a tadpole contribution depending on yet to be determined quartic interaction vertex. We also compute the tree-level four-scalar scattering amplitude due to all higher-spin exchanges and discuss its inconsistency with the BCFW constructibility condition. We comment on possible relation to similar computations in AdS background in connection with AdS/CFT.
