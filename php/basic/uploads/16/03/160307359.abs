Title: Regular black holes: Guilfoyle's electrically charged solutions with a  perfect fluid phantom core
Authors: Jos√© P. S. Lemos and Vilson T. Zanchin
Abstract: Regular black hole solutions are found among the Guilfoyle exact solutions. These are spherically symmetric solutions of general relativity coupled to Maxwell's electromagnetism and charged matter where the metric potentials and electromagnetic fields are related in some particularly simple form. We show that, for certain ranges of the parameters, there are objects which correspond to regular charged black holes, whose interior region is filled by an electrically charged phantom-like fluid, or, in the limiting case, a de Sitter false vacuum fluid, and whose exterior region is Reissner-Nordstr\"om. The boundary between both regions is a smooth boundary surface, except in the limiting case where the boundary is made of a massless electrically charged spherically symmetric coat. The main physical and geometrical properties of such charged regular solutions are analyzed.
