Title: Smooth non-extremal D1-D5-P solutions as charged gravitational  instantons
Authors: Bidisha Chakrabarty and Jorge V. Rocha and Amitabh Virmani
Abstract: We present an alternative and more direct construction of the non-supersymmetric D1-D5-P supergravity solutions found by Jejjala, Madden, Ross and Titchener. We show that these solutions --- with all three charges and both rotations turned on --- can be viewed as a charged version of the Myers-Perry instanton. We present an inverse scattering construction of the Myers-Perry instanton metric in Euclidean five-dimensional gravity. The angular momentum bounds in this construction turn out to be precisely the ones necessary for the smooth microstate geometries. We add charges on the Myers-Perry instanton using appropriate SO(4,4) hidden symmetry transformations. The full construction can be viewed as an extension and simplification of a previous work by Katsimpouri, Kleinschmidt and Virmani.
