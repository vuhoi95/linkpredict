Title: Universal Bounds on Charged States in 2d CFT and 3d Gravity
Authors: Nathan Benjamin and Ethan Dyer and A. Liam Fitzpatrick and Shamit Kachru
Abstract: We derive an explicit bound on the dimension of the lightest charged state in two dimensional conformal field theories with a global abelian symmetry. We find that the bound scales with $c$ and provide examples that parametrically saturate this bound. We also prove than any such theory must contain a state with charge-to-mass ratio above a minimal lower bound. We comment on the implications for charged states in three dimensional theories of gravity.
