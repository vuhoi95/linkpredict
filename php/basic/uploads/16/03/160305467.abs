Title: Ding-Iohara-Miki symmetry of network matrix models
Authors: A. Mironov and A. Morozov and Y. Zenkevich
Abstract: Ward identities in the most general "network matrix model" can be described in terms of the Ding-Iohara-Miki algebras (DIM). This confirms an expectation that such algebras and their various limits/reductions are the relevant substitutes/deformations of the Virasoro/W-algebra for (q, t) and (q_1, q_2, q_3) deformed network matrix models. Exhaustive for these purposes should be the Pagoda triple-affine elliptic DIM, which corresponds to networks associated with 6d gauge theories with adjoint matter (double elliptic systems). We provide some details on elliptic qq-characters.
