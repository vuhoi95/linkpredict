Title: Non-Abelian Monopoles as the Origin of Dark Matter
Authors: H. Falomir and J. Gamboa and F. Mendez
Abstract: We suggest that dark matter may be partially constituted by a dilute 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles gas. We reach this conclusion by using the Georgi-Glashow model coupled to a dual kinetic mixing term $ F{\tilde {\cal G}}$ where $F$ is the electromagnetic field and ${\cal G}$ the 't Hooft tensor. We show that these monopoles carry both (Maxwell) electric and (Georgi-Glashow) magnetic charges and the electric charge quantization condition is modified in terms of a dimensionless real parameter. This parameter could be determined from milli-charged particle experiments.
