Title: Geometry defects in Bosonic symmetry protected topological phases
Authors: Yizhi You and Yi-Zhuang You
Abstract: In this paper we focus on the interplay between geometry defects and topological properties in bosonic symmetry protected topological(SPT) phases. We start from eight copies of 3D time-reversal($\mathcal{T}$) invariant topological superconductors(TSC) on a crystal lattice. We melt the lattice by condensation of disclinations and therefore restore the rotation symmetry. Such disclination condensation procedure confines the fermion and afterwards turns the system into a 3D boson topological liquid crystal(TCL). The low energy effective theory of this crystalline-liquid transition contains a topological term inherited from the geometry axion response in TSC. In addition, we investigate the interplay between dislocation and superfluid vortex on the surface of TCL. We demonstrate that the $\mathcal{T}$ and translation invariant surface state is a double $[e\mathcal{T}m\mathcal{T}]$ state with intrinsic surface topological order. We also look into the exotic behavior of dislocation in 2D boson SPT state described by an $O(4)$ non-linear $\sigma$-model(NL$\sigma $M) with topological $\Theta$-term. By dressing the $O(4)$ vector with spiral order and gauge the symmetry, the dislocation has mutual semion statistics with the gauge flux. Further reduce the $O(4)$ NL$\sigma M$ to the Ising limit, we arrive at the Levin-Gu model with stripy modulation whose dislocation has nontrivial braiding statistics.
