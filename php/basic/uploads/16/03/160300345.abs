Title: Casimir-Polder interaction of neutrons with metal or dielectric surfaces
Authors: Valentin Gebhart and Juliane Klatt and Stefan Yoshi Buhmann
Abstract: We predict a repulsive Casimir-Polder-type dispersion interaction between a single neutron and a metal or dielectric surface. Our model scenario assumes a single neutron subject to an external magnetic field. Due to its intrinsic magnetic moment, the neutron then forms a magnetisable two-level system which can exchange virtual photons with a nearby surface. The resulting dispersion interaction between a purely magnetic object (neutron) and a purely electric one (surface) is found to be repulsive. Its magnitude is considerably smaller than than the standard atom-surface Casimir-Polder force due to the magnetic nature of the interaction and the smallness of the electron-to-neutron mass ratio. Nevertheless, we show that it can be comparable to the gravitational potential of the same surface.
