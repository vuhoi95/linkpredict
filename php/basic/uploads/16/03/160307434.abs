Title: Dark energy from complementary graviton
Authors: Yugo Abe and Masaatsu Horikoshi and Yoshiharu Kawamura
Abstract: Based on a new kind of complementary principle, we describe physics concerning the cosmological constant problem in the framework of effective field theory and suggest that a dominant part of dark energy can originate from the zero point energy due to another graviton that performs a complementary role vis-a-vis the ordinary one and obtains a tiny mass through the coupling to the vacuum energy of matters.
