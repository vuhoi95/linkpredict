Title: Associative algebras for (logarithmic) twisted modules for a vertex  operator algebra
Authors: Yi-Zhi Huang and Jinwei Yang
Abstract: We construct two associative algebras from a vertex operator algebra $V$ and a general automorphism $g$ of $V$. The first, called $g$-twisted zero-mode algebra, is a subquotient of what we call $g$-twisted universal enveloping algebra of $V$. These algebras are generalizations of the corresponding algebras introduced and studied by Frenkel-Zhu and Nagatomo-Tsuchiya in the (untwisted) case that $g$ is the identity. The other is a generalization of the $g$-twisted version of Zhu's algebra for suitable $g$-twisted modules constructed by Dong-Li-Mason when the order of $g$ is finite. We are mainly interested in $g$-twisted $V$-modules introduced by the first author in the case that $g$ is of infinite order and does not act on $V$ semisimply. In this case, twisted vertex operators in general involve the logarithm of the variable. We construct functors between categories of suitable modules for these associative algebras and categories of suitable (logarithmic) $g$-twisted $V$-modules. Using these functors, we prove that the $g$-twisted zero-mode algebra and the $g$-twisted generalization of Zhu's algebra are in fact isomorphic.
