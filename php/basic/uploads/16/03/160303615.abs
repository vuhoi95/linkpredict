Title: Gel'fand-Zetlin basis for a class of representations of the Lie  superalgebra gl(\infty|\infty)
Authors: N. I. Stoilova and J. Van der Jeugt
Abstract: A new, so called odd Gel'fand-Zetlin basis is introduced for the irreducible covariant tensor representations of the Lie superalgebra gl(n|n). The related Gel'fand-Zetlin patterns are based upon the decomposition according to a particular chain of subalgebras of gl(n|n). This chain contains only genuine Lie superalgebras of type gl(k|l) with k and l nonzero (apart from the final element of the chain which is gl(1|0)=gl(1)). Explicit expressions for a set of generators of the algebra on this Gel'fand-Zetlin basis are determined. The results are extended to an explicit construction of a class of irreducible highest weight modules of the general linear Lie superalgebra gl(\infty|\infty).
