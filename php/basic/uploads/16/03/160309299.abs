Title: Anti Self-Dual Yang-Mills, Modified Faddeev-Jackiw Formalism and Hidden  BRS Invariance
Authors: Saurabh Gupta and Raju Roychowdhury
Abstract: We analyze the constraints for a system of anti self-dual Yang-Mills (ASDYM) equations by means of the modified Faddeev-Jackiw method in K and J gauges \`{a} la Yang. We also establish the Hamiltonian flow for ASDYM system through the hidden BRS invariance in both the gauges. Finally, we remark on the bi-Hamiltonian nature of ASDYM and the compatibility of the symplectic structures therein.
