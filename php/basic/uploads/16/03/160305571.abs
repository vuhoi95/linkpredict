Title: Four-dimensional black holes with scalar hair in nonlinear  electrodynamics
Authors: José O. Barrientos and P. A. González and Yerko Vásquez
Abstract: We consider a gravitating system consisting of a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity with a self-interacting potential and a U(1) nonlinear electromagnetic field. Solving analytically and numerically the coupled system for both power-law and Born-Infeld type electrodynamics, we find charged hairy black hole solutions. Then, we study the thermodynamics of these solutions and we find that at a low temperature the topological charged black hole with scalar hair is thermodynamically preferred, whereas the topological charged black hole without scalar hair is thermodynamically preferred at a high temperature for power-law electrodynamics. Interestingly enough, these phase transitions occur at a fixed critical temperature and do not depend on the exponent $p$ of the nonlinearity electrodynamics.
