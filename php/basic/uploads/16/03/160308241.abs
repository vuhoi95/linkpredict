Title: Induced rotation from de Sitter-Godel-de Sitter phase transition
Authors: Sh. Khodabakhshi and A. Shojai
Abstract: The rotation of the cosmic objects is a universal phenomenon and its origin is still an open question. Here a model for the origin of rotation is presented. After an investigation of the phase transition of a scalar field in de Sitter and G\"odel backgrounds, the motion of a test particle during the phase transitions is studied. Then using computer simulation for a congruence of particles, we show that although the local induced rotation is nonzero, the global rotation is below the observational limit.
