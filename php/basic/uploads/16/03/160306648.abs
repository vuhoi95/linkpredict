Title: Bouncing Universes in Scalar-Tensor Gravity Around Conformal Invariance
Authors: B. Boisseau and H. Giacomini and D. Polarski
Abstract: We consider the possibility to produce a bouncing universe in the framework of scalar-tensor gravity when the scalar field has a nonconformal coupling to the Ricci scalar. We prove that bouncing universes regular in the future with essentially the same dynamics as for the conformal coupling case do exist when the coupling deviates slightly from it. This is found numerically for more substantial deviations as well. In some cases however new features are found like the ability of the system to leave the effective phantom regime.
