Title: The Influence of Modification of Gravity on the Dynamics of Radiating  Spherical Fluids
Authors: Z. Yousaf and Kazuharu Bamba and M. Zaeem ul Haq Bhatti
Abstract: We explore the evolutionary behaviors of compact objects in a modified gravitational theory with the help of structure scalars. Particularly, we consider the spherical geometry coupled with heat and radiation emitting shearing viscous matter configurations. We construct structure scalars by splitting the Riemann tensor orthogonally in $f(R,T)$ gravity with and without constant $R$ and $T$ constraints, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $T$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. We investigate the influence of modification of gravity on the physical meaning of scalar functions for radiating spherical matter configurations. It is explicitly demonstrated that even in modified gravity, the evolutionary phases of relativistic stellar systems can be analyzed through the set of modified scalar functions.
