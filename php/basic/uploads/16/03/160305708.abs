Title: Static and rotating universal horizons and black holes in gravitational  theories with broken Lorentz invariance
Authors: Kai Lin and V. H. Satheeshkumar and Anzhong Wang
Abstract: In this paper, we show the existence of static and rotating universal horizons and black holes in gravitational theories with the broken Lorentz invariance. We pay particular attention on the ultraviolet regime, and show that universal horizons and black holes exist not only in low energy scales but also in the UV scales. This is realized by presenting various static and stationary exact solutions of the full theory of the projectable Ho\v{r}ava gravity with an extra U(1) symmetry in (2+1)-dimensions, which, by construction, is power-counting renormalizable.
