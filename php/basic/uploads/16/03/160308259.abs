Title: Engineering Holographic Superconductor Phase Diagrams
Authors: Jiunn-Wei Chen and Shou-Huang Dai and Debaprasad Maity and Yun-Long Zhang
Abstract: We study how to engineer holographic models with features of a high temperature superconductor phase diagram. We introduce a field in the bulk which provides a tunable "doping" parameter in the boundary theory. By designing how this field changes the effective masses of other order parameter fields, desired phase diagrams can be engineered. We give examples of generating phase diagrams with phase boundaries similar to a superconducting dome and an anti-ferromagnetic phase by including two order parameter fields. We also explore whether the pseudo gap phase can be described without adding another order parameter field and discuss the potential scaling symmetry associated with a quantum critical point hidden under the superconducting dome in this phase diagram.
