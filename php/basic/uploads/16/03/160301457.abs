Title: Effects of Thermal Fluctuations on the Thermodynamics of Modified  Hayward Black Hole
Authors: Behnam Pourhassan and Mir Faizal and Ujjal Debnath
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the effects of thermal fluctuations on the thermodynamics of a modified Hayward black hole. These thermal fluctuations will produce correction terms for various thermodynamic quantities like entropy, pressure, inner energy and specific heats. We also investigate the effect of these correction terms on the first law of thermodynamics. Finally, we study the phase transition for the modified Hayward black hole. It is demonstrated that the modified Hayward black hole is stable even after the thermal fluctuations are taken into account, as long as the event horizon is larger than a certain critical value.
