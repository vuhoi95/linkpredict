Title: Holographic interpretation of 1-point toroidal block in the  semiclassical limit
Authors: K. B. Alkalaev and V. A. Belavin
Abstract: We propose the holographic interpretation of the 1-point conformal block on a torus in the semiclassical regime. To this end we consider the linearized version of the block and find its coefficients by means of the perturbation procedure around natural seed configuration corresponding to the zero-point block. From the AdS/CFT perspective the linearized block is given by the geodesic length of the tadpole graph embedded into the thermal AdS plus the holomorphic part of the thermal AdS action.
