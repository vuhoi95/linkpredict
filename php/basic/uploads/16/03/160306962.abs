Title: Diphoton Resonance in F-theory inspired Flipped SO(10)
Authors: George K. Leontaris and Qaisar Shafi
Abstract: Motivated by the diphoton excess at 750 GeV reported by the ATLAS and CMS experiments, we present an F-theory inspired flipped $SO(10)$ model embedded in an $E_6$ GUT. The low energy spectrum includes the three MSSM chiral families, vectorlike color triplets, several pairs of charged $SU(2)_L$ singlet fields $(E^c, \bar E^c)$, as well as MSSM singlets, one or more of which can contribute to the resonance. Total decay width in the multi-GeV range can arise from couplings involving the singlet and MSSM fields
