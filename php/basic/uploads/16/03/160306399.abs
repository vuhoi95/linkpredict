Title: Improving the Single Scalar Consistency Relation
Authors: D. J. Brooker and N. C. Tsamis and R. P. Woodard
Abstract: We propose a test of single-scalar inflation based on using the well-measured scalar power spectrum to reconstruct the tensor power spectrum, up to a single integration constant. This sort of test can be used effectively, even when the tensor power spectrum is measured too poorly to resolve the tensor spectral index.
