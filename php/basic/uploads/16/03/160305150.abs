Title: Crossing symmetry and Higher spin towers
Authors: Luis F. Alday and Agnese Bissi
Abstract: We consider higher spin operators in weakly coupled gauge conformal field theories. Crossing symmetry of mixed scalar correlators relates different higher spin towers and we study the consequences for the spectrum and structure constants of higher spin operators of different twists. Constraints are obtained to all loops in perturbation theory. The large spin contributions to the structure constants can be resummed into a theory-dependent prefactor times a universal factor, whose structure of poles agrees with the one that would be obtained from a Witten diagram supergravity computation, although only crossing symmetry is assumed. Finally, our results provide an all loop expression for the double null limit of mixed correlators, which is in perfect agreement with the correlator/Wilson loop correspondence.
