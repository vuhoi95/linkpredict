Title: Fermionic T-duality in fermionic double space
Authors: Bojan Nikolic and Branislav Sazdovic
Abstract: In this article we offer the interpretation of the fermionic T-duality of the type II superstring theory in double space. We generalize the idea of double space doubling the fermionic sector of the superspace. In such doubled space fermionic T-duality is represented as permutation of the fermionic coordinates $\theta^\alpha$ and $\bar\theta^\alpha$ with the corresponding fermionic T-dual ones, $\vartheta_\alpha$ and $\bar\vartheta_\alpha$, respectively. Demanding that T-dual transformation law has the same form as inital one, we obtain the known form of the fermionic T-dual NS-R i R-R background fields. Fermionic T-dual NS-NS background fields are obtained under some assumptions. We conclude that only symmetric part of R-R field strength and symmetric part of its fermionic T-dual contribute to the fermionic T-duality transformation of dilaton field and analyze the dilaton field in fermionic double space. As a model we use the ghost free action of type II superstring in pure spinor formulation in approximation of constant background fields up to the quadratic terms.
