Title: The Moduli Space in the Gauged Linear Sigma Model
Authors: Huijun Fan and Tyler Jarvis and Yongbin Ruan
Abstract: This is a survey article for the mathematical theory of Witten's Gauged Linear Sigma Model, as developed recently by the authors. Instead of developing the theory in the most general setting, in this paper we focus on the description of the moduli.
