Title: Field Theory of the Eulerian Perfect Fluid
Authors: Taketo Ariki and Pablo A. Morales
Abstract: The Eulerian perfect-fluid theory is reformulated from its action principle in a pure field-theoretic manner. Conservation of the convective current is no longer imposed by Lin's constraints, but rather adopted as the central idea of the theory. Our formulation, for the first time, successfully reduces redundant degrees of freedom promoting one half of the Clebsch variables as the true dynamical fields. Interactions on these fields allow for the exchange of the convective current of quantities such as mass and charge, which are uniformly understood as the breaking of the underlying symmetry of the force-free fluid. The Clebsch fields play the essential role in the exchange of angular momentum with the force field producing vorticity.
