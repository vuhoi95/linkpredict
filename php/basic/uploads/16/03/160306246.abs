Title: Bi-Local Holography in the SYK Model
Authors: Antal Jevicki and Kenta Suzuki and Junggi Yoon
Abstract: We discuss large $N$ rules of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and the bi-local representation of holography of this theory. This is done by establishing $1/N$ Feynman rules in terms of bi-local propagators and vertices, which can be evaluated following the recent procedure of Polchinski and Rosenhaus. These rules can be interpreted as Witten type diagrams of the dual AdS theory, which we are able to define at IR fixed point and off.
