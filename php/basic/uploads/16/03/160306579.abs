Title: Exact results for ABJ Wilson loops and open-closed duality
Authors: Yasuyuki Hatsuda and Kazumi Okuyama
Abstract: We find new exact relations between the partition function and vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of 1/2 BPS Wilson loops in ABJ theory, which allow us to predict the large N expansions of the 1/2 BPS Wilson loops from known results of the partition function. These relations are interpreted as an open-closed duality where the closed string background is shifted by the insertion of Wilson loops due to a back-reaction. Using the connection between ABJ theory and the topological string on local P1 x P1, we explicitly write down non-trivial relations between open and closed string amplitudes.
