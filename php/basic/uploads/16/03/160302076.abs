Title: Searching for a continuum limit in causal dynamical triangulation  quantum gravity
Authors: Jan Ambjorn and Daniel Coumbe and Jakub Gizbert-Studnicki and Jerzy Jurkiewicz
Abstract: We search for a continuum limit in the causal dynamical triangulation (CDT) approach to quantum gravity by determining the change in lattice spacing using two independent methods. The two methods yield similar results that may indicate how to tune the relevant couplings in the theory in order to take a continuum limit.
