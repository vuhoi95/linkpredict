Title: Geometry on Lie algebroids I: compatible geometric structures on the  base
Authors: Alexei Kotov and Thomas Strobl
Abstract: The object of our study is a Lie algebroid $A$ or a Cartan-Lie algebroid $(A,\nabla)$ (a Lie algebroid with a compatible connection) over a base manifold $M$ equipped with appropriately compatible geometrical structures. The main focus is on a Riemannian base $(M,g)$, but we also consider symplectic and generalized Riemannian structures. For the Riemannian case, we show that the compatibility implies that the foliation induced by the Lie algebroid is a Riemannian foliation; thus, in particular, if the leaf space $Q = M/\!\sim$ is smooth, $Q$ permits a metric such that the quotient projection is a Riemannian submersion. For other structures on $M$ with a smooth leaf space $Q$, the reduced geometrical type on $Q$ can be different: for example, $(M,\omega)$ symplectic provides in general only a symplectic realization of a Poisson manifold $(Q,\mathcal{P})$. Building upon a result of del Hoyo and Fernandes, we prove that any Lie algebroid integrating to a proper Lie groupoid admits a compatible Riemannian base. We also show that, given an arbitrary connection on an anchored bundle, there is a unique Cartan connection on the corresponding free Lie algebroid.
