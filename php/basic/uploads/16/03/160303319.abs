Title: Unparticle contribution to the hydrogen atom ground state energy
Authors: Michael F. Wondrak and Piero Nicolini and Marcus Bleicher
Abstract: In the present work we study the effect of unparticle modified static potentials on the energy levels of the hydrogen atom. By using Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation theory, we obtain the energy shift of the ground state and we compare it with experimental data. Bounds on the unparticle energy scale $\Lambda_\mathcal{U}$ as a function of the scaling dimension $d_\mathcal{U}$ and the coupling constant $\lambda$ are derived. We show that there exists a parameter region where bounds on $\Lambda_\mathcal{U}$ are stringent, signalling that unparticles could be tested in atomic physics experiments.
