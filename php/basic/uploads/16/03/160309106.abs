Title: Dynamics of test bodies in scalar-tensor theory and equivalence  principle
Authors: Yuri N. Obukhov and Dirk Puetzfeld
Abstract: How do test bodies move in scalar-tensor theories of gravitation? We provide an answer to this question on the basis of a unified multipolar scheme. In particular, we give the explicit equations of motion for pointlike, as well as spinning test bodies, thus extending the well-known general relativistic results of Mathisson, Papapetrou, and Dixon to scalar-tensor theories of gravity. We demonstrate the validity of the equivalence principle for test bodies.
