Abstract: The electrostatic potential is important for the pair production in the holographic Schwinger effect. In this paper, we analyze the electrostatic potential in a deformed AdS background and investigate the effect of deformation parameter which may be useful to test of AdS/QCD. In the case of zero temperature we find that larger value of the deformation parameter leads to a smaller value of separation length of the test particles on the probe. Also we find a finite maximum of separation length in presence of modification parameter.
