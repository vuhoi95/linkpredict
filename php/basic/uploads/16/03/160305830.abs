Title: The string-junction picture of multiquark states: an update
Authors: Giancarlo Rossi and Gabriele Veneziano
Abstract: We recall and update, both theoretically and phenomenologically, our (nearly) forty-years-old proposal of a string-junction as a necessary complement to the conventional classification of hadrons based just on their quark-antiquark constituents. In that proposal single (though in general metastable) hadronic states are associated with "irreducible" gauge-invariant operators consisting of Wilson lines (visualized as strings of color flux tubes) that may either end on a quark or an antiquark, or annihilate in triplets at a junction $J$ or an anti-junction $\bar{J}$. For the junction-free sector (ordinary $q\, \bar{q}$ mesons and glueballs) the picture is supported by large-$N$ (number of colors) considerations as well as by a lattice strong-coupling expansion. Both imply the famous OZI rule suppressing quark-antiquark annihilation diagrams. For hadrons with $J$ and/or $\bar{J}$ constituents the same expansions support our proposal, including its generalization of the OZI rule to the suppression of $J-\bar{J}$ annihilation diagrams. Such a rule implies that hadrons with junctions are "mesophobic" and thus unusually narrow if they are below threshold for decaying into as many baryons as their total number of junctions (two for a tetraquark, three for a pentaquark). Experimental support for our claim, based on the observation that narrow multiquark states typically lie below (well above) the relevant baryonic (mesonic) thresholds, will be presented.
