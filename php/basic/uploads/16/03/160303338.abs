Title: C-map for Born-Infeld theories
Authors: Laura Andrianopoli and Riccardo D'Auria and Sergio Ferrara and Mario Trigiante
Abstract: The c-map of four dimensional non-linear theories of electromagnetism is considered both in the rigid case and in its coupling to gravity. In this way theories with antisymmetric tensors and scalars are obtained, and the three non-linear representations of N=2 supersymmetry partially broken to N=1 related. The manifest $\mathrm{Sp}(2n)$ and $\mathrm{U}(n)$ covariance of these theories in their multifield extensions is also exhibited.
