Abstract: Recently, the bi-local fields attract the interest in studying the duality between $O(N)$ vector model and a higher-spin gauge theory in AdS spacetime. In those theories, the bi-local fields are realized as collective one's of the $O(N)$ vector fields, which are the source of higher-spin bulk fields. Historically, the bi-local fields are introduced as a candidate of non-local fields by Yukawa. Today, Yukawa's bi-local fields are understood from a viewpoint of relativistic two-particle bound systems, the bi-local systems. We study the relation between the bi-local collective fields out of higher-spin bulk fields and the fields out of the bi-local systems embedded in AdS${}_5$ spacetime with warped metric. It is shown that the effective spring constant of the bi-local system depends on the brane, on which the bi-local system is located. In particular, a bi-local system with vanishing spring constant, which is similar to the bi-local collective fields, can be realized on a low-energy IR brane.
