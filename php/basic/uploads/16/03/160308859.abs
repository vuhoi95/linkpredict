Abstract: In this work an application of the $\kappa$--deformed algebra in condensed matter physics is presented. Starting by the $\kappa$--deformed Dirac equation we study the relativistic generalization of the $\kappa$--deformed Landau levels as well as the consequences of the deformation on the Hall conductivity. By comparing the $\kappa$--deformed Landau levels in the nonrelativistic regime with the energy levels of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the presence of a normal magnetic field, upper bounds for the deformation parameter in different materials are established. An expression for the $\kappa$--deformed Hall conductivity of a 2DEG is obtained as well. The expression recovers the well-known result for the usual Hall conductivity in the limit $\varepsilon=\kappa^{-1}\to 0$. The deformation parameter breaks the Landau levels degeneracy and due to this, it is observed that deformation gives rise to new plateaus of conductivity in a such way that the plateaus widths of the $\kappa$--deformed Hall conductivity are less than the usual one. By studying the temperature dependence of the $\kappa$--deformed Hall conductivity, we show that an increase of the temperature causes the smearing of the plateaus and a diminution of the effect of the deformation, whilst an increase in the magnetic field enhances the effect of the deformation.
