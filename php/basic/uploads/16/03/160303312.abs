Title: The critical geometry of a thermal big bang
Authors: Niayesh Afshordi and Joao Magueijo
Abstract: We explore the space of scalar-tensor theories containing two non-conformalmetrics, and find a discontinuity pointing to a "critical" cosmological solution. Due to the different maximal speeds of propagation for matter and gravity,the cosmological fluctuations start off inside the horizon even without inflation, and will more naturally have a thermal origin (since there is never vacuum domination). The critical model makes an unambiguous, non-tuned prediction for the spectral index of the scalar fluctuations: $n_S= 0.96478(64)$. Considering also that no gravitational waves are produced, we have unveiled the most predictive model on offer. The model has a simple geometrical interpretation as a probe 3-brane embedded in an $EAdS_2\times E_3$ geometry.
