Title: Fermionic higher-spin triplets in AdS
Authors: Alessandro Agugliaro and Francesco Azzurli and Dmitri Sorokin
Abstract: We derive a metric-like Lagrangian and equations of motion, in AdS space, for multiplets of fermionic fields with spin ranged from 1/2 to s, from their frame-like formulation.
