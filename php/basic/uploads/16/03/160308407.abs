Title: Faddeev-Jackiw Quantization of Non-Autonomous Singular Systems
Authors: Zahir Belhadi and Alain Bérard and Hervé Mohrbach
Abstract: We extend the quantization \`a la Faddeev-Jackiw for non-autonomous singular systems. This leads to a generalization of the Schr\"odinger equation for those systems. The method is exemplified by the quantization of the damped harmonic oscillator and the relativistic particle in an external electromagnetic field.
