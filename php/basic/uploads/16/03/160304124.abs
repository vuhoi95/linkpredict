Title: Giambelli Identity in Super Chern-Simons Matrix Model
Authors: Satsuki Matsuno and Sanefumi Moriyama
Abstract: A classical identity due to Giambelli in representation theory states that the character in any representation is expressed as a determinant whose components are characters in the hook representation constructed from all the combinations of the arm and leg lengths of the original representation. Previously it was shown that the identity persists in taking, for each character, the matrix integration in the super Chern-Simons matrix model in the grand canonical ensemble. We prove here that this Giambelli compatibility still holds in the deformation of the fractional-brane background.
