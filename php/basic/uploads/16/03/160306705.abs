Title: Determinant Formula for Parabolic Verma Modules of Lie Superalgebras
Authors: Yoshiki Oshima and Masahito Yamazaki
Abstract: We prove a determinant formula for a parabolic Verma module of a Lie superalgebra, previously conjectured by the second author. Our determinant formula generalizes the previous results of Jantzen for a parabolic Verma module of a (non-super) Lie algebra, and of Kac concerning a (non-parabolic) Verma module for a Lie superalgebra. The resulting formula is expected to have a variety of applications in the study of higher-dimensional supersymmetric conformal field theories. We also discuss irreducibility criteria for the Verma module.
