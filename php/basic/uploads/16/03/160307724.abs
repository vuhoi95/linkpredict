Title: A new dynamical instability in Anti-de-Sitter spacetime
Authors: Umut GÃ¼rsoy and Aron Jansen and Wilke van der Schee
Abstract: We present fully dynamical solutions to Einstein-scalar theory in asymptotically Anti-de-Sitter spacetime with a scalar potential containing particularly rich physics. Depending on one parameter in the potential we find an especially interesting regime, which exhibits a thermodynamically stable, but dynamically unstable black brane, even at zero momentum. We show this using the non-linear dynamics, and give a clear interpretation in terms of the spectrum of linearized perturbations. Our results translate directly to their dual strongly coupled non-conformal field theories.
