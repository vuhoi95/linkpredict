Authors: Josevi Carvalho and Alexandre M. de M. Carvalho and Everton Cavalcante and Claudio Furtado
Abstract: In this contribution we study the Klein-Gordon oscillator on the curved background within the Kaluza-Klein theory. The problem of interaction between particles coupled harmonically with a topological defects in Kaluza-Klein theory is studied. We consider a series of topological defects, that treat the Klein-Gordon oscillator coupled to this background and find the energy levels and corresponding eigenfunctions in these cases. We show that the energy levels depend on the global parameters characterizing these spacetimes. We also investigate a quantum particle described by the Klein-Gordon oscillator interacting with a cosmic dislocation in Som-Raychaudhuri spacetime in the presence of homogeneous magnetic field in a Kaluza-Klein theory. In this case, the spectrum of energy is determined, and we observe that these energy levels are the sum of the term related with Aharonov-Bohm flux and of the parameter associated to the rotation of the spacetime.
