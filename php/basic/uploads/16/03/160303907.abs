Title: Comments on the Effect of Frame Dragging
Authors: I. Özbakır and K. Yakut
Abstract: The effect of the frame dragging on the equation of motions, depends on the approaches that have been considered. Accordingly, additional force terms may appear or disappear. To understand the effect of radial and non-radial perturbations that may exist in the case of mass distribution of spherical shell form, modifications should be predicted to the approaches of the components of elastic tensor $E^{\mu\nu}$ given in Bass and Pirani (1955). Different relations between $\omega$ and $\omega'$ have been discussed.
