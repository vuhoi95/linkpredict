Abstract: We study the integrable model with minimally and non-minimally coupled scalar fields and the correspondence of their general solutions. Using the model with a minimally coupled scalar field and a the constant potential as an example we demonstrate the difference between the general solutions of the corresponding models in the Jordan and the Einstein frames.
