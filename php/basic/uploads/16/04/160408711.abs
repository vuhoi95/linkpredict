Title: On the question of symmetries in non-relativistic diffeomorphism  invariant theories
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Sunandan Gangopadhyay and Pradip Mukherjee
Abstract: Nonrelativistic diffeomorphism invariance has recently emerged as a powerful tool for investigating various phenomena. The flat limit of such an invariance which should yield the Galilean invariance is, surprisingly, riddled with ambiguities and anomalies. We show that our approach, based on Galilean gauge theory, resolves these shortcomings. As a spin-off, we provide a systematic and unique way of interpreting nonrelativistic diffeomorphism invariance and Galilean invariance as appropriate nonrelativistic limits of relativistic invariances in curved and flat backgrounds, respectively. The complementary role of flat and nonrelativistic limits is highlighted.
