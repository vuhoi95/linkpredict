Title: Connecting Through Obstruction; Relating Gauge Gravity and String Theory
Authors: Casey Cartwright and Alex Flournoy
Abstract: We consider topological constraints that must be satisfied by formulations of gravitation as a gauge theory. To facilitate the analysis we review and further justify the composite bundle formalism of Tresguerres as a consistent underlying structure capable of incorporating both the local Lorentz and translational degrees of freedom. Identifying an important global structure required by the composite construction, we translate this into conditions on the underlying manifold. We find that in addition to admitting the expected orientability, causality and spin structures, the underlying manifold must also admit a string structure. We take this to imply that even before considerations of quantum consistency, topological considerations of gauge gravity provide a classical motivation for extended degrees of freedom.
