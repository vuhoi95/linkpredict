Abstract: The conditions for the cancellation of one loop contributions to vacuum energy (both U.V. divergent and finite) coming from the known (Standard Model) fields and the field associated with the hypothetical 750 Gev diphoton excess are examined. Depending on the nature of this latter resonance we find that in order to satisfy the constraints (sum rules) different additional, minimal field contributions are required, leading to yet to be observed particles.
