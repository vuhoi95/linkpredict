Title: New Improved Massive Gravity and Three Dimensional Spacetimes of  Constant Curvature and Constant Torsion
Authors: T. Dereli and C. Yetismisoglu
Abstract: We derive the field equations for topologically massive gravity coupled with the most general quadratic curvature terms using the language of exterior differential forms and a first order constrained variational principle. We find variational field equations both in the presence and absence of torsion. We then show that spaces of constant negative curvature (i.e. the anti de-Sitter space $AdS_3$) and constant torsion provide exact solutions.
