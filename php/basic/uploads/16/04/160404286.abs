Title: Spin-2 spectrum of six-dimensional field theories
Authors: Achilleas Passias and Alessandro Tomasiello
Abstract: We analyze the mass spectrum of spin-2 excitations around the gravity duals of "linear quiver" supersymmetric conformal field theories (SCFT's) in six dimensions. We show that for the entire family of gravity solutions it satisfies a bound which corresponds to a unitarity bound for the scaling dimension of the dual field theory operators. We determine the masses of excitations which belong to short multiplets, and for certain gravity solutions we obtain the Kaluza-Klein modes and the corresponding mass spectrum, fully and explicitly. Finally, we discuss an intuitive picture of the dual operators in terms of the effective descriptions of1 the SCFT's.
