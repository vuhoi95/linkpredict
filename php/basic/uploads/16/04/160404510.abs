Title: Structure constants of shs$[Î»]$: the deformed-oscillator point of  view
Authors: Thomas Basile and Nicolas Boulanger
Abstract: We derive and spell out the structure constants of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded algebra $\mathfrak{shs}[\lambda]\,$ by using deformed-oscillators techniques in $Aq(2;\nu)\,$, the universal enveloping algebra of the Wigner-deformed Heisenberg algebra in 2 dimensions. The use of Weyl ordering of the deformed oscillators is made throughout the paper, via the symbols of the operators and the corresponding associative, non-commutative star product. The deformed oscillator construction was used by Vasiliev in order to construct the higher spin algebras in three spacetime dimensions. We derive an expression for the structure constants of $\mathfrak{shs}[\lambda]\,$ and show that they must obey a recurrence relation as a consequence of the associativity of the star product. We solve this condition and show that the $\mathfrak{hs}[\lambda]\,$ structure constants are given by those postulated by Pope, Romans and Shen for the Lone Star product.
