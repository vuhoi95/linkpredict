Title: Black hole collapse and democratic models
Authors: Aron Jansen and Javier M. Magan
Abstract: We study the evolution of black hole entropy and temperature in collapse scenarios, finding three generic lessons. First, entropy evolution is extensive. Second, at large times, entropy and temperature ring with twice the frequency of the lowest quasinormal mode. Third, the entropy oscillations saturate black hole area theorems in general relativity. The first two features are characteristic of entanglement dynamics in `democratic' models. Solely based on general relativity and Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula, our results point to democratic models as microscopic theories of black holes. The third feature can be taken as a prediction for democratic models coming from black hole physics.
