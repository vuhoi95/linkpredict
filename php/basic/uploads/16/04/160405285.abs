Title: Bound states of the $Ï†^4$ model via the nonperturbative  renormalization group
Authors: F. Rose and F. Benitez and F. Leonard and B. Delamotte
Abstract: Using the nonperturbative renormalization group, we study the existence of bound states in the symmetry-broken phase of the scalar $\phi^4$ theory in all dimensions between two and four and as a function of the temperature. The accurate description of the momentum dependence of the two-point function, required to get the spectrum of the theory, is provided by means of the Blaizot--M\'endez-Galain--Wschebor approximation scheme. We confirm the existence of a bound state in dimension three, with a mass within 1% of previous Monte-Carlo and numerical diagonalization values.
