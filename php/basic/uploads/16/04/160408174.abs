Authors: Abdel Nasser Tawfik and Abdel Magied Diab and M. T. Hussein
Abstract: In characterizing the quark-hadron phase structure, determining various thermodynamic quantities and investigating their temperature dependencies on vanishing and finite magnetic field, SU(3) Polyakov linear-sigma model (PLSM) is utilized. The dependence of the chiral order-parameter on vanishing and finite magnetic field is calculated in mean-field approximation. In a wide range of temperatures and magnetic field strengths, the thermodynamic observables including trace anomaly, speed of sound squared, entropy density, specific heat and magnetization are presented. An excellent agreement is found when these are confronted to recent lattice QCD calculations. The temperature dependence of these quantities confirms our previous result that the transition temperature is reduced with magnetic field. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of magnetization verifies the conclusion that the QCD matter has paramagnetic properties near and far above the critical temperature. The excellent agreement with recent lattice calculations means that PLSM possesses the correct degrees of freedom in both hadronic and partonic phases and describes well dynamics deriving confined hadrons to deconfined quark-gluon plasma. The magnetic field seems to enhance the occurrence of chiral phase-transition due to its contributions to the Landau quantizations and contribute to the suppression in the chiral condensates relevant to the restoration of the chiral symmetry-breaking. The inverse magnetic catalysis leads to a decrease in the chiral critical temperature with increasing magnetic field. We remark that PLSM has a temperature-limited applicability depending on the temperature-applicability of its chiral and deconfinement order-parameters. Only within this limit the conclusions about equation of state, chiral phase-structure and magnetic properties, etc. can be relatively certain.
