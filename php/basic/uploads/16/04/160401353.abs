Title: Alternative method of Reduction of the Feynman Diagrams to a set of  Master Integrals
Authors: Julio Borja and Igor Kondrashuk
Abstract: We propose a new set of Master Integrals which can be used as a basis for certain multiloop calculations in massless gauge field theories. In these theories we consider three-point Feynman diagrams with arbitrary number of loops. The corresponding multiloop integrals may be decomposed in terms of this set of the Master Integrals. We construct a new reduction procedure which we apply to perform this decomposition.
