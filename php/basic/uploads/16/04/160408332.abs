Abstract: To gain holographic insight into critical phenomena of $f(R)$ AdS black holes, we investigate their two point correlation function, which are dual to the geodesic length in the bulk. We solve the equation of motion constrained by the boundary condition numerically and probe both the effect of boundary region size and $f(R)$ gravity. Moreover, we introduce an analogous specific heat related to $\delta L$. It is shown in the $T-\delta L$ graph for the case $Q<Q_c$ that both the large radius branch and the small radius branch are stable with positive specific heat while the medium radius branch is unstable with negative specific heat. We carry out free energy analysis to determine the first order phase transition temperature $T_*$ and remove the unstable branch in $T-\delta L$ curve with a bar $T=T_*$. It is shown that the values of free energy are influenced by the parameter $b$ showing the impact of $f(R)$ gravity. However, to one's surprise, the numerical result of $T_*$ turns out to be $0.2847050173$ for all the three choices of $b$, implying that the first order phase transition temperature $T_*$ is the same at least to the order of $10^{-10}$ for different choices of $b$. We also check the analogous equal area law numerically and find that the relative errors for the cases $\theta_0=0.1$ and $\theta_0=0.2$ are small enough. The fitting functions between $ \log\mid T -T_c\mid$ and $\log\mid\delta L-\delta L_c\mid $ for both cases are also obtained. It is shown that the slope is around 3, implying that the critical exponent is about $2/3$. This result is in accordance with those in former literatures of specific heat related to the thermal entropy or entanglement entropy .
