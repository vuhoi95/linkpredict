Title: Diffractions from the brane and GW150914
Authors: Merab Gogberashvili and Pavle Midodashvili
Abstract: In the braneworld scenario the zero mode gravitons are trapped on a brane due to non-linear warping effect, so that gravitational waves can reflect from the brane walls. If the reflected waves form an interference pattern on the brane then it can be detected on existing detectors due to spatial variations of intensity in the pattern. As an example we interpret the LIGO event GW150914 as a manifestation of such interference pattern produced by the burst gravitational waves, emitted by a powerful source inside or outside the brane and reflected from the brane walls.
