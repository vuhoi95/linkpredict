Title: Entanglement negativity in a two dimensional harmonic lattice: Area law  and corner contributions
Authors: Cristiano De Nobili and Andrea Coser and Erik Tonni
Abstract: We study the logarithmic negativity and the moments of the partial transpose in the ground state of a two dimensional massless harmonic square lattice with nearest neighbour interactions for various configurations of adjacent domains. At leading order for large domains, the logarithmic negativity and the logarithm of the ratio between the generic moment of the partial transpose and the moment of the reduced density matrix at the same order satisfy an area law in terms of the length of the curve shared by the adjacent regions. We give numerical evidences that the coefficient of the area law term in these quantities is related to the coefficient of the area law term in the R\'enyi entropies. Whenever the curve shared by the adjacent domains contains vertices, a subleading logarithmic term occurs in these quantities and the numerical values of the corner function for some pairs of angles are obtained. In the special case of vertices corresponding to explementary angles, we provide numerical evidence that the corner function of the logarithmic negativity is given by the corner function of the R\'enyi entropy of order 1/2.
