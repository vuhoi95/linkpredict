Abstract: A $(1+1)$ dimensional model where vector and axial vector interaction get mixed up with different weight is considered with a generalized masslike term for gauge field. Through Poincar\'e algebra it has been made confirm that only a Lorentz covariant masslike term leads to a physically sensible theory as long as the number of constraints in the phase space is two. With that admissible masslike term, phase space structure of this model with proper identification of physical canonical pair has been determined using Diracs' scheme of quantization of constrained system. The bosonized version of the model remains gauge non-invariant to start with. Therefore, with the inclusion of appropriate Wess-Zumino term it is made gauge symmetric. An alternative quantization has been carried out over this gauge symmetric version to determine the phase space structure in this situation. To establish that the Wess-Zumino fields allocates themselves in the un-physical sector of the theory an attempts has been made to get back the usual theory from the gauge symmetric theory of the extended phase-space without hampering any physical principle. It has been found that the role of gauge fixing is crucial for this transmutation.
