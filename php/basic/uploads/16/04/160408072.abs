Abstract: In order to explain the fermions masses and mixing parameters appearing in the lepton sector of the Standard Model, one proposes the extension of its symmetry. A discrete, non-abelian subgroup of $U(3)$ is added to the gauge group $SU(3)_{C}\times SU(2)_{L}\times U(1)_{Y}$ . Apart from that, one assumes the existence of one extra Higgs doublet. This article focuses mainly on the mathematical theorems and computational techniques which brought us to the results.
