Title: The Lorentz Force and Energy-Momentum for Off-Shell Electromagnetism
Authors: M. C. Land and L. P. Horwitz
Abstract: The kinematics of pre-Maxwell electrodynamics is examined and interpretations of these fields is found through an examination of the associated Lorentz force and the structure of the energy-momentum tensor.
