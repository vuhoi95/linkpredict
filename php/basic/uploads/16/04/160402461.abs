Abstract: In this work we consider electromagnetic dynamics in Randall-Sundrum branes. It is derived a family of four-dimensional spacetimes compatible with Randall-Sundrum brane worlds, focusing on asymptotic flat backgrounds. Maximal extensions of the solutions are constructed and their causal structures are discussed. These spacetimes include singular, non-singular and extreme black holes. Maxwell's electromagnetic field is introduced and its evolution is studied in an extensive numerical survey. Electromagnetic quasinormal mode spectra are derived and analyzed with time-dependent and high-order WKB methods. Our results indicate that the black holes in the brane are electromagnetically stable.
