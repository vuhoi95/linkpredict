Title: A New Target for Cosmic Axion Searches
Authors: Daniel Baumann and Daniel Green and Benjamin Wallisch
Abstract: Future CMB experiments have the potential to probe the density of relativistic species at the sub-percent level. Sensitivity at this level allows light thermal relics to be detected up to arbitrarily high decoupling temperatures. Conversely, the absence of a detection would require extra light species never to have been in equilibrium with the Standard Model. In this paper, we exploit this feature to demonstrate the sensitivity of future cosmological observations to the couplings of axions to all of the Standard Model degrees of freedom. In many cases, the constraints achievable from cosmology will surpass existing bounds from laboratory experiments and astrophysical observations by orders of magnitude.
