Title: Higher dimensional Robinson-Trautman spacetimes sourced by p-forms:  static and radiating black holes
Authors: Marcello Ortaggio and Jiri Podolsky and Martin Zofka
Abstract: We summarize results about Robinson-Trautman spacetimes in the presence of an aligned $p$-form Maxwell field and an arbitrary cosmological constant in $n\ge 4$ dimensions. While in odd dimensions the solutions reduce to static black holes dressed with an electric and a magnetic field (with an Einstein space horizon), in even dimensions $2p=n$ they may also describe black holes gaining (or losing) mass by receiving (or emitting) electromagnetic radiation. The Weyl type of the spacetimes is also briefly discussed in all the possible cases.
