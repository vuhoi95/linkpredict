Title: Elliptic stable envelope
Authors: Mina Aganagic and Andrei Okounkov
Abstract: We construct stable envelopes in equivariant elliptic cohomology of Nakajima quiver varieties. In particular, this gives an elliptic generalization of the results of arXiv:1211.1287. We apply them to the computation of the monodromy of $q$-difference equations arising the enumerative K-theory of rational curves in Nakajima varieties, including the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations.
