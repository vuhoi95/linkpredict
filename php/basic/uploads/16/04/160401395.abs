Title: Influence of Electric Charge and Modified Gravity on Density  Irregularities
Authors: M. Zaeem Ul Haq Bhatti and Z. Yousaf
Abstract: This work aims to identify some inhomogeneity factors for plane symmetric topology with anisotropic and dissipative fluid under the effects of both electromagnetic field as well as Palatini $f(R)$ gravity. We construct the modified field equations, kinematical quantities and mass function to continue our analysis. We have explored the dynamical quantities, conservation equations and modified Ellis equations with the help of a viable $f(R)$ model. Some particular cases are discussed with and without dissipation to investigate the corresponding inhomogeneity factors. For non-radiating scenario, we examine such factors with dust, isotropic and anisotropic matter in the presence of charge. For dissipative fluid, we investigate the inhomogeneity factor with charged dust cloud. We conclude that electromagnetic field increases the inhomogeneity in matter while the extra curvature terms make the system more homogeneous with the evolution of time.
