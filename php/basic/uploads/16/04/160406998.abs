Abstract: On the basis of horizon thermodynamics we study the thermodynamic stability and $P-V$ criticality of topological black holes constructed in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity without the detailed-balance condition (with general $\epsilon$). In the framework of horizon thermodynamics, the temperature $T$ and pressure $P$ are independent quantities. It is not necessary to derive $T$ according to the metric function and $P$ according to any matter content. It is shown that the HL black hole for $k=0$ is always thermodynamically stable. For $k=1$, the temperature of HL black hole can be classified in five different cases. In one case, the thermodynamic behaviors of HL black hole is similar to that of Reissner- Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) black hole. There are larger/smaller black hole phase transition and smaller/larger black hole phase transition in different cases. For $k=-1$, there are six cases for the temperature of HL black hole, in one of which the HL black hole exhibits itself like Schwarzschild-AdS black hole. It is also shown that the HL black hole can exhibit $P-V$ criticality in $k=1$ and $k=-1$. However, in both cases, the critical behaviors are different from those of the RN-AdS black hole or the van der Waals liquid/gas system.
