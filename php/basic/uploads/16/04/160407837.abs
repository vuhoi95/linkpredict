Title: Conserved Charges of Minimal Massive Gravity Coupled to Scalar Field
Authors: M. R. Setare and H. Adami
Abstract: Recently, the theory of Topologically massive gravity non-minimally coupled to a scalar field has been proposed which comes from Lorentz-Chern-Simons theory \cite{1}. That theory is a torsion free one. We extend that theory by adding an extra term which makes torsion to be non-zero. The extended theory can be regarded as an extension of Minimal massive gravity such that it is non-minimally coupled to a scalar field. We obtain equations of motion of extended theory such that they are expressed in terms of usual torsion free spin-connection. We show that BTZ spacetime is a solution of this theory when scalar field is constant. We define quasi-local conserved charge by the concept of generalized off-shell ADT current which both are conserved for any asymptotically Killing vector field as well as a Killing vector field which is admitted by spacetime everywhere. Also we find general formula for entropy of stationary black hole solution in the context of considered theory. We apply the obtained formulas on BTZ black hole solution, to calculate energy, angular momentum and entropy of this soultion. We obtain the central extension term, the central charges and the eigenvalues of the Virasoro algebra generators for the BTZ black hole solution. We calculate energy and angular momentum of BTZ black hole using the eigenvalues of the Virasoro algebra generators. Also we calculate the entropy of BTZ black hole by using the Cardy formula. We find that obtained results using two different ways are exactly matched as we expected.
