Title: Higher spin entanglement entropy at finite temperature with chemical  potential
Authors: Bin Chen and Jie-qiang Wu
Abstract: It is generally believed that the semiclassical AdS$_3$ higher spin gravity could be described by a two dimensional conformal field theory with ${\cal{W}}$-algebra symmetry in the large central charge limit. In this paper, we study the single interval entanglement entropy on the torus in the CFT with a ${\cW}_3$ deformation. More generally we develop the monodromy analysis to compute the two-point function of the light operators under a thermal density matrix with a ${\cW}_3$ chemical potential to the leading order. Holographically we compute the probe action of the Wilson line in the background of the spin-3 black hole with a chemical potential. We find exact agreement.
