Title: Towards a Theory of Nonassociative Gravity
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Michael Fuchs
Abstract: Violating the strong constraint of double field theory, non-geometric fluxes were argued to give rise to noncommutative/nonassociative structures. We derive in a rather pedestrian physicist way a differential geometry on the simplest nonassociative (phase-)space arising for a constant non-geometric R-flux. This provides a complementary presentation to the quasi-Hopf representation categorial one delivered by Barnes, Schenkel, Szabo in arXiv:1409.6331+1507.02792. As there, the notions of tensors, covariant derivative, torsion and curvature find a star-generalization. We continue the construction with the introduction of a star-metric and its star-inverse where, due to the nonassociativity, we encounter major deviations from the familiar structure. Comments on the Levi-Civita connection, a star-Einstein-Hilbert action and the relation to string theory are included, as well.
