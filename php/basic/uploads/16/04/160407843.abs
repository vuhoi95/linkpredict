Abstract: We classify three dimensional isolated weighted homogeneous rational complete intersection singularities, which define many new four dimensional N=2 superconformal field theories. We also determine the mini-versal deformation of these singularities, and therefore solve the Coulomb branch spectrum and Seiberg-Witten solution.
