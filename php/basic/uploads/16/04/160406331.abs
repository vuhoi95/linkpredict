Title: Holographic Schwinger effect with a rotating probe D3-brane
Authors: Hao Xu and Yong-Chang Huang
Abstract: This paper presents the potential research on holographic Schwinger effect with rotating probe D3-brane etc. We discover, for zero temperature case in the Schwinger effect, the faster the angular velocity, the farther the distance of the test particles pair at D3-brane, the potential barrier of total potential energy also grows higher and wider. This paper discovers: at finite temperature, when S5 without rotation near the horizon, there is the failure of the Schwinger effect because the particles will remain at annihilate state, which is an absolute vacuum state. However, the angular velocity in S5 will avoid the existence of the absolute vacuum near the horizon. Both zero and finite temperature states, the achieved results completely agree with the results of the DBI action. So the theories of this paper are consistent, all these show that these theories will play important roles in pair production research in the future.
