Title: Massive charged BTZ black holes in asymptotically (a)dS spacetimes
Authors: S. H. Hendi and B. Eslam Panah and S. Panahiyan
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments of BTZ black holes and interesting results of massive gravity, we investigate massive BTZ black holes in the presence of Maxwell and Born-Infeld (BI) electrodynamics. We study geometrical properties such as type of singularity and asymptotical behavior as well as thermodynamic structure of the solutions through canonical ensemble. We show that despite the existence of massive term, obtained solutions are asymptotically (a)dS and have a curvature singularity at the origin. Then, we regard varying cosmological constant and examine the Van der Waals like behavior of the solutions in extended phase space. In addition, we employ geometrical thermodynamic approaches and show that using Weinhold, Ruppeiner and Quevedo metrics leads to existence of ensemble dependency while HPEM metric yields consistent picture. For neutral solutions, it will be shown that generalization to massive gravity leads to the presence of non-zero temperature and heat capacity for vanishing horizon radius. Such behavior is not observed for linearly charged solutions while generalization to nonlinearly one recovers this property.
