Abstract: The gauge invariance analysis of theories described in noncommutative (NC) space-times can lead us to interesting results since noncommutativity is one of the possible paths to investigate quantum effects in classical theories such as general relativity, for example. This theoretical possibility has motivated us to analyze the gauge invariance of the NC version of the Proca model, which is a second-class system, in Dirac's classification, since its classical formulation (commutative space-time) has its gauge invariance broken thanks to the mass term. To obtain such gauge invariant model, we have used the gauge unfixing method to construct a first-class NC version of the Proca model. We have also questioned if the gauge symmetries of NC theories, are affected necessarily or not by the NC parameter. In this way, we have calculated its respective symmetries in a standard way via Poisson brackets.
