Title: Wormholes, the weak energy condition, and scalar-tensor gravity
Authors: Rajibul Shaikh and Sayan Kar
Abstract: We obtain a large class of Lorentzian wormhole spacetimes in scalar-tensor gravity, for which the matter stress energy does satisfy the weak energy condition. Our constructions have zero Ricci scalar and an everywhere finite, non-zero scalar field profile. Interpreting the scalar-tensor gravity as an effective on-brane theory resulting from a two-brane Randall--Sundrum model of warped extra dimensions, it is possible to link wormhole existence with that of extra dimensions. We study the geometry, matter content, gravitational red-shift and circular orbits in such wormholes and argue that our examples are perhaps among those which may have some observational relevance in astrophysics in future. We also study traversability and find that our wormholes are indeed traversable for values of the metric parameters satisfying the weak energy condition.
