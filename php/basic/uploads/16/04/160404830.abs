Title: Nonperturbative RG analysis of five-dimensional O(N) models with cubic  interactions
Authors: Kazuhiko Kamikado and Takuya Kanazawa
Abstract: We reconsider critical properties of O(N) scalar models with cubic interactions in $d>4$ dimensions using functional renormalization group equations. Working at next-to-leading order in the derivative expansion, we find non-trivial IR fixed points at small and intermediate N from beta functions for relevant cubic terms. The putative fixed point at large N suggested recently by higher spin holography and the epsilon-expansion is also discussed, with an emphasis on stability of the effective potential.
