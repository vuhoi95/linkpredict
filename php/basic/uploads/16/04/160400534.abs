Abstract: We investigate the Casimir stress on a topological insulator (TI) between two metallic plates. The TI is assumed to be joined to one of the plates and its surface in front of the other is covered by a thin magnetic layer, which turns the TI into a full insulator. We also analyze the limit where one of the plates is sent to infinity yielding the Casimir stress between a conducting plate and a TI. To this end we employ a local approach in terms of the stress-energy tensor of the system, its vacuum expectation value being subsequently evaluated in terms of the appropriate Green's function. Finally, the construction of the renormalised vacuum stress-energy tensor in the region between the plates yields the Casimir stress. Numerical results are also presented.
