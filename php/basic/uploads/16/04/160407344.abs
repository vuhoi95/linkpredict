Title: The $q$-deformed Bogoliubov transformations
Authors: Ivan Arraut and Carlos Segovia
Abstract: An algebraic generalization of the Bogoliubov transformation is introduced in the context of $q$-commutativity. The set of coefficients are promoted to operators where we work with a $q$-deformed action over the Bosonic algebra together with some generalized trigonometric hyperbolic identities. We make the analogous extension for the fermionic algebra.
