Title: Plateau Inflation from Random Non-Minimal Coupling
Authors: Benedict J. Broy and Dries Coone and Diederik Roest
Abstract: A generic non-minimal coupling can push any higher-order terms of the scalar potential sufficiently far out in field space to yield observationally viable plateau inflation. We provide analytic and numerical evidence that this generically happens for a non-minimal coupling strength $\xi$ of the order $N_e^2$. In this regime, the non-minimally coupled field is sub-Planckian during inflation and is thus protected from most higher-order terms. For larger values of $\xi$, the inflationary predictions converge towards the sweet spot of PLANCK. The latter includes $\xi\simeq 10^4$ obtained from CMB normalization arguments, thus providing a natural explanation for the inflationary observables measured.
