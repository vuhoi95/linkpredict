Title: Low-Energy Lorentz Invariance in Lifshitz Nonlinear Sigma Models
Authors: Pedro R. S. Gomes and M. Gomes
Abstract: This work is dedicated to the study of both large-$N$ and perturbative quantum behaviors of Lifshitz nonlinear sigma models with dynamical critical exponent $z=2$ in 2+1 dimensions. We discuss renormalization and renormalization group aspects with emphasis on the possibility of emergence of Lorentz invariance at low energies. Contrarily to the perturbative expansion, where in general the Lorentz symmetry restoration is delicate and may depend on stringent fine-tuning, our results provide a more favorable scenario in the large-$N$ framework. We also consider supersymmetric extension in this nonrelativistic situation.
