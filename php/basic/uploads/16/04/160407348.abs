Title: On the gravitational seesaw and light bending
Authors: Antonio Accioly and Breno L. Giacchini and Ilya L. Shapiro
Abstract: Local gravitational theories with more than four derivatives are superrenormalizable, and also may be unitary in the Lee-Wick sense. It makes sense to study low-energy properties of these theories, e.g., identify observables which might be useful for experimental detection of higher derivatives. Using an analogy with neutrino Physics, we explore the possibility of a gravitational seesaw mechanism, in which several dimensional parameters of the same order of magnitude produce a hierarchy in the masses of propagating particles and make a relatively light degree of freedom detectable by frequency dependence in the gravitational light bending. It turns out that such a seesaw mechanism in the six- and more-derivative theories is unable to reduce the lightest mass more than in the simplest four-derivative model. Adding more derivatives can only make heavier masses even larger. This fact may be favorable for protecting the theory from instabilities, but makes experimental detection of higher derivatives more difficult.
