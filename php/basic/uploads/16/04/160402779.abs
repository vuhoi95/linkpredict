Title: On one-loop entanglement entropy of two short intervals from OPE of  twist operators
Authors: Zhibin Li and Jia-ju Zhang
Abstract: We investigate the one-loop entanglement entropy of two short intervals with small cross ratio $x$ on a complex plane in two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) using operator product expansion of twist operators. We focus on the one-loop entanglement entropy instead of the general order $n$ R\'enyi entropy, and this makes the calculation much easier. We consider the contributions of stress tensor to order $x^{10}$, contributions of $W_3$ operator to order $x^{12}$, and contributions of $W_4$ operator to order $x^{14}$. The CFT results agree with the ones in gravity.
