Title: The modified Horava-Lifshitz black hole from holographic engine
Authors: J. Sadeghi and Kh. Jafarzade
Abstract: In this paper we take cosmological constant as thermodynamic pressure and its conjugate quantity will be thermodynamic volume. This expression help us to investigate the phase transition and holography heat engine in the modified Horava-Lifshitz (HL) black hole. Here, also we modified the solution of HL black hole with Van der Waals fluid and some cosmology ansatz. Finally , we discuss the stability condition for the corresponding black hole and show that the stability exist only in special region black hole.
