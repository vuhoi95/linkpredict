Authors: Partha Guha and E. Harikumar and Zuhair N. S
Abstract: In this paper we regularize the Kepler problem on $\kappa$-spacetime in several different ways. First, we perform a Moser-type regularization and then we proceed for the Ligon-Schaaf regularization to our problem. In particular, generalizing Heckman-de Laat (J. Symplectic Geom. 10, (2012), 463-473) in the noncommutative context we show that the Ligon-Schaaf regularization map follows from an adaptation of the Moser regularization can be generalized to the Kepler problem on $\kappa$-spacetime.
