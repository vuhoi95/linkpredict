Title: AdS/dS CFT Correspondence
Authors: Chong-Sun Chu and Dimitrios Giataganas
Abstract: We propose and study a holographic dual of the type IIB superstring theory of AdS_5 x S^5 in terms of the N=4 superconformal Yang-Mills theory on dS_4. We use the bulk to boundary formalism to evaluate the boundary correlation functions and verify that it agrees with the expected result in dS conformal field theory. The gauge theory is expected to be UV finite and enjoy exact SL(2,Z) strong-weak duality. As the string theory Green-Schwarz sigma model carries an infinite number of classically conserved charges, it also suggest that the superconformal Yang-Mills theory is integrable and deserves further studies.
