Title: Evidence for an Electrifying Violation of Cosmic Censorship
Authors: Gary T. Horowitz and Jorge E. Santos and Benson Way
Abstract: We present a plausible counterexample to cosmic censorship in four dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory with asymptotically anti-de Sitter boundary conditions. Smooth initial data evolves to a region of arbitrarily large curvature that is visible to distant observers. Our example is based on a holographic model of an electrically charged, localised defect which was previously studied at zero temperature. We partially extend those results to nonzero temperatures.
