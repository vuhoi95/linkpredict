Title: Hydrodynamic theory of thermoelectric transport and negative  magnetoresistance in Weyl semimetals
Authors: Andrew Lucas and Richard A. Davison and Subir Sachdev
Abstract: We present a theory of thermoelectric transport in weakly disordered Weyl semimetals where the electron-electron scattering time is faster than the electron-impurity scattering time. Our hydrodynamic theory consists of relativistic fluids at each Weyl node, coupled together by perturbatively small inter-valley scattering, and long-range Coulomb interactions. The conductivity matrix of our theory is Onsager reciprocal and positive-semidefinite. In addition to the usual axial anomaly, we account for the effects of a distinct, axial-gravitational anomaly expected to be present in Weyl semimetals. Negative thermal magnetoresistance is a sharp, experimentally accessible signature of this axial-gravitational anomaly, even beyond the hydrodynamic limit.
