Title: EPR Pairs, Local Projections and Quantum Teleportation in Holography
Authors: Tokiro Numasawa and Noburo Shiba and Tadashi Takayanagi and Kento Watanabe
Abstract: In this paper we analyze three quantum operations in two dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs): local projection measurements, creations of partial entanglement between two CFTs, and swapping of subsystems between two CFTs. We also give their holographic duals and study time evolutions of entanglement entropy. By combining these operations, we present an analogue of quantum teleportation between two CFTs and give its holographic realization. We introduce a new quantity to probe tripartite entanglement by using local projection measurement.
