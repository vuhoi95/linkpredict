Title: Inflation from string field theory
Authors: Alexey S. Koshelev and K. Sravan Kumar and Paulo Vargas Moniz
Abstract: In the framework of string field theory (SFT) a setting is considered, where the closed string dilaton is coupled to the open string tachyon at the final stage of an unstable brane or brane-anti-brane pair decay. The structure of non-locality leads to interesting inflationary scenarios. Concretely, we show that this configuration can lead to viable inflation by means of the dilaton becoming a non-local (infinite-derivative) inflaton. We obtain (i) a class of single field inflation with universal attractor predictions at $n_{s}\sim0.967$ with any value of $r<0.1$, where the tensor to scalar ratio $r$ can be solely regulated by parameters of the SFT; (ii) a new class of two field conformally invariant models with a peculiar quadratic cross-product of scalar fields. In particular, we analyze a specific case where a spontaneously broken conformal invariance leads to Starobinsky like inflation, plus creating an uplifted potential minimum which accounts for vacuum energy after inflation.
