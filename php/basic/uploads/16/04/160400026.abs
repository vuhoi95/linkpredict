Title: Spherical Calogero model with oscillator/Coulomb potential: classical  case
Authors: Francisco Correa and Tigran Hakobyan and Olaf Lechtenfeld and Armen Nersessian
Abstract: We construct the Hamiltonians and symmetry generators of Calogero-oscillator and Calogero-Coulomb models on the N-dimensional sphere within the matrix-model reduction approach. Our method also produces the integrable Calogero-Coulomb-Stark model on the sphere and proves the integrability of the spin extensions of all these systems.
