Abstract: In this paper we obtain the complete classification of the M2-brane symplectic torus bundles classes with monodromy in $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ and their precise T-duality relations among them. There are eight inequivalent classes of bundles which are, at low energies, in correspondence with the eight type II gauged supergravities in nine dimensions. In a previous work we have already obtained four of those. Here we provide the explicit realization of the remaining four classes. We also generalize our previous results for the T-duality acting on supermembrane bundles. We provide the most general expression for the T-duality transformation acting at the level of the mass operator as well as on the geometrical bundle structure of the theory. By using these results we are able to establish the precise T-duality relations between the eight inequivalent classes. We find that the gauging groups -classifying the eight types of II gauged supergravity in nine dimensions- are determined by the inequivalent coinvariant classes of the supermembrane bundles and their duals.
