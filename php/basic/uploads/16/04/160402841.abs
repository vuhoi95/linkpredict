Title: Prospects of the Nambu Bracket
Authors: Kazuki Kiyoshige and Sanefumi Moriyama and Katsuya Yano
Abstract: We review recent progress in formulating the worldvolume theory of M2-branes using the Nambu bracket. Although it is generally agreed that this formulation should be replaced by another using the superconformal Chern-Simons theory, we try to pursue a possible complementary role played by the Nambu bracket. Since the partition function of the superconformal Chern-Simons theory implies a hidden super gauge group, we study the supersymmetric generalization of the Nambu bracket. We explicitly construct the superunitary Nambu algebra.
