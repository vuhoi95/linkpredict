Title: Magnetic monopoles in noncommutative quantum mechanics
Authors: Samuel Kováčik and Peter Prešnajder
Abstract: We discuss certain generalization of the Hilbert space of states in noncommutaive quantum mechanics that, as we show, introduces magnetic monopoles into the theory. Such generalization arises very naturally in the considered model, but can be easily reproduced in ordinary quantum mechanics as well. This approach offers a different viewpoint on the Dirac quantization condition and other important relations for magnetic monopoles. We focus mostly on the kinematic structure of the theory, but investigate also a dynamical problem (with the Coulomb potential).
