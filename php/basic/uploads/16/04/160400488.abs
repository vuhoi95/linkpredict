Title: The conformal supercurrents in diverse dimensions and conserved  superconformal currents
Authors: Yegor Korovin and Sergei M. Kuzenko and Stefan Theisen
Abstract: Given a conserved and traceless energy-momentum tensor and a conformal Killing vector, one obtains a conserved current. We generalise this construction to superconformal theories in three, four, five and six dimensions with various amounts of supersymmetry by working in the appropriate superspaces.
