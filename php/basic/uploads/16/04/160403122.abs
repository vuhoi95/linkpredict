Title: Large $N$ matrix models for 3d ${\cal N}=2$ theories: twisted index,  free energy and black holes
Authors: Seyed Morteza Hosseini and Alberto Zaffaroni
Abstract: We provide general formulae for the topologically twisted index of a general three-dimensional ${\cal N}\geq 2$ gauge theory with an M-theory or massive type IIA dual in the large $N$ limit. The index is defined as the supersymmetric path integral of the theory on $S^2\times S^1$ in the presence of background magnetic fluxes for the R- and global symmetries and it is conjectured to reproduce the entropy of magnetically charged static BPS AdS$_4$ black holes. For a class of theories with an M-theory dual, we show that the logarithm of the index scales indeed as $N^{3/2}$ (and $N^{5/3}$ in the massive type IIA case). We find an intriguing relation with the (apparently unrelated) large $N$ limit of the partition function on $S^3$. We also provide a universal formula for extracting the index from the large $N$ partition function on $S^3$ and its derivatives and point out its analogy with the attractor mechanism for AdS black holes.
