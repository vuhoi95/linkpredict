Title: Affleck-Dine Baryogenesis in Type IIB String Models
Authors: Rouzbeh Allahverdi and Michele Cicoli and Francesco Muia
Abstract: We present a viable string embedding of Affleck-Dine baryogenesis in type IIB sequestered models where the late-time decay of the lightest modulus reheats the universe to relatively low temperatures. We show that if inflation is driven by a blow-up Kaehler modulus, the Affleck-Dine field can become tachyonic during inflation if the Kaehler metric for matter fields has an appropriate inflaton-dependent contribution. We find that the Affleck-Dine mechanism can generate the observed baryon asymmetry for natural values of the underlying parameters which lead also to successful inflation and low-energy gaugino masses in a split supersymmetry scenario. The reheating temperature from the lightest modulus decay is high enough to allow thermal Higgsino-like dark matter.
