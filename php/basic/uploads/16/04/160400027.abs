Title: Spherical Calogero model with oscillator/Coulomb potential: quantum case
Authors: Francisco Correa and Tigran Hakobyan and Olaf Lechtenfeld and Armen Nersessian
Abstract: We consider the quantum mechanics of Calogero models in an oscillator or Coulomb potential on the N-dimensional sphere. Their Hamiltonians are obtained by an appropriate Dunkl deformation of the oscillator/Coulomb system on the sphere and its restriction to (Coxeter reflection) symmetric wave functions. By the same method we also find the symmetry generators and compute their algebras.
