Abstract: The dynamical net-charge fluctuations (${\nu}_{dyn}$) in different particle ratios $K/{\pi}$, $K/p$, and $p/{\pi}$ are calculated from the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model and compared with STAR central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7.7-200~$GeV and NA49 central Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=6.3-17.3~$GeV. The three charged-particle ratios ($K/{\pi}$, $K/p$, and $p/{\pi}$) are determined as total and average of opposite and average of same charges. We find an excellent agreement between the HRG calculations and the experimental measurements, especially from STAR beam energy scan (BES) program, while the strange particles in the NA49 experiment at lower Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) energies are not reproduced by the HRG approach. We conclude that the utilized HRG version seems to take into consideration various types of correlations including strong interactions through the heavy resonances and their decays especially at BES energies.
