Title: Weyl Action of Two-Column Mixed-Symmetry Field and Its Factorization  Around (A)dS Space
Authors: Euihun Joung and Karapet Mkrtchyan
Abstract: We investigate the four-derivative free Weyl action for two-column mixed-symmetry field that makes use of maximal gauge symmetries. In flat space, the action can be uniquely determined from gauge and Weyl (trace shift) symmetry requirements. We show that there is a smooth and unique deformation of the flat action to (A)dS which keeps the same amount of gauge symmetries. This action admits a factorization into two distinct two-derivative actions having gauge parameters of different Young diagrams. Hence, this factorization pattern naturally extends that of the Weyl actions of symmetric higher spin fields to mixed-symmetry cases. The mass-deformation for these actions can be realized preserving one of the gauge symmetries. Although generically non-unitary, in special dimensions, unitarity is achieved selecting different mass deformations for dS and AdS. We consider particular examples of our construction such as New Massive Gravity in three dimensions, linearized bigravity in four dimensions and their arbitrary dimensional generalizations.
