Title: Comparative analysis of finite field-dependent BRST transformations
Authors: Pavel Yu. Moshin and Alexander A. Reshetnyak
Abstract: We present a review of our recent study (A. Reshetnyak, IJMPA 29 (2014) 1450128; P. Moshin, A. Reshetnyak, Nucl. Phys. B 888 (2014) 92; Phys. Lett B 739 (2014) 110; IJMPA 29 (2014) 1450159; IJMPA 30 (2015) 1550021; IJMPA 31 (2016) 1650111), in which the concept of finite field-dependent BRST and BRST-antiBRST transformations for gauge theories was introduced, and their properties investigated. An algorithm of exact calculation for the Jacobian of a respective change of variables in the path integral is presented. Applications to the Yang--Mills theory and Standard Model, in view of infra-red (Gribov) peculiarities, are discussed.
