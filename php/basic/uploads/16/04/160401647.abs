Title: Dynamical corrections to the anomalous holographic softwall model: the  pomeron and the odderon
Authors: Eduardo Folco Capossoli and Danning Li and Henrique Boschi-Filho
Abstract: In this work we use the holographic softwall AdS/QCD model with anomalous dimension contributions coming from two different QCD beta functions to calculate the masses of higher spin glueball states for both even and odd spins and its respective Regge trajectories, related to the pomeron and the odderon, respectively. We further investigate this model taking into account dynamical corrections due to a dilaton potential consistent with Einstein equations in 5 dimensions. The results found in this work for the Regge trajectories within the anomalous softwall model with dynamical corrections are consistent with those presented in the literature.
