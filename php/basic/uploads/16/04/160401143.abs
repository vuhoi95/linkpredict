Title: Consistent systems of correlators in non-semisimple conformal field  theory
Authors: JÃ¼rgen Fuchs and Christoph Schweigert
Abstract: Based on the modular functor associated with a - not necessarily semisimple - finite non-degenerate ribbon category $\mathcal D$, we present a definition of a consistent system of bulk field correlators of a conformal field theory which comprises invariance under mapping class group actions and compatibility with the sewing of surfaces. We show that when restricting to surfaces of genus zero such systems are in bijection with commutative symmetric Frobenius algebras in $\mathcal D$, while for surfaces of any genus they are in bijection with modular Frobenius algebras in $\mathcal D$. This extends structures familiar from rational conformal field theories to rigid logarithmic conformal field theories.
