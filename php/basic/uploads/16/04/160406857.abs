Title: Cosmological twinlike models with multi scalar fields
Authors: Yuan Zhong and Chun-E Fu and Yu-Xiao Liu
Abstract: We consider cosmological models driven by several canonical or noncanonical scalar fields. We show how the superpotential method enables one to construct twinlike models for a particular canonical model from some noncanonical ones. We conclude that it is possible to construct twinlike models for multi-field cosmological models, even when the spatial curvature is nonzero. This work extends the discussions of [D. Bazeia and J. D. Dantas, Phys. Rev. D, 85 (2012) 067303] to cases with multi scalar fields and with non-vanished spatial curvature, by using a different superpotential method.
