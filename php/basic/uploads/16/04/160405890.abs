Abstract: Using the concept of 3-Leibniz bialgebra, we construct Bagger-Lambert (BL) model for $N=6$ multiple M2-brane on Manin triple of special 3-Leibniz bialgebra. Consequently, according to the correspondence of these 3-Leibniz bialgebras with Lie bialgebras, we reduce this model to an N = (4,4) WZW model (D2-brane) equipped with one 2-cocycle in its Lie bialgebra structure. Moreover, the Basu-Harvey equation which is found by considering boundary conditions for BL model containing Leibniz bialgebra structure, is reduced to Nahm equation and vice versa using this correspondence. In this way, M2-brane and its boundary conditions can be constructed from D2-brane and the related boundary conditions using the correspondence of 3-Leibniz bialgebra and Lie bialgebra, and vice versa.
