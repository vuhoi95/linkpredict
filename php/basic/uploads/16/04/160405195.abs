Title: Quantum gravity kinematics from extended TQFTs
Authors: Bianca Dittrich and Marc Geiller
Abstract: We show how extended topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) can be used to obtain a kinematical setup for quantum gravity, i.e. a kinematical Hilbert space together with a representation of the observable algebra including operators of quantum geometry. In particular, we consider the holonomy-flux algebra of (2+1)-dimensional Euclidean loop quantum gravity, and construct a new representation of this algebra that incorporates a positive cosmological constant. The vacuum state underlying our representation is defined by the Turaev-Viro TQFT. We therefore construct here a generalization, or more precisely a quantum deformation at root of unity, of the previously-introduced SU(2) BF representation. The extended Turaev-Viro TQFT provides a description of the excitations on top of the vacuum, which are essential to allow for a representation of the holonomies and fluxes. These excitations agree with the ones induced by massive and spinning particles, and therefore the framework presented here allows automatically for a description of the coupling of such matter to (2+1)-dimensional gravity with a cosmological constant. The new representation presents a number of advantages over the representations which exist so far. It possesses a very useful finiteness property which guarantees the discreteness of spectra for a wide class of quantum (intrinsic and extrinsic) geometrical operators. The notion of basic excitations leads to a fusion basis which offers exciting possibilities for constructing states with interesting global properties. The work presented here showcases how the framework of extended TQFTs can help design new representations and understand the associated notion of basic excitations. This is essential for the construction of the dynamics of quantum gravity, and will enable the study of possible phases of spin foam models and group field theories from a new perspective.
