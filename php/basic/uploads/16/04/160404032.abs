Title: Generalized Wick theorems in conformal field theory and the Borcherds  identity
Authors: Taichiro Takagi and Takuma Yoshikawa
Abstract: As the missing counterpart of the well-known generalized Wick theorem for interacting fields in two dimensional conformal field theory, we present a new formula for the operator product expansion of a normally ordered operator and a single operator on its right hand. Quite similar to the original Wick theorem for the opposite order operator product, it expresses the contraction i.e. the singular part of the operator product expansion as a contour integral of only two terms, each of which is a product of a contraction and a single operator. We discuss the relationship between these formulas and the Borcherds identity satisfied by the quantum fields associated with the theory of vertex algebras. A derivation of these formulas by an analytic method is also presented. The validity of our new formula is illustrated by a few examples including the Sugawara construction of the energy momentum tensor for the quantized currents of affine Lie algebras.
