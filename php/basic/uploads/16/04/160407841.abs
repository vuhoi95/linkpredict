Title: Loop Corrections to Standard Model Fields in Inflation
Authors: Xingang Chen and Yi Wang and Zhong-Zhi Xianyu
Abstract: We calculate 1-loop corrections to the Schwinger-Keldysh propagators of Standard-Model-like fields of spin-0, 1/2, and 1, with all renormalizable interactions during inflation. We pay special attention to the late-time divergences of loop corrections, and show that the divergences can be resummed into finite results in the late-time limit using dynamical renormalization group method. This is our first step toward studying both the standard model and new physics in the primordial universe.
