Abstract: We study Bethe vectors of integrable models based on the super-Yangian $Y(\mathfrak{gl}(m|n))$. Starting from the super-trace formula, we exhibit recursion relations for these vectors in the case of $Y(\mathfrak{gl}(2|1))$ and $Y(\mathfrak{gl}(1|2))$. These recursion relations allow to get explicit expressions for the Bethe vectors. Using an antimorphism of the super-Yangian $Y(\mathfrak{gl}(m|n))$, we also construct a super-trace formula for dual Bethe vectors, and, for $Y(\mathfrak{gl}(2|1))$ and $Y(\mathfrak{gl}(1|2))$ super-Yangians, show recursion relations for them. Again, the latter allow us to get explicit expressions for dual Bethe vectors.
