Title: A big bounce, slow-roll inflation and dark energy from conformal gravity
Authors: Jack Gegenberg and Shohreh Rahmati and Sanjeev S. Seahra
Abstract: We examine the cosmological sector of a gauge theory of gravity based on the SO(4,2) conformal group of Minkowski space. We allow for conventional matter coupled to the spacetime metric as well as matter coupled to the field that gauges special conformal transformations. An effective cosmological constant is generated dynamically via solution of the equations of motion, and this allows us to recover the late time acceleration of the universe. Furthermore, gravitational fields sourced by ordinary cosmological matter (i.e. dust and radiation) are significantly weakened in the very early universe, which has the effect of replacing the big bang with a big bounce. Finally, we find that this bounce is followed by a period of nearly-exponential slow roll inflation that can last long enough to explain the large scale homogeneity of the cosmic microwave background.
