Title: Equilibrium and stability of relativistic stars in extended theories of  gravity
Authors: Aneta Wojnar and Hermano Velten
Abstract: We study static, spherically symmetric equilibrium configurations in extended theories of gravity (ETG) following the notation introduced by Capozziello et {\it al}. We calculate the differential equations for the stellar structure in such theories in a very generic form i.e., the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff generalization for any ETG is introduced. Stability analysis is also investigated with special focus on the particular example of scalar-tensor gravity.
