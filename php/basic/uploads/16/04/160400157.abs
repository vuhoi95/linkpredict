Title: Dispersionless wave packets in graphene and other Dirac materials
Authors: Vit Jakubsky and Matej Tusek
Abstract: We show that a wide class of quantum systems with translational invariance can host dispersionless, soliton-like, wave packets. We focus on the settings where the effective, two-dimensional Hamiltonian acquires the form of Dirac operator. The proposed framework for construction of the dispersionless wave packets is illustrated on systems with topologically nontrivial effective mass. Our analytical predictions are accompanied by a numerical analysis and possible experimental realizations are discussed.
