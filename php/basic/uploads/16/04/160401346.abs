Title: Odd viscosity in the quantum critical region of a holographic Weyl  semimetal
Authors: Karl Landsteiner and Yan Liu and Ya-Wen Sun
Abstract: We study odd viscosity in a holographic model of a Weyl semimetal. The model is characterised by a quantum phase transition from a topological semimetal to a trivial semimetal state. Since the model is axisymmetric in three spatial dimensions there are two independent odd viscosities. Both odd viscosity coefficients are non-vanishing in the quantum critical region and non-zero only due to the mixed axial gravitational anomaly. It is therefore a novel example in which the mixed axial gravitational anomaly gives rise to a transport coefficient at first order in derivatives at finite temperature. We also compute anisotropic shear viscosities and show that one of them violates the KSS bound. In the quantum critical region, the physics of viscosities as well as conductivities is governed by the quantum critical point.
