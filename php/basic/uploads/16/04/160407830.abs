Title: Finite size effect on dynamical entanglement entropy: CFT and holography
Authors: Gautam Mandal and Ritam Sinha and Tomonori Ugajin
Abstract: Time-dependent entanglement entropy (EE) is computed for a single interval in two-dimensional conformal theories from a quenched initial state in the presence of spatial boundaries. The EE is found to be periodic in time with periodicity equal to the system size $L$. For large enough $L$, the EE shows a rise to a thermal value (characterized by a temperature $1/\beta$ determined by the initial state), followed by periodic returns to the original value. This works irrespective of whether the conformal field theory (CFT) is rational or irrational. For conformal field theories with a holographic dual, the large $c$ limit plays an essential role in ensuring that the EE computed from the CFT is universal (independent of the details of the CFT and of boundary conditions) and is exactly matched by the holographic EE. The dual geometry is computed and it interpolates between a BTZ black hole at large $L$ and global AdS at large $\beta$.
