Title: Bootstrapping rapidity anomalous dimension for transverse-momentum  resummation
Authors: Ye Li and Hua Xing Zhu
Abstract: Soft function relevant for transverse-momentum resummation for Drell-Yan or Higgs production at hadron colliders are computed through to three loops in the expansion of strong coupling, with the help of bootstrap technique and supersymmetric decomposition. The corresponding rapidity anomalous dimension is extracted. An intriguing relation between anomalous dimensions for transverse-momentum resummation and threshold resummation is found.
