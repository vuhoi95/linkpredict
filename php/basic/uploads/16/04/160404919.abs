Title: Refinement of the Bousso-Engelhardt Area Law
Authors: Fabio Sanches and Sean J. Weinberg
Abstract: Past holographic screens are codimension-one surfaces of indefinite signature that are foliated by marginally anti-trapped surfaces called leaves. Future holographic screens are defined similarly except with marginally trapped leaves. Bousso and Engelhardt recently showed that the leaves of past and future holographic screens have monotonic area. We prove a stronger area law that shows that subregions of leaves also have monotonic area. For every past and future holographic screen, there exists a family of leaf-orthogonal curves called the fibration of the screen. Any region in a leaf can be translated along the fibration to a leaf of larger area. Our result states that the area of the subregion grows as it is translated.
