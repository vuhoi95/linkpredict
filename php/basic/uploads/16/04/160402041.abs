Title: Quantum-gravity effects on a Higgs-Yukawa model
Authors: Astrid Eichhorn and Aaron Held and Jan M. Pawlowski
Abstract: A phenomenologically viable theory of quantum gravity must accommodate all observed matter degrees of freedom and their properties. Here, we explore whether a toy model of the Higgs-Yukawa sector of the Standard Model is compatible with asymptotically safe quantum gravity. We discuss the phenomenological implications of our result in the context of the Standard Model. We analyze the quantum scaling dimension of the system, and find an irrelevant Yukawa coupling at a joint gravity-matter fixed point. Further, we explore the impact of gravity-induced couplings between scalars and fermions, which are non-vanishing in asymptotically safe gravity.
