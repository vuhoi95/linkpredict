Title: Meson spectroscopy in a confining theory via AdS/CFT
Authors: Majid Dehghani and Behrouz Mirza
Abstract: Instanton effects may have implications for hadronization of quark-gluon plasma as it cools. Here we study dispersion relations of mesons in a strongly coupled plasma with an instanton background present. It will be shown that at higher energies the instanton effect diminishes and some comments on the limiting velocity of mesons in the plasma. the profile function of mesons on the gravity side is considered also because of its relevance to energy loss of quark in plasma.
