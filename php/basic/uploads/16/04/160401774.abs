Title: Semiclassical OPE coefficients from 3D gravity
Authors: Chi-Ming Chang and Ying-Hsuan Lin
Abstract: We present a closed form expression for the semiclassical OPE coefficients that are universal for all 2D CFTs with a "weak" light spectrum, by taking the semiclassical limit of the fusion kernel. We match this with a properly regularized and normalized bulk action evaluated on a geometry with three conical defects, analytically continued in the deficit angles beyond the range for which a metric with positive signature exists. The analytically continued geometry has a codimension-one coordinate singularity surrounding the heaviest conical defect. This singularity becomes a horizon after Wick rotating to Lorentzian signature, suggesting a connection between universality and the existence of a horizon.
