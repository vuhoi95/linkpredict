Title: Modular invariant inflation
Authors: Tatsuo Kobayashi and Daisuke Nitta and Yuko Urakawa
Abstract: Modular invariance is a striking symmetry in string theory, which may keep stringy corrections under control. In this paper, we investigate a phenomenological consequence of the modular invariance, assuming that this symmetry is preserved as well as in a four dimensional (4D) low energy effective field theory. As a concrete setup, we consider a modulus field $T$ whose contribution in the 4D effective field theory remains invariant under the modular transformation and study inflation drived by $T$. The modular invariance restricts a possible form of the scalar potenntial. As a result, large field models of inflation are hardly realized. Meanwhile, a small field model of inflation can be still accomodated in this restricted setup. The scalar potential traced during the slow-roll inflation mimics the hilltop potential $V_{ht}$, but it also has a non-negligible deviation from $V_{ht}$. Detecting the primordial gravitational waves predicted in this model is rather challenging. Yet, we argue that it may be still possible to falsify this model by combining the information in the reheating process which can be determined self-completely in this setup.
