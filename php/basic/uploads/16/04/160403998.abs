Abstract: Using Hodge diagram combinatorial data, we study qubit and fermionic Fock spaces from the point of view of type II superstring black holes based on complex compactifications. Concretely, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between qubits, fermionic spaces and extremal black holes in maximally supersymmetric supergravity obtained from type II superstring on complex toroidal and Calabi-Yau compactifications. We interpret the differential forms of the n-dimensional complex toroidal compactification as states of n-qubits encoding information on extremal black hole charges. We show that there are 2^n copies of n-qubit systems which can be split as 2^n=2^{n-1}+2^{n-1}. More precisely, 2^{n-1} copies are associated with even D-brane charges in type IIA superstring and the other 2^{n-1} ones correspond to odd D-brane charges in IIB superstring. This correspondence is generalized to a class of Calabi-Yau manifolds. In connection with black hole charges in type IIA superstring, an n-qubit system has been obtained from a canonical line bundle of n factors of one dimensional projective space \mathbb{CP}^1.
