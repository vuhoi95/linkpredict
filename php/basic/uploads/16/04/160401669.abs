Abstract: Using finite discrete group characters and symmetry breaking by hyperflux as well as constraints on top- quark family, we study minimal low energy effective theory following from SU$_{5}\times D_{4}$ models embedded in F-theory with non abelian flux. Matter curves spectrum of the models is obtained from SU$_{5}\times S_{5}$ theory with monodromy $S_{5}$ by performing two breakings; first from symmetric group $S_{5}$ to $S_{4}$ subsymmetry; and next to dihedral $D_{4}$ subgroup. As a consequence, and depending on the ways of decomposing triplets of $S_{4}$, we end with three types of $D_{4}$- models. Explicit constructions of these theories are given and a MSSM- like spectrum is derived.
