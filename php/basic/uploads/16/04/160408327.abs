Title: Functional flows in QED and the modified Ward-Takahashi identity
Authors: Yuji Igarashi and Katsumi Itoh and Jan M. Pawlowski
Abstract: In the functional renormalisation group approach to gauge theory, the Ward-Takahashi identity is modified due to the presence of an infrared cutoff term. It take the most accessible form for the Wilsonian effective action. In the present work we solve these identities, partially, for the Wilson effective action of QED. In particular, we compute the longitudinal part of the photon two point vertex function as a momentum- dependent function in the presence of the cutoff k. The resultant Wilsonian effective action carries form factors that originate from the modified Ward-Takahashi identity. We show how this result carries over to the one-particle-irreducible effective action.
