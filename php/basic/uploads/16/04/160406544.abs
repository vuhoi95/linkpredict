Title: Interacting Gauge-Fluid system
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Subir Ghosh and Arpan Krishna Mitra
Abstract: A gauge-fluid relativistic model where a non-isentropic fluid is coupled to a dynamical Maxwell ($U(1)$) gauge field, has been studied. We have examined in detail the structures of energy momentum tensor, derived from two definitions, {\it{ie.}} the canonical (Noether) one and the symmetric one. In the conventional equal-time formalism, we have shown that the generators of the spacetime transformations obtained from these two definitions agree, modulo the Gauss constraint. This equivalence in the physical sector has been achieved only because of the dynamical nature of the gauge fields. Subsequently we have explicitly demonstrated the validity of the Schwinger condition. A detailed analysis of the model in lightcone formalism has also been done where several interesting features are revealed.
