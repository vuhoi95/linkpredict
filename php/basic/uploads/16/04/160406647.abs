Title: On the CPT-even Lorentz-breaking extension of the QED
Authors: T. Mariz and R. V. Maluf and J. R. Nascimento and A. Yu. Petrov
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the CPT-even Lorentz-breaking extension of QED in four and five dimensions and generate perturbatively the aether-like term for the gauge field which is finite in five dimensions within the dimensional regularization, but divergent in four dimensions.
