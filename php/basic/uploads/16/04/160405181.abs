Title: From Basu-Harvey to Nahm equation via 3-Lie bialgebra
Authors: M. Aali-Javanangrouh and A. Rezaei-Aghdam
Abstract: Using the concept of 3-Lie bialgebra; we construct the Bagger- Lambert- Gustavson (BLG) model on the Manin triple $\cal D$ of the special 3-Lie bialgebra $({\cal D},{\cal A}_{\cal G},{\cal A}_{{\cal G}^*}^*)$ which is in correspondence with Manin triple of Lie bialgebra $({\cal D},{\cal G},{\cal G}^*)$. Then we have obtained the Basu-Harvey equation (with 3-Lie algebra ${\cal D}$) by studying the boundary condition of this BLG model. We have shown that the Nahm equation (with Lie algebra ${\cal G}$) can be obtained from this Basu-Harvey equation and vice versa.
