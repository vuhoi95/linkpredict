Title: The symmetric orbifold of N=2 minimal models
Authors: Matthias R. Gaberdiel and Maximilian Kelm
Abstract: The large level limit of the N=2 minimal models that appear in the duality with the N=2 supersymmetric higher spin theory on AdS_3 is shown to be a natural subsector of a certain symmetric orbifold theory. We study the relevant decompositions in both the untwisted and the twisted sector, and analyse the structure of the higher spin representations in the twisted sector in some detail. These results should help to identify the string background of which the higher spin theory is expected to describe the leading Regge trajectory in the tensionless limit.
