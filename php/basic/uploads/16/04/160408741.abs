Title: Vertex Operators for Irregular Conformal Blocks: Supersymmetric Case
Authors: Dimitri Polyakov and Chaiho Rim
Abstract: We construct supersymmetric irregular vertex operators of arbitrary rank, appearing in the colliding limit of primary fields. We find that the structure of the supersymmetric irregular vertices differs significantly from the bosonic case: upon supersymmetrization, the irregular operators are no longer the eigenstates of positive Virasoro and $W_N$ generators but block-diagonalize them. We relate the block-diagonal structure of the irregular vertices to contributions of the Ramond sector to the colliding limit.
