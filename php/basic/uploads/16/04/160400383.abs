Abstract: Supersymmetric localization provides exact results that should match QFT computations in some regularization scheme. The agreement is particularly subtle in three dimensions where complex answers from localization procedure sometimes arise. We investigate this problem by studying the expectation value of the 1/6 BPS Wilson loop in planar ABJ(M) theory at three loops in perturbation theory. We reproduce the corresponding term in the localization result and argue that it originates entirely from a non-trivial framing of the circular contour. Contrary to pure Chern-Simons theory, we point out that for ABJ(M) the framing phase is a non-trivial function of the couplings and that it potentially receives contributions from vertex-like diagrams. Finally, we briefly discuss the intimate link between the exact framing factor and the Bremsstrahlung function of the 1/2-BPS cusp.
