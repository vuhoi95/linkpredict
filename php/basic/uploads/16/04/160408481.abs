Authors: Am-Gil Li and Tae-Song Kim and Chol-Man Li and Song-Jin Im
Abstract: In this paper, we proved the correspondence between Feynman diagrams in space-time and light-cone diagrams in world-sheet by using only path integral representation on free Green function in the first quantization theory. We also obtained general representation on perturbation series of light-cone diagrams describing split and join of strings.
