Title: F-Theory and N=1 SCFTs in Four Dimensions
Authors: David R. Morrison and Cumrun Vafa
Abstract: Using the F-theory realization, we identify a subclass of 6d (1,0) SCFTs whose compactification on a Riemann surface leads to N = 1 4d SCFTs where the moduli space of the Riemann surface is part of the moduli space of the theory. In particular we argue that for a special case of these theories (dual to M5 branes probing ADE singularities), we obtain 4d N = 1 theories whose space of marginal deformations is given by the moduli space of flat ADE connections on a Riemann surface.
