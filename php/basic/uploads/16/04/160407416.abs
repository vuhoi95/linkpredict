Title: Large N Correlation Functions in Superconformal Field Theories
Authors: Diego Rodriguez-Gomez and Jorge G. Russo
Abstract: We compute correlation functions of chiral primary operators in N=2 superconformal theories at large N using a construction based on supersymmetric localization recently developed by Gerchkovitz et al. We focus on N=4 SYM as well as on superconformal QCD. In the case of N=4 we recover the free field theory results as expected due to non-renormalization theorems. In the case of superconformal QCD we study the planar expansion in the large N limit. The final correlators admit a simple generalization to a finite N formula which exactly matches the various small $N$ results in the literature.
