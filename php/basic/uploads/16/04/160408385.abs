Title: de Sitter symmetry of Neveu-Schwarz spinors
Authors: Henri Epstein and Ugo Moschella
Abstract: We study the relations between Dirac fields living on the 2-dimensional Lorentzian cylinder and the ones living on the double-covering of the 2-dimensional de Sitter manifold, here identified as a certain coset space of the group $SL(2,R)$. We show that there is an extended notion of de Sitter covariance only for Dirac fields having the Neveu-Schwarz anti-periodicity and construct the relevant cocycle. Finally, we show that the de Sitter symmetry is naturally inherited by the Neveu-Schwarz massless Dirac field on the cylinder.
