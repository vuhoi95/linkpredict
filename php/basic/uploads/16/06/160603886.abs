Title: Higher Order and Harmonic Corrections to the Quasi-de Sitter Inflation
Authors: M. Mohsenzadeh and E. Yusofi
Abstract: Since the trans-Planckian considerations can be associated with the re-definition of the initial vacuum, we investigate further the influence of trans-planckian physics on the spectra produced by initial quasi-de Sitter (dS) state during inflation. Recently, we have introduced asymptotic-dS mode to study the scale dependency of power spectrum during inflation. The obtained spectra consisting of higher order corrections associated to the type of the geometry and harmonic terms sensitive to the fluctuations of space-time(or gravitational waves) during inflation. The corrections are tiny at far past time limit, but may have very important effects at CMB and on the formation of large scale structure. Also, the results are always valid for any asymptotic dS space-time and particularly coincide the conventional results for the dS and flat space-time.
