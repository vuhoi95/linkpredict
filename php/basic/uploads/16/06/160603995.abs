Abstract: In this paper, we continue to investigate nonequilibrium properties of the anisotropic quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions within the holographic approach. We evaluate spatial Wilson loops using both static and time-dependent dual backgrounds. The anisotropic time-dependent plasma is dual to the Lifshitz-Vaidya background, while we use a black brane in the Lifshitz-like spacetime for a finite temperature plasma in equilibrium. To probe the system we calculate Wilson loops oriented in different spatial directions. We find that anisotropic effects in the Lifshitz-like backgrounds are more visible for the Wilson loops lying in the transversal plane unlike the Wilson loops with partially longitudinal orientation. We also observe that these Wilson loops are more sensitive to the parameter controlling the anisotropy of the metric. We compute the string tension and the pseudopotential at different temperatures for the static quark-gluon plasma. We also compare the thermalization times of spatial Wilson loops with the thermalization times of entanglement entropy and two-point correlation functions. We note that the thermalization of 2-point correlators is faster compared to Wilson loops, the thermalization of which is faster than the thermalization of entanglement entropy. Increasing the anisotropy we decrease the thermalization times of all these observables keeping the order of their thermalization.
