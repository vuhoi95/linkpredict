Title: Noncommutative Brownian motion
Authors: Willien O. Santos and Guilherme M. A. Almeida and Andre M. C. Souza
Abstract: We investigate the Brownian motion of a particle in a two-dimensional noncommutative (NC) space. Using the standard NC algebra embodied by the sympletic Weyl-Moyal formalism we find that noncommutativity induces a non-vanishing correlation between both coordinates at different times. The effect itself stands as a signature of spatial noncommutativity and offers further alternatives to experimentally detect the phenomena.
