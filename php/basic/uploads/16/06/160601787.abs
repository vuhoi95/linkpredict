Title: F-string Solution in AdS4 X CP3 PP-wave Background
Authors: Gourav Banerjee and Binata Panda
Abstract: We present supergravity solution for F-string in pp wave background obtained from AdS4 X CP3 with zero flat directions.The classical solution is shown to break all space-time supersymmetries. We explicitly write down the standard as well as supernumerary Killing spinors both for the background and F-string solution.
