Title: Dressed elliptic genus of heterotic compactifications with torsion and  general bundles
Authors: Dan Israel and Matthieu Sarkis
Abstract: We define and compute the dressed elliptic genus of N = 2 heterotic compactifications with torsion that are principal two-torus bundles over a K3 surface. We consider the most general gauge bundle compatible with supersymmetry, a stable holomorphic vector bundle over the base together with an Abelian bundle over the total space, generalizing the computation previously done by the authors in the absence of the latter. Starting from a (0,2) gauged linear sigma-model with torsion we use supersymmetric localization to obtain the result. We provide also a mathematical definition of the dressed elliptic genus as a modified Euler characteristic and prove that both expressions agree for hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces. Finally we show that it admits a natural decomposition in terms of N = 4 superconformal characters, that may be useful to investigate moonshine phenomena for this wide class of N = 2 vacua, that includes K3*T2 compactifications as special cases.
