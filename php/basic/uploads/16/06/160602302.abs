Title: Static Einstein-Maxwell black holes with no spatial isometries in AdS  space
Authors: Carlos A. R. Herdeiro and Eugen Radu
Abstract: We explicitly construct static black hole solutions to the fully non-linear, D=4, Einstein-Maxwell-AdS equations that have no continuous spatial symmetries. These black holes have a smooth, topologically spherical horizon (section), but without isometries, and approach, asymptotically, global AdS spacetime. They are interpreted as bound states of a horizon with the Einstein-Maxwell-AdS solitons recently discovered, for appropriate boundary data. In sharp contrast with the uniqueness results for Minkowski electrovacuum, the existence of these black holes shows that single, equilibrium, BH solutions in AdS-electrovacuum admit an arbitrary multipole structure.
