Title: Nontrivial UV behavior of rank-4 tensor field models for quantum gravity
Authors: Joseph Ben Geloun and Tim A. Koslowski
Abstract: We investigate the universality classes of rank-4 colored bipartite U(1) tensor field models near the Gaussian fixed point with the functional renormalization group. In a truncation that contains all power counting relevant and marginal operators, we find a one-dimensional UV attractor that is connected with the Gaussian fixed point. Hence this is first evidence that the model could be asymptotically safe due to a mechanism similar to the one found in the Grosse-Wulkenhaar model, whose UV behavior near the Gaussian fixed point is also described by one-dimensional attractor that contains the Gaussian fixed point. However, the cancellation mechanism that is responsible for the simultaneous vanishing of the beta functions is new to tensor models, i.e. it does not occur in vector or matrix models.
