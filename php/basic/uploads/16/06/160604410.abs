Title: Braneworld scenarios from deformed defect chains
Authors: Mariana Chinaglia and Alex E. Bernardini and Roldao da Rocha
Abstract: Novel braneworld scenarios supported by warp factors driven by a single extra dimension are obtained from deformed one-dimensional lump-like solutions known {\em a priori}. Through a novel {\em ansatz}, the internal energy structure, the braneworld warp factor, and the quantum mechanical analogue problem, as well as the associated zero mode solutions, are straightforwardly derived by means of an analytical procedure. The results allow one to identify thick brane solutions that support internal structures and that can hold the ($3+1$)-dimensional gravity.
