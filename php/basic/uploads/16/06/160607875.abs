Abstract: We model galaxy-like structures as self-gravitating fluids, and analyse their properties in the Newtonian framework. For isotropic fluids, we show that this leads to a generalised Hernquist profile that admits flat rotation curves at large radial distances. For two-component fluid models, we show analytically that physicality of the solutions demands that one of the fluids is necessarily exotic, i.e has negative pressure, excepting for the case where the density profiles of the component fluids are those of the isothermal sphere. We reconcile this result with a corresponding relativistic analysis. Our work can be applied to cases where the gravitating fluids are interpreted as dark fluids, which may accompany or cause gravitational collapse giving birth to galaxy like structures. We elaborate on such collapse processes in general relativity, which might lead to naked singularities.
