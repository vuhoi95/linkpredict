Title: Kondo effect from a Lorentz-violating domain wall description of  superconductivity
Authors: D. Bazeia and F. A. Brito and J. C. Mota-Silva
Abstract: We extend recent results on domain wall description of superconductivity in an Abelian Higgs model by introducing a particular Lorentz-violating term. The temperature of the system is interpreted through the fact that the soliton following accelerating orbits is a Rindler observer experiencing a thermal bath. We show that this term can be associated with the {\sl Kondo effect}, that is, the Lorentz-violating parameter is closely related to the concentration of magnetic impurities living on a superconducting domain wall. We also found that the critical temperature decreasing with the impurity concentration as a non single-valued function, for the case $T_K < T_{c0}$, develops a negative curvature and presents deviations from the Abrikosov and Gor'kov theory, a phenomenon already supported by experimental evidence.
