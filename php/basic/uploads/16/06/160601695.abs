Title: Plethystic Vertex Operators and Boson-Fermion Correspondences
Authors: Bertfried Fauser and Peter D Jarvis and Ronald C King
Abstract: We study the algebraic properties of plethystic vertex operators, introduced in J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 43 405202 (2010), underlying the structure of symmetric functions associated with certain generalized universal character rings of subgroups of the general linear group, defined to stabilize tensors of Young symmetry type characterized by a partition of arbitrary shape \pi. Here we establish an extension of the well-known boson-fermion correspondence involving Schur functions and their associated (Bernstein) vertex operators: for each \pi, the modes generated by the plethystic vertex operators and their suitably constructed duals, satisfy the anticommutation relations of a complex Clifford algebra. The combinatorial manipulations underlying the results involve exchange identities exploiting the Hopf-algebraic structure of certain symmetric function series and their plethysms.
