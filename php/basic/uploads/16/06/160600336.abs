Title: Skyrmions confined as beads on a vortex ring
Authors: Sven Bjarke Gudnason and Muneto Nitta
Abstract: A very simple, quadratic potential is used to construct vortex strings in a generalized Skyrme model and an additional quadratic potential is used to embed sine-Gordon-type halfkinks onto the string worldline, yielding half-Skyrmions on a string. The strings are furthermore compactified onto a circle and the halfkinks are forced to appear in pairs; in particular 2B halfkinks (half-Skyrmions) will appear as beads on a ring with B being the number of times the host vortex is twisted and also the baryon number (Skyrmion number) from the bulk point of view. Finally, we construct an effective field theory on the torus, describing the kinks living on the vortex rings.
