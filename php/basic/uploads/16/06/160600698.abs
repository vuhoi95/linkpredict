Abstract: We revisit the inflationary dynamics in detail for theories with Gauss-Bonnet gravity coupled to scalar functions in light of PLANCK. Considering a chaotic inflationary scenario for two models involving inflaton-Gauss-Bonnet coupling with a dimensionless coupling parameter $\beta$, we constrain the model parameters by current PLANCK data. For non-zero $\beta$, we get a big cosmologically viable region in the space of $(m,\beta)$, where $m$ is the mass of inflaton. Further, we have studied the reheating constraints and unitarity bound on $\beta$ by examining $2$-graviton $\rightarrow 2$-graviton ($ h h \rightarrow h h$) scattering amplitude in flat background. For linear Gauss-Bonnet coupling function, we obtain $\beta \lesssim 10^3$, with the condition $\beta (m/M_P)^2 \simeq 10^{-4}$. For quadratic Gauss-Bonnet coupling function we have found even tighter constraint on $\beta$, coming from reheating consideration. However, study of the Higgs inflation scenario in the presence of Gauss-Bonnet term turned out to be strongly disfavoured.
