Title: Superspace Gauge Fixing in Yang-Mills Matter Coupled Conformal  Supergravity
Authors: Taichiro Kugo and Ryo Yokokura and Koichi Yoshioka
Abstract: In $D=4$, $\cal{N}=1$ conformal superspace, the Yang-Mills matter coupled supergravity system is constructed where the Yang-Mills gauge interaction is introduced by extending the superconformal group to include the K\"ahler isometry group of chiral matter fields. There are two gauge-fixing procedures to get to the component Poincar\'e supergravity: one via the superconformal component formalism and the other via the Poincar\'e superspace formalism. These two types of superconformal gauge-fixing conditions are analyzed in detail and their correspondence is clarified.
