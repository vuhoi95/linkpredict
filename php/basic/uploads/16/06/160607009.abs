Title: The Instanton-Dyon Liquid Model III: Finite Chemical Potential
Authors: Yizhuang Liu and Edward Shuryak and Ismail Zahed
Abstract: We discuss an extension of the instanton-dyon liquid model that includes light quarks at finite chemical potential in the center symmetric phase. We develop the model in details for the case of SU_c(2)\times SU_f(2) by mapping the theory on a 3-dimensional quantum effective theory. We analyze the different phases in the mean-field approximation. We extend this analysis to the general case of SU_c(N_c)\times SU_f(N_f) and note that the chiral and diquark pairings are always comparable.
