Title: Novel symmetries in Weyl-invariant gravity with massive gauge field
Authors: K. Abhinav and A. Shukla and P. K. Panigrahi
Abstract: The background field method is used to linearize the Weyl invariant scalar-tensor gravity, coupled with a Stueckelberg field. For a generic background metric, this action is found to be not invariant, under both diffeomorphism and generalized Weyl symmetry, the latter being a combination of gauge and Weyl transformations. Interestingly, the quadratic Lagrangian, emerging from a background of Minkowski metric, respects both the transformations, independently. Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) symmetry of scalar-tensor gravity coupled with a Stueckelberg-like massive gauge particle, possessing diffeomorphism and generalized Weyl symmetry, reveals that in both the cases, negative norm states with unphysical degrees of freedom do exist. We then show that, by combining diffeomorphism and generalized Weyl symmetries, all the ghost states decouple, thereby removing the unphysical redundancies of the theory. During this process, the scalar field does not represent any dynamic mode, yet modifies the usual harmonic gauge condition through non-minimal coupling with gravity.
