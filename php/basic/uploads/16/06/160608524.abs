Abstract: In this work we use the quasinormal frequencies of a massless scalar perturbation to probe the phase transition of the high dimension charged-AdS black hole. The signature of the critical behavior of this black hole solution is detected in the isobaric as well as in isothermal process. This paper is a natural generalization of \cite{base} to higher dimensional spacetime. More precisely our study shows a clear signal for any dimension $d$ in the isobaric process. As to the isothermal case, we find out that this signature can be affected by other parameters like the pressure and the horizon radius. We conclude that the quasinormal modes can be an efficient tool to investigate the first order phase transition, but fail to disclose the signature of the second order phase transition.
