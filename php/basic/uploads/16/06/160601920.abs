Title: Holographic Entanglement Entropy in NMG
Authors: Luca Basanisi and Shankhadeep Chakrabortty
Abstract: In this paper, we show that a higher derivative theory, such as New Massive Gravity, allows the existence of new entangling surfaces with non-zero extrinsic curvature. We perform the analysis for Lifshitz and Warped $AdS$ space times, revealing the role of the higher derivative contributions in the calculation of the holographic entanglement entropy. Finally, as an outcome of our holographic analysis we briefly comment on the dual boundary theory.
