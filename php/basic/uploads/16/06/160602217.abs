Title: AdS3/CFT2 and q-Poincare' superalgebras
Authors: Joakim Stromwall and Alessandro Torrielli
Abstract: We discover that a certain deformation of the 1+1 dimensional Poincare' superalgebra is exactly realised in the massless sector of the AdS3/CFT2 integrable scattering problem. Deformed Poincar\'e superalgebras were previously noticed to appear in the AdS5/CFT4 correspondence - which displays only massive excitations -, but they were there only a partial symmetry. We obtain a representation of the boost operator and its coproduct, and show that the comultiplication exactly satisfies the homomorphism property. We present a classical limit, and finally speculate on an analogy with the physics of phonons.
