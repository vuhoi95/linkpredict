Title: On the BRST and finite field dependent BRST of a model where vector and  axial vector interaction get mixed up with different weight
Authors: Anisur Rahaman and Safia Yasmin
Abstract: The generalized version of a lower dimensional model where vector and axial vector interaction get mixed up with different weight is considered. The bosonized version of which does not posses the local gauge symmetry. An attempt has been made here to construct BRST invariant reformulation of this model using Batalin Fradlin and Vilkovisky formalism. It is found that the extra field needed to make it gauge invariant turns into Wess-Zumino scalar with appropriate choice of gauge fixing. An application of finite field dependent BRST and anti-BRST transformation is also made here in order to show the transmutation between the BRST symmetric and the usual non-symmetric version of the model.
