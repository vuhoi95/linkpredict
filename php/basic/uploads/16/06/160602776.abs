Title: Vortex lines attached to dark solitons in Bose-Einstein condensates and  Boson-Vortex Duality in 3+1 Dimensions
Authors: A. Mu√±oz Mateo and Xiaoquan Yu and Jun Nian
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of stationary states composed of vortex lines attached to planar dark solitons in scalar Bose-Einstein condensates. Dynamically stable states of this type are found at low values of the chemical potential in channeled condensates, where the long-wavelength instability of dark solitons is prevented. In oblate, harmonic traps, U-shaped vortex lines attached by both ends to a single planar soliton are shown to be long-lived states. Our results are reported for parameters typical of current experiments, and open up a way to explore the interplay of different topological structures. These configurations provide Dirichlet boundary conditions for vortex lines and thereby mimic open strings attached to D-branes in string theory. We show that these similarities can be formally established by mapping the Gross-Pitaevskii theory into a dual effective string theory for open strings via a boson-vortex duality in 3+1 dimensions. Combining a one-form gauge field living on the soliton plane which couples to the endpoints of vortex lines and a two-form gauge field which couples to vortex lines, we obtain a gauge-invariant dual action of open vortex lines with their endpoints attached to dark solitons.
