Title: On the Hamiltonian formalism of the tetrad-gravity
Authors: Meriem Hadjer Lagraa and Mohammed Lagraa and Nabila Touhami
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the Hamiltonian constraints of the d-dimensional tetrad-connection gravity where the non-dynamical part of the spatial connection is fixed to zero by an adequate guage transformation. This new action depending on the co-tetrad and the dynamical part of the spatial connection leads to Lorentz, scalar and vectorial first-class polynomial constraints obeying a closed algebra in terms of Poisson brackets. This algebra closes on the structure constants instead of structure functions resulting from the Hamiltonian formalisms based on the A.D.M. decomposition. The same algebra of the reduced first-class constraints defined on the reduced phase-space, where the second-class constraints are solved, is obtained in terms of Dirac brackets. These first-class constraintslead to the same physical degrees of freedom of the general relativity. PACS numbers: 04.20.Cv, 04.20.Fy, 11.10.Ef, 11.30.Cp
