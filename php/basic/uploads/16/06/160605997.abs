Title: Mass and Angular Momentum of Black Holes in Three Dimensional Gravity  Theories with First Order Formalism
Authors: Soonkeon Nam and Jong-Dae Park
Abstract: We apply the Wald formalism to obtain masses and angular momenta of black holes in three dimensional gravity theories using first order formalism. Wald formalism suggests mass and angular momentum of black hole as an integration of some charge variation form at its boundary. The action of the three dimensional gravity theories can be represented by the form including some auxiliary fields. As well-known examples we have calculated mass and angular momentum of some black holes in topologically massive gravity and new massive gravity theories using first order formalism. We have also calculated mass and angular momentum of BTZ black hole and new type black hole in minimal massive gravity theory with the action represented by first order formalism.
