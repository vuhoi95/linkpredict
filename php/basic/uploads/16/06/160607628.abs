Title: Emergent geometry, thermal CFT and surface/state correspondence
Authors: Wen-Cong Gan and Fu-Wen Shu and Meng-He Wu
Abstract: We study a conjectured correspondence between any codimension two convex surface and a quantum state (SS-duality for short). By generalizing thermofield double formalism to continuum version of the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (cMERA) and using the SS-duality, we show that thermal geometries naturally emerge as a result of hidden quantum entanglement between boundary CFTs. We therefore propose a general framework to emerge the thermal geometry from CFT at finite temperature. As an example, the case of $2d$ CFT is considered. We calculate its information metric and show that it is either BTZ black hole or thermal AdS as expected.
