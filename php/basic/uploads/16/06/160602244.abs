Title: Local integrands for two-loop all-plus Yang-Mills amplitudes
Authors: Simon Badger and Gustav Mogull and Tiziano Peraro
Abstract: We express the planar five- and six-gluon two-loop Yang-Mills amplitudes with all positive helicities in compact analytic form using D-dimensional local integrands that are free of spurious singularities. The integrand is fixed from on-shell tree amplitudes in six dimensions using D-dimensional generalised unitarity cuts. The resulting expressions are shown to have manifest infrared behaviour at the integrand level. We also find simple representations of the rational terms obtained after integration in 4-2epsilon dimensions.
