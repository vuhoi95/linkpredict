Title: Symmetries of quantum space-time in 3 dimensions
Authors: Francesco Cianfrani and Jerzy Kowalski-Glikman and Daniele Pranzetti and Giacomo Rosati
Abstract: By applying loop quantum gravity techniques to 3D gravity with a positive cosmological constant $\Lambda$, we show how the local gauge symmetry of the theory, encoded in the constraint algebra, acquires the quantum group structure of $so_q(4)$, with $ q = \exp{(i\hbar \sqrt{\Lambda}/2\kappa)}$. By means of an Inonu-Wigner contraction of the quantum group bi-algebra, keeping $\kappa$ finite, we obtain the kappa-Poincar\'e algebra of the flat quantum space-time symmetries.
