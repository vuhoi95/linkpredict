Abstract: We consider Abelian tensor hierarchy in four-dimensional ${\cal N}=1$ supergravity in the conformal superspace formalism, where the so-called covariant approach is used to antisymmetric tensor fields. We introduce $p$-form gauge superfields as superforms in the conformal superspace. We solve the Bianchi identities under the constraints for the superforms. As a result, each of form fields is expressed by a single gauge invariant superfield. The action of superforms is shown with the invariant superfields. We also show the relation between the superspace formalism and the superconformal tensor calculus.
