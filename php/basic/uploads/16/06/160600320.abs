Title: Effective action approach to dynamical generation of fermion mixing
Authors: Massimo Blasone and Petr Jizba and Luca Smaldone
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a mechanism for the dynamical generation of flavor mixing, in the framework of the Nambu--Jona Lasinio model. Our approach is illustrated both with the conventional operatorial formalism and with functional integral and ensuing one-loop effective action. The results obtained are briefly discussed.
