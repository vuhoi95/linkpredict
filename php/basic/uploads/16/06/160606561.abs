Title: Coherent 3j-symbol representation for the loop quantum gravity  intertwiner space
Authors: Emanuele Alesci and Jerzy Lewandowski and Ilkka MÃ¤kinen
Abstract: We introduce a new technique for dealing with the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian operator in loop quantum gravity, based on the use of intertwiners projected on coherent states of angular momentum. We give explicit expressions for the projections of intertwiners on the spin coherent states in terms of complex numbers describing the unit vectors which label the coherent states. Operators such as the Hamiltonian can then be reformulated as differential operators acting on polynomials of these complex numbers. This makes it possible to describe the action of the Hamiltonian geometrically, in terms of the unit vectors originating from the angular momentum coherent states, and opens up a way towards investigating the semiclassical limit of the dynamics via asymptotic approximation methods.
