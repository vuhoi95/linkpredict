Title: A no-go theorem for the $n$-twistor description of a massive particle
Authors: Satoshi Okano and Shinichi Deguchi
Abstract: It is proved that the $n$-twistor expression of a particle's four-momentum vector reduces, by a unitary transformation, to the two-twistor expression for a massive particle or the one-twistor expression for a massless particle. Therefore the genuine $n$-twistor description of a massive particle fails for the case $n\ge3$.
