Title: Gravitating vortices and the Einstein--Bogomol'nyi equations
Authors: Luis Álvarez-Cónsul and Mario Garcia-Fernandez and Oscar García-Prada
Abstract: In this paper we consider the gravitating vortex equations. These are equations coupling a metric over a compact Riemann surface with a hermitian metric over a holomorphic line bundle equipped with a fixed global section -- the Higgs field. These equations appear as dimensional reduction of the Kahler-Yang-Mills equations on a rank two vector bundle over the product of the complex projective line with the Riemann surface, and have a symplectic interpretation as moment map equations. As a particular case of the gravitating vortex equations on the complex projective line we find the Einstein-Bogomol'nyi equations, previously studied in the theory of cosmic strings in physics. Our main result in this paper is giving a converse to an existence theorem of Yisong Yang for the Einstein-Bogomol'nyi equations, establishing in this way a correspondence with Geometric Invariant Theory for these equations. In particular, we prove a conjecture by Yang about the non-existence of cosmic strings on the complex projective line superimposed at a single point.
