Title: Exact solution of the $D_3$ non-Abelian anyon chain
Authors: Natalia Braylovskaya and Peter E. Finch and Holger Frahm
Abstract: Commuting transfer matrices for linear chains of interacting non-Abelian anyons from the two-dimensional irreducible representation of the dihedral group $D_3$ (or, equivalently, the integer sector of the $su(2)_4$ spin-$1$ chain) are constructed using the spin-anyon correspondence to a $D_3$-symmetric formulation of the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain. The spectral problem is solved using discrete inversion identities satisfied by these transfer matrices and functional Bethe ansatz methods. The resulting spectrum can be related to that of the XXZ spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg chain with boundary conditions depending on the topological sector of the anyon chain. The properties of this model in the critical regime are studied by finite size analysis of the spectrum. In particular, points in the phase diagram where the anyon chain realizes some of the rational $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold theories are identified.
