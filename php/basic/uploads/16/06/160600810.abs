Title: Aspects of Superconformal Multiplets in D>4
Authors: Matthew Buican and Joseph Hayling and Constantinos Papageorgakis
Abstract: We explicitly construct and list all unitary superconformal multiplets, along with their index contributions, in five and six dimensions. From this data, we uncover various unifying themes in the representation theory of five- and six-dimensional superconformal field theories. At the same time, we provide a detailed argument for the complete classification of unitary irreducible representations in five dimensions using a combination of physical and mathematical techniques.
