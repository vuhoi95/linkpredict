Title: Quantum leaps of black holes: Magnifying glasses of quantum gravity
Authors: Sumanta Chakraborty and Kinjalk Lochan
Abstract: We show using simple arguments, that the conceptual triad of a {\it classical} black hole, semi-classical Hawking emission and geometry quantization is inherently, mutually incompatible. Presence of any two explicitly violates the third. We argue that geometry quantization, if realized in nature, magnifies the quantum gravity features hugely to catapult them into the realm of observational possibilities. We also explore a quantum route towards extremality of the black holes.
