Abstract: We present the $W_{1+\infty}$ $n$-algebra which satisfies the generalized Jacobi and Bremner identities for the $n$ even and odd cases, respectively. We note that the $W_{1+\infty}$ $2n$-algebra is the so-called generalized Lie algebra. Its remarkable property is that there exists the nontrivial sub-$2n$-algebra in which the structure constants are determined by the Vandermonde determinant. The central extension terms of the $W_{1+\infty}$ sub-$2n$-algebra are also presented. We investigate the $W_{1+\infty}$ $n$-algebra in the Landau problem. Furthermore we discuss the case of the many-body system in the lowest Landau level.
