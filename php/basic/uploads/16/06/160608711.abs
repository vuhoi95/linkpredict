Abstract: We present the numerical results of a simple matrix model that approximates $SU(N)$ pure Yang-Mills theory. The low-lying physical spectrum of the Hamiltonian is estimated by variational techniques of $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$. In both these cases, we find an excellent agreement with lattice simulations. However, in the matrix model, the computation is much simpler and faster.
