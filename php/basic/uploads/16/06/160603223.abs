Title: Heat Engines for Dilatonic Born-Infeld Black Holes
Authors: Chandrasekhar Bhamidipati and Pavan Kumar Yerra
Abstract: In the context of dilaton coupled Einstein gravity with negative cosmological constant and a Born-Infeld field, we study heat engines where charged black hole is the working substance and the mechanical work is done via the $pdV$ terms present in the first law of extended gravitational thermodynamics. Efficiency is analyzed as a function of dilaton and Born-Infeld couplings, and results compared with Einstein-Maxwell theory.
