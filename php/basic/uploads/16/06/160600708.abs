Title: A Mean-Field Description for AdS Black Hole
Authors: Suvankar Dutta and Sachin Shain P
Abstract: In this paper we find an equivalent mean-field description for asymptotically $AdS$ black hole in high temperature limit and in arbitrary dimensions. We obtain a class of mean-field potential for which the description is valid. We explicitly show that there is an one to one correspondence between the thermodynamics of a gas of interacting particles moving under a mean-field potential and an $AdS$ black hole, namely the equation of state, temperature, pressure, entropy and enthalpy of both the systems match. In $3+1$ dimensions, in particular, the mean-field description can be thought of as an ensemble of tiny interacting {\it asymptotically flat} black holes moving in volume $V$ and at temperature $T$. This motivates us to identify these asymptotically flat black holes as microstructure of asymptotically $AdS$ black holes in $3+1$ dimensions.
