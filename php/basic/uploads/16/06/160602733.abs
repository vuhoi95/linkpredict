Title: Dyonic (A)dS Black Holes in Einstein-Born-Infeld Theory in Diverse  Dimensions
Authors: Shoulong Li and H. Lu and Hao Wei
Abstract: We study Einstein-Born-Infeld gravity and construct the dyonic (A)dS planar black holes in general even dimensions, that carry both the electric charge and magnetic fluxes along the planar space. In four dimensions, the solution can be constructed with also spherical and hyperbolic topologies. We study the black hole thermodynamics and obtain the first law. We also classify the singularity structure.
