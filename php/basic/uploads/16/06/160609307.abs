Title: The rotation curve of a point particle in stringy gravity
Authors: Sung Moon Ko and Jeong-Hyuck Park and Minwoo Suh
Abstract: Double Field Theory may suggest to view the whole massless NS-NS sector as the gravitational unity. The doubled diffeomorphisms and the $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$ covariance determine unambiguously how the Standard Model as well as a relativistic point particle should couple to the NS-NS sector. The theory also refines the notion of singularity. We consider the most general, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat, static vacuum solution to ${D=4}$ Double Field Theory, which contains three free parameters and consequently generalizes the Schwarzschild geometry. Analyzing the circular geodesic of a point particle, we obtain the orbital velocity as a function of radius. The rotation curve generically features a maximum and thus non-Keplerian over a finite range, while becoming asymptotically Keplerian at infinity. The gravitational force can be even repulsive very close to the origin. By tuning the free parameters, we attempt to simulate quantitatively the observed rotation curve of galaxy. Though both the dark matter and the dark energy problems arise from far-distance observations (large physical radius, $R\rightarrow\infty$), it may allude to the short-distance nature of gravity, or Double Field Theory (small dimensionless radial variable, $R/{\cal M}_{\infty}G\rightarrow 0$).
