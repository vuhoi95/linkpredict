Title: New non-linear equations and modular form expansion for double-elliptic  Seiberg-Witten prepotential
Authors: G. Aminov and A. Mironov and A. Morozov
Abstract: Integrable N-particle systems have an important property that the associated Seiberg-Witten prepotentials satisfy the WDVV equations. However, this does not apply to the most interesting class of elliptic and double-elliptic systems. Studying the commutativity conjecture for theta-functions on the families of associated spectral curves, we derive some other non-linear equations for the perturbative Seiberg-Witten prepotential, which turn out to have exactly the double-elliptic system as their generic solution. In contrast with the WDVV equations, the new equations acquire non-perturbative corrections which are straightforwardly deducible from the commutativity conditions. We obtain such corrections in the first non-trivial case of N=3 and describe the structure of non-perturbative solutions as expansions in powers of the flat moduli with coefficients that are (quasi)modular forms of the elliptic parameter.
