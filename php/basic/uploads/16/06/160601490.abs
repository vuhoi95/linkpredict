Title: A Quantized Spacetime Based on $Spin(3,1)$ Symmetry
Authors: Pisin Chen and Hsu-Wen Chiang and Yao-Chieh Hu
Abstract: We introduce a new type of the spacetime quantization based on the spinorial description suggested by loop quantum gravity. Specifically, we build our theory on a string theory inspired $Spin(3,1)$ worldsheet action. Because of its connection with quantum gravity theories, our proposal may in principle link back to string theory, connect to loop quantum gravity where $SU(2)$ is suggested as the fundamental symmetry, or serve as a Lorentzian spin network. We derive the generalized uncertainty principle and demonstrate the holographic nature of our theory. Due to the quantization of spacetime, geodesics in our theory are fuzzy, but the fuzziness is shown to be much below conceivable astrophysical bounds.
