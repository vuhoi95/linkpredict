Title: Axodraw Version 2
Authors: John C. Collins and J. A. M. Vermaseren
Abstract: We present version two of the Latex graphical style file Axodraw. It has a number of new drawing primitives and many extra options, and it can now work with \program{pdflatex} to directly produce output in PDF file format (but with the aid of an auxiliary program).
