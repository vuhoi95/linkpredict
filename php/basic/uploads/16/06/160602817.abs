Title: On SUSY Restoration in Single-Superfield Inflationary Models of  Supergravity
Authors: Sergei V. Ketov and Takahiro Terada
Abstract: We study the conditions of restoring supersymmetry (SUSY) after inflation in the supergravity-based cosmological models with a single chiral superfield and a quartic stabilization term in the K\"ahler potential. Some new, explicit, and viable inflationary models satisfying those conditions are found. The inflaton's scalar superpartner is dynamically stabilized during and after inflation. We also demonstrate a possibility of having small and adjustable SUSY breaking with a tiny cosmological constant.
