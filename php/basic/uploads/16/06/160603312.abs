Authors: Carmelo P. Martin and Josip Trampetic and Jiangyang You
Abstract: The equivalence of the noncommutative U(N) quantum field theories related by the theta-exact Seiberg-Witten maps is in this letter proven to all orders in the perturbation theory with respect to the coupling constant. We show that this duality holds for Super Yang-Mills theories with N=0,1,2,4 supersymmetry. A direct check of this equivalence relation is performed by computing the one-loop quantum corrections to the quadratic part of the effective action in the noncommutative U(1) gauge theory with N=0,1,2,4 supersymmetry.
