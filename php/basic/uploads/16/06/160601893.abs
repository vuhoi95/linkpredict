Title: Particle-Vortex Duality from 3d Bosonization
Authors: Andreas Karch and David Tong
Abstract: We provide a simple derivation of particle-vortex duality in d=2+1 dimensions. Our starting point is a relativistic form of flux attachment, designed to transmute the statistics of particles. From this seed, we derive a web of new dualities. These include particle-vortex duality for bosons as well as the recently discovered counterpart for fermions.
