Title: On uniqueness of T-duality with spectators
Authors: Ladislav Hlavaty and Filip Petrasek
Abstract: We investigate the dependence of nonabelian T-duality on various identification of the group of target space isometries of nonlinear sigma models with its orbits, i.e. with respect to the location of the group unit on manifolds invariant under the isometry group. We show that T-duals constructed by isometry groups of dimension less than the dimension of the (pseudo)riemannian manifold may depend not only on the initial metric but also on the choice of manifolds defining positions of group units on each of the submanifold invariant under the isometry group. We investigate whether this dependence can be compensated by coordinate transformation.
