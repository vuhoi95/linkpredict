Title: Particle-vortex duality in topological insulators and superconductors
Authors: Jeff Murugan and Horatiu Nastase
Abstract: We investigate the origins and implications of the duality between topological insulators and topological superconductors in three and four spacetime dimensions. In the latter, the duality transformation can be made at the level of the path integral in the standard way, while in three dimensions, it takes the form of "self-duality in odd dimensions". In this sense, it is closely related to the particle-vortex duality of planar systems. In particular, we use this to elaborate on Son's conjecture that a three dimensional Dirac fermion that can be thought of as the surface mode of a four dimensional topological insulator is dual to a composite fermion.
