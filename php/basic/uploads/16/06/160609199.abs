Title: Inflation Model Selection meets Dark Radiation
Authors: Thomas Tram and Robert Vallance and Vincent Vennin
Abstract: We investigate how inflation model selection is affected by the presence of additional free-streaming relativistic degrees of freedom, i.e. dark radiation. We perform a full Bayesian analysis of both inflation parameters and cosmological parameters taking reheating into account self-consistently. We compute the Bayesian evidence for a few representative inflation scenarios in both the standard $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ model and an extension including dark radiation parametrised by its effective number of relativistic species $N_\mathrm{eff}$. We find that the observational status of most inflationary models is unchanged, with the exception of potentials such as power-law inflation that predict a value for the scalar spectral index that is too large in $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ but which can be accommodated when $N_\mathrm{eff}$ is allowed to vary. In this case, cosmic microwave background data indicate that power-law inflation is one of the best models together with plateau potentials. However, contrary to plateau potentials, power-law inflation predicts a value for the present Hubble rate $H_0=73.6\pm 0.95\, \text{km}/\text{sec}/\text{Mpc}$ in perfect agreement with local measurements.
