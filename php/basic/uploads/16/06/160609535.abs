Title: Thermal width of heavy quarkonia from an AdS/QCD model
Authors: Nelson R. F. Braga and Luiz F. Ferreira
Abstract: We estimate the thermal width of a heavy quark anti-quark pair inside a strongly coupled plasma using a holographic AdS/QCD model. The imaginary part of the quark potential that produces the thermal width appears in the gravity dual from quantum fluctuations of the string world sheet in the vicinity of the horizon. The results, obtained using a soft wall background that involves an infrared mass scale, are consistent with previous analisys where the mass scale was introduced by averaging over quark anti-quark states.
