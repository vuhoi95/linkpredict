Title: Superconformal minimal models and admissible Jack polynomials
Authors: Olivier Blondeau-Fournier and Pierre Mathieu and David Ridout and Simon Wood
Abstract: We give new proofs of the rationality of the N=1 superconformal minimal model vertex operator superalgebras and of the classification of their modules in both the Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond sectors. For this, we combine the standard free field realisation with the theory of Jack symmetric functions. A key role is played by Jack symmetric polynomials with a certain negative parameter that are labelled by admissible partitions. These polynomials are shown to describe free fermion correlators, suitably dressed by a symmetrising factor. The classification proofs concentrate on explicitly identifying Zhu's algebra and its twisted analogue. Interestingly, these identifications do not use an explicit expression for the non-trivial vacuum singular vector. While the latter is known to be expressible in terms of an Uglov symmetric polynomial or a linear combination of Jack superpolynomials, it turns out that standard Jack polynomials (and functions) suffice to prove the classification.
