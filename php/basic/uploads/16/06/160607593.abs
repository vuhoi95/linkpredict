Title: Relations and representations of QCD amplitudes
Authors: Leonardo de la Cruz and Alexander Kniss and Stefan Weinzierl
Abstract: In this talk we review relations and representations of primitive QCD tree amplitudes. Topics covered include the BCJ relations, the CHY representation, and the KLT relations. We will put a special emphasis on how these relations and representations generalise from pure Yang-Mills theory to QCD. The generalisation of the KLT relations from pure Yang-Mills to QCD includes the case of massive quarks. On the gravity side we then obtain hypothetical particles interacting with gravitational strength, which can be massive and non-relativistic.
