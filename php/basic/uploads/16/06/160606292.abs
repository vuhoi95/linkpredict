Title: The equivalence principle and QFT: Can a particle detector tell if we  live inside a hollow shell?
Authors: Keith K. Ng and Robert B. Mann and Eduardo Martin-Martinez
Abstract: We show that a particle detector can distinguish the interior of a hollow shell from flat space for switching times much shorter than the light-crossing time of the shell, even though the local metrics are indistinguishable. This shows that a particle detector can read out information about the non-local structure of spacetime even when switched on for scales much shorter than the characteristic scale of the non-locality.
