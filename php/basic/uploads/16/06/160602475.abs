Abstract: In this paper we give an explicit construction of unfolded equations for massive higher spin supermultiplets of the minimal (1,0) supersymmetry in AdS_3 space. For that purpose we use an unfolded formulation for massive bosonic and fermionic higher spins and find supertransformations leaving appropriate set of unfolded equations invariant. We provide two general supermultiplets (s, s+1/2) and (s, s-1/2) with arbitrary integer s, as well as a number of lower spin examples.
