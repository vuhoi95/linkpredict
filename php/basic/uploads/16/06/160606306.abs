Abstract: Detailed studies of four dimensional N=2 superconformal field theories (SCFT) defined by isolated complete intersection singularities are performed: we compute the Coulomb branch spectrum, Seiberg-Witten solutions and central charges. Most of our theories have exactly marginal deformations and we identify the weakly coupled gauge theory descriptions for many of them, which involve (affine) D and E shaped quiver gauge theories and theories formed from Argyres-Douglas matters. These investigations provide strong evidence for the singularity approach in classifying 4d N=2 SCFTs.
