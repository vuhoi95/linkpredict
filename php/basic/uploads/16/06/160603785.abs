Title: Localization of scalar massless excitations in self-gravitating $SO(10)$  kinks
Authors: Rafael Chavez and Rommel Guerrero and R. Omar Rodriguez
Abstract: Three self-gravitating $SO(10)$ kinks inducing asymptotically the breaking pattern $SO(10)\rightarrow SU(5)$ are determined which can be distinguished, among other features, by the unbroken group on each of them: $SO(10)$ for the first kink and $SO(6)\times SU(2)\times U(1)/Z_2$ and $SU(4)\times SO(2)\times U(1)/Z_4$ for the second and third configuration respectively. The perturbative stability of the scenarios is also evaluated; in particular, the metric fluctuations are parameterized in terms of tensor, vector and scalar modes. All these modes as well as the scalar field excitations are rewritten as gauge-invariant variables. With regarding the tensor and vector fluctuations, for a four-dimensional observer, the standard results are obtained, while the massless graviton is localized on the wall the graviphotons propagate freely in the bulk. On the other hand, for the scalar excitations in correspondence with the symmetry obtained inside each kink, both along the broken generators and along the some unbroken generators, normalizable zero modes in the four-dimensional sector of the scenarios are found.
