Title: Phase transition in extended thermodynamic phase space and charged  Horava-Lifshitz black holes
Authors: Mohammad Bagher Jahani Poshteh and Nematollah Riazi
Abstract: For charged black holes in Horava-Lifshitz gravity, it is shown that a second order phase transition takes place in extended phase space. We study the behavior of specific heat and free energy at the point of transition in canonical and grand canonical ensembles and show that the black hole falls into a state which is locally and globally stable. We relate the second order nature of phase transition to the fact that the phase transition occurs at a sharp temperature and not over a temperature interval. By taking cosmological constant as thermodynamic pressure for charged black holes, we extend Ehrenfest's equations. We obtain nine equations and show that, all of them are satisfied at the point in which the specific heat diverges. We also apply geometrothermodynamics to extended phase space and show that the scalar curvature of Quevedo metric diverges at the point at which the second order phase transition takes place.
