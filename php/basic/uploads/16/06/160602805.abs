Abstract: In this paper we construct a special class of four dimensional axissymmetric stationary spacetimes whose Ricci scalar is constant in the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. The first step is to construct Einstein metric by solving a modified Ernst equation for nonzero cosmological constant. Then, we modify the previous result by adding two additional functions to the metric to obtain a more general metric of constant scalar curvature which are not Einstein.
