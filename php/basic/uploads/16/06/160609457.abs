Title: The sunrise integral and elliptic polylogarithms
Authors: Luise Adams and Christian Bogner and Stefan Weinzierl
Abstract: We summarize recent computations with a class of elliptic generalizations of polylogarithms, arising from the massive sunrise integral. For the case of arbitrary masses we obtain results in two and four space-time dimensions. The iterated integral structure of our functions allows us to furthermore compute the equal mass case to arbitrary order.
