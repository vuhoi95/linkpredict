Title: Eikonal model analysis of elastic hadron collisions at high energies
Authors: Jiri Prochazka and Vojtech Kundrat
Abstract: Elastic collisions of protons at different energies represent main background in studying the structure of fundamental particles at the present. On the basis of standardly used model proposed by West and Yennie the protons have been then interpreted as transparent objects; elastic events have been interpreted as more central than inelastic ones. It will be shown that using eikonal model the protons may be interpreted in agreement with usual ontological conception; elastic processes being more peripheral than inelastic ones. The corresponding results (differing fundamentally from those of WY model) will be presented by analyzing the most ample elastic data set measured at ISR energy of 53 GeV. Detailed analysis of measured differential cross section will be performed and different alternatives of peripheral behavior on the basis of eikonal model will be presented. The impact of recently established electromagnetic form factors on determination of quantities specifying hadron interaction determined from the fits of experimental elastic data will be discussed. The influence of some assumptions on proton characteristics derived from elastic hadronic amplitude determined on the basis of experimental data will be mentioned, too.
