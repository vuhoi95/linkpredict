Abstract: We show that if the {\alpha}-attractor model is realized by the spontaneous breaking of the scale symmetry, then the stability and the dynamics of the vector field that gauges the scale symmetry severely constrains the {\alpha}-parameter as 5/6 < {\alpha} < 1, restricting the inflationary predictions in a very tiny region in the n_s vs r plane that are in great agreement with the latest Planck data. Although the different values of {\alpha} do not make a tangible difference for n_s and r, they provide radically different scenarios for the post-inflationary dynamics which determines the standard BBN processes and the large scale isotropy of the universe.
