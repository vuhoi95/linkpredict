Authors: Richard A. Davison and Sašo Grozdanov and Stefan Janiszewski and Matthias Kaminski
Abstract: We study the linearized transport of transverse momentum and charge in a conjectured field theory dual to a black brane solution of Ho\v{r}ava gravity with Lifshitz exponent $z=1$. As expected from general hydrodynamic reasoning, we find that both of these quantities are diffusive over distance and time scales larger than the inverse temperature. We compute the diffusion constants and conductivities of transverse momentum and charge, as well the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density, and find that they differ from their relativistic counterparts. To derive these results, we propose how the holographic dictionary should be modified to deal with the multiple horizons and differing propagation speeds of bulk excitations in Ho\v{r}ava gravity. When possible, as a check on our methods and results, we use the covariant Einstein-Aether formulation of Ho\v{r}ava gravity, along with field redefinitions, to re-derive our results from a relativistic bulk theory.
