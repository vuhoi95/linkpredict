Title: The Weak Gravity Conjecture in three dimensions
Authors: Miguel Montero and Gary Shiu and Pablo Soler
Abstract: We study weakly coupled $U(1)$ theories in $AdS_3$, their associated charged BTZ solutions, and their charged spectra. We find that modular invariance of the holographic dual two-dimensional CFT and compactness of the gauge group together imply the existence of charged operators with conformal dimension significantly below the black hole threshold. We regard this as a form of the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) in three dimensions. We also explore the constraints posed by modular invariance on a particular discrete $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry which arises in our discussion. In this case, modular invariance does not guarantee the existence of light $\mathbb{Z}_N$-charged states. We also highlight the differences between our discussion and the usual heuristic arguments for the WGC based on black hole remnants.
