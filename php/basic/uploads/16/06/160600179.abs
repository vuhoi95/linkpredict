Title: Exact partition functions for the $Î©$-deformed $\mathcal N=2^{*}$  $SU(2)$ gauge theory
Authors: Matteo Beccaria and Guido Macorini
Abstract: We study the low energy effective action of the $\Omega$-deformed $\mathcal N =2^{*}$ $SU(2) $ gauge theory. It depends on the deformation parameters $\epsilon_{1},\epsilon_{2}$, the scalar field expectation value $a$, and the hypermultiplet mass $m$. We explore the plane $(\frac{m}{\epsilon_{1}}, \frac{\epsilon_{2}}{\epsilon_{1}})$ looking for special features in the multi-instanton contributions to the prepotential, motivated by what happens in the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit $\epsilon_{2}\to 0$. We propose a simple condition on the structure of poles of the $k$-instanton prepotential and show that it is admissible at a finite set of points in the above plane. At these special points, the prepotential has poles at fixed positions independent on the instanton number. Besides and remarkably, both the instanton partition function and the full prepotential, including the perturbative contribution, may be given in closed form as functions of the scalar expectation value $a$ and the modular parameter $q$ appearing in special combinations of Eisenstein series and Dedekind $\eta$ function. As a byproduct, the modular anomaly equation can be tested at all orders at these points. We discuss these special features from the point of view of the AGT correspondence and provide explicit toroidal 1-blocks in non-trivial closed form. The full list of solutions with 1, 2, 3, and 4 poles is determined and described in details.
