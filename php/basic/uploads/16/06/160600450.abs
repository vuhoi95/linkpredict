Title: Dynamical Vacuum against a rigid Cosmological Constant
Authors: Joan Sola and Javier de Cruz Perez and Adria Gomez-Valent and Rafael C. Nunes
Abstract: When we are approaching the centenary of the introduction of the cosmological constant, $\Lambda$, by Einstein in his gravitational field equations, and after about two decades of the first observational papers confirming the existence of a non-vanishing, positive, $\Lambda$ as the most likely explanation for the observed acceleration of the Universe, we are still facing the question whether $\Lambda$ is truly a fundamental constant of Nature or a mildly evolving dynamical variable. In this work, we compare a triad of dynamical vacuum models (DVM's) in interaction with matter. By performing an overall fit to the $SNIa+BAO+H(z)+LSS+CMB$ cosmological data, we find that the three DVM's are significantly more favored than the $\Lambda$CDM. Compared to the best DVM (the running vacuum model) the option $\Lambda=$const is excluded at $\sim 4\sigma$ c.l. This conclusion is strongly supported by Akaike and Bayesian criteria, both rendering more than 25 points of difference against a rigid $\Lambda$.
