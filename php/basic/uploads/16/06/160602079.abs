Title: Black holes and quantum theory on manifolds with singular potentials
Authors: T R Govindarajan and J. M. Munoz-Castaneda
Abstract: Quantum theory on manifolds with boundaries have been studied extensively through von Neumann analysis of self adjoint operators. We approach the issues through introduction of singular $\delta$ and $\delta'$ potentials. The advantages of this are pointed out as a model for black hole and in several other examples.
