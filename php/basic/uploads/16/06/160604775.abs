Title: Mapping spaces and automorphism groups of toric noncommutative spaces
Authors: Gwendolyn E. Barnes and Alexander Schenkel and Richard J. Szabo
Abstract: We develop a sheaf theory approach to toric noncommutative geometry which allows us to formalize the concept of mapping spaces between two toric noncommutative spaces. As an application we study the `internalized' automorphism group of a toric noncommutative space and show that its Lie algebra has an elementary description in terms of braided derivations.
