Title: Scale-invariance of parity-invariant three-dimensional QED
Authors: Nikhil Karthik and Rajamani Narayanan
Abstract: We present numerical evidences using overlap fermions for a scale-invariant behavior of parity-invariant three-dimensional QED with two flavors of massless two-component fermions. Using finite-size scaling of the low-lying eigenvalues of the massless anti-Hermitian overlap Dirac operator, we rule out the presence of bilinear condensate and estimate the mass anomalous dimension. The eigenvectors associated with these low-lying eigenvalues suggest critical behavior in the sense of a metal-insulator transition. We show that there is no mass gap in the scalar and vector correlators in the infinite volume theory. The vector correlator does not acquire an anomalous dimension. The anomalous dimension associated with the long-distance behavior of the scalar correlator is consistent with the mass anomalous dimension.
