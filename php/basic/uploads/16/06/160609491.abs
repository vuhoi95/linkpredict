Abstract: In this paper, we study some aspects of energy loss in non-relativistic theories from holography. We analyze the energy lost by a rotating heavy point particle along a circle of radius $l$ with angular velocity $\omega$ in theories with general dynamical exponent $z$ and hyperscaling violation exponent $\theta$. It is shown that this problem provides a novel perspective on the energy loss in such theories. A general computation at zero and finite temperature is done and it is shown that how the total energy loss rate depends non-trivially on two characteristic exponents $(z,\theta)$. We find that at zero temperature there is a special radius $l_c$ where the energy loss is independent of different values of $(\theta,z)$. Also at zero temperature, there is a crossover between a regime in which the energy loss is dominated by the linear drag force and by the radiation because of the acceleration of the rotating particle. We find that the energy loss of the particle decreases by increasing $\theta$ and $z$. We note that, unlike in the zero temperature, there is no special radius $l_c$ at finite temperature case.
