Title: Evolution of spherical domain walls in solitonic symmetron models

Abstract: In this work, inspired by the symmetron model, we analyse the evolution of spherical domain walls by considering specific potentials that ensure symmetry breaking and the occurrence of degenerate vacua that are necessary for the formation of domain walls. By considering a simple analytical model of spherical domain wall collapse, in vacuum, it is shown that this model fits the more accurate numerical results very well until full collapse, after which oscillations and scalar radiation take place. Furthermore, we explore the effect of a central non-relativistic matter lump on the evolution of a spherical domain wall and show that the central lump can prevent the full collapse and annihilation of the domain wall bubble, due to the repulsion between the domain wall and matter over-density within the adopted symmetron inspired model.
