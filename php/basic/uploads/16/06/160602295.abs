Title: Aspects of Galileon Non-Renormalization
Authors: Garrett Goon and Kurt Hinterbichler and Austin Joyce and Mark Trodden
Abstract: We discuss non-renormalization theorems applying to galileon field theories and their generalizations. Galileon theories are similar in many respects to other derivatively coupled effective field theories, including general relativity and $P(X)$ theories. In particular, these other theories also enjoy versions of non-renormalization theorems that protect certain operators against corrections from self-loops. However, we argue that the galileons are distinguished by the fact that they are not renormalized even by loops of other heavy fields whose couplings respect the galileon symmetry.
