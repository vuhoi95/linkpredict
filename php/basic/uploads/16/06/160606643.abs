Title: Supersymmetric black lenses in five dimensions
Authors: Shinya Tomizawa and Masato Nozawa
Abstract: We present an asymptotically flat supersymmetric black lens solution with the horizon topology L(n,1)=S^3/Z_n in the five-dimensional minimal ungauged supergravity. We show that the black lens carries a mass, two independent angular momenta, electric charge and (n-1) magnetic fluxes, among which only the (n+1) quantities are independent.
