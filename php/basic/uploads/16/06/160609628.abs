Title: Tensionless Superstrings: View from the Worldsheet
Authors: Arjun Bagchi and Shankhadeep Chakrabortty and Pulastya Parekh
Abstract: In this brief note, we show that the residual symmetries that arise in the analysis of the tensionless superstrings in the equivalent of the conformal gauge is (a trivial extension of) the recently discovered 3d Super Bondi-Metzner-Sachs algebra, discussed in the context of asymptotic symmetries of 3d Supergravity in flat-spacetimes. This helps us uncover a limiting approach to the construction of the tensionless superstring from the point of view of the worldsheet, analogous to the one we had adopted earlier for the closed tensionless bosonic string.
