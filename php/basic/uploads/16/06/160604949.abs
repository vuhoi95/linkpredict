Title: New Insights into Properties of Large-N Holographic Thermal QCD at  Finite Gauge Coupling at (the Non-Conformal/Next-to) Leading Order in N
Authors: Karunava Sil and Aalok Misra
Abstract: In the context of [1]'s string theoretic dual of large-N thermal QCD-like theories at finite gauge/string coupling (as part of the `MQGP' limit of [2]), we discuss the following. First, up to LO in N, using the results of [3], we show that the local T^3 of [2] is the T^2-invariant sLag of [3] in a resolved conifold. This, together with the results of [4], shows that for a (predominantly resolved or deformed) resolved warped deformed conifold, the local T^3 of [2] in the MQGP limit, is the T^2-invariant sLag of [3] justifying the construction of the delocalized SYZ type IIA mirror of the type IIB background of [1]. Then, using the prescription of [5], we obtain the temperature dependence of the thermal (and electrical) conductivity working up to leading order in N (the number of D3-branes), and upon comparison with [6] show that the results mimic a 1+1-dimensional Luttinger liquid with impurities. Further, including sub-leading non-conformal terms in the metric determined by M (the number of fractional D-branes = the number of colors = 3 in the IR after the end of a Seiberg duality cascade), by looking at respectively the scalar, vector and tensor modes of metric perturbations and using [7]'s prescription of constructing appropriate gauge-invariant perturbations, we obtain respectively the speed of sound, the diffusion constant and the shear viscosity \eta (and \eta/s) including the non-conformal O((g_s M^2) (g_s N_f)/N<<1)-corrections, N_f being the number of flavor D7-branes.
