Title: Basic hypergeometry of supersymmetric dualities
Authors: Ilmar Gahramanov and Hjalmar Rosengren
Abstract: We introduce several new identities combining basic hypergeometric sums and integrals. Such identities appear in the context of superconformal index computations for three-dimensional supersymmetric dual theories. We give both analytic proofs and physical interpretations of the presented identities.
