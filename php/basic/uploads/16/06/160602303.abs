Title: Grand Unification without Proton Decay
Authors: Andreas MÃ¼tter and Michael Ratz and Patrick K. S. Vaudrevange
Abstract: It is commonly believed that grand unified theories (GUTs) predict proton decay. This is because the exchange of extra GUT gauge bosons gives rise to dimension 6 proton decay operators. We show that there exists a class of GUTs in which these operators are absent. Many string and supergravity models in the literature belong to this class.
