Abstract: The di-photon excess observed at the LHC can be explained as a Standard Model singlet that is produced and decays by heavy vector-like colour triplets and electroweak doublets in one-loop diagrams. The characteristics of the required spectrum are well motivated in heterotic-string constructions that allow for a light $Z^\prime$. Anomaly cancellation of the $U(1)_{Z^\prime}$ symmetry requires the existence of the Standard Model singlet and vector-like states in the vicinity of the $U(1)_{Z^\prime}$ breaking scale. In this paper we show that the agreement with the gauge coupling data at one-loop is identical to the case of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, owing to cancellations between the additional states. We further show that effects arising from heavy thresholds may push the supersymmetric spectrum beyond the reach of the LHC, while maintaining the agreement with the gauge coupling data. We show that the string inspired model can indeed account for the observed signal and discuss the feasibility of obtaining viable scalar mass spectrum.
