Authors: Mustafa Dernek and Semra Gurtas and Yusuf Sucu and Nuri Unal
Abstract: In the study, we introduce a relativistic quantum mechanical wave equation of the spin-1 particle as an excited state of the zitterbewegung and show that it is consistent with the 2+1 dimensional Proca theory. At the same time, we see that this equation has two eigenstates, particle and antiparticle states or negative and positive energy eigenstates, respectively, in the rest frame and the spin-1 matrices satisfy $SO(2,1)$ spin algebra. As practical applications, we derive the exact solutions of the equation in the presence of a constant magnetic field and a curved spacetime. From these solutions, we construct the current components of the spin-1 particle.
