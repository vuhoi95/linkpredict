Authors: Z. Yousaf and Kazuharu Bamba and M. Zaeem ul Haq Bhatti
Abstract: We investigate irregularity factors for a self-gravitating spherical star evolving in the presence of imperfect fluid. We explore the gravitational field equations and the dynamical equations with the systematic construction in $f(R,T)$ gravity, where $T$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. Furthermore, we analyze two well-known differential equations (which occupy principal importance in the exploration of causes of energy density inhomogeneities) with the help of the Weyl tensor and the conservation laws. The irregularity factors for a spherical star are examined for particular cases of dust, isotropic and anisotropic fluids in dissipative and non-dissipative regimes in the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity. It is found that as the complexity in the matter with the anisotropic stresses increases, the inhomogeneity factor has more correspondences to one of the structure scalars.
