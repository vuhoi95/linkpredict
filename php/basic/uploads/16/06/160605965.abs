Title: How the Dark Energy Can Reconcile \textit{Planck} with Local  Determination of the Hubble Constant
Authors: Qing-Guo Huang and Ke Wang
Abstract: We try to reconcile the tension between the local 2.4\% determination of Hubble constant and its global determination by $\textit{Planck}$ CMB data and BAO data through modeling the dark energy variously. We find that the chi-square is significantly reduced by $\Delta\chi^2_\text{all}=-6.76$ in the redshift-binned dark energy model where the $68\%$ limits of the equation of state of dark energy read $w(0\leq z\leq 0.1)=-1.958_{-0.508}^{+0.509}$, $w(0.1< z\leq 1.5)=-1.006_{-0.082}^{+0.092}$, and here $w(z>1.5)$ is fixed to $-1$.
