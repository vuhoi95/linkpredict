Title: Ho≈ôava-Lifshitz gravity inspired Bianchi-II cosmology
Authors: Leonardo Giani and Alexander Yu. Kamenshchik
Abstract: We study different aspects of the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz inspired Bianchi-II cosmology. First, we present exact solutions for a toy model, where only the cubic in spatial curvature terms are present in the action; then we briefly discuss some exotic singularities, which can appear in this toy model, finally, we analyse qualitatively the equations of motion for a more complicated model, where different powers of the spatial curvature terms are present. Generally, our analysis gives some arguments in favour of existence of an oscillatory approach to the singularity in the universe governed by the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz type gravity.
