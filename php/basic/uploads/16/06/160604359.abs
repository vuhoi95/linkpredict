Title: New observational constraints on f(T) gravity from cosmic chronometers
Authors: Rafael C. Nunes and Supriya Pan and Emmanuel N. Saridakis
Abstract: We use the local value of the Hubble constant recently measured with 2.4% precision, as well as the latest compilation of cosmic chronometers data, together with standard probes such as Supernovae Type Ia and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation distance measurements, in order to impose constraints on the viable and most used f(T) gravity models, where T is the torsion scalar in teleparallel gravity. In particular, we consider three f(T) models with two parameters, out of which one is independent, and we quantify their deviation from $\Lambda$CDM cosmology through a sole parameter. Our analysis reveals that for one of the models a small but non-zero deviation from $\Lambda$CDM cosmology is slightly favored, while for the other models the best fit is very close to $\Lambda$CDM scenario. Clearly, f(T) gravity is consistent with observations, and it can serve as a candidate for modified gravity.
