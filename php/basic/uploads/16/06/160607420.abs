Title: On Calabi-Yau generalized complete intersections from Hirzebruch  varieties and novel K3-fibrations
Authors: Per Berglund and Tristan Hubsch
Abstract: We consider the construction of Calabi-Yau varieties recently generalized to where the defining equations may have negative degrees over some projective space factors in the embedding space. Within such "generalized complete intersection" Calabi-Yau ("gCICY") three-folds, we find several sequences of distinct manifolds. These include both novel elliptic and K3-fibrations and involve Hirzebruch surfaces and their higher dimensional analogues. En route, we generalize the standard techniques of cohomology computation to these generalized complete intersection Calabi-Yau varieties.
