Title: Kantowski-Sachs Einstein-Ã¦ther perfect fluid models
Authors: Joey Latta and Genly Leon and Andronikos Paliathanasis
Abstract: We investigate Kantowski-Sachs models in Einstein-{\ae}ther theory with a perfect fluid source using the singularity analysis to prove the integrability of the field equations and dynamical system tools to study the evolution. We find an inflationary source at early times, and an inflationary sink at late times, for a wide region in the parameter space. The results by A. A. Coley, G. Leon, P. Sandin and J. Latta (JCAP 12, 010, 2015), are then re-obtained as particular cases. Additionally, we select other values for the non-GR parameters which are consistent with current constraints, getting a very rich phenomenology. In particular, we find solutions with infinite shear, zero curvature, and infinite matter energy density in comparison with the Hubble scalar. We also have stiff-like future attractors, anisotropic late-time attractors, or both, in some special cases. Such results are developed analytically, and then verified by numerics. Finally, the physical interpretation of the new critical points is discussed.
