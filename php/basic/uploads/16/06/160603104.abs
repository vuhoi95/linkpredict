Title: First Sound in Holographic Superfluids at Zero Temperature
Authors: Angelo Esposito and Sebastian Garcia-Saenz and Riccardo Penco
Abstract: Within the context of AdS/CFT, the gravity dual of an s-wave superfluid is given by scalar QED on an asymptotically AdS spacetime. While this conclusion is vastly supported by numerical arguments, here we provide an analytical proof that this is indeed the case. Working at zero temperature, we explicitly find the quadratic action for the superfluid phonon at the boundary in an arbitrary number of dimensions and for an arbitrary scalar field potential, recovering the known dispersion relation for conformal first sound.
