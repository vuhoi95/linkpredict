Title: String Theory Origin of Constrained Multiplets
Authors: Renata Kallosh and Bert Vercnocke and Timm Wrase
Abstract: We study the non-linearly realized spontaneously broken supersymmetry of the (anti-)D3-brane action in type IIB string theory. The worldvolume fields are one vector $A_\mu$, three complex scalars $\phi^i$ and four 4d fermions $\lambda^0$, $\lambda^i$. These transform, in addition to the more familiar N=4 linear supersymmetry, also under 16 spontaneously broken, non-linearly realized supersymmetries. We argue that the worldvolume fields can be packaged into the following constrained 4d non-linear N=1 multiplets: four chiral multiplets $S$, $Y^i$ that satisfy $S^2=SY^i=0$ and contain the worldvolume fermions $\lambda^0$ and $\lambda^i$; and four chiral multiplets $W_\alpha$, $H^i$ that satisfy $S W_\alpha=0$ and $S \bar D_{\dot \alpha} \bar H^{\bar \imath}=0$ and contain the vector $A_\mu$ and the scalars $\phi^i$. We also discuss how placing an anti-D3-brane on top of intersecting O7-planes can lead to an orthogonal multiplet $\Phi$ that satisfies $S(\Phi-\bar \Phi)=0$, which is particularly interesting for inflationary cosmology.
