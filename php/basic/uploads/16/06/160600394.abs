Title: Supergravity background of the lambda-deformed AdS_3 x S^3 supercoset
Authors: Yuri Chervonyi and Oleg Lunin
Abstract: We construct the solution of type IIB supergravity describing the integrable lambda-deformation of the AdS_3 x S^3 supercoset. While the geometry corresponding to the deformation of the bosonic coset has been found in the past, our background is more natural for studying superstrings, and several interesting features distinguish our solution from its bosonic counterpart. We also report progress towards constructing the lambda-deformation of the AdS_5 x S^5 supercoset.
