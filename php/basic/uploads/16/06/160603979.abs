Title: On three-dimensional trace anomaly from holographic local RG
Authors: Ken Kikuchi and Hiroto Hosoda and Akihiro Suzuki
Abstract: Odd-dimensional quantum field theories (QFTs) can have nonzero trace anomalies if external fields are introduced and some ingredients needed to make Lorentz scalars with appropriate mass dimensions (or weights) are supplied. We have studied a three-dimensional QFT and explicitly computed the trace of the stress tensor using the holographic local renormalization group (RG). We have checked some properties of vector beta functions and the Wess-Zumino consistency condition, however, found the anomalies vanish on fixed points. We clarify what is responsible for the vanishing trace anomalies.
