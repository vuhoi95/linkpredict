Title: Quasi-normal Frequencies in Schwarzschild space-time to Arbitrary Order  for Large Overtone Number
Authors: Marc Casals and Adrian C. Ottewill
Abstract: We analytically investigate the spin-1 quasinormal mode frequencies of Schwarzschild black hole space-time. We formally determine these frequencies to arbitrary order as an expansion for large imaginary part (i.e., large-n, where n is the overtone number). As an example of the practicality of this formal procedure, we analytically calculate the explicit frequencies up to order $n^{-5/2}$.
