Title: On exact solution of topological CFT models based on Kazama-Suzuki  cosets
Authors: Alexander Belavin and Vladimir Belavin
Abstract: We compute the flat coordinates on the Frobenius manifolds arising on the deformation space of Gepner $\hat{SU}(3)_k$ chiral rings. The explicit form of the flat coordinates is important for exact solutions of models of topological CFT and 2d Liouville gravity. We describe the case k=3, which is of particular interest because apart from the relevant chiral fields it contains a marginal one. Whereas marginal perturbations are relevant in different contexts, their analysis requires additional care compared to the relevant perturbations.
