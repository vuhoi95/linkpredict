Title: Constraints on rainbow gravity functions from black hole thermodynamics
Authors: Sunandan Gangopadhyay and Abhijit Dutta
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of black holes in the framework of rainbow gravity. By considering rainbow functions in the metric of Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black holes, remnant and critical masses are found to exist. Demanding the universality of logarithmic corrections to the semi-classical area law for the entropy leads to constraining the form of the rainbow functions. The mass output and the radiation rate for these constrained form of rainbow functions have been computed for different values of the rainbow parameter $\eta$ and have striking similarity to those derived from the generalized uncertainty principle.
