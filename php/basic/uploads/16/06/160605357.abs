Title: Chirality and Circular Polarization in Models of Inflation
Authors: Stephon Alexander and Sam Cormack and Robert Sims
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that a chiral asymmetry during inflation can manifest as net circular polarization in photons. Using an example known to produce a helicity imbalance in fermions, we show that superhorizon photon modes produced during inflation acquire net circular polarization. Modes that reenter the horizon around last scattering can thermalize into the Cosmic Microwave Background while retaining a portion of their net circular polarization. We also consider the possibility of direct detection of the circular polarization in the CMB.
