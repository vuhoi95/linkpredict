Title: Gauge theories on compact toric surfaces, conformal field theories and  equivariant Donaldson invariants
Authors: Mikhail Bershtein and Giulio Bonelli and Massimiliano Ronzani and Alessandro Tanzini
Abstract: We show that equivariant Donaldson polynomials of compact toric surfaces can be calculated as residues of suitable combinations of Virasoro conformal blocks, by building on AGT correspondence between N = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories and two-dimensional conformal field theory.
