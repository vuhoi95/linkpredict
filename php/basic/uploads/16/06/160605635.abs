Title: Quantum probes of timelike naked singularity with scalar hair
Authors: O. Svitek and T. Tahamtan
Abstract: We study the curvature singularity resolution via quantum fields on a fixed background based on Klein--Gordon and Dirac equations for a static spacetime with a scalar field producing a timelike naked singularity. We show that both Klein--Gordon and Dirac quantum fields see this singularity. Subsequently we check the results by applying the maximal acceleration existence in Covariant Loop Quantum Gravity described recently and obtain the resolution of singularity. In the process we study the geodesics in the spacetime.
