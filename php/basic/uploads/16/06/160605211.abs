Title: Singular inflation from Born-Infeld-f(R) gravity
Authors: Emilio Elizalde and Andrey N. Makarenko
Abstract: Accelerating dynamics from Born-Infeld-$f(R)$ gravity are studied in a simplified conformal approach without matter. Explicit unification of inflation with late-time acceleration is realized within this singular inflation approach, which is similar to Odintsov-Oikonomou singular $f(R)$ inflation. Our model turns out to be consistent with the latest release of Planck data.
