Title: New effects in the interaction between electromagnetic sources mediated  by nonminimal Lorentz violating interactions
Authors: L. H. C. Borges and A. F. Ferrari and F. A. Barone
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to the study of interactions between external sources for the electromagnetic field in a Lorentz symmetry breaking scenario. We focus on a particular higher derivative, Lorentz violating interaction that arises from a specific model that was argued to lead to interesting effects in the low energy phenomenology of light pseudoscalars interacting with photons. The kind of higher derivative Lorentz violating interaction we discuss do not appear in the well known Standard Model Extension, therefore they are called nonminimal. They are usually expected to be relevant only at very high energies, but we argue they might also induce relevant effects in low energy phenomena. Special attention is given for phenomena that have no counterpart in Maxwell theory.
