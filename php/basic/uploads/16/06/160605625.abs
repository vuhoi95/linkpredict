Title: Fermion zero modes in a $Z_2$ vortex background
Authors: Gustavo Lozano and Azadeh Mohammadi and Fidel A. Schaposnik
Abstract: In this paper we study the zero energy solutions of the Dirac equation in the background of a $Z_2$ vortex of a non-Abelian gauge model with three charged scalar fields. We determine the number of the fermionic zero modes giving their explicit form for two specific Ansatze.
