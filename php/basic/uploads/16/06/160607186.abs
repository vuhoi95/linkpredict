Title: Supersymmetry Enhancement and Junctions in S-folds
Authors: Yosuke Imamura and Hirotaka Kato and Daisuke Yokoyama
Abstract: We study supersymmetry enhancement from ${\cal N}=3$ to ${\cal N}=4$ proposed by Aharony and Tachikawa by using string junctions in S-folds. The central charges carried by junctions play a central role in our analysis. We consider planer junctions in a specific plane. Before the S-folding they carry two complex central charges, which we denote by $Z$ and $\bar Z$. The S-fold projection eliminates $\bar Z$ as well as one of the four supercharges, and when the supersymmetry is enhanced $\bar Z$ should be reproduced by some non-perturbative mechanism. For the models of $\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ S-folds which are expected to give $SU(3)$ and $SO(5)$ ${\cal N}=4$ theories we compare the junction spectra with those in perturbative brane realization of the same theories. We establish one-to-one correspondence so that $Z$ coincides. By using the correspondence we also give an expression for the enhanced central charge $\bar Z$.
