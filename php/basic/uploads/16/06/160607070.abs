Title: Twisted sectors from plane partitions
Authors: Shouvik Datta and Matthias R. Gaberdiel and Wei Li and Cheng Peng
Abstract: Twisted sectors arise naturally in the bosonic higher spin CFTs at their free points, as well as in the associated symmetric orbifolds. We identify the coset representations of the twisted sector states using the description of W_\infty representations in terms of plane partitions. We confirm these proposals by a microscopic null-vector analysis, and by matching the excitation spectrum of these representations with the orbifold prediction.
