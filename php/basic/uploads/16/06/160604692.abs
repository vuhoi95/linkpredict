Title: Generalized relativistic kinematics in Poincar√©-invariant models
Authors: B. Ivetic and S. Mignemi and A. Samsarov
Abstract: Assuming the validity of the relativity principle, we discuss the implications on relativistic kinematics of a deformation of the Poincar\'e invariance that preserves the Poincar\'e algebra, and only modifies its action on phase space in a Lorentz-invariant way. We show that, in contrast to the case where the Poincar\'e algebra is deformed, the action of boosts on two-particle states is not affected, while the addition law of momenta is to a large extent arbitrary. We give some nontrivial examples of this arising from doubly special relativity and noncommutative geometry and show that Hopf-algebra methods give equivalent results.
