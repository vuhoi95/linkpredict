Title: $W_4$ Toda example as hidden Liouville CFT
Authors: P. Furlan and V. B. Petkova
Abstract: We construct correlators in the $W_4$ Toda 2d conformal field theory for a particular class of representations and demonstrate a relation to a $W_2$ (Virasoro) theory with different central charge. The relevance of the classical limits of the constructed 3-point functions and braiding matrices to problems in 4d conformal theories is discussed.
