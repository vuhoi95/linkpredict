Title: On the Correctness of Quantum Raychaudhuri Equation and its Implications
Authors: E. I. Lashin and Djamel Dou
Abstract: Regardless of the problems associated with the Bohmian interpretation of quantum mechanics, we carefully examine the approach of quantum Raychaudhuri equation (QRE) based on quantal (Bohmian) trajectories. We find that the whole procedure is full of problematic points, on both physical relevancy and mathematical correctness. In particular, we illustrate the problems associated with the technical derivation of QRE, as well as its invalid physical implications. Thus, all claims concerning the inevitability of focusing and the formation of conjugate points, including the singularity evading, are, to us, not valid.
