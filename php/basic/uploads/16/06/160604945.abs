Title: Chiral kinetic theory and anomalous hydrodynamics in even spacetime  dimensions
Authors: Vatsal Dwivedi and Michael Stone
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamics of a gas of noninteracting Weyl fermions coupled to the electromagnetic field in $(2N + 1) + 1$ spacetime dimensions using the chiral kinetic theory, which encodes the gauge anomaly in the Chern character of the nonabelian Berry connection over the Fermi surface. We derive the anomalous contributions to the relativistic hydrodynamic currents in equilibrium and at a finite temperature, which agree with and provides an approach complementary to the results derived previously using thermodynamic constraints.
