Title: Spherical Accretion of Matter by Charged Black Holes on f(T) Gravity
Authors: Manuel E. Rodrigues and Ednaldo L. B. Junior
Abstract: We studied the spherical accretion of matter by charged black holes on $f(T)$ Gravity. Considering the accretion model of a isentropic perfect fluid we obtain the general form of the Hamiltonian and the dynamic system for the fluid. We have analysed the movements of an isothermal fluid model with $p=\omega e$ and where $p$ is the pressure and $e$ the total energy density. The analysis of the cases shows the possibility of spherical accretion of fluid by black holes, revealing new phenomena as cyclical movement inside the event horizon.
