Title: Warped Graviton Couplings to Bulk Vectors with Brane Kinetic Terms
Authors: Archil Kobakhidze and Kristian L. McDonald and Lei Wu and Jason Yue
Abstract: We consider non-universal couplings between Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons and bulk Standard Model (SM) vectors in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model due to the inclusion of both UV and IR brane-localised gauge kinetic terms. We find that such kinetic terms can enhance the couplings of KK gravitons to SM gauge bosons and help ensure the KK vector masses are consistent with electroweak precision constraints. As an application, we consider the 750 GeV diphoton excess observed in the early LHC Run 2 data, identifying the lightest KK graviton with the diphoton resonance and employing brane kinetic terms to increase the coupling to SM vectors.
