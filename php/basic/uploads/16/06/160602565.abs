Title: Self-accelerating Universe in modified gravity with dynamical torsion
Authors: V. Nikiforova and S. Randjbar-Daemi and V. Rubakov
Abstract: We consider a model belonging to the class of Poincare gauge gravities. The model is free of ghosts and gradient instabilities about Minkowski and torsionless Einstein backgrounds. We find that at zero cosmological constant, the model admits a self-accelerating solution with non-Riemannian connection. Small value of the effective cosmological constant is obtained at the expense of the hierarchy between the dimensionless couplings.
