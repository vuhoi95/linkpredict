Title: Correlators at large c without information loss
Authors: Andrea Galliani and Stefano Giusto and Emanuele Moscato and Rodolfo Russo
Abstract: We study a simple class of correlators with two heavy and two light operators both in the D1D5 CFT and in the dual AdS$_3 \times S^3 \times T^4$ description. On the CFT side we focus on the free orbifold point and discuss how these correlators decompose in terms of conformal blocks, showing that they are determined by protected quantities. On the gravity side, the heavy states are described by regular, asymptotically AdS$_3 \times S^3 \times T^4$ solutions and the correlators are obtained by studying the wave equation in these backgrounds. We find that the CFT and the gravity results agree and that, even in the large central charge limit, these correlators do not have (Euclidean) spurious singularities. We suggest that this is indeed a general feature of the heavy-light correlators in unitary CFTs, which can be relevant for understanding how information is encoded in black hole microstates.
