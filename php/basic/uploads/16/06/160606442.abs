Title: Conjugation Properties of Tensor Product and Fusion Coefficients

Abstract: We review some recent results on properties of tensor product and fusion coefficients under complex conjugation of one of the factors. Some of these results have been proven, some others are conjectures awaiting a proof, one of them involving hitherto unnoticed observations on ordinary representation theory of finite simple groups of Lie type
