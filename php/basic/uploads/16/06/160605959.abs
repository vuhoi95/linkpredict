Title: Anomalous transport of the cuprate strange metal from holography
Authors: Xian-Hui Ge and Yu Tian and Shang-Yu Wu and Shao-Feng Wu
Abstract: We study the anomalous transport of the cuprate strange metals by exploring a new black hole solution in AdS spacetime with a hyperscaling violating factor via the gauge/gravity duality. We show that both the linear T-dependence resistivity and the quadratic T-dependence inverse Hall angle can be naturally achieved. Other anomalous temperature scaling of transport quantities of cuprates, such as 1) the Hall Lorenz ratio, 2) the Nernst coefficient and 3) the magnetoresistance can also be reproduced. In the zero temperature limit, the Lorenz ratio obeys the Wiedemann-Franz law, suggestive of a Fermi-liquid ground state.
