Title: Quantum Entanglement of Locally Excited States in Maxwell Theory
Authors: Masahiro Nozaki and Naoki Watamura
Abstract: In 4 dimensional Maxwell gauge theory, we study the changes of (Renyi) entangle-ment entropy which are defined by subtracting the entropy for the ground state from the one for the locally excited states generated by acting with the gauge invariant local operators on the state. The changes for the operators which we consider in this paper reflect the electric-magnetic duality. The late-time value of changes can be interpreted in terms of electromagnetic quasi-particles. When the operator constructed of both electric and magnetic fields acts on the ground state, it shows that the operator acts on the late-time structure of quantum entanglement differently from free scalar fields.
