Title: Quantized chiral magnetic current from reconnections of magnetic flux
Authors: Yuji Hirono and Dmitri E. Kharzeev and Yi Yin
Abstract: We introduce a new mechanism for the chiral magnetic effect that does not require an initial chirality imbalance. The chiral magnetic current is generated by reconnections of magnetic flux that change the magnetic helicity of the system. The resulting current is entirely determined by the change of magnetic helicity, and it is quantized.
