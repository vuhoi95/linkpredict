Title: Matter localization on brane-worlds generated by deformed defects
Authors: Alex E. Bernardini and Roldao da Rocha
Abstract: Localization and mass spectrum of bosonic and fermionic matter fields of some novel families of asymmetric thick brane configurations generated by deformed defects are investigated. The localization profiles of spin 0, spin 1/2 and spin 1 bulk fields are identified for novel matter field potentials supported by thick branes with internal structures. The condition for localization is constrained by the brane thickness of each model such that thickest branes strongly induces matter localization. The bulk mass terms for both fermion and boson fields are included in the global action as to produce some imprints on mass-independent potentials of the Kaluza-Klein modes associated to the corresponding Schr\"odinger equations. In particular, for spin 1/2 fermions, a complete analytical profile of localization is obtained for the four classes of superpotentials here discussed. Regarding the localization of fermion fields, our overall conclusion indicates that thick branes produce a left-right asymmetric chiral localization of spin 1/2 particles.
