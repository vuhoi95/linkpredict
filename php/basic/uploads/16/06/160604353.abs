Authors: M. Ghodrati and K. Hajian and M. R. Setare
Abstract: Restricting the covariant gravitational phase spaces to the manifold of parametrized families of solutions, the mass, angular momenta, entropies, and electric charges can be calculated by a single and simple method. In this method, which has been called "solution phase space method", conserved charges are unambiguous and regular. Moreover, entropies and other conserved charges can be calculated on arbitrary surfaces, not necessarily horizons or asymptotics. Hence, the first law of thermodynamics would be simply an identity relating the exact symmetries to which the mass, angular momentum, electric charge and entropy are attributed. In this paper, we apply this powerful method to the $f(R)$ gravitational theories accompanied by the terms quadratic in the Riemann and Ricci tensors. Furthermore, conserved charges and the first law of thermodynamics for some of their black hole solutions are exemplified. The examples include Warped BTZ, charged static BTZ, and 3-dimensional $z=3$ Lifshitz black holes.
