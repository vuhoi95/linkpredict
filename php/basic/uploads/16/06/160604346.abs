Title: Reheating and preheating in the simplest extension of Starobinsky  inflation
Authors: C. van de Bruck and P. Dunsby and L. E. Paduraru
Abstract: The epochs of reheating and preheating are studied in a simple extension of the Starobinsky inflationary model, which consists of an $R^2$--correction to the Einstein--Hilbert action and an additional scalar field. We find that if the $R^2$--correction at the end of inflation is dynamically important, it affects the expansion rate and as a consequence the reheating and preheating processes. While we find that the reheating temperature and duration of reheating are only slightly affected, the effect has to be taken into account when comparing the theory to data. In the case of preheating, the gravitational corrections can significantly affect the decay of the second field. Particle production is strongly affected for certain values of the parameters in the theory.
