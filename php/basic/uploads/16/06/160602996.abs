Title: The Instanton-Dyon Liquid Model V: Twisted Light Quarks
Authors: Yizhuang Liu and Edward Shuryak and Ismail Zahed
Abstract: We discuss an extension of the instanton-dyon liquid model that includes twisted light quarks in the fundamental representation with explicit $Z_{N_c}$ symmetry for the case with equal number of colors $N_c$ and flavors $N_f$. We map the model on a 3-dimensional quantum effective theory, and analyze it in the mean-field approximation. The effective potential and the vacuum chiral condensates are made explicit for $N_f=N_c=2, 3$. The low temperature phase is center symmetric but breaks spontaneously flavor symmetry with $N_f-1$ massless pions. The high temperature phase breaks center symmetry but supports finite and unequal quark condensates.
