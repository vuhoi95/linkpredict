Title: Lovelock gravities from Born-Infeld gravity theory
Authors: P. K. Concha and N. Merino and E. K. Rodr√≠guez
Abstract: We present a Born-Infeld gravity theory based on generalizations of Maxwell symmetries denoted as $\mathfrak{C}_{m}$. We analyze different configuration limits allowing to recover diverse Lovelock gravity actions in six dimensions. Further, the generalization to higher even dimensions is also considered.
