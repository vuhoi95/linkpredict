Title: The Full Superconformal Index of the Argyres-Douglas Theory
Authors: Kazunobu Maruyoshi and Jaewon Song
Abstract: We find an N=1 gauge theory which flows to the N=2 Argyres-Douglas theory $H_0$ in the infrared up to the extra free chiral multiplets. The gauge theory is obtained from a certain N=1 preserving deformation of the N=2 SU(2) gauge theory with four fundamental hypermultiplets. From this description we compute the full superconformal index and find agreements with the known results in special limits.
