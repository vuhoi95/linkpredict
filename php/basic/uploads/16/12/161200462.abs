Title: A robust generalization of the Legendre transform for QFT
Authors: David M. Jackson and Achim Kempf and Alejandro H. Morales
Abstract: Although perturbative quantum field theory is highly successful, it possesses a number of well-known analytic problems, from ultraviolet and infrared divergencies to the divergence of the perturbative expansion itself. As a consequence, it has been difficult, for example, to prove with full rigor that the Legendre transform of the quantum effective action is the generating functional of connected graphs. Here, we give a rigorous proof of this central fact. To this end, we show that the Legendre transform can be re-defined purely combinatorially and that it ultimately reduces to a simple homological relation, the Euler characteristic for tree graphs. This result suggests that, similarly, also the quantum field theoretic path integral, being a Fourier transform, may be reducible to an underlying purely algebraic structure.
