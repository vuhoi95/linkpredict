Title: On uniqueness of static black hole with conformal scalar hair
Authors: Yoshimune Tomikawa and Tetsuya Shiromizu and Keisuke Izumi
Abstract: We discuss the uniqueness of the static black hole in the Einstein gravity with a conformally coupled scalar field. In particular, we prove the uniqueness of the region outside of the photon surface, not event horizon.
