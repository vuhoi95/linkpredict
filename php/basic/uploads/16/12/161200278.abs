Title: Enhanced Asymptotic Symmetry Algebra of 2+1 Dimensional Flat Space
Authors: St√©phane Detournay and Max Riegler
Abstract: In this paper we present a new set of asymptotic boundary conditions for Einstein gravity in 2+1 dimensions with vanishing cosmological constant that are a generalization of the Barnich-Comp{\`e}re boundary conditions gr-qc/0610130. These new boundary conditions lead to an asymptotic symmetry algebra that is generated by a $\mathfrak{bms}_3$ algebra and two affine $\hat{\mathfrak{u}}(1)$ current algebras. We then apply these boundary conditions to Topologically Massive Gravity (TMG) and determine how the presence of the gravitational Chern-Simons term affects the central extensions of the asymptotic symmetry algebra. We furthermore determine the thermal entropy of solutions obeying our new boundary conditions for both Einstein gravity and TMG.
