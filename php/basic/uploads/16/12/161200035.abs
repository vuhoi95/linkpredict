Title: Quantum quenches during inflation
Authors: Pedro Carrilho and Raquel H. Ribeiro
Abstract: We propose a new technique to study fast transitions during inflation, by studying the dynamics of quantum quenches in an $O(N)$ scalar field theory in de Sitter spacetime. We compute the time evolution of the system using a non-perturbative large-$N$ limit approach. We derive the self-consistent mass equation for several physically relevant transitions of the parameters of the theory, in a slow motion approximation. Our computations reveal that the effective mass after the quench evolves in the direction of recovering its value before the quench, but stopping at a different asymptotic value, in which the mass is strictly positive. Furthermore, we tentatively find situations in which the effective mass can be temporarily negative, thus breaking the $O(N)$ symmetry of the system for a certain time, only to then come back to a positive value, restoring the symmetry. We argue the relevance of our new method in a cosmological scenario.
