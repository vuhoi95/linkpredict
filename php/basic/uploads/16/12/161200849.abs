Abstract: We compute the thermodynamic properties of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models of fermions with a conserved fermion number, $\mathcal{Q}$. We extend a previously proposed Schwarzian effective action to include a phase field, and this describes the low temperature energy and $\mathcal{Q}$ fluctuations. We obtain higher-dimensional generalizations of the SYK models which display disordered metallic states without quasiparticle excitations, and we deduce their thermoelectric transport coefficients. We also examine the corresponding properties of Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theories on black brane geometries which interpolate from either AdS$_4$ or AdS$_5$ to an AdS$_2\times \mathbb{R}^2$ or AdS$_2\times \mathbb{R}^3$ near-horizon geometry. These provide holographic descriptions of non-quasiparticle metallic states without momentum conservation. We find a precise match between low temperature transport and thermodynamics of the SYK and holographic models. In both models the Seebeck transport coefficient is exactly equal to the $\mathcal{Q}$-derivative of the entropy. For the SYK models, quantum chaos, as characterized by the butterfly velocity and the Lyapunov rate, universally determines the thermal diffusivity, but not the charge diffusivity.
