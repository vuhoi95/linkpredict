Abstract: Working within the post-Newtonian (PN) approximation to General Relativity, we use the effective field theory (EFT) framework to study the conservative dynamics of the two-body motion at fourth PN order, at fifth order in the Newton constant. This is one of the missing pieces preventing the computation of the full Lagrangian at fourth PN order using EFT methods. We exploit the analogy between diagrams in the EFT gravitational theory and 2-point functions in massless gauge theory, to address the calculation of 4-loop amplitudes by means of standard multi-loop diagrammatic techniques. Our result contains a contribution which is not present in previous studies, performed using different methods.
