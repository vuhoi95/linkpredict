Title: Charged Lifshitz black hole and probed Lorentz-violation fermions from  holography
Authors: Cheng-Jian Luo and Xiao-Mei Kuang and Fu-Wen Shu
Abstract: We analytically obtain a new charged Lifshtitz solution by adding a non-relativistic Maxwell field in Horava-Lifshitz gravity. The black hole exhibits an anisotropic scaling between space and time (Lifshitz scaling) in the UV limit, while in the IR limit, the Lorentz invariance is recovered. We introduce the probed Lorentz-violation fermions into the background and holographically investigate the spectral properties of the dual fermionic operator. The Lorentz-violation of fermions will enhance the peak and corresponds larger fermi momentum, which compensates the non-relativistic bulk effect of the dynamical exponent. For a fixed $z$, when the Lorentz-violation of fermions increases to a critical value, the behavior of the low energy excitation goes from a non-Fermi liquid type to a fermi liquid type, which implies a kind of phase transition.
