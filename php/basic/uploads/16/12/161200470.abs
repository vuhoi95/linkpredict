Title: Spatially modulated instabilities of holographic gauge-gravitational  anomaly
Authors: Yan Liu and Francisco Pena-Benitez
Abstract: We performed a study of the perturbative instabilities in Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory with a gravitational Chern-Simons term, which is dual to a strongly coupled field theory with both chiral and mixed gauge-gravitational anomaly. With an analysis of the fluctuations in the near horizon regime at zero temperature, we found that there might be two possible sources of instabilities. The first one corresponds to a real mass-squared which is below the BF bound of AdS$_2$, and it leads to the bell-curve phase diagram at finite temperature. The effect of mixed gauge-gravitational anomaly is emphasised. Another source of instability is independent of gauge Chern-Simons coupling and exists for any finite gravitational Chern-Simons coupling. There is a singular momentum close to which unstable mode appears. The possible implications of this singular momentum are discussed. Our analysis suggests that Reissner-Nordstrom black hole is not a stable ground state in the theory with a gravitational Chern-Simons term for finite density system unless the gravitational Chern-Simons coupling is treated as a small perturbative parameter.
