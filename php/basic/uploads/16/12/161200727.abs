Title: Gustafson integrals for $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ spin magnet
Authors: S. E. Derkachov and A. N. Manashov and P. A. Valinevich
Abstract: It was observed recently that the multidimensional Mellin--Barnes integrals (Gustafson's integrals) arise naturally in studies of the $SL(2,R)$ spin chain models. We extend this analysis to the noncompact $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ spin magnets and obtain integrals which generalize Gustafson's integrals to the complex case.
