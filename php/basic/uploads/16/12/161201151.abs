Title: ${\cal N}$ = $1$ Euler Anomaly from RG-dependent metric-Background
Authors: Vladimir Prochazka and Roman Zwicky
Abstract: We consider ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories in the conformal window. By applying a suitable matter superfield rescaling and a Weyl-transformation the renormalisation group running (matter and gauge field $Z$-factors) are absorbed into the metric. The latter becomes a function of the $Z$-factors. The Euler flow $\Delta a \equiv a_{\rm UV} - a_{\rm IR} |_{{\cal N}=1}$ is then obtained by free field theory computation with the non-trivial dynamics coming from expanding the Euler invariant in the flow dependent metric. The result is therefore directly obtained in terms of the infrared anomalous dimension confirming an earlier result using the matching of conserved currents.
