Title: Conformal anomalies and the Einstein Field Equations
Authors: Hadi Godazgar and Krzysztof A. Meissner and Hermann Nicolai
Abstract: We compute corrections to the Einstein field equations which are induced by the anomalous effective actions associated to the type A conformal anomaly, both for the (non-local) Riegert action, as well as for the local action with dilaton. In all cases considered we find that these corrections can be very large.
