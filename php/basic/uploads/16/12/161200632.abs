Title: Dark matter and baryogenesis in the Fermi-bounce curvaton mechanism
Authors: Andrea Addazi and Stephon Alexander and Yi-Fu Cai and Antonino Marciano
Abstract: We elaborate on a toy-model of matter bounce, in which the matter content is constituted by two fermion species endowed with four fermion interaction term. We describe the curvaton mechanism that is forth generated, and then argue that one of the two fermionic species may realize baryogenesis, while the other (lighter) one is compatible with constrains on extra hot dark matter particles.
