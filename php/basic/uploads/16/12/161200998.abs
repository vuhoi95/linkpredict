Title: Note on Reheating in G-inflation
Authors: Hossein Bazrafshan Moghaddam and Robert Brandenberger and Jun'ichi Yokoyama
Abstract: We study particle production at the end of inflation in kinetically driven G-inflation model and show that, in spite of the fact that there are no inflaton oscillations and hence no parametric resonance instabilities, the production of matter particles due to a coupling to the evolving inflaton field can be more efficient than pure gravitational Parker particle production.
