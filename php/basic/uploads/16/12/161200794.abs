Title: Symmetries in superintegrable deformations of oscillator/Coulomb  systems: "holomorphic factorization"
Authors: Tigran Hakobyan and Armen Nersessian and Hovhannes Shmavonyan
Abstract: We propose a unified description for the constants of motion for superintegrable deformations of the oscillator and Coulomb systems on N-dimensional Euclidean space, sphere and hyperboloid. We also consider the duality between these generalized systems and present some example.
