Title: Geometric interpretation of Planck-scale-deformed co-products
Authors: Iarley P. Lobo and Giovanni Palmisano
Abstract: For theories formulated with a maximally symmetric momentum space we propose a general characterization for the description of interactions in terms of the isometry group of the momentum space. The well known cases of $\kappa$-Poincar\'e-inspired and (2+1)-dimensional gravity-inspired composition laws both satisfy our condition. Future applications might include the proposal of a class of models based on momenta spaces with anti-de Sitter geometry.
