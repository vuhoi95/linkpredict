Abstract: In a recent paper [Mod. Phys. Lett. A30 (2015) 1550104], the black-hole/qubit correspondence (BHQC) was exploited to define "black hole quantum circuits" allowing for a change of the supersymmetry-preserving features of electromagnetic charge configurations supporting the black hole solution, thus switching from one U-duality orbit to another, or - equivalently - from an element of the corresponding Freudenthal Triple System with a definite rank, to another one. On the supergravity side of BHQC, such quantum gates relate to particular symplectic transformations acting on the black hole charges; namely, such transformations cannot belong to the U-duality group, otherwise switching among orbits would be impossible. In this paper, we consider a particular class of such symplectic transformations, namely the ones belonging to the so-called Peccei-Quinn symplectic group, introduced some time ago within the study of very special Kaehler geometries of the vector multiplets' scalar manifolds in N = 2 supergravity in D = 4 space-time dimensions.
