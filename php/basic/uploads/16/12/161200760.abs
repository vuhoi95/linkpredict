Title: Non Bunch Davies group coherent states, and their quantum signatures in  CMB observables
Authors: Suddhasattwa Brahma and Pietro Dona and Antonino Marciano
Abstract: We approach the problem of finding generalized states for matter fields in a de Sitter universe, moving from a group theoretical point of view. This has profound consequences for cosmological perturbations during inflation, and for other CMB observables. In a systematic derivation, we find all the allowed generalities that such a state may have, within the requirements of coherent states. Furthermore, we show their relation to the more familiar excited initial states, often used in inflation.
