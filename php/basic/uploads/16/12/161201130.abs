Title: Solutions of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation with position dependent  Fermi--velocity and gap profiles
Authors: M. Presilla and O. Panella and P. Roy
Abstract: It is shown that bound state solutions of the one dimensional Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equation may exist when the Fermi velocity becomes dependent on the space coordinate. The existence of bound states in continuum (BIC) like solutions has also been confirmed both in the normal phase as well as in the super-conducting phase. We also show that a combination of Fermi velocity and gap parameter step-like profiles provides scattering solutions with normal reflection and transmission.
