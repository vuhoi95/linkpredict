Title: Majorana Fermions in Particle Physics, Solid State and Quantum  Information
Authors: L. Borsten and M. J. Duff
Abstract: This review is based on lectures given by M. J. Duff summarising the far reaching contributions of Ettore Majorana to fundamental physics, with special focus on Majorana fermions in all their guises. The theoretical discovery of the eponymous fermion in 1937 has since had profound implications for particle physics, solid state and quantum computation. The breadth of these disciplines is testimony to Majorana's genius, which continues to permeate physics today. These lectures offer a whistle-stop tour through some limited subset of the key ideas. In addition to touching on these various applications, we will draw out some fascinating relations connecting the normed division algebras $\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}, \mathbb{H}, \mathbb{O}$ to spinors, trialities, $K$-theory and the classification of stable topological states of symmetry-protected gapped free-fermion systems.
