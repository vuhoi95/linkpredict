Abstract: We investigate the interaction of spin-2 fields with those of Standard Model in a model independent framework. We have considered interactions where the spin-2 fields couple to two sets of gauge invariant tensorial operators that are not conserved unlike the energy momentum tensor with different coupling strengths. Such interactions not only change the ultraviolet behaviour of the couplings but also expand the scope of the searches of spin-2 particles at the colliders. We present all the relevant renormalisation constants up to three loop level in QCD and also the form factors that contribute to potential observables. This sets the ground to investigate the phenomenological consequences of these interactions with spin-2 fields through more than one tensorial operator.
