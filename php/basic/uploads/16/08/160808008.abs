Title: Estimating cosmological parameters by the simulated data of  gravitational waves from Einstein Telescope
Authors: Rong-Gen Cai and Tao Yang
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational wave (GW) as the standard siren to estimate the constraint ability of cosmological parameters using the third-generation gravitational wave detector: Einstein Telescope. The binary merger of a neutron with either a neutron or black hole is hypothesized to be the progenitor of a short and intense burst of $\gamma$-rays, some fraction of those binary mergers could be detected both through electromagnetic radiation and gravitational wave. Thus we can determine both the luminosity distance and redshift of the source separately. We simulate the luminosity distance and redshift measurements from 100 to 1000 GW events. We adopt Markov chain Monte Carlo method to constrain the Hubble constant and dark matter density parameter, we find that with about 500-600 GW events we can constrain the Hubble constant with an accuracy comparable to \textit{Planck} temperature data and \textit{Planck} lensing combined results, while for the dark matter density, it needs about 1000 GW events. Then we constrain the equation of state of dark energy using a new nonparametric method: Gaussian Process. In the low redshift region, we find that about 700 GW events can give the constraints of $w(z)$ comparable to the constraints of the constant $w$ by \textit{Planck} data with Type Ia supernovae. Those results show that the GWs as the standard sirens to probe the cosmological parameters can provide an independent and complementary alternative to current experiments.
