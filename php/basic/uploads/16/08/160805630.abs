Title: Asymptotic dynamics, large gauge transformations and infrared symmetries
Authors: Cesar Gomez and Mischa Panchenko
Abstract: Infrared finite S matrices enjoy an infinite family of symmetries, namely decoupling of asymptotic soft modes with arbitrary direction. The infrared structure of the theory manifests itself in the form of vacuum degeneracy and in nontrivial asymptotic dynamics. These two ingredients are unified in the infrared finite S matrix symmetries and can be disentangled as soft and hard components of corresponding charges. When these two components are disentangled, the nontrivial role of large gauge transformations becomes manifest. The soft decoupling symmetry of the physical S matrix leads to relations between the corresponding soft/hard decompositions for the in and out states that can encode crucial nontrivial information about the scattering process.
