Title: Quantum Criticality and DBI Magneto-resistance
Authors: Elias Kiritsis and Li Li
Abstract: We use the DBI action from string theory and holography to study the magneto-resistance at quantum criticality with hyperscaling violation. We find and analyze a rich class of scaling behaviors for the magneto-resistance. A special case describes the scaling results found in pnictides by Hayers et al. in~\cite{analytis}.
