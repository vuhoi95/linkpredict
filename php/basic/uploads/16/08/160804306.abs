Title: A note on connected formula for form factors
Authors: Song He and Zhengwen Liu
Abstract: In this note we study the connected prescription, originally derived from Witten's twistor string theory, for tree-level form factors in ${\cal N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory. The construction is based on the recently proposed four-dimensional scattering equations with $n$ massless on-shell states and one off-shell state, which we expect to work for form factors of general operators. To illustrate the universality of the prescription, we propose compact formulas for super form factors with chiral stress-tensor multiplet operator, and bosonic ones with scalar operators ${\rm Tr}(\phi^m)$ for arbitrary $m$.
