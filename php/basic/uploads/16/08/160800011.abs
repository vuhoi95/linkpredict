Title: Charged Proca Stars
Authors: Federico Garc√≠a and Ignacio Salazar Landea
Abstract: In this paper, we study gauged solutions associated to a massive vector field representing a spin-one condensate, namely the Proca field. We focus on regular spherically-symmetric solutions which we construct either using a self-interaction potential or general relativity in order to glue the solutions together. We start generating non-gravitating solutions, so-called, Proca Q-balls and charged Proca Q-balls. Then, we turn-on backreaction on the metric, allowing gravity to hold together the Proca condensate, to study the so-called Proca stars, charged Proca stars, Proca Q-stars and charged Proca Q-stars.
