Title: A resurgence analysis for cubic and quartic anharmonic potentials
Authors: Ilmar Gahramanov and Kemal Tezgin
Abstract: In this work we explicitly show resurgence relations between perturbative and one instanton sectors of the resonance energy levels for cubic and quartic anharmonic potentials in one-dimensional quantum mechanics. Both systems satisfy the Dunne-Unsal relation and hence we are able to derive one-instanton non-perturbative contributions with the fluctuation terms to the energy merely from the perturbative data. We confirm our results with previous results obtained by Zinn-Justin et al.
