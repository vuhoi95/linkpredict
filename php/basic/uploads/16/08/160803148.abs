Abstract: Following earlier study regarding Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-massive black holes in the presence of Born-Infeld nonlinear electromagnetic field [S. H. Hendi, B. Eslam Panah and S. Panahiyan, arXiv:1510.00108], we study thermodynamical structure and critical behavior of these black holes through different methods in this paper. Geometrical thermodynamics is employed to give a picture regarding phase transition of these black holes. Next, a new method is used to derive critical pressure and horizon radius of these black holes. In addition, Maxwell equal area law is employed to study the Van der Waals like behavior of these black holes. Moreover, the critical exponents are calculated and by using Ehrenfest equations, the type of the phase transitions are determined.
