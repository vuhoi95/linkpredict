Title: Point-like bounding chains in open Gromov-Witten theory
Authors: Jake P. Solomon and Sara B. Tukachinsky
Abstract: We use $A_\infty$ algebras to define open Gromov-Witten invariants with both boundary and interior constraints, associated to a Lagrangian submanifold $L\subset X$ of arbitrary odd dimension. The boundary constraints are bounding chains, which are shown to behave like points. The interior constraints are arbitrary even degree classes in the cohomology of $X$ relative to $L.$ We show the invariants satisfy analogs of the axioms of closed Gromov-Witten theory. Our definition of invariants depends on the vanishing of a series of obstruction classes. One way to show vanishing is to impose certain cohomological conditions on $L.$ Alternatively, if there exists an anti-symplectic involution fixing $L$, then part of the obstructions vanish a priori, and weaker cohomological conditions suffice to guarantee vanishing of the remaining obstructions. In particular, our definition generalizes both Welschinger's and Georgieva's real enumerative invariants.
