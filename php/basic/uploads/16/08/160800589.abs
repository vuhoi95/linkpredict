Title: Stability Aspects of Wormholes in $R^2$ Gravity
Authors: James B. Dent and Damien A. Easson and Thomas W. Kephart and Sara C. White
Abstract: We study radial perturbations of a wormhole in $R^2$ gravity to determine regions of stability. We also investigate massive and massless particle orbits and tidal forces in this space-time for a radially infalling observer.
