Title: Little String Origin of Surface Defects
Authors: Nathan Haouzi and Christian Schmid
Abstract: We derive the codimension-two defects of 4d $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory from the (2, 0) little string. The origin of the little string is type IIB theory compactified on an ADE singularity. The defects are D-branes wrapping the 2-cycles of the singularity. We use this construction to make contact with the description of SYM defects due to Gukov and Witten [arXiv:hep-th/0612073]. Furthermore, we derive from a geometric perspective the complete nilpotent orbit classification of codimension-two defects, and the connection to ADE-type Toda CFT. The only data needed to specify the defects is a set of weights of the algebra obeying certain constraints, which we give explicitly. We highlight the differences between the defect classification in the little string theory and its (2, 0) CFT limit.
