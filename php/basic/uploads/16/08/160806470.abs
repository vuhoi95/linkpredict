Title: Natural Supersymmetry from Extra Dimensions
Authors: Antonio Delgado and Mateo Garcia-Pepin and Germano Nardini and Mariano Quiros
Abstract: We show that natural supersymmetry can be embedded in a five-dimensional theory with supersymmetry breaking \`a la Scherk-Schwarz (SS). There is no 'gluino-sucks' problem for stops localized in the four-dimensional brane and gluinos propagating in the full five-dimensional bulk, and sub-TeV stops are easily accommodated. The $\mu / B_\mu$ problem is absent as well; the SS breaking generates a Higgsino Dirac mass and no bilinear Higgs mass parameter in the superpotential is required. Moreover, for non-maximal SS twists leading to $\tan \beta \simeq 1$, the Higgs spectrum is naturally split, in agreement with LHC data. The 125-GeV Higgs mass and radiative electroweak symmetry breaking can be accommodated by minimally extending the Higgs sector with $Y=0$ $SU(2)_L$ triplets.
