Abstract: The most realistic situations in quantum mechanics involve the interaction between two or more systems. In the most of reliable models, the form and structure of the interactions generate differential equations which are, in the most of cases, almost impossible to solve exactly. In this paper, using the Schwinger Quantum Action Principle, we found the time transformation function that solves exactly the harmonic oscillator interacting with a set of other harmonic coupled oscillators. In order to do it, we have introduced a new special set of creation and annihilation operators which leads directly to the \emph{dressed states} associated to the system, which are the real quantum states of the interacting \emph{\textquotedblleft field-particle\textquotedblright} system. To obtain the closed solution, it is introduced in the same foot a set of \emph{normal mode} creation and annihilation operators of the system related to the first ones by an orthogonal transformation. We find the eigenstates, amplitude transitions and the system spectra without any approximation. At last, we show that the Schwinger Variational Principle provides the solutions in a free representation way.
