Title: Flat structures on Frobenius Manifolds in the case of irrelevant  deformations
Authors: A. Belavin and L. Spodyneiko
Abstract: In this paper we use the recently suggested conjecture about the integral representation for the flat coordinates on Frobenius manifolds, connected with the isolated singularities, to compute the flat coordinates and Saito primitive form on the space of the deformations of Gepner chiral ring $\widehat{SU}(3)_4$. We verify this conjecture comparing the expressions for the flat coordinates obtained from the conjecture with the one found by direct computation. The considered case is of a particular interest since together with the relevant and marginal deformations it has one irrelevant deformation.
