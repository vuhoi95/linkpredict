Title: The vorticity induced chiral separation effect from the compactified  D4-branes with smeared D0-brane charge
Authors: Chao Wu and Yidian Chen and Mei Huang
Abstract: By using the boundary derivative expansion formalism of fluid/gravity correspondence, we study the chiral vortical separation effect in a strongly coupled nonconformal relativistic fluid in the background of D0-D4 Sakai-Sugimoto model. The relativistic fluid of this model is nonconformal with a conserved axial vector current, and the presence of the chiral vortical separation effect is induced by the addition of a Chern-Simons term in the bulk action. Except the non-dissipative anomalous viscous coefficient and the sound speed, all other thermal and hydrodynamical quantities of first order depend on the temperature and the axial chemical potential. Stability analysis shows that this anomalous relativistic fluid is stable and the doping of smeared D0-brane will slow down the sound speed.
