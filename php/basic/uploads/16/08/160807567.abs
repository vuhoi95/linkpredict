Title: Bi-Local Holography in the SYK Model: Perturbations
Authors: Antal Jevicki and Kenta Suzuki
Abstract: We continue the study of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model in the Large $N$ limit. Following our formulation in terms of bi-local collective fields with dynamical reparametrization symmetry, we perform perturbative calculations around the conformal IR point.
