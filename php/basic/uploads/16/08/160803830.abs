Title: Gravito-magnetic monopoles in traversable wormholes from WIMT
Authors: Jesús Martín Romero and Mauricio Bellini
Abstract: Using Weitzenb\"ock Induced Matter Theory (WIMT), we study Schwarzschild wormholes performing different foliations on an extended (non-vaccuum) 5D manifold. We explore the geodesic equations for observers which are in the interior of a traversable wormhole and how these observers can detect gravito-magnetic monopoles which are dual to gravito-electric sources observed in the outer zone of some Schwarzschild Black-Hole (BH). The densities of these monopoles are calculated and quantized in the Dirac sense. This kind of duality on the extended Einstein-Maxwell equations, relates electric and magnetic charges on causally disconnected space regions.
