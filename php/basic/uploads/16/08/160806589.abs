Title: Relating Mass to Angular Momentum and Charge in 5-Dimensional Minimal  Supergravity
Authors: Aghil Alaee and Marcus Khuri and Hari Kunduri
Abstract: We prove a mass-angular momentum-charge inequality for a broad class of maximal, asymptotically flat, bi-axisymmetric initial data within the context of five-dimensional minimal supergravity. We further show that the charged Myers-Perry black hole initial data are the unique minimizers. In addition, we establish a rigidity statement for the relevant BPS bound, and give a variational characterization of BMPV black holes.
