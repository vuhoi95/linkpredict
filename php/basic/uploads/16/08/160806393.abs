Title: Conjugate boundary condition, hidden particles, and gauge-Higgs  inflation
Authors: Yugo Abe and Yuhei Goto and Yoshiharu Kawamura and Yasunari Nishikawa
Abstract: We propose an idea that hidden particles can be separated according to gauge quantum numbers from the visible ones by the difference of boundary conditions on extra dimensions. We formulate 5-dimensional gauge theories yielding conjugate boundary conditions besides ordinary ones on $S^1/Z_2$, and examine physical implications concerning hidden particles on an extension of the standard model coexisting different types of boundary conditions. A model with conjugate boundary conditions is applied on a gauge-Higgs inflation scenario.
