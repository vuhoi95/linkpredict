Title: Resurgence of the dressing phase for ${\rm AdS}_5\times {\rm S}^5$
Authors: Gleb Arutyunov and Daniele Dorigoni and Sergei Savin
Abstract: We discuss the resummation of the strong coupling asymptotic expansion of the dressing phase of the ${\rm AdS}_5\times {\rm S}^5$ superstring. The dressing phase proposed by Beisert, Eden and Staudacher can be recovered from a modified Borel-Ecalle resummation of this asymptotic expansion only by completing it with new, non-perturbative and exponentially suppressed terms that can be organized into different sectors labelled by an instanton-like number. We compute the contribution to the dressing phase coming from the sum over all the instanton sectors and show that it satisfies the homogeneous crossing symmetry equation. We comment on the semiclassical origin of the non-perturbative terms from the world-sheet theory point of view even though their precise explanation remains still quite mysterious.
