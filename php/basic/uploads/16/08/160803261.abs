Title: Graphene through the looking glass of QFT
Authors: Ignat V. Fialkovsky and Dmitri V. Vassilevich
Abstract: This paper is aimed to review and promote the main applications of the methods of Quantum Field Theory to description of quantum effects in graphene. We formulate the effective electromagnetic action following from the Dirac model for the quasiparticles in graphene and apply it for derivation of different observable effects like the induced mean charge, quantized conductivity, Faraday effect, and Casimir interaction involving graphene samples.
