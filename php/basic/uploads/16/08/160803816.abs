Title: BFKL pomeron with massive gluons and running coupling
Authors: Eugene Levin and Lev Lipatov and Marat Siddikov
Abstract: In this paper we proceed with the study of the Pomeron spectrum, by solving numerically the BFKL equation with massive gluons and running coupling. The spectrum of Regge singularities is discrete and the leading Pomeron has a considerable dependence on nonperturbative effects, for which we use Higgs mechanism as a model. We cross-checked this result with variational method and confirmed the infrared sensitivity of leading Pomeron. This fact is related to the infrared instability of the BFKL equation in QCD, with a running coupling. The subleading poles have a mild sensitivity to the soft physics, and are well described by known semiclassical methods. We also discuss the dependence on various prescriptions of the running coupling arguments.
