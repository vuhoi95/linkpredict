Title: Scalar bosons under the influence of noninertial effects in the cosmic  string spacetime
Authors: L. C. N. Santos and C. C. Barros Jr
Abstract: In this paper we present two different classes of solutions for the Klein-Gordon equation in the presence of a scalar potential under the influence of noninertial effects in the cosmic string spacetime. We show that noninertial effects restrict the physical region of the spacetime where the particle can be placed, and furthermore that the energy levels are shifted by these effects. In addition, we show that the presence of a Coulomb-like scalar potential allows the formation bound states when the Klein-Gordon equation is considered in this kind of spacetime.
