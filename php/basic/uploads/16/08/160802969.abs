Title: Indices for 6 dimensional superconformal field theories
Authors: Seok Kim and Kimyeong Lee
Abstract: We review some recent developments in the 6 dimensional (2, 0) superconformal field theories, focusing on their BPS spectra in the Coulomb and symmetric phases computed by various Witten indices. We shall discuss the instanton partition function of 5d maximal super-Yang-Mills theory, and the 6d superconformal index.
