Abstract: Resonance plays critical roles in the formation of many physical phenomena, and several methods have been developed for the exploration of resonance. In this work, we propose a new scheme for resonance by solving the Dirac equation in complex momentum representation, in which the resonant states are exposed clearly in complex momentum plane and the resonance parameters can be determined precisely without imposing unphysical parameters. Combining with the relativistic mean-field theory, this method is applied to probe the resonances in $^{120}$Sn with the energies, widths, and wavefunctions being obtained. Comparing with other methods, this method is not only very effective for narrow resonances, but also can be reliably applied to broad resonances.
