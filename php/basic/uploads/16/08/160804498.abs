Title: Path integral polymer propagator of relativistic and non-relativistic  particles
Authors: Hugo A. Morales-TÃ©cotl and Saeed Rastgoo and Juan C. Ruelas
Abstract: A recent proposal to connect the loop quantization with the spin foam model for cosmology via the path integral is hereby adapted to the case of mechanical systems within the framework of the so called polymer quantum mechanics. The mechanical models we consider are deparametrized and thus the group averaging technique is used to deal with the corresponding constraints. The transition amplitudes are written in a vertex expansion form used in the spin foam models, where here a vertex is actually a jump in position. Polymer Propagators previously obtained by spectral methods for a nonrelativistic polymer particle, both free and in a box, are regained with this method. Remarkably, the approach is also shown to yield the polymer propagator of the relativistic particle. This reduces to the standard form in the continuum limit for which the length scale parameter of the polymer quantization is taken to be small. Some possible future developments are commented upon.
