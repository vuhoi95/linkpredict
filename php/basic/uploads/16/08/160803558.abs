Abstract: We study the covariant Dirac equation in the space-time generated by a cosmic string in presence of vector and scalar potentials of electromagnetic field. We obtain the solution of the radial part of Dirac equation. We consider the scattering states under the Hulth\'{e}n potential and obtain the phase shifts. From the poles of the scattering $S$-matrix the bound states energies are determined as well.
