Title: (2,2) and (0,4) Supersymmetric Boundary Conditions in 3d N = 4 Theories  and Type IIB Branes
Authors: Hee-Joong Chung and Tadashi Okazaki
Abstract: The half-BPS boundary conditions preserving N = (2,2) and N = (0,4) supersymmetry in 3d N = 4 supersymmetric gauge theories are examined. The BPS equations admit decomposition of the bulk supermultiplets into specific boundary supermultiplets of preserved supersymmetry. Bogomolony-like equations and Nahm-like equations arise in the vector multiplet BPS boundary conditions and Robin-type boundary conditions appear for the hypermultiplet coupled to vector multiplet. The half-BPS boundary conditions are realized in the brane configurations of Type IIB string theory.
