Title: Four-fold way to helicity
Authors: M. Elbistan and P. A. Horvathy and P. -M. Zhang
Abstract: Bialynicki-Birula's "photon wave equation", derived from a Dirac/Weyl-type action principle, is symmetric w.r.t. duality transformations, but the associated Noether quantity vanishes. Replacing fields by potentials in the definition and using instead a Klein-Gordon-type action allows us to recover the previously proposed conserved "double-Chern-Simons" expression of helicity. The Dirac/Weyl-type approach applied to our potential-modified theory yields again zero conserved charge. The Klein-Gordon-type approach applied to the original Bialynicki-Birula setting yields in turn Lipkin's "zilch". Our results are consistent with the theorem of Weinberg and Witten.
