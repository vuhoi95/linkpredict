Authors: Bitan Roy and Vladimir Juricic and Igor F. Herbut
Abstract: We correct our previous conclusion regarding the fate of a charged quantum critical point across the superconducting transition for two dimensional massless Dirac fermion. Within the leading order $\epsilon$ expansion, we now find that the requisite number of four-component Dirac fermion flavors ($N_f$) for the continuous phase transition through a charged critical point is $N_f>18.2699$. For $N_f\geq1/2$, the critical number of bosonic flavors for this transition is significantly reduced as compared to the value determined in the absence of the Dirac fermions in the theory.
