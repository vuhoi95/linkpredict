Title: A CFT Perspective on Gravitational Dressing and Bulk Locality
Authors: Aitor Lewkowycz and Gustavo J. Turiaci and Herman Verlinde
Abstract: We revisit the construction of local bulk operators in AdS/CFT with special focus on gravitational dressing and its consequences for bulk locality. Specializing to 2+1-dimensions, we investigate these issues via the proposed identification between bulk operators and cross-cap boundary states. We obtain explicit expressions for correlation functions of bulk fields with boundary stress tensor insertions, and find that they are free of non-local branch cuts but do have non-local poles. We recover the HKLL recipe for restoring bulk locality for interacting fields as the outcome of a natural CFT crossing condition. We show that, in a suitable gauge, the cross-cap states solve the bulk wave equation for general background geometries, and satisfy a conformal Ward identity analogous to a soft graviton theorem, Virasoro symmetry, the large N conformal bootstrap and the uniformization theorem all play a key role in our derivations.
