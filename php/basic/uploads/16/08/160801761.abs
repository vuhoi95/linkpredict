Title: The Verlinde formula for Higgs bundles
Authors: JÃ¸rgen Ellegaard Andersen and Sergei Gukov and Du Pei
Abstract: We propose and prove the Verlinde formula for the quantization of the Higgs bundle moduli spaces and stacks for any simple and simply-connected group. This generalizes the equivariant Verlinde formula for the case of $SU(n)$ proposed previously by the second and third author. We further establish a Verlinde formula for the quantization of parabolic Higgs bundle moduli spaces and stacks.
