Title: 5D Lovelock gravity: new exact solutions with torsion
Authors: B. Cvetković and D. Simić
Abstract: We investigate Lovelock gravity in five dimensions in first order formalism. We construct a new class of solutions: BTZ black ring with(out) torsion. We show that our solution with torsion exists in the different sector of the Lovelock gravity compared to Lovelock Chern-Simons and the sector investigated by Canfora et al. We compute conserved charges of the solutions by using Nester's formula, and confirm the results by canonical method. We show that the theory linearized around the background with torsion possesses additional degrees of freedom compared to general relativity.
