Title: M2-Branes And The (2,0) Superalgebra
Authors: Neil Lambert and Damiano Sacco
Abstract: We present a generalization of the six-dimensional (2,0) system of arXiv:1007.2982 to include a constant abelian 3-form. For vanishing 3-form this system is known to provide a variety descriptions of parallel M5-branes. For a particular choice of 3-form the system is shown to reduce to that of two M2-branes. Thus this generalised (2,0) system provides a unified description of two parallel M2-branes or M5-branes.
