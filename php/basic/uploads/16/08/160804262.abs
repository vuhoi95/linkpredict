Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the null geodesics extending from the near-horizon region out to a distant observatory in an extremal Kerr-Newman black hole background. In particular, using the matched asymptotic expansion method, we analytically solve the null geodesics near the superradiant bound. For the case that the polar angles of the two endpoints of the geodesic coincide, the relation between the radial values of the two endpoints is found, and the shifts in the azimuthal angle and time are also obtained.
