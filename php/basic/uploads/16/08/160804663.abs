Title: Higher-spin charges in Hamiltonian form. I. Bose fields
Authors: Andrea Campoleoni and Marc Henneaux and Sergio HÃ¶rtner and Amaury Leonard
Abstract: We study asymptotic charges for symmetric massless higher-spin fields on Anti de Sitter backgrounds of arbitrary dimension within the canonical formalism. We first analyse in detail the spin-3 example: we cast Fronsdal's action in Hamiltonian form, we derive the charges and we propose boundary conditions on the canonical variables that secure their finiteness. We then extend the computation of charges and the characterisation of boundary conditions to arbitrary spin.
