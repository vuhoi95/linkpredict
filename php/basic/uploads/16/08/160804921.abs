Title: Super-spectral curve of irregular conformal blocks
Authors: Dimitri Polyakov and Chaiho Rim
Abstract: We use super-spectral curve to investigate irregular conformal states of integer and half-odd integer rank. The spectral curve is the loop equation of supersymmetrized irregular matrix model. The case of integer rank corresponds to the colliding limit of supersymmetric vertex operators of NS sector and half-odd integer to the Ramond sectors. The spectral curve is simply integrable at Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit and the partition function (inner product of irregular conformal state) is obtained from the superconformal structure manifest in the spectral curve. We present some explicit forms of the partition function of integer (NS sector) and of half-odd ranks (Ramond sector).
