Title: On the algebraic structure of Killing superalgebras
Authors: Jos√© Figueroa-O'Farrill and Andrea Santi
Abstract: We study the algebraic structure of the Killing superalgebra of a supersymmetric $11$-dimensional supergravity background and show that it is isomorphic to a filtered deformation of a $\mathbb Z$-graded subalgebra of the Poincar\'e superalgebra. We then re-interpret the classification problem for backgrounds which preserve more than half of the supersymmetry as the classification problem of certain admissible filtered subdeformations of the Poincar\'e superalgebra. In particular we relate the bosonic field equations of $11$-dimensional supergravity to the Jacobi identity of the Killing superalgebra and show in this way that preserving more than half the supersymmetry implies the bosonic field equations.
