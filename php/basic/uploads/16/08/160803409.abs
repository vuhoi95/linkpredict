Title: Equation of State in the Presence of Gravity
Authors: Hyeong-Chan Kim and Gungwon Kang
Abstract: We investigate how an equation of state for matter is affected when a gravity is present. For this purpose we consider a box of ideal gas in the presence of Newtonian gravity. In addition to the ordinary thermodynamic quantities, a characteristic variable which represents a weight per unit area relative to the average pressure is required in order to describe a macroscopic state of the gas. Although the density and pressure are not uniform due to the presence of gravity, the ideal gas law itself is satisfied for the thermodynamic quantities when averaged over the system. Assuming that the system follows an adiabatic process further, we obtain a {\it new} relation between the averaged pressure and density, which defers from the conventional equation of state for the ideal gas in the absence of gravity. Applying our results to a small volume in a Newtonian star, however, we find that the conventional one is reliable for most astrophysical situations when the characteristic scale is small. On the other hand, gravity effects become significant near the surface of a Newtonian star.
