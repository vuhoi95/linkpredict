Title: Liberation of quarks and spinons on domain walls: analogies between  gauge theories and quantum magnets
Authors: Tin Sulejmanpasic and Hui Shao and Anders Sandvik and Mithat Unsal
Abstract: In a spontaneously dimerized quantum antiferromagnet (a valence-bond-solid, VBS) in two or three dimensions, spin-1/2 excitations (spinons) are confined by strings akin to the strings confining quarks in non-abelian gauge theories. The VBS has multiple degenerate ground states (vacua) and domain walls between regions of inequivalent vacua. Here we demonstrate that, if the number of vacua is two, the spinons become liberated (deconfined) on the domain wall. This is in close analogy to gauge theories, where quarks deconfine on domain walls separating two vacua. We show that the deconfinement mechanism in the VBS is strikingly similar in certain regimes in which confining strings are composed out of domain walls. This remarkable analogy opens doors to improving our understanding of confinement by computational and experimental studies in quantum magnetism. As an illustration, we present a numerical demonstration of spinon deconfinement on domain walls in a two-dimensional quantum magnet.
