Title: Snyder-type spaces, twisted Poincaré algebra and addition of momenta
Authors: S. Meljanac and D. Meljanac and S. Mignemi and R. Štrajn
Abstract: We discuss the Snyder model from the Hopf algebroid point of view in terms of realisations and introduce a generalisation including all possible deformations compatible with Lorentz invariance. The corresponding deformed addition of momenta is obtained and analysed for all realisations. We calculate the twist and the $R$-matrix to first order in the deformation parameters for these models and also obtain the exact twist in the particular case of the Snyder realisation.
