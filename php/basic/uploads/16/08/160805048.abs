Title: A dynamical $Î±$-cluster model of $^{16}$O
Authors: C. J. Halcrow and C. King and N. S. Manton
Abstract: We calculate the low-lying spectrum of the $^{16}$O nucleus using an $\alpha$-cluster model which includes the important tetrahedral and square configurations. Our approach is motivated by the dynamics of $\alpha$-particle scattering in the Skyrme model. We are able to replicate the large energy splitting that is observed between states of identical spin but opposite parities, as well as introduce states that were previously not found in other cluster models, such as a $0^-$ state. We also provide a novel interpretation of the first excited state of $^{16}$O and make predictions for the energies of $6^-$ states that have yet to be observed experimentally.
