Authors: Zhongwen Feng and Yang Cheng and Xiaotao Zu
Abstract: Using Proca equation and WKB approximation, we investigate Hawking radiation of vector particles via tunneling from 4-dimensional Kerr-de Sitter black hole and 5-dimensional Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole. The results show that the tunneling rates and Hawking temperatures are depended on the properties of spacetime (event horizon, mass and angular momentum). Besides, our results are the same as scalars and fermions tunneling from 4-dimensional Kerr-de Sitter black hole and 5-dimensional Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole.
