Title: Random Field Theories in The Mirror Quintic Moduli Space
Authors: Kate Eckerle and Brian Greene
Abstract: We investigate the distribution of field theories that arise from the low energy limit of flux vacua built on type IIB string theory compactified on the mirror quintic. For a large collection of these models, we numerically determine the distribution of Taylor coefficients in a polynomial expansion of each model's scalar potential to fourth order, and show that they differ significantly from potentials generated by random choices of such coefficients over a flat measure.
