Title: Functional renormalisation group for the $U(1)-T_5^6$ TGFT with closure  constraint
Authors: Vincent Lahoche and Dine Ousmane Samary
Abstract: This paper is focused on the functional renormalization group applied to the $T_5^6$ tensor model on the Abelian group $U(1)$ with closure constraint. In a first time we derive the flow equations for the couplings and mass parameters in a suitable truncation around the marginal interactions with respect to the perturbative power counting. In a second time, we study the behavior around the Gaussian fixed point, and show that the theory in non-asymptotically free. Finally, we discuss the UV completion of the theory. We show the existence of several non-trivial fixed points, study the behavior of the renormalization group flow around them, and point out evidence in favor of an asymptotically safe theory.
