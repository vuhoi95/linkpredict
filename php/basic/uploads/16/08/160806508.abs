Title: Chirality oscillation of primordial gravitational waves during inflation
Authors: Yong Cai and Yu-Tong Wang and Yun-Song Piao
Abstract: We show that if the gravitational Chern-Simons term couples to a massive scalar field ($m>H$), the primordial gravitational waves (GWs) will show itself the chirality oscillation, i.e., the amplitudes of the left- and right-handed GWs modes will convert into each other and oscillate in their propagations. This oscillation will eventually develop a permanent difference of the amplitudes of both modes, which leads to nearly opposite oscillating shapes in the power spectra of the left- and right-handed primordial GWs. We discuss its implication to the CMB B-mode polarization.
