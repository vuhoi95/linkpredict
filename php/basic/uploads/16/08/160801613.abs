Title: On augmented superfield approach to vector Schwinger model
Authors: Saurabh Gupta and R. Kumar
Abstract: We exploit the techniques of Bonora-Tonin superfield formalism to derive the off-shell nilpotent and absolutely anticommuting (anti-)BRST as well as (anti-)co-BRST symmetry transformations for the (1+1)-dimensional (2D) bosonized vector Schwinger model. In the derivation of above symmetries, we invoke the (dual)-horizontality conditions as well as gauge and (anti-)co-BRST invariant restrictions on the superfields that are defined onto the (2, 2)-dimensional supermanifold. We provide geometrical interpretation of the above nilpotent symmetries (and their corresponding charges). We also express the nilpotency and absolute anticommutativity of the (anti-)BRST and (anti-)co-BRST charges within the framework of augmented superfield formalism.
