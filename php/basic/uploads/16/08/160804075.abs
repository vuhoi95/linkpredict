Title: Sound waves in the compactified D0-D4 brane system
Authors: Wenhe Cai and Si-wen Li
Abstract: As an extension to our previous work, we study the transport properties of the Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model in the black D4-brane background with smeared D0-branes (D0-D4/D8 system). Because of the presence of the D0-branes, in the bubble configuration this model is holographically dual to 4d QCD or Yang-Mills theory with a Chern-Simons term. And the number density of the D0-branes corresponds to the coupling constant ($\theta$ angle) of the Chern-Simons term in the dual field theory. In this paper, we accordingly focus on small number density of the D0-branes to study the sound mode in the black D0-D4 brane system since the coupling of the Chern-Simons term should be quite weak in QCD. Then we derive its 5d effective theory and analytically compute the speed of sound and the sound wave attenuation in the approach of Gauge/Gravity duality. Our result shows the speed of sound and the sound wave attenuation is modified by the presence of the D0-branes. Thus they depend on the $\theta$ angle or chiral potential in this holographic description.
