Title: Ghostbusters in higher derivative supersymmetric theories: who is afraid  of propagating auxiliary fields?
Authors: Toshiaki Fujimori and Muneto Nitta and Yusuke Yamada
Abstract: We present for the first time a ghost-free higher-derivative chiral model with a propagating auxiliary F-term field (highest component of the chiral multiplet). We obtain this model by removing a ghost in a higher derivative chiral model, with Higgsing it in terms of an auxiliary vector superfield. Depending on the sign of the quadratic derivative term of the chiral superfield, the model contains two ghost free branches of the parameter regions. We find that supersymmetry is spontaneously broken in one branch while it is preserved in the other branch. As a consequence of dynamical F-term field, a conserved U(1) charge corresponding to the number density of $F$ appears, which can be regarded as a generalization of the R-symmetry.
