Title: Generalized $Î»$-deformations of AdS_p x S^p
Authors: Yuri Chervonyi and Oleg Lunin
Abstract: We study analytical properties of the generalized $\lambda$-deformation, which modifies string theories while preserving integrability, and construct the explicit backgrounds corresponding to AdS_p x S^p, including the Ramond-Ramond fluxes. For an arbitrary coset, we find the general form of the R-matrix underlying the deformation, and prove that the dilaton is not modified by the deformation, while the frames are multiplied by a constant matrix. Our explicit solutions describe families of integrable string theories depending on several continuous parameters.
