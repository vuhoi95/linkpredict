Title: Wigner translations, sideways shift and massless spinning particles
Authors: Katarzyna Lason-Bolonek and Piotr Kosinski and Pawel Maslanka
Abstract: Recently (Phys. Rev. Lett. 114 (2015), 210402) the influence of "Wigner translations' on circularly polarized Gaussian packets has been studied. It has been shown that the Wigner translation have an effect of shifting the wave packet trajectory parallel to itself by an amount proportional to the photon helicity. This shift has been related to algebraic properties of Poincare generators. In this letter we present a simple proof, based on the properties of unitary representation of Poincare group, that the relation suggested above is valid for (almost) all electromagnetic field configuration. Comment concerning the generalization to higher helicities and the relation with old Pryce coordinate operator are given.
