Title: Multipartite Entanglement in Stabilizer Tensor Networks
Authors: Sepehr Nezami and Michael Walter
Abstract: Tensor network models reproduce important structural features of holography, including the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for the entanglement entropy and quantum error correction in the entanglement wedge. In contrast, only little is known about their multipartite entanglement structure, which has been of considerable recent interest. In this work, we study random stabilizer tensor networks and show that here the tripartite entanglement question has a sharp answer: The average number of GHZ triples that can be extracted from a stabilizer tensor network is small, implying that the entanglement is predominantly bipartite. As a consequence, we obtain a new operational interpretation of the monogamy of the Ryu-Takayanagi mutual information and an entropic diagnostic for higher-partite entanglement. Our technical contributions include a spin model for evaluating the average GHZ content of stabilizer tensor networks and a novel formula for the third moment of random stabilizer states.
