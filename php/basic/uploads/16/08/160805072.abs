Title: Reflection matrices with $U_q[osp^{(2)}(2|2m)]$ symmetry
Authors: R. S. Vieira and A. Lima-Santos
Abstract: In this work we report and classify the reflection $K$ matrices with the $U_{q}\left[\mathfrak{osp}^{(2)}\left(2|2m\right)\right]$ symmetry. This vertex model is the fermionic analogue of the Jimbo (bosonic) $U_{q}\left[D_{n+1}^{(2)}\right]$ vertex model. Both models are reductions of the most general $U_{q}\left[\mathfrak{osp}^{(2)}\left(2n+2|2m\right)\right]$ vertex model.
