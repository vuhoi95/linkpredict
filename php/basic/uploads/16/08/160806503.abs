Title: Hadronic Lorentz Violation in Chiral Perturbation Theory
Authors: Rasha Kamand and Brett Altschul and Matthias R. Schindler
Abstract: Any possible Lorentz violation in the hadron sector must be tied to Lorentz violation at the underlying quark level. The relationships between the theories at these two levels are studied using chiral perturbation theory. Starting from a two-flavor quark theory that includes dimension-four Lorentz-violation operators, the effective Lagrangians are derived for both pions and nucleons, with novel terms appearing in both sectors. Since the Lorentz violation coefficients for nucleons and pions are all related to a single set of underlying quark coefficients, it is possible to place approximate bounds on pion Lorentz violation using only proton and neutron observations. The resulting bounds on four pion parameters are at the $10^{-23}$ level, representing improvements of ten orders of magnitude.
