Title: Mass Deformed ABJM Theory on Three Sphere in Large N limit
Authors: Tomoki Nosaka and Kazuma Shimizu and Seiji Terashima
Abstract: In this paper the free energy of the mass deformed ABJM theory on S^3 in the large N limit is studied. We find new solutions of the large N saddle point equation which exist for an arbitrary value of the mass parameter, and compute the free energies for these solutions. We also show that the solution corresponding to an asymptotically AdS_4 geometry is singular at a certain value of the mass parameter and does not exist over this critical value. This result strongly suggest that the mass deformed ABJM theory on S^3 has no gravity dual for the mass parameter larger than the critical value.
