Title: Resumming the POPE at One Loop
Authors: Ho Tat Lam and Matt von Hippel
Abstract: The Pentagon Operator Product Expansion represents polygonal Wilson loops in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills in terms of a series of flux tube excitations for finite coupling. We demonstrate how to re-sum this series at the one loop level for the hexagonal Wilson loop dual to the six-point MHV amplitude. By summing over a series of effective excitations we find expressions which integrate to logarithms and polylogarithms, reproducing the known one-loop result.
