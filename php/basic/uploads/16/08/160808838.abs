Title: Gravitational relaxation of electroweak hierarchy problem
Authors: Hiroki Matsui and Yoshio Matsumoto
Abstract: The current status of the LHC experiments has aggravated the electroweak hierarchy problem as severe as the cosmological constant problem. Therefore, recently, theoretically different approaches to the electroweak hierarchy problem have been explored. In the present paper, we formulate several gravitational relaxation scenarios for the electroweak hierarchy problem. These scenarios assume that the frame of the the high-energy theory is essentially different from the frame of the Standard Model and the dimensional parameters as the Higgs boson mass or the cosmological constant depend on the parameter of the conformal transformation. Therefore, the Higgs boson mass and the cosmological constant of the ultraviolet (UV) cut-off scale order are sufficiently suppressed and sequestered via the conformal transformation. In these scenarios, the electroweak scale becomes natural without invoking supersymmetry or any other new physics at the low-energy scale by requiring modification of the gravitational sector.
