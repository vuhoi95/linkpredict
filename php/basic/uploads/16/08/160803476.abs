Title: Anomalous transport in second order hydrodynamics
Authors: Eugenio Megias and Manuel Valle
Abstract: We study the non-dissipative transport effects appearing at second order in the hydrodynamic expansion for a non-interacting gas of chiral fermions by using the partition function formalism. We discuss some features of the corresponding constitutive relations, derive the explicit expressions for the conductivities and compare with existing results in the literature.
