Title: Towards Holographic Quantum Energy Teleportation
Authors: Dimitrios Giataganas and Feng-Li Lin and Pei-Hua Liu
Abstract: We propose a simplified protocol of quantum energy teleportation (QET) for holographic conformal field theory (CFT) in 3-dimensional anti-de Sitter space with or without black hole. As a tentative proposal, we simplify the standard QET by replacing Alice's local measurement with the local projection, which excites the system from ground state into a particular state dual to a Banados geometry. We then mimic Bob's local operation of the usual QET for extracting energy by deforming the UV surface with a local bump. Adopting the surface/state duality this deformation corresponds to local unitary. We evaluate the extraction of energy from the holographic stress tensor, and find that Bob always gains energy extraction in our protocol. This could be related to the positive energy theorem of the dual gravity. Moreover, the ratio of extraction energy to injection one is a universal function of the UV surface deformation profile.
