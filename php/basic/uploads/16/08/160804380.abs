Title: Anti-de Sitter particles and manifest (super)isometries
Authors: Alex S. Arvanitakis and Alec E. Barns-Graham and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: Starting from the classical action for a spin-zero particle in a D-dimensional anti-Sitter (AdS) spacetime, we recover the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound by quantization. For D=4,5,7 we find a simple bi-twistor form of the action; the AdS isometry group is linearly realized but only for zero mass when D=4,7, in agreement with previous constructions. For zero mass and D=4, the conformal isometry group is linearly realized. We extend these results to the superparticle in the maximally supersymmetric "AdS x S" string/M-theory vacua, showing that quantization yields a 128+128 component supermultiplet. We also extend them to the null string.
