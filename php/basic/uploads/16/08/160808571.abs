Title: The Analytical Solution of the Schrödinger Particle in Multiparameter  Potential
Authors: Ahmet Taş and Ali Havare
Abstract: In this study, we present analytical solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation with the Multiparameter potential containing the different types of physical potential via the asymptotic iteration method (AIM) by applying a Pekeris-type approximation to the centrifugal potential. For any n and l (states) quantum numbers, we get the bound state energy eigenvalues numerically and the corresponding eigenfunctions.Furthermore, we compare our results with the ones obtained in previous works and it is seen that our numerical results are in good agreement with the literature.
