Abstract: Several time dependent backgrounds, with perfect fluid matter, can be used to construct solutions of Einstein equations in the presence of a negative cosmological constant along with some matter sources. In this work we focus on the non-vacuum Kasner-AdS geometry and its solitonic generalization. To characterize these space-times, we provide ways to embed them in higher dimensional flat space-times. General space-like geodesics are then studied and used to compute the two point boundary correlators within the geodesic approximation.
