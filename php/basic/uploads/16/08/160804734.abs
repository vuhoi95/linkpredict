Title: Black hole thermodynamics, stringy dualities and double field theory
Authors: Alex S. Arvanitakis and Chris D. A. Blair
Abstract: We discuss black hole thermodynamics in the manifestly duality invariant formalism of double field theory (DFT). We reformulate and prove the first law of black hole thermodynamics in DFT, using the covariant phase space approach. After splitting the full O(D, D) invariant DFT into a Kaluza-Klein-inspired form where only n coordinates are doubled, our results provide explicit duality invariant mass and entropy formulas. We illustrate how this works by discussing the black fundamental string solution and its T-duals.
