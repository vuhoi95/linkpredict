Title: Scattering of Fermions by Gravitons
Authors: S. C. Ulhoa and A. F. Santos and Faqir C. Khanna
Abstract: The interaction between gravitons and fermions is investigated in the teleparallel gravity. The scattering of fermions and gravitons in the weak field approximation is analyzed. The transition amplitudes of M$\varnothing$ller, Compton and new gravitational scattering are calculated.
