Title: Quantized Coulomb branches of Jordan quiver gauge theories and  cyclotomic rational Cherednik algebras
Authors: Ryosuke Kodera and Hiraku Nakajima
Abstract: We study quantized Coulomb branches of quiver gauge theories of Jordan type. We prove that the quantized Coulomb branch is isomorphic to the spherical graded Cherednik algebra in the unframed case, and is isomorphic to the spherical cyclotomic rational Cherednik algebra in the framed case. We also prove that the quantized Coulomb branch is a deformation of a subquotient of the Yangian of the affine $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$.
