Title: Nekrasov and Argyres-Douglas theories in spherical Hecke algebra  representation
Authors: Chaiho Rim and Hong Zhang
Abstract: AGT conjecture connects Nekrasov instanton partition function of 4D quiver gauge theory with 2D Liouville conformal blocks. We re-investigate this connection using the central extension of spherical Hecke algebra in q-coordinate representation, q being the instanton expansion parameter. Based on AFLT basis together with Matsuo's interwiner we construct gauge conformal state and demonstrate its equivalence to the Liouville conformal state with careful attention to the proper scaling behavior of the state. Using the colliding limit of regular states, we obtain the formal expression of irregular conformal states corresponding to Argyres-Douglas theory which involves summation of functions over Young diagrams.
