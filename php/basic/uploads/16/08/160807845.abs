Title: Quantum cat map dynamics on AdS$_2$
Authors: Minos Axenides and Emmanuel Floratos and Stam Nicolis
Abstract: We present a toy model for the chaotic unitary scattering of single particle wave packets on the radial AdS$_2$ geometry of extremal BH horizons. Based on our recent work on the discretization of the AdS$_2$ space-time, which describes a finite and random geometry, by modular arithmetic, we investigate the validity of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), as well as that of the fast scrambling time bound (STB), for an observer with time evolution operator the quantum Arnol'd cat map (QACM). We present arguments that the QACM is ergodic and mixing, while at the same time, it preserves memories due to unitarity and other possible symmetries. We find that the QACM, while possessing a linear spectrum, has eigenstates, which can be expressed in closed form, are random and satisfy the assumptions of the ETH. The implications are that the dynamics is described by a chaotic, unitary, single particle S-matrix, which completely delocalizes and randomizes initial gaussian wave packets. Applying results obtained by Dyson and Falk for the periods of the Arnol'd Cat Map(ACM),which are related to its mixing time, we also find that the thermalization of infalling wave packets in this particular model is exponentially fast, thereby saturating the STB, under the constraint that the finite dimension of the single--particle Hilbert space takes values in the set of Fibonacci integers.
