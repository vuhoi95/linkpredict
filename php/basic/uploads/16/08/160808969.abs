Title: Domestic Axion
Authors: Gia Dvali and Lena Funcke
Abstract: We attempt to identify a phenomenologically viable solution to the strong $CP$ problem in which the axion is composed entirely out of Standard Model fermion species. The axion consists predominantly of the $\eta'$ meson with a minuscule admixture of a pseudoscalar bilinear composite of neutrinos, $\eta_{\nu}$. The Peccei-Quinn symmetry is an axial symmetry that acts on the up quark and the neutrino species and is spontaneously broken by the QCD condensate of quarks as well as the condensate of neutrinos triggered by chiral gravitational anomaly. The up-quark mass is spontaneously generated by the neutrino condensate which plays the role of an additional composite Higgs doublet with the compositeness scale of the order of the neutrino masses. Such a scenario is highly economical: it solves the strong $CP$ problem, generates the up-quark and neutrino masses from fermion condensates and simultaneously protects the axion shift symmetry against gravitational anomaly. The phenomenology is different from the standard hidden axion case. One of the experimental signatures is the existence of a gravity-competing isotope-dependent attractive force among nucleons at (sub)micron distances.
