Title: Phase transition and critical phenomena of black holes: A general  approach
Authors: Abhijit Mandal and Saurav Samanta and Bibhas Ranjan Majhi
Abstract: We present a general framework to study the phase transition of a black hole. Assuming that there is a phase transition, it is shown that without invoking any specific black hole, the critical exponents and the scaling powers can be obtained. We find that the values are exactly same which were calculated by taking explicit forms of different black hole spacetimes. The reason for this universality is also explained. The implication of the analysis is -- one does not need to investigate this problem case by case, what the people are doing right now. We also observe that these, except two such quantities, are independent of the details of the spacetime dimensions.
