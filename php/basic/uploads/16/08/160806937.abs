Title: Nonrelativistic Short-Distance Completions of a Naturally Light Higgs
Authors: Kevin T. Grosvenor and Petr Horava and Christopher J. Mogni and Ziqi Yan
Abstract: Nonrelativistic scalar field theories can exhibit a natural cascading hierarchy of scales, protected by a hierarchy of polynomial shift symmetries. Using a simple model, we argue that a high-energy cross-over to such nonrelativistic behavior naturally leads to light scalars, and thus represents a useful ingredient for technically natural resolutions of scalar mass hierarchies, perhaps even the Higgs mass hierarchy puzzle.
