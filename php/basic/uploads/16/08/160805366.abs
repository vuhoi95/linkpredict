Title: Quantum backreaction on a rotating BTZ black hole
Authors: Marc Casals and Alessandro Fabbri and Cristián Martínez and Jorge Zanelli
Abstract: We investigate semiclassical backreaction on a rotating BTZ black hole geometry produced by a conformally coupled quantum scalar field. We obtain the backreacted metric in analytic form. This allows us to explore the quantum effects on various regions of relevance for a rotating black hole space-time. We find that for given values of mass and angular momentum, quantum effects lead to a growth of both the event horizon and the radius of the ergosphere, and to a reduction of the angular velocity, compared to the unperturbed values. Furthermore, quantum effects give rise to the formation of a curvature singularity at the Cauchy horizon but show no evidence of a superradiant instability.
