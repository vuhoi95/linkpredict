Title: On a New Approach for Constructing Wormholes in Einstein-Born-Infeld  Gravity
Authors: Jin Young Kim and Mu-In Park
Abstract: We study a new approach for the wormhole construction in Einstein-Born-Infeld gravity, which does not require exotic matters in the Einstein equation. The Born-Infeld field equation is not modified from "coordinate independent" conditions of continuous metric tensor and its derivatives, even though the Born-Infeld fields have discontinuities in their derivatives at the throat in general. We study the relation of the newly introduced conditions with the usual continuity equation for the energy-momentum tensor and the gravitational Bianchi identity. We find that there is no violation of energy conditions for the Born-Infeld fields contrary to the usual approaches. The exoticity of energy-momentum tensor is not essential for sustaining wormholes. Some open problems are discussed.
