Title: Non-geometric Five-branes in Heterotic Supergravity
Authors: Shin Sasaki and Masaya Yata
Abstract: We study T-duality chains of five-branes in heterotic supergravity where the first order $\alpha'$-corrections are present. By performing the $\alpha'$-corrected T-duality transformations of the heterotic NS5-brane solutions, we obtain the KK5-brane and the exotic $5^2_2$-brane solutions associated with the symmetric, the neutral and the gauge NS5-branes. We find that the Yang-Mills gauge field in these solutions satisfies the self-duality condition in the three- and two-dimensional transverse spaces to the brane world-volumes. The $O(2,2)$ monodromy structures of the $5^2_2$-brane solutions are investigated by the $\alpha'$-corrected generalized metric. Our analysis shows that the symmetric $5^2_2$-brane solution, which satisfies the standard embedding condition, is a T-fold and it exhibits the non-geometric nature. We also find that the neutral $5^2_2$-brane solution is a T-fold at least at $\mathcal{O} (\alpha')$. On the other hand, the gauge $5^2_2$-brane solution is not a T-fold but show unusual structures of space-time.
