Abstract: We demonstrate an equivalence between the wave equation obeyed by the entanglement entropy of CFT subregions and the linearized bulk Einstein equation in Anti-de Sitter pace. In doing so, we make use of the formalism of kinematic space [arXiv:1505.05515] and fields on this space, introduced in [arXiv:1604.03110]. We show that the gravitational dynamics are equivalent to a gauge invariant wave-equation on kinematic space and that this equation arises in natural correspondence to the conformal Casimir equation in the CFT.
