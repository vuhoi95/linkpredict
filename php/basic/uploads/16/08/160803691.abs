Title: Dark Side of the Standard Model: Dormant New Physics Awaken
Authors: Shinya Matsuzaki and Hiroshi Ohki and Koichi Yamawaki
Abstract: We find that the standard model as it stands possesses a dark matter candidate, dormant "dark-standard model-skyrmion", which is stabilized by the dynamical gauge boson of the hidden local symmetry, "standard-model rho meson", hidden in the standard model.
