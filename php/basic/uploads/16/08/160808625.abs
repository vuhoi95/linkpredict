Title: Low Scale Inflation at High Energy Colliders and Meson Factories
Authors: Joseph Bramante and Jessica Cook and Antonio Delgado and Adam Martin
Abstract: Inflation occurring at energy densities less than (10$^{14}$ GeV)$^4$ produces tensor perturbations too small to be measured by cosmological surveys. However, we show that it is possible to probe low scale inflation by measuring the mass of the inflaton at low energy experiments. Detection prospects and cosmological constraints are determined for low scale quartic hilltop models of inflation paired with a curvaton field, which imprints the spectrum of scalar perturbations observed in large scale structure and on the cosmic microwave background. With cosmological constraints applied, low scale quartic inflation at energies GeV--PeV, can be mapped to an MeV--TeV mass inflaton resonance, discoverable through a Higgs portal coupling at upcoming collider and meson decay experiments. It is demonstrated that low scale inflatons can have detectably large couplings to Standard Model particles through a Higgs portal, permitting prompt reheating after inflation, without spoiling, through radiative corrections to the inflaton's self-coupling, the necessary flatness of a low scale inflationary potential. A characteristic particle spectrum for a quartic inflaton-curvaton pair is identified: to within an order of magnitude, the mass of the curvaton can be predicted from the mass of the inflaton, and vice-versa. Low scale inflation Higgs portal sensitivity targets are found for experiments like the LHC, SHiP, BEPC, and KEKB.
