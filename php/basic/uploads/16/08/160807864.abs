Title: N=4 and N=8 SUSY Quantum Mechanics and Klein's Vierergruppe
Authors: S. James Gates and Tristan HÃ¼bsch and Kevin Iga and Stefan Mendez-Diez
Abstract: Sets of signed permutation matrices satisfying the GR(4,4) algebra are shown to be, up to sign, left cosets of Klein's famous Vierergruppe. In this way we verify the count done by computer in 2012, and set it in a more significant mathematical context. A similar analysis works for GR(1,1), GR(2,2) and GR(8,8).
