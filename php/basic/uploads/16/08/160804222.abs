Title: Half-BPS half-BPS twist two at four loops in N=4 SYM
Authors: Burkhard Eden and Felix Paul
Abstract: We consider a double OPE limit of the planar four-point function of stress tensor multiplets in N = 4 SYM theory. Loop integrands for this correlator have been constructed to very high order, but the corresponding integrals are explicitly known only up to three loops. Fortunately, the double coincidence limit of the four-loop integrals can be found by the method of expansion by regions, which reduces the problem of computing the four-point integrals to the evaluation of a large set of massless propagator integrals. These can in turn be evaluated by IBP reduction. The OPE limit of the stress tensor four-point function allows us to extract the (square of the) three-point couplings between two stress tensor multiplets and one twist two operator in the 20' of SU(4). The latest available IBP software accomplishes this task up to and including spin 8. With the data obtained we hope to further the development of the recent integrable systems picture for correlation functions.
