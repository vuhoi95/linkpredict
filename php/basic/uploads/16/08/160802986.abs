Title: Radial excitations of current-carrying vortices
Authors: Betti Hartmann and Florent Michel and Patrick Peter
Abstract: We report on the existence of a new type of cosmic string solutions in the Witten model with U(1)xU(1) symmetry. These solutions are superconducting with radially excited condensates that exist for both gauge and ungauged currents. Our results suggest that these new configurations can be macroscopically stable, but microscopically unstable to radial perturbations. Nevertheless, they might have important consequences for the network evolution and particle emission. We discuss these effects and their possible signatures. We also comment on analogies with non-relativistic condensed matter %models systems where these solutions may be observable.
