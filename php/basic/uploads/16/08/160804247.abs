Title: Note on the speed of GW150914 in gravity's rainbow
Authors: Bogeun Gwak and Wontae Kim and Bum-Hoon Lee
Abstract: Without breaking Lorentz invariance, we investigate the speed of graviton in event GW150914 by using the modified dispersion relation from gravity's rainbow. The proper range of the parameter in the modified dispersion relation is determined by taking into account the gap between the speed of the graviton and that obtained from event GW150914.
