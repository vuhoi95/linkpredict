Title: Dark Solitons, D-branes and Noncommutative Tachyon Field Theory
Authors: Stefano Giaccari and Jun Nian
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the boson/vortex duality by mapping the Gross-Pitaevskii theory into an effective string theory, both with and without boundaries. Through the effective string theory, we find the Seiberg-Witten map between the commutative and the noncommutative tachyon field theories, and consequently identify their soliton solutions with the D-branes in the effective string theory. We perform various checks of the duality map and the identification of classical solutions. This new insight of the duality between the Gross-Pitaevskii theory and the effective string theory allows us to test many results of string theory in Bose-Einstein condensates, and at the same time help us understand the quantum behavior of superfluids and cold atom systems.
