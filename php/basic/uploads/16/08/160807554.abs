Title: Tools for CICYs in F-theory
Authors: Lara B. Anderson and Xin Gao and James Gray and Seung-Joo Lee
Abstract: We provide a set of tools for analyzing the geometry of elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau manifolds, starting with a description of the total space rather than with a Weierstrass model or a specified type of fiber/base. Such an approach to the subject of F-theory compactification makes certain geometric properties, which are usually hidden, manifest. Specifically, we review how to isolate genus-one fibrations in such geometries and then describe how to find their sections explicitly. This includes a full parameterization of the Mordell-Weil group where non-trivial. We then describe how to analyze the associated Weierstrass models, Jacobians and resolved geometries. We illustrate our discussion with concrete examples which are complete intersections in products of projective spaces (CICYs). The examples presented include cases exhibiting non-abelian symmetries and higher rank Mordell-Weil group. We also make some comments on non-flat fibrations in this context. In a companion paper [1] to this one, these results will be used to analyze the consequences for string dualities of the ubiquity of multiple fibrations in known constructions of Calabi-Yau manifolds.
