Title: Semi-analytic techniques for calculating bubble wall profiles
Authors: Sujeet Akula and Csaba Bal√°zs and Graham A. White
Abstract: We present semi-analytic techniques for finding bubble wall profiles during first order phase transitions with multiple scalar fields. Our method involves reducing the problem to an equation with a single field, finding an analytic solution and perturbing around it. The perturbations can be written in a semi-analytic form. We argue that our technique lacks convergence problems and demonstrate the speed of convergence on an example potential.
