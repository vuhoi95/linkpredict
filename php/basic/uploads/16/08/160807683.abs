Abstract: We show that the Pauli exclusion principle in a system of $M0$-branes can give rise to the expansion and contraction of the universe which is located on an $M3$-brane. We start with a system of $M0$-branes with high symmetry, which join mutually and form pairs of $M1$-anti-$M1$-branes. The resulting symmetry breaking creates gauge fields that live on the $M1$-branes and play the role of graviton tensor modes, which induce an attractive force between the $M1$ and anti-$M1$ branes. Consequently, the gauge fields that live on the $M1$-branes, and the scalar fields which are attached symmetrically to all parts of these branes, decay to fermions that attach anti-symmetrically to the upper and lower parts of the branes, and hence the Pauli exclusion principle emerges. By closing $M1$-branes mutually, the curvatures produced by parallel spins will be different from the curvatures produced by anti-parallel spins, and this leads to an inequality between the number of degrees of freedom on the boundary surface and the number of degrees of freedom in the bulk region. This behavior is inherited in the $M3$-brane on which the universe is located, and hence this leads to the emergence of the universe expansion and contraction. In this sense, the Pauli exclusion principle rules the cosmic dynamics.
