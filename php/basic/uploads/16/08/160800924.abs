Title: Quasi locality of the GGE in interacting-to-free quenches in  relativistic field theories
Authors: Alvise Bastianello and Spyros Sotiriadis
Abstract: We study the quench dynamics in continuous relativistic quantum field theory, more specifically the locality properties of the large time stationary state. After a quantum quench in a one-dimensional integrable model, the expectation values of local observables are expected to relax to a Generalised Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), constructed out of the conserved charges of the model. Quenching to a free bosonic theory, it has been shown that the system indeed relaxes to a GGE described by the momentum mode occupation numbers. Here we address the question whether the latter can be equivalently described by a GGE constructed with only local charges. We show that, in marked contrast to the lattice case, this is always impossible in continuous field theories and instead the recently discovered quasilocal charges are necessary. In particular we show that the discrepancy between the exact steady state and the local GGE is clearly manifested as a difference in the large distance behaviour of the two point correlation function. Lastly we study in detail the locality properties of the quasilocal charges that are needed in order to construct the correct GGE.
