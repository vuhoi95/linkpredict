Title: Noncommutative Deformations of Locally Symmetric KÃ¤hler manifolds
Authors: Kentaro Hara and Akifumi Sako
Abstract: We derive algebraic recurrence relations to obtain a deformation quantization with separation of variables for a locally symmetric K\"ahler manifold. This quantization method is one of the ways to perform a deformation quantization of K\"ahler manifolds, which is introduced by Karabegov. From the recurrence relations, concrete expressions of star products for one-dimensional local symmetric K\"ahler manifolds and ${\mathbb C}P^N$ are constructed. The recurrence relations for a Grassmann manifold $G_{2,2}$ are closely studied too.
