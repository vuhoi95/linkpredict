Title: Deformed symmetries in noncommutative and multifractional spacetimes
Authors: Gianluca Calcagni and Michele Ronco
Abstract: We clarify the relation between noncommutative spacetimes and multifractional geometries where the spacetime dimension changes with the probed scale. In the absence of curvature and comparing the symmetries of both position and momentum space, we show that $\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime and the commutative multifractional theory with $q$-derivatives are physically inequivalent but they admit several contact points that allow one to describe certain aspects of $\kappa$-Minkowski noncommutative geometry as a multifractional theory and vice versa. Contrary to previous literature, this result holds without assuming any specific measure for $\kappa$-Minkowski. More generally, no well-defined $\star$-product can be constructed from the $q$-theory, although the latter does admit a natural noncommutative extension with a given deformed Poincar\'e algebra. A similar no-go theorem may be valid for all multiscale theories with factorizable measures. Turning gravity on, we write the algebras of gravitational first-class constraints in the multifractional theories with $q$- and weighted derivatives and discuss their differences with respect to the deformed algebras of $\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime and of loop quantum gravity.
