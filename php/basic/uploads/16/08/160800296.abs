Title: Continuous point symmetries in Group Field Theories
Authors: Alexander Kegeles and Daniele Oriti
Abstract: We discuss the notion of symmetries in non-local field theories characterized by integro-differential equations of motion, from a geometric perspective. We then focus on Group Field Theory (GFT) models of quantum gravity and provide a general analysis of their continuous point symmetry transformations, including the generalized conservation laws following from them.
