Title: Absence of conical singularities in beyond-generalized Proca theories
Authors: Lavinia Heisenberg and Ryotaro Kase and Shinji Tsujikawa
Abstract: In Gleyzes-Langlois-Piazza-Vernizzi (GLPV) scalar-tensor theories, which are outside the domain of second-order Horndeski theories, it is known that there exists a conical singularity in the case where the parameter $\alpha_{\rm H}$ characterizing the deviation from Horndeski theories approaches a non-vanishing constant at the center of a spherically symmetric body. Meanwhile, it was recently shown that second-order generalized Proca theories with a massive vector field $A^{\mu}$ can be consistently extended to beyond-generalized Proca theories, which recover the shift-symmetric GLPV theories in the scalar limit $A^{\mu} \to \nabla^{\mu} \chi$. In beyond-generalized Proca theories up to quartic-order Lagrangians, we show that the conical singularity is generally absent due to the existence of the temporal vector component. We also derive the vector-field profiles around a compact object and show that the success of the Vainshtein mechanism operated by vector Galileons is not prevented by the new interaction in beyond generalized Proca theories.
