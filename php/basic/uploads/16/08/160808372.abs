Title: Axion decay constants at special points in type II string theory
Authors: Masaki Honda and Akane Oikawa and Hajime Otsuka
Abstract: We propose the mechanism to disentangle the decay constant of closed string axion from the string scale in the framework of type II string theory on Calabi-Yau manifold. We find that the quantum and geometrical corrections in the prepotential that arise at some special points in the moduli space widen the window of axion decay constant. In particular, around the small complex structure points, the axion decay constant becomes significantly lower than the string scale. We also discuss the moduli stabilization leading to the phenomenologically attractive low-scale axion decay constant.
