Title: The connected prescription for form factors in twistor space
Authors: Andreas Brandhuber and Edward Hughes and Rodolfo Panerai and Bill Spence and Gabriele Travaglini
Abstract: We propose a connected prescription formula in twistor space for all tree-level form factors of the stress tensor multiplet operator in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills, which is a generalisation of the expression of Roiban, Spradlin and Volovich for superamplitudes. By introducing link variables, we show that our formula is identical to the recently proposed four-dimensional scattering equations for form factors. Similarly to the case of amplitudes, the link representation of form factors is shown to be directly related to BCFW recursion relations, and is considerably more tractable than the scattering equations. We also discuss how our results are related to a recent Grassmannian formulation of form factors, and comment on a possible derivation of our formula from ambitwistor strings.
