Title: One-loop Wilson loops and the particle-interface potential in AdS/dCFT
Authors: Marius de Leeuw and Asger C. Ipsen and Charlotte Kristjansen and Matthias Wilhelm
Abstract: We initiate the calculation of quantum corrections to Wilson loops in a class of four-dimensional defect conformal field theories with vacuum expectation values based on N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. Concretely, we consider an infinite straight Wilson line, obtaining explicit results for the one-loop correction to its expectation value. This allows us to extract the particle-interface potential of the theory. We compare our results to those of a previous calculation in the dual string-theory set-up consisting of a D5-D3 probe-brane system with flux. We find perfect agreement in a double-scaling limit.
