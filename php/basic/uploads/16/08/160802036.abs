Title: Pre-potential in the $AdS_{5}\,\times\,S^{5}$ Type IIB superspace
Authors: Martin Poláček and Warren Siegel
Abstract: We found the pre-potential in the superspace with $AdS_{5}\,\times\,S^{5}$ background. The pre-potential appears as part of the vielbeins, without derivatives. The space-cone gauge destroys the bulk Lorentz covariance, but still preserves boundary Lorentz covariance (projective superspace) $SO\,(\,3,\,1\,)\,\otimes\,SO\,(\,4\,)$, i.e. symmetries of boundary CFT are manifest.
