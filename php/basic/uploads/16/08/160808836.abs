Title: Pomeron - Odderon interactions in a reggeon field theory
Authors: J. Bartels and C. Contreras and G. P. Vacca
Abstract: In this paper we extend our recent non perturbative functional renormalization group analysis of Reggeon Field Theory to the interactions of Pomeron and Odderon fields. We establish the existence of a fixed point and its universal properties, which exhibits a novel symmetry structure in the space of Odderon-Pomeron interactions. As in our previous analysis, this part of our program aims at the investigation of the IR limit of reggeon field theory (the limit of high energies and large transverse distances). It should be seen in the broader context of trying to connect the nonperturbative infrared region (large transverse distances) with the UV region of small transverse distances where the high energy limit of perturbative QCD applies.
