Title: Modeling the Dispersion and Polarization Content of Gravitational Waves  for Tests of General Relativity
Authors: Rhondale Tso and Maximiliano Isi and Yanbei Chen and Leo Stein
Abstract: We propose a generic, phenomenological approach to modifying the dispersion of gravitational waves, independent of corrections to the generation mechanism. This model-independent approach encapsulates all previously proposed parametrizations, including Lorentz violation in the Standard-Model Extension, and provides a roadmap for additional theories. Furthermore, we present a general approach to include modulations to the gravitational-wave polarization content. The framework developed here can be implemented in existing data analysis pipelines for future gravitational-wave observation runs.
