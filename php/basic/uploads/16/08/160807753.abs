Title: Exact solutions of (0,2) Landau-Ginzburg models
Authors: Abhijit Gadde and Pavel Putrov
Abstract: In this paper we study the low energy physics of Landau-Ginzburg models with N=(0,2) supersymmetry. We exhibit a number of classes of relatively simple LG models where the conformal field theory at the low energy fixed point can be explicitly identified. One interesting class of fixed points can be thought of as "heterotic" minimal models. Other examples include N=(0,2) renormalization group flows that end up at N=(2,2) minimal models and models with non-abelian symmetry.
