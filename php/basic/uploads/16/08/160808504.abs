Title: Abelian Yang-Baxter Deformations and TsT transformations
Authors: David Osten and Stijn J. van Tongeren
Abstract: We prove that abelian Yang-Baxter deformations of superstring coset sigma models are equivalent to sequences of commuting TsT transformations, meaning T dualities and coordinate shifts. Our results extend also to fermionic deformations and fermionic T duality, and naturally lead to a TsT subgroup of the superduality group OSp(d_b,d_b|2d_f). In cases like AdS_5 x S^5, fermionic deformations necessarily lead to complex models. As an illustration of inequivalent deformations, we give all six abelian deformations of AdS_3. We comment on the possible dual field theory interpretation of these (super-)TsT models.
