Abstract: We investigate the spacetime properties of BTZ black holes in Maxwell field and BornInfeld field and find rich properties in the spacetime structures when the model parameters vary. Employing the Landau-Lifshitz theory, we examine the thermodynamical phase transition in the charged BTZ holes. We further study the dynamical perturbation in the background of the charged BTZ black holes and find different properties of dynamical perturbations for the extreme and nonextreme charged BTZ black holes, which can serve as a new physical signal to indicate the phase transition between them.
