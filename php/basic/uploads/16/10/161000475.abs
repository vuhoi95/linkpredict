Title: A Study of the H-dibaryon in Holographic QCD
Authors: Kohei Matsumoto and Yuya Nakagawa and Hideo Suganuma
Abstract: We study the H-dibaryon (uuddss) in holographic QCD for the first time. Holographic QCD is derived from a QCD-equivalent D-brane system ($S^1$-compactified D4/D8/$\overline{\rm D8}$) in the superstring theory via the gauge/gravity correspondence. In holographic QCD, all baryons appear as topological chiral solitons of Nambu-Goldstone bosons and (axial) vector mesons. In this framework, the H-dibaryon can be described as an SO(3)-type hedgehog state. We present the formalism of the H-dibaryon in holographic QCD, and perform the calculation to investigate its properties in the chiral limit.
