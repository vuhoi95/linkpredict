Title: General expressions for extra-dimensional tree amplitudes and all-plus  1-loop integrands in Q-cut representaion
Authors: Yang An and Yi Li
Abstract: In this paper, we give the general expressions for a special series of tree amplitudes of the Yang-Mills theory. This series of amplitudes have two adjacent massless spin-1 particle with extra-dimensional momenta and any number of positive helicity gluons. With special helicity choices, we use the spinor helicity formalism to express these n-point amplitudes in compact forms, and find a clever way to use the BCFW recursion relations to prove the results. Then these amplitudes are used to compute the 1-loop all-plus integrand with any number of gluons using the Q-cut construction.
