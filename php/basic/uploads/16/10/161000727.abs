Title: Modifications to Holographic Entanglement Entropy in Warped CFT
Authors: Wei Song and Qiang Wen and Jianfei Xu
Abstract: In arXiv:1601.02634 it was observed that asymptotic boundary conditions play an important role in the study of holographic entanglement beyond AdS/CFT. In particular, the Ryu-Takayanagi proposal must be modified for warped AdS$_3$ (WAdS$_3$) with Dirichlet boundary conditions. In this paper, we consider AdS$_3$ and WAdS$_3$ with Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions. The conjectured holographic duals are warped conformal field theories (WCFTs), featuring a Virasoro-Kac-Moody algebra. We provide a holographic calculation of the entanglement entropy and R\'{e}nyi entropy using AdS$_3$/WCFT and WAdS$_3$/WCFT dualities. Our bulk results are consistent with the WCFT results derived by Castro-Hofman-Iqbal using the Rindler method. Comparing with arXiv:1601.02634, we explicitly show that the holographic entanglement entropy is indeed affected by boundary conditions. Both results differ from the Ryu-Takayanagi proposal, indicating new relations between spacetime geometry and quantum entanglement for holographic dualities beyond AdS/CFT.
