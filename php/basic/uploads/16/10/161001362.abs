Title: Thermality and excited state RÃ©nyi entropy in two-dimensional CFT
Authors: Feng-Li Lin and Huajia Wang and Jia-ju Zhang
Abstract: We evaluate one-interval R\'enyi entropy and entanglement entropy for the excited states of two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) on a cylinder, and examine their differences from the ones for the thermal state. We assume the interval to be short so that we can use operator product expansion (OPE) of twist operators to calculate R\'enyi entropy in terms of sum of one-point functions of OPE blocks. We find that the entanglement entropy for highly excited state and thermal state behave the same way after appropriate identification of the conformal weight of the state with the temperature. However, there exists no such universal identification for the R\'enyi entropy in the short-interval expansion. Therefore, the highly excited state does not look thermal when comparing its R\'enyi entropy to the thermal state one. As the R\'enyi entropy captures the higher moments of the reduced density matrix but the entanglement entropy only the average, our results imply that the emergence of thermality depends on how refined we look into the entanglement structure of the underlying pure excited state.
