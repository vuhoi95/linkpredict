Title: The information recovery problem

Abstract: The problem of rescuing unitary matter evolution on a black hole spacetime remains unresolved. We argue that some prominent cures are more troubling than the disease, demonstrate that their central element --- forming of the event horizon before the evaporation begins --- is not necessarily true, and describe a fully coupled matter-gravity system which is manifestly unitary.
