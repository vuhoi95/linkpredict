Title: The gyraton solutions on generalized Melvin universe with cosmological  constant
Authors: Hedvika Kadlecová and Pavel Krtouš
Abstract: We present and analyze new exact gyraton solutions of algebraic type II on generalized Melvin universe of type D which admit non-vanishing cosmological constant $\Lambda$. We show that it generalizes both, gyraton solutions on Melvin and on direct product spacetimes. When we set $\Lambda = 0$ we get solutions on Melvin spacetime and for $\Sigma = 1$ we obtain solutions on direct product spacetimes. We demonstrate that the solutions are member of the Kundt family of spacetimes as its subcases. We show that the Einstein equations reduce to a set of equations on the transverse 2-space. We also discuss the polynomial scalar invariants which are non-constant in general but constant for sub-solutions on direct product spacetimes.
