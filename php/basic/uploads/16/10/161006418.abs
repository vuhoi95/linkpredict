Title: Dirac and Maxwell equations in Split Octonions
Authors: Revaz Beradze and Tsotne Shengelia
Abstract: The split octonionic form of Dirac and Maxwell equations are found. In contrast with the previous attempts these equations are derived from the octonionic analyticity condition and also we use different basis of the 8-dimensional space of split octonions.
