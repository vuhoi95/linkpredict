Authors: Sheng-Hong Lai and Jen-Chi Lee and I-Hsun Tsai
Abstract: We use a set of ADHM 3-instanton data to systematically construct a class of SU(2) Yang-Mills instanton solutions with arbitrary topological charges. Moreover, by using the biquaternion calculation with biconjugation operation developed recently, these new ADHM data are used to construct a class of SL(2,C) Yang-Mills instanton sheaves on CP^3 with arbitrary topological charges k greater than 3. This result extends the previous construction of Yang-Mills 2-instanton sheaves to arbitrary higher k-instanton sheaves.
