Abstract: We present a novel supersymmetric (SUSY) model based on trinification $[\mathrm{SU}(3)]^3$ and family $\mathrm{SU}(3)_\mathrm{F}$ symmetries embedded into a maximal subgroup of $\mathrm{E}_8$. Besides unification of gauge couplings and proton stability, one of its most attractive features is the universality of Yukawa couplings for chiral quarks and leptons. The sectors of light Higgs bosons and leptons are unified into a single chiral supermultiplet dramatically reducing the parameter space of the model. The family symmetry automatically forbids unification-scale masses for the Standard Model (SM) fermions that are typically unavoidable in trinification-based theories. At low energy scales, one finds an effective non-SUSY left-right symmetric model originating from the spontaneously broken gauge trinification. The model incorporates several realistic SM-like scenarios for scalar mass hierarchies at low energies where the light scalar, neutralino and gluino sectors are fully controlled by dynamics of the soft SUSY breaking.
