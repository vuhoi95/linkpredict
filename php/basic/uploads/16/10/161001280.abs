Abstract: We consider the softly broken ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric electrodynamics, regularized by higher derivatives. For this theory we demonstrate that the renormalization of the photino mass is determined by integrals of double total derivatives in the momentum space in all orders. Consequently, it is possible to derive the NSVZ-like exact relation between the photino mass anomalous dimension and the anomalous dimension of the matter superfields in the rigid theory by direct summation of supergraphs. It is important that both these renormalization group functions are defined in terms of the bare coupling constant, so that the considered NSVZ-like relation is valid independently of the subtraction scheme in the case of using the higher derivative regularization. The factorization of integrals defining the photino mass renormalization into integrals of double total derivatives is verified by an explicit two-loop calculation.
