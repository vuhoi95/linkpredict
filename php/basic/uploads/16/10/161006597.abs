Title: Standard Model Background of the Cosmological Collider
Authors: Xingang Chen and Yi Wang and Zhong-Zhi Xianyu
Abstract: The inflationary universe can be viewed as a "Cosmological Collider" with energy of Hubble scale, producing very massive particles and recording their characteristic signals in primordial non-Gaussianities. To utilize this collider to explore any new physics at very high scales, it is a prerequisite to understand the background signals from the particle physics Standard Model. In this paper we describe the Standard Model background of the Cosmological Collider.
