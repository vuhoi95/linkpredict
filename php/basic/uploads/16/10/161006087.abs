Title: Hamiltonian Analysis of an On-shell U(1) Gauge Field Theory
Authors: Chunshan Lin and Misao Sasaki
Abstract: We perform the Hamiltonian analysis of an on-shell U(1) gauge field theory, in which the action is not invariant under local U(1) transformations but recovers the invariance when the equations of motion are imposed. We firstly apply Dirac's method of Hamiltonian analysis. We find one first-class constraint and two second-class constraints in the vector sector. It implies the photons have only two polarisations, at least at the classical level, although the standard U(1) symmetry is explicitly broken. The results are confirmed by an independent analysis based on the Faddeev-Jackiw Hamiltonian reduction approach.
