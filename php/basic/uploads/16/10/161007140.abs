Title: Finite Temperature Corrections to Tachyon Mass in Intersecting D-Branes
Authors: Varun Sethi and Sudipto Paul Chowdhury and Swarnendu Sarkar
Abstract: We continue with the analysis of finite temperature corrections to the Tachyon mass in intersecting branes which was initiated in arxiv:1403.0389. In this paper we extend the computation to the case of intersecting D3-branes by considering a setup of two intersecting branes in flat-space background. A holographic model dual to BCS superconductor consisting of intersecting D8-branes in D4-brane background was proposed in arxiv:1104.2843. The background considered here is a simplified configuration of this dual model. We compute the one-loop Tachyon amplitude in the Yang-Mills approximation and show that the result is finite. Analyzing the amplitudes further we numerically compute the transition temperature at which the Tachyon becomes massless. The analytic expressions for the one-loop amplitudes obtained here reduce to those for intersecting D1-branes obtained in arxiv:1403.0389 as well as those for intersecting D2-branes.
