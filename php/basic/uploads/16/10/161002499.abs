Title: SU(1,2) invariance in two-dimensional oscillator
Authors: Sergey Krivonos and Armen Nersessian
Abstract: Performing the Hamiltonian analysis we explicitly established the canonical equivalence of the deformed oscillator, constructed in arXiv:1607.03756[hep-th], with the ordinary one. As an immediate consequence, we proved that the SU(1,2) symmetry is the dynamical symmetry of the ordinary two-dimensional oscillator. The characteristic feature of this SU(1,2) symmetry is a non-polynomial structure of its generators written it terms of the oscillator variables.
