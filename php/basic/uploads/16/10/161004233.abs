Title: Sine-Gordon Theory : Entanglement entropy and holography
Authors: Pinaki Banerjee and Atanu Bhatta and B. Sathiapalan
Abstract: We compute entanglement entropy of sine-Gordon theory for a single interval using both field theoretic and holographic techniques. The results match for near-marginal perturbations up to leading order in the coupling.
