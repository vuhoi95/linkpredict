Title: On 2-dimensional Kaehler metrics with one holomorphic isometry
Authors: Samuele Chimento and Tomas Ortin
Abstract: We show how to write any Kaehler metric of complex dimension 2 admitting a holomorphic isometry as a simple 1-real-function deformation of a Gibbons-Hawking metric. Hyper-Kaehler metrics with a tri-holomorphic isometry (Gibbons-Hawking metrics) or with a mono-holomorphic isometry are recovered for particular values of the additional function. The new general metric can be used as an Ansatz in several interesting physical problems.
