Title: Topological influence and excitations: decomposition formulas for  calculating homotopy groups of symmetry broken phases
Authors: Sho Higashikawa and Masahito Ueda
Abstract: A symmetry broken phase of a system with internal degrees of freedom often features a complex order parameter, which generates a rich variety of topological excitations and topological influence between them, yet the very complexity of the order parameter makes it difficult to treat topological excitations and topological influence in a unified manner. To overcome this problem, we develop a general method to calculate homotopy groups and derive decomposition formulas which express homotopy groups of a quotient space $G/H$ in terms of those of the symmetry $G$ of the system and those of the remaining symmetry $H$ of the state. We apply these formulas to analyze a general monopole and a general three-dimensional skyrmion, and show that their textures are obtained through substitution of the corresponding $\mathfrak{su}(2)$-subalgebra for the $\mathfrak{su}(2)$-spin. We also show that a discrete symmetry of $H$ is necessary for the presence of topological influence and find the topological influence on a skyrmion characterized by a non-Abelian permutation group of three elements in the ground state of an SU(3)-Heisenberg model.
