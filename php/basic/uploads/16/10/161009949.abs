Title: Moduli Spaces of Transverse Deformations of Near-Horizon Geometries
Authors: A. Fontanella and J. B. Gutowski
Abstract: We investigate deformations of extremal near-horizon geometries in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory, including various topological terms, and also in D=11 supergravity. By linearizing the field equations and Bianchi identities over the compact spatial cross-sections of the near-horizon geometry, we prove that the moduli associated with such deformations are constrained by elliptic systems of PDEs. The moduli space of deformations of near-horizon geometries in these theories is therefore shown to be finite dimensional.
