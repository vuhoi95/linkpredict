Abstract: The deconfinement transition at vanishing chemical potential can be reliably studied by lattice simulations and its general features are by now well known. On the contrary, what happens at finite density is still largely unknown and we will review the results obtained in the last year regarding the dependence, for small density, of the (pseudo)critical temperature on the baryonic chemical potential.
