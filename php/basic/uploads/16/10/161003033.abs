Title: On the Supersymmetry of Bianchi attractors in Gauged supergravity
Authors: Bidisha Chakrabarty and Karthik Inbasekar and Rickmoy Samanta
Abstract: Bianchi attractors are near horizon geometries with homogeneous symmetries in the spatial directions. We construct supersymmetric Bianchi attractors in $\mathcal{N}=2, d=4,5$ gauged supergravity coupled to vector and hypermultiplets. In $d=4$, in the Bianchi I class we construct an electric $1/4$ BPS $AdS_2\times\mathbb{R}^2$ geometry. In $d=5$ we consider gauged supergravity with a generic gauging of symmetries of the scalar manifold and the R symmetry. Analyzing the gaugino and hyperino conditions we show that when the fermionic shifts do not vanish there are no supersymmetric Bianchi attractors. When the central charge satisfies an extremization condition, some of the fermionic shifts vanish and supersymmetry requires that the symmetries of the scalar manifold be ungauged. This allows supersymmetric Bianchi attractors sourced by massless gauge fields and a cosmological constant. In the Bianchi I class we show that the anisotropic $AdS_3\times\mathbb{R}^2$ solution is $1/2$ BPS. We also construct a new class of $1/2$ BPS Bianchi III geometries labeled by the central charge. When the central charge takes a special value the Bianchi III geometry reduces to the known $AdS_3\times\mathbb{H}^2$ solution. For the Bianchi V and VII classes the radial spinor breaks all of supersymmetry.
