Title: Ricci flow, Courant algebroids, and renormalization of Poisson--Lie  T-duality
Authors: Pavol Å evera and Fridrich Valach
Abstract: We use a generalized Ricci tensor, defined for generalized metrics in Courant algebroids, to show that Poisson-Lie T-duality is compatible with the 1-loop renormalization group.
