Title: On rectangular HOMFLY for twist knots
Authors: Ya. Kononov and A. Morozov
Abstract: As a new step in the study of rectangularly-colored knot polynomials, we reformulate the prescription of arXiv:1606.06015 for twist knots in the double-column representations $R=[rr]$ in terms of skew Schur polynomials. These, however, are mysteriously shifted from the standard topological locus, what makes further generalization to arbitrary $R=[r^s]$ not quite straightforward.
