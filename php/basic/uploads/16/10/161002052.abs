Title: Chiral Closed strings: Four massless states scattering amplitude
Authors: Marcelo M. Leite and Warren Siegel
Abstract: We compute the scattering amplitudes of four massless states for chiral (closed) bosonic and type II superstrings using the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye ($KLT$) factorization method. The amplitude in the chiral bosonic case is identical to a field theory amplitude corresponding to the spin-$2$ tachyon, massless gravitational sector and massive spin-2 tardyon states of the spectrum. Chiral type II superstrings amplitude only possess poles associated with the massless gravitational sector. We briefly discuss the extension of the calculation to heterotic superstrings.
