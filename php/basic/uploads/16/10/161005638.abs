Title: Banados and SUSY: On Supersymmetry and Minimal Surfaces of Locally AdS3  Geometries
Authors: E. Ó Colgáin and H. Yavartanoo
Abstract: We extend the classification of supersymmetric locally AdS$_3$ geometries, beyond BTZ black holes, to the Ba\~nados geometries, noting that supersymmetries are in one-to-one correspondence with solutions to the Hill differential condition. We show that the number of global supersymmetries is an orbit invariant quantity and identify geometries with zero, one, two, three and four global supersymmetries. As an application of our classification, we exploit supersymmetry, which is preserved locally in the bulk, to determine space-like co-dimension two surfaces in AdS$_3$. In the process, we by-pass geodesics or mappings of AdS$_3$, neither of which have an analogue in higher dimensions, to recover known Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi surfaces. Our findings suggest supersymmetry can be exploited to find extremal surfaces in holographic entanglement entropy.
