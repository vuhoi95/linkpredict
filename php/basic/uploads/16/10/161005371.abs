Abstract: We find a simple relation between two-dimensional BPS N=2 superconformal blocks and bosonic Virasoro conformal blocks, which allows us to analyze the crossing equations for BPS 4-point functions in unitary (2,2) superconformal theories numerically with semidefinite programming. We constrain gaps in the non-BPS spectrum through the operator product expansion of BPS operators, in ways that depend on the moduli of exactly marginal deformations through chiral ring coefficients. In some cases, our bounds on the spectral gaps are observed to be saturated by free theories, by N=2 Liouville theory, and by certain Landau-Ginzburg models.
