Title: Weyl Gravity Revisited
Authors: Enrique Alvarez and Sergio Gonzalez-Martin
Abstract: The on shell equivalence of first order and second order formalisms for the Einstein-Hilbert action does not hold for those actions quadratic in curvature. It would seem that by considering the connection and the metric as independent dynamical variables, there are no quartic propagators for any dynamical variable. This suggests that it is possible to get both renormalizability and unitarity along these lines. We have studied a particular instance of those theories, namely Weyl gravity. Although the ground state of this system is difficult to analyze, we have been able to study the physical effects of some external sources.
