Title: Geometric Constraints from Subregion Duality Beyond the Classical Regime
Authors: Chris Akers and Jason Koeller and Stefan Leichenauer and Adam Levine
Abstract: Subregion duality in AdS/CFT implies certain constraints on the geometry: entanglement wedges must contain causal wedges, and nested boundary regions must have nested entanglement wedges. We elucidate the logical connections between these statements and the Quantum Focussing Conjecture, Quantum Null Energy Condition, Boundary Causality Condition, and Averaged Null Energy Condition. Our analysis does not rely on the classical limit of bulk physics, but instead works to all orders in $G\hbar \sim 1/N$. This constitutes a nontrivial check on the consistency of subregion duality, entanglement wedge reconstruction, and holographic entanglement entropy beyond the classical regime.
