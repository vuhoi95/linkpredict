Title: Gauged spinning models with deformed supersymmetry
Authors: Sergey Fedoruk and Evgeny Ivanov
Abstract: New models of the SU(2|1) supersymmetric mechanics based on gauging the systems with dynamical (1,4,3) and semi-dynamical (4,4,0) supermultiplets are presented. We propose a new version of SU(2|1) harmonic superspace approach which makes it possible to construct the Wess-Zumino term for interacting (4,4,0) multiplets. A new N=4 extension of d=1 Calogero-Moser multiparticle system is obtained by gauging the U(n) isometry of matrix SU(2|1) harmonic superfield model.
