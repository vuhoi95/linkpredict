Title: Einstein--Weyl Spaces and Near-Horizon Geometry
Authors: Maciej Dunajski and Jan Gutowski and Wafic Sabra
Abstract: We show that a class of solutions of minimal supergravity in five dimensions is given by lifts of three--dimensional Einstein--Weyl structures of hyper-CR type. We characterise this class as most general near--horizon limits of supersymmetric solutions to the five--dimensional theory. In particular, we deduce that a compact spatial section of a horizon can only be a Berger sphere, a product metric on $S^1\times S^2$ or a flat three-torus. We then consider the problem of reconstructing all supersymmetric solutions from a given near--horizon geometry. By exploiting the ellipticity of the linearised field equations we demonstrate that the moduli space of transverse infinitesimal deformations of a near--horizon geometry is finite--dimensional.
