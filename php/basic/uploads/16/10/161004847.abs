Title: Spin Interaction under the Collision of Two Kerr-(anti-)de Sitter Black  Holes
Authors: Bogeun Gwak and Daeho Ro
Abstract: We have investigated spin interaction under the collision of Kerr-(anti-)de Sitter black holes. The potential of a spin interaction is dependent on the relative rotating directions of the black holes, and this potential can be released as gravitational radiation under the collision. The radiation depends on the cosmological constant and corresponds to the potential of the spin interaction at a limit where one of the black holes is assumed to have small mass and angular momentum. Then, we have shown, approximately, the overall behaviors of the upper bounds on the radiation using thermodynamics. From these bounds, the spin interaction can consistently contribute to the radiation. In addition, the radiation depends on the stability of the black hole synthesized from the collision.
