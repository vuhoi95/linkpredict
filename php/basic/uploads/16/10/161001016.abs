Title: Modified Gravity Explains Dark Matter?
Authors: Taishi Katsuragawa and Shinya Matsuzaki
Abstract: We explore a new horizon of modified gravity from the viewpoint of the particle physics. As a concrete example, we take the $F(R)$ gravity to raise a question: can a scalar particle ("scalaron") derived from the $F(R)$ gravity be a dark matter candidate? We place the limit on the form of function $F(R)$ from the constraint on the scalaron as a dark matter. The role of the screening mechanism and compatibility with the dark energy problem are addressed.
