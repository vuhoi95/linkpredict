Title: The NUTs and Bolts of Squashed Holography
Authors: Nikolay Bobev and Thomas Hertog and Yannick Vreys
Abstract: We evaluate the partition function of the free O(N) model on a two-parameter family of squashed three spheres. We also find new solutions of general relativity with negative cosmological constant and the same double squashed boundary geometry and analyse their thermodynamic properties. Remarkably, both systems exhibit a qualitatively similar behaviour over the entire configuration space of boundary geometries. Recent formulations of dS/CFT enable one to interpret the field theory partition function as a function of the two squashing parameters as the Hartle-Hawking wave function in a minisuperspace model of anisotropic deformations of de Sitter space. The resulting probability distribution is normalisable and globally peaked at the round three sphere, with a low amplitude of boundary geometries with negative scalar curvature.
