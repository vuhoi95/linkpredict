Title: Second level semi-degenerate fields in W3 Toda theory: matrix element  and differential equation
Authors: Vladimir Belavin and Xiangyu Cao and Benoit Estienne and Raoul Santachiara
Abstract: In a recent study we considered W3 Toda 4-point functions that involve matrix elements of a primary field with the highest-weight in the adjoint representation of sl3. We generalize this result by considering a semi-degenerate primary field, which has one null vector at level two. We obtain a sixth-order Fuchsian differential equation for the conformal blocks. We discuss the presence of multiplicities, the matrix elements and the fusion rules.
