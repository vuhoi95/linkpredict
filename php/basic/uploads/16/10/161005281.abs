Title: Charged Rotating AdS Black Holes with Chern-Simons coupling
Authors: Mozhgan Mir and Robert B. Mann
Abstract: We obtain a perturbative solution for rotating charged black holes in 5-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory with a negative cosmological constant. We start from a small undeformed Kerr-AdS solution and use the electric charge as a perturbative parameter to build up black holes with equal-magnitude angular momenta up to forth order. These black hole solutions are described by three parameters, the charge, horizon radius and horizon angular velocity. We determine the physical quantities of these black holes and study their dependence on the parameters of black holes and arbitrary Chern-Simons coefficient. In particular, for values of CS coupling constant beyond its supergravity amount, due to a rotational instability, counterrotating black holes arise. Also the rotating solutions appear to have vanishing angular momenta and do not manifest uniquely by their global charges.
