Title: Self-acceleration and matter content in bicosmology from Noether  Symmetries
Authors: Mariam Bouhmadi-López and Salvatore Capozziello and Prado Martín-Moruno
Abstract: We consider the existence of Noether symmetries in bigravity cosmologies in order to constrain the material content minimally coupled to the gravitational sector that we are not inhabiting. Interestingly, a Noether symmetry not only constrain the matter content of the universe we do not inhabit but also comes as a sort of bonus on the form of a very interesting dynamics of the universe we live in. In fact, by assuming that our universe is filled with standard matter and radiation, we show that the existence of a Noether symmetry implies the existence of a vacuum energy in our universe that can explain, in a natural way, the current acceleration of the universe. This vacuum energy is intrinsic to the model and can be realized either for a theory that is not properly a bigravity model or for a genuinely bimetric scenario. In fact, it would correspond to a "mono"-universe with a $\Lambda$CDM matter symmetry or to a bimetric world where our universe would have once again a $\Lambda$CDM matter symmetry while the non-inhabited universe could have a gravitational coupling with a different sign to that in ours. The main point in these pictures is that the Noether symmetry plays a major role into dynamics. The physical consequences are also briefly discussed.
