Title: Dynamical role of Polyakov loops in the QCD thermodynamics
Authors: N. O. Agasian and M. S. Lukashov and Yu. A. Simonov
Abstract: Polyakov loops $L_a(T), a=3,8,...$ are shown to give the most important nonperturbative contribution to the thermodynamic potentials. Derived from the gluonic field correlators they enter as factors into free energy. It is shown in the $SU(3)$ case that $L_a (T)$ define to a large extent the behavior of the free energy and the trace anomaly $I(T)$, most sensitive to nonperturbative effects.
