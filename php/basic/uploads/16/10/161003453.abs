Title: High Energy QCD at NLO: from light-cone wave function to JIMWLK  evolution
Authors: Michael Lublinsky and Yair Mulian
Abstract: Soft components of the light cone wave-function of a fast moving projectile hadron is computed in perturbation theory to third order in QCD coupling constant. At this order, the Fock space of the soft modes consists of one-gluon, two-gluon, and a quark-antiquark states. The hard component of the wave-function acts as a non-Abelian background field for the soft modes and is represented by a valence charge distribution that accounts for non-linear density effects in the projectile. When scattered off a dense target, the diagonal element of the S-matrix reveals the Hamiltonian of high energy evolution, the JIMWLK Hamiltonian. This way we provide a new direct derivation of the JIMWLK Hamiltonian at the Next-to-Leading Order.
