Title: String field representation of the Virasoro algebra
Authors: Nicholas Mertes and Martin Schnabl
Abstract: We construct a representation of the zero central charge Virasoro algebra using string fields in Witten's open bosonic string field theory. This construction is used to explore extensions of the KBc algebra and find novel algebraic solutions of open string field theory.
