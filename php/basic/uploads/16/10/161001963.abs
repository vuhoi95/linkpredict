Abstract: In order to study the effect of the anti de Sitter/ conformal field theory correspondence (AdS/CFT) on the primordial inflationary era, we consider a universe filled with a tachyon field in a slow-roll regime. In this context, the background and perturbative parameters characterising the inflationary era are related to the standard one by correction terms. We show a clear agreement between the theoretical prediction and the observational data for the above mentioned model. The main results of our work are illustrated for an exponential potential. We show that, for a suitable conformal anomaly coefficient, AdS/CFT correspondence might leave its imprints on the spectrum of the gravitational waves amplitude with a tensor to scalar ratio, $r$, of the perturbations compatible with Planck data.
