Title: Gauge theory on Aloff-Wallach spaces
Authors: Gavin Ball and Goncalo Oliveira
Abstract: For gauge groups $U(1)$ and $SO(3)$ we classify invariant $G_2$-instantons for homogeneous coclosed $G_2$-structures on Aloff-Wallach spaces $X_{k,l}$. As a consequence, we give examples where $G_2$-instantons can be used to distinguish between different strictly nearly parallel $G_2$-structures on the same Aloff-Wallach space. In addition to this, we find that while certain $G_2$-instantons exist for the strictly nearly parallel $G_2$-structure on $X_{1,1}$, no such $G_2$-instantons exist for the tri-Sasakian one. As a further consequence of the classification, we produce examples of some other interesting phenomena, such as: irreducible $G_2$-instantons that, as the structure varies, merge into the same reducible and obstructed one; and $G_2$-instantons on nearly parallel $G_2$-manifolds that are not locally energy minimizing.
