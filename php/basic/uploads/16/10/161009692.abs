Title: Relative-locality effects in Snyder spacetime
Authors: S. Mignemi and A. samsarov
Abstract: When applied to some models of noncommutative geometry, the formalism of relative locality predicts the occurrence of a delay in the time of arrival of massless particle of different energies emitted by a distant observer. In this letter, we show that this is not the case with Snyder spacetime, essentially because the Lorentz invariance is not deformed in this case. This conclusion is in accordance with the findings of doubly special relativity. Distant observers may however measure different times of flight for massive particle.
