Title: Special Gravity as Alternatives for Interacting Massless Gravitons
Authors: Dong Bai and Yu-Hang Xing
Abstract: Special gravity, first discussed by Wald \cite{Wald:1986bj} decades ago, is a novel class of theories for interacting massless gravitons in Minkowski spacetime. It respects gauge invariance, but not general covariance, which is drastically different from Einstein's gravity and many of its modifications. In this note, we study properties of special gravity, revealing its connections with asymptotic causality, S-matrix program, non-renormalization, massive gravity and emergent gravitons in condensed matter systems.
