Title: Replica trick and string winding
Authors: Andrea Prudenziati and Diego Trancanelli
Abstract: We apply the replica trick to compute the entropy of a cylinder amplitude in string theory. We focus on the contribution from non-perturbative winding modes and impose tadpole cancellation to understand the correct prescription for integrating over moduli. Choosing the entangling surface to cut longitudinally over the whole length of the cylinder, we obtain an answer that is interpreted as the entropy of a density matrix. We recast this result in target space language, both in the open and closed string picture.
