Title: Extending Chiral Perturbation Theory with an Isosinglet Scalar
Authors: Martin Hansen and Kasper Langaeble and Francesco Sannino
Abstract: We augment the chiral Lagrangian by an isosinglet scalar and compute the one-loop radiative corrections to the pion mass and decay constant, as well as the scalar mass. The calculations are carried out for different patterns of chiral symmetry breaking of immediate relevance for phenomenology and lattice investigations. By construction our results encompass several interesting limits, ranging from the dilaton to the linear sigma model.
