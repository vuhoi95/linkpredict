Title: Global phase diagram of a dirty Weyl semimetal
Authors: Bitan Roy and Robert-Jan Slager and Vladimir Juricic
Abstract: We here theoretically study the global phase diagram of a three-dimensional dirty Weyl system. The generalized Harris criterion, augmented by a perturbative renormalization-group (RG) analysis shows that weak disorder is an irrelevant perturbation at the Weyl semimetal(WSM)-insulator quantum critical point (QCP). But, a metallic phase sets in through a quantum phase transition (QPT) at strong disorder across a multicritical point, characterized by the correlation length exponent $\nu=2$ and dynamic scaling exponent (DSE) $z=5/4$. Deep inside the WSM phase, generic disorder is also an irrelevant perturbation, while a metallic phase appears at strong disorder through a QPT. We here demonstrate that in the presence of generic, but chiral symmetric disorder (e.g., chemical potential, axial potential, etc.) the WSM-metal QPT is always characterized by the exponents $\nu=1$ and $z=3/2$ to one-loop order. We here anchor such emergent \emph{chiral superuniversality} through complimentary RG calculations, controlled via $\epsilon$-expansions, and numerical analysis of average density of states across WSM-metal QPT. Even though in the presence of chiral symmetry breaking disorder, as for instance random spin-orbit coupling, the exact value of DSE across such QPT depends on the RG scheme, we always find $z>d$, with $d$ as dimensionality of the WSM, and $\nu=1$. We also discuss scaling behavior of various physical observables, such as residue of quasiparticle pole, dynamic conductivity, specific heat, Gr\"uneisen ratio, across the WSM-metal QPTs.
