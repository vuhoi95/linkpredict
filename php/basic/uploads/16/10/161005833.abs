Title: The fate of chaotic strings in a confining geometry
Authors: Takaaki Ishii and Keiju Murata and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We study chaotic motion of classical closed strings in the five-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS) soliton spacetime. We first revisit classical chaos using a cohomogeneity-1 string ansatz. We then consider turbulent behaviors of the classical strings when the spatial dependence of the string world-sheet is included. Sensitivity to initial conditions in chaotic systems suggests that the string under chaos tends to stretch in the AdS soliton spacetime in a Lyapunov timescale. In this process, the orbital angular momentum transfers to internal spin due to the turbulence on the string. It follows that the string stays around the tip of the AdS soliton with a jumbled profile. We evaluate the spectra of conserved quantities and discuss their universal power-law scalings in the turbulent behaviors.
