Title: Tensor power spectrum and disformal transformations
Authors: Jacopo Fumagalli and Sander Mooij and Marieke Postma
Abstract: In a general effective theory description of inflation a disformal transformation can be used to set the tensor sound speed to one. After the transformation, the tensor power spectrum then automatically only depends on the Hubble parameter. We show that this disformal transformation, however, is nothing else than a change of units. It is a very useful tool for simplifying and interpreting computations, but it cannot change any physics. While the apparent parametrical dependence of the tensor power spectrum does change under a disformal transformation, the physics described is frame invariant. We further illustrate the frame invariance of the tensor power spectrum by writing it exclusively in terms of separately invariant quantities.
