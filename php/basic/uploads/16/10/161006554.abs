Title: Contravariant Gravity on Poisson Manifolds and Einstein Gravity
Authors: Yukio Kaneko and Hisayoshi Muraki and Satoshi Watamura
Abstract: A relation between gravity on Poisson manifolds proposed in arXiv:1508.05706 and the Einstein gravity is investigated. The compatibility of the Poisson and Riemann structures defines a unique connection, the contravariant Levi-Civita connection, and leads to the idea of the contravariant gravity. The Einstein-Hilbert-type action gives the equation of motion represented by the analog of the Einstein tensor and includes couplings between the metric and the Poisson tensor. The Weyl transformation is studied to reveal properties of those interactions. It is argued that the theory can have an equivalent description in terms of the Einstein gravity coupled to matter. As an example, it is shown that the contravariant gravity on a two-dimensional Poisson manifold has another description by a real scalar field coupling to the metric in a specific manner.
