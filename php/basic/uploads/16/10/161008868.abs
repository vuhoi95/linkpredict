Abstract: This is the second in a series of papers on preheating in inflationary models comprised of multiple scalar fields coupled nonminimally to gravity. In this paper, we work in the rigid-spacetime approximation and consider field trajectories within the single-field attractor, which is a generic feature of these models. We construct the Floquet charts to find regions of parameter space in which particle production is efficient for both the adiabatic and isocurvature modes, and analyze the resonance structure using analytic and semi-analytic techniques. Particle production in the adiabatic direction is characterized by the existence of an asymptotic scaling solution at large values of the nonminimal couplings, $\xi_I \gg 1$, in which the dominant instability band arises in the long-wavelength limit, for comoving wavenumbers $k \rightarrow 0$. However, the large-$\xi_I$ regime is not reached until $\xi_I \geq {\cal O} (100)$. In the intermediate regime, with $\xi_I \sim {\cal O}(10)$, the resonance structure depends strongly on the wavenumber and couplings. The resonance structure for isocurvature perturbations is distinct and more complicated than its adiabatic counterpart, as expected. An intermediate regime, for $\xi_I \sim {\cal O} (10)$, is again evident. For large values of $\xi_I$, the Floquet chart consists of densely spaced, nearly parallel instability bands, suggesting a very efficient preheating behavior. Quantitatively, the approach to the large-$\xi_I$ asymptotic solution for isocurvature modes is slower than in the case of the adiabatic modes.
