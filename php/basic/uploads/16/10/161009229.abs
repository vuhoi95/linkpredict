Title: The star-triangle relation, lens partition function, and hypergeometric  sum/integrals
Authors: Ilmar Gahramanov and Andrew P. Kels
Abstract: The aim of the present paper is to consider the hyperbolic limit of an elliptic hypergeometric sum/integral identity, and associated lattice model of statistical mechanics previously obtained by the second author. The hyperbolic sum/integral identity obtained from this limit, has two important physical applications in the context of the so-called gauge/YBE correspondence. For statistical mechanics, this identity is equivalent to a new solution of the star-triangle relation form of the Yang-Baxter equation, that directly generalises the Faddeev-Volkov models to the case of discrete and continuous spin variables. On the gauge theory side, this identity represents the duality of lens ($S_b^3/\mathbb{Z}_r$) partition functions, for certain three-dimensional $\mathcal N = 2$ supersymmetric gauge theories.
