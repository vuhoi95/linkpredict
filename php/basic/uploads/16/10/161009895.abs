Title: Minimal $\cal N=4$ topologically massive supergravity
Authors: Sergei M. Kuzenko and Joseph Novak and Ivo Sachs
Abstract: Using the superconformal framework, we construct a new off-shell model for topologically massive $\cal N=4$ supergravity which is minimal in the sense that it makes use of a single compensating vector multiplet. Our theory provides a counterexample to the common lore that two compensating multiplets are required within the conformal approach to supergravity with eight supercharges in diverse dimensions. All solutions in this theory correspond to non-conformally flat superspaces. Its maximally supersymmetric solutions include the so-called critical (4,0) anti-de Sitter superspace introduced in arXiv:1205.4622. Other maximally supersymmetric solutions describe warped critical (4,0) anti-de Sitter superspaces. We also propose a dual formulation for the theory in which the vector multiplet is replaced with an off-shell hypermultiplet. Upon elimination of the auxiliary fields belonging to the hypermultiplet and imposing certain gauge conditions, the dual action reduces to the one introduced in arXiv:1605.00103.
