Title: Higher-curvature Corrections to Holographic Entanglement with Momentum  Relaxation
Authors: M Reza Tanhayi and R Vazirian
Abstract: We study the effects of Gauss-Bonnet corrections on entanglement entropy and mutual information in the holographic model with momentum relaxation. There are in fact two kinds of deformation in the states of conformal field theory in this model: the higher-curvature terms, which could address the low-energy quantum excitation corrections, and the deformation due to scalar fields, which are responsible for the momentum conservation breaking. We use holographic methods to obtain the corresponding changes due to these deformations in the finite and universal parts of entanglement entropy for strip geometry. Holographic calculation indicates that mutual and tripartite information undergo a transition beyond which they identically change their values. We find that the behavior of transition curves depends on the sign of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling $\lambda$. The transition for $\lambda>0$ takes place in larger separation of subsystems than that of $\lambda<0$.
