Abstract: We study a family of noncommutative spacetimes constructed by one four-vector. The large set of coordinate commutation relations described in this way includes many cases that are widely studied in the literature. The Hopf-algebra symmetries of these noncommutative spacetimes, as well as the structures of star product and twist, are introduced and considered at first order in the deformation, described by four parameters. We also study the deformations to relativistic kinematics implied by this framework, and calculate the most general expression for the backreaction factors of momenta on boosts. At the end of the paper we analyse the phenomenological consequences of this large family of vector-like deformations on particles propagation in spacetime. This leads to a set of characteristic phenomenological effects.
