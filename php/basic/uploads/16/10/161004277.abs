Title: Rainbows without unicorns: Metric structures in theories with Modified  Dispersion Relations
Authors: Iarley P. Lobo and Niccol√≥ Loret and Francisco Nettel
Abstract: "Rainbow" metrics are a widely used approach to metric formalism for theories with Modified Dispersion Relations. They have had a huge success in the Quantum Gravity Phenomenology literature, since they allow to introduce momentum-dependent spacetime metrics into the description of systems with Modified Dispersion Relation. This approach, however, presents some compatibility issues with a relativistic description, even in the case of introducing deformed spacetime symmetries to keep the theory's modified dispersion relation invariant. In this paper we would like to introduce the readers to this issue and to describe how the relativistic properties of the theory can be recovered taking into account a more complex (but also complete) momentum-space curvature framework. We also introduce a new metric structure from a Polyakov-like description of the action.
