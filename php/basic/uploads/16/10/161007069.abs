Title: Hawking Radiation of Scalar and Vector Particles From 5D Myers-Perry  Black Holes
Authors: Kimet Jusufi and Ali Övgün
Abstract: In the present paper we explore the Hawking radiation as a quantum tunneling effect from a rotating 5 dimensional Myers-Perry (5D-MPBH) black hole with two independent angular momentum componentes. First, we investigate the Hawking temperature by considering the tunneling of massive scalar particles and spin-1 vector particles from the 5D-MPBH in the Painlev\'e coordinates and then in the corotating frames. More specifically, we solve the Klein-Gordon and Proca equation by applying the WKB method and Hamilton-Jacobi equation in both cases. Finally, we recover the Hawking temperature and show that coordinates systems do not affect the Hawking temperature.
