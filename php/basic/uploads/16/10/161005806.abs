Title: Analytic solution for Gauged Dirac-Weyl equation in $(2+1)$-dimensions
Authors: Juan Sebasti√°n Ardenghi and Alfredo Juan and Lucas Sourrouille
Abstract: A gauged Dirac-Weyl equation in (2+1)-dimension is considered. This equation describe relativistic matter. In particular we are interested in matter interacting with a Chern-Simons gauge fields. We show that exact self-dual solutions are admitted. These solutions are the same as those supported by nonrelativistic matter interacting with a Chern-Simons gauge field.
