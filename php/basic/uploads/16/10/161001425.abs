Title: On instanton effects in the operator product expansion
Authors: Luis F. Alday and Gregory P. Korchemsky
Abstract: We revisit the computation of instanton effects to various correlation functions in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM and clarify a controversy existing in the literature regarding their consistency with the OPE and conformal symmetry. To check these properties, we examine the conformal partial wave decomposition of four-point correlators involving combinations of half-BPS and Konishi operators and isolate the contribution from the conformal primary scalar operators of twist four. We demonstrate that the leading instanton correction to this contribution is indeed consistent with conformal symmetry and compute the corresponding corrections to the OPE coefficients and the scaling dimensions of such twist-four operators. Our analysis justifies the regularization procedure used to compute ultraviolet divergent instanton contribution to correlation functions involving unprotected operators.
