Authors: Antonio Accioly and Breno L. Giacchini and Ilya L. Shapiro
Abstract: The most simple super-renormalizable model of quantum gravity is based on the general local covariant six-derivative action. It was recently shown that such a theory may also have unitary S-matrix, in the case when massive poles are complex. In the present work we construct the modified Newton potential and explore the gravitational light bending in a general six-derivative theory, including the most interesting case of complex massive poles. In what concerns light deflection, the results are obtained within classical and semiclassical approaches. The presentation is given in details which can be useful for better understanding the effects of the higher derivative terms.
