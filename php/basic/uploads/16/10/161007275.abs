Title: Hamiltonian Truncation Study of Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics:  S-Matrix and Metastable States
Authors: Bruno Balthazar and Victor A. Rodriguez and Xi Yin
Abstract: We implement the Rayleigh-Ritz method in supersymmetric quantum mechanics with flat directions, and extract the S-matrix and metastable resonances. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated in two strongly coupled systems: an N=1 toy supermembrane model, and an N=4 model with a U(1) gauge multiplet and a charged chiral multiplet.
