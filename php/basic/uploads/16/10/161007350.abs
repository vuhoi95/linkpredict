Title: AdS Monopole Black Hole and Phase Transition
Authors: Shoichiro Miyashita and Kei-ichi Maeda
Abstract: We study the Einstein-SO(3)Yang-Mills-Higgs system with a negative cosmological constant, and find the monopole black hole solutions as well as the trivial Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole. We discuss thermodynamical stability of the monopole black hole in an isolated system. We expect a phase transition between those two black holes when the mass of a black hole increases or decreases. The type of phase transition depends on the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ as well as the vacuum expectation value $v$ and the coupling constant $\lambda$ of the Higgs field. Fixing $\lambda$ small, we find there are two critical values of the cosmological constant $\Lambda_{\rm cr (1)}(v)$ and $\Lambda_{\rm cr(2)}(v)$, which depend on $v$. If $\Lambda_{\rm cr(1)}(v)<\Lambda (<0)$, we find the first order transition, while if $\Lambda_{\rm cr(2)}(v)<\Lambda<\Lambda_{\rm cr(1)}(v)$, the transition becomes second order. For the case of $\Lambda_{b}(v)<\Lambda<\Lambda_{\rm (2)}(v)$, we again find the first order irreversible transition from the monopole black hole to the extreme Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole. Beyond $\Lambda_{b}(v)$, no monopole black hole exists. We also discuss thermodynamical properties of the monopole black hole in a thermal bath system.
