Title: Gauges and functional measures in quantum gravity II: Higher derivative  gravity
Authors: N. Ohta and R. Percacci and A. D. Pereira
Abstract: We compute the one-loop divergences in a higher-derivative theory of gravity including Ricci tensor squared and Ricci scalar squared terms, in addition to the Hilbert and cosmological terms, on an (generally off-shell) Einstein background. We work with a two-parameter family of path integral measures, corresponding to different ways of parametrizing the graviton field, and a two-parameter family of gauges. Only the logarithmic divergences are independent of these choices, but there are some choices of gauge or parametrization that reduce the dependence on the remaining parameters. The results are invariant under a recently discovered "duality" that involves the replacement of the densitized metric by a densitized inverse metric as the fundamental quantum variable.
