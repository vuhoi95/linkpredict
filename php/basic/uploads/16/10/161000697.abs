Title: A Note On The Semiclassical Formulation Of BPS States In  Four-Dimensional N=2 Theories
Authors: T. Daniel Brennan and Gregory W. Moore
Abstract: Vector spaces of (framed) BPS states of Lagrangian four-dimensional N=2 field theories can be defined in semiclassical chambers in terms of the $L^2$-cohomology of Dirac-like operators on monopole moduli spaces. This was spelled out previously for theories with only vectormultiplets, taking into account only a subset of the possible half-supersymmetric 't Hooft-Wilson line defects. This note completes the discussion by describing the modifications needed when including matter hypermultiplets together with arbitrary 't Hooft-Wilson line defects. Two applications of this extended discussion are given.
