Title: Wald type analysis for spin-one fields in three dimensions
Authors: Nabarun Bera and Suchetan Das and Bobby E
Abstract: We revisit Walds analysis in the context of spin-one fields in three dimensions. A key technical difference from Walds is the role played by the three dimensional completely antisymmetric tensor. We show how this changes the analysis as well as the result.
