Abstract: We present the first results on the third order corrections to on-shell form factor (FF) of the Konishi operator in ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory using Feynman diagrammatic approach in modified dimensional reduction ($\overline {DR}$) scheme. We show that it satisfies KG equation in $\overline {DR}$ scheme while the result obtained in four dimensional helicity (FDH) scheme needs to be suitably modified not only to satisfy the KG equation but also to get the correct ultraviolet (UV) anomalous dimensions. We find that the cusp, soft and collinear anomalous dimensions obtained to third order are same as those of the FF of the half-BPS operator confirming the universality of the infrared (IR) structures of on-shell form factors. In addition, the highest transcendental terms of the FF of Konishi operator are identical to those of half-BPS operator indicating the probable existence of deeper structure of the on-shell FF. We also confirm the UV anomalous dimensions of Konishi operator up to third order providing a consistency check on the both UV and universal IR structures in ${\cal N}=4$.
