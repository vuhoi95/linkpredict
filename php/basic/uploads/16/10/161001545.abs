Title: Antigravity: Spin-gravity coupling in action
Authors: Roman Plyatsko and Mykola Fenyk
Abstract: The typical motions of a spinning test particle in Schwarzschild's background which show the strong repulsive action of the highly relativistic spin-gravity coupling are considered using the exact Mathisson-Papapetrou equations. An approximated approach to choice solutions of these equations which describe motions of the particle's proper center of mass is developed.
