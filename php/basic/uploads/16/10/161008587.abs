Abstract: The lattice Dirac equation is formulated on a simplicial complex which approximates a smooth Riemann manifold by introducing a lattice vierbein on each site and a lattice spin connection on each link. Care is taken so the construction applies to any smooth D-dimensional Riemannian manifold that permits a spin connection. It is tested numerically in 2D for the projective sphere ${\mathbb S}^2$ in the limit of an increasingly refined sequence of triangles. The eigenspectrum and eigenvectors are shown to converge rapidly to the exact result in the continuum limit. In addition comparison is made with the continuum Ising conformal field theory on ${\mathbb S}^2$. Convergence is tested for the two point, $\langle \epsilon(x_1) \epsilon(x_2) \rangle$, and the four point, $\langle \sigma(x_1) \epsilon(x_2) \epsilon(x_3 )\sigma(x_4) \rangle $, correlators for the energy, $\epsilon(x) = i \bar \psi(x)\psi(x)$, and twist operators, $\sigma(x)$, respectively.
