Title: Topology of the Electroweak Vacua
Authors: Ben Gripaios and Oscar Randal-Williams
Abstract: In the Standard Model, the electroweak symmetry is broken by a complex, $SU(2)$-doublet Higgs field and the vacuum manifold $SU(2)\times U(1)/U(1)$ has the topology of a 3-sphere. We remark that there exist alternative effective field theory descriptions that can be fully consistent with existing collider data, but in which the vacuum manifold is homeomorphic to an arbitrary non-trivial principal $U(1)$-bundle over a 2-sphere. These alternatives have non-trivial fundamental group and so lead to topologically-stable electroweak strings. Perhaps the most plausible alternative to $S^3$ is the manifold $\mathbb{R}P^3$ (with fundamental group $\mathbb{Z}/2$), since it allows custodial protection of gauge boson masses and their couplings to fermions. Searches for such strings may thus be regarded as independent, and qualitatively different, precision tests of the SM, in that they are (thus far) astrophysical in nature, and test the global topology, rather than the local geometry, of the electroweak vacua.
