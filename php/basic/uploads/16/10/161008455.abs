Abstract: We analyse the smooth and sharp creation of a pointlike source for a quantised massless scalar field in $(3+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, as a model for the breakdown of correlations that has been proposed to occur at the horizon of an evaporating black hole. After a smooth creation, the renormalised energy density $\langle T_{00} \rangle$ is well defined away from the source, but it is time dependent, and it is so large near the source that the total energy transmitted into the field during the source creation is infinite. In the sharp creation limit, $\langle T_{00} \rangle$ diverges everywhere in the causal future of the creation event, and so does the response of an Unruh-DeWitt detector that operates in the causal future of the creation event. The source creation is hence significantly more singular than the corresponding process in $1+1$ dimensions, and may be sufficiently singular to break down quantum correlations in the way which has been proposed to happen in the spacetime of an evaporating black hole.
