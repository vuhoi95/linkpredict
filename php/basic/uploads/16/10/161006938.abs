Title: Higher-spin currents in the Gross-Neveu model at $1/n^2$
Authors: A. N. Manashov and E. D. Skvortsov
Abstract: We calculate the anomalous dimensions of higher-spin currents, both singlet and non-singlet, in the Gross-Neveu model at the $1/n^2$ order. It was conjectured that in the critical regime this model is dual to a higher-spin gauge theory on $AdS_4$. The $AdS/CFT$ correspondence predicts that the masses of higher-spin fields correspond to the scaling dimensions of the singlet currents in the Gross-Neveu model.
