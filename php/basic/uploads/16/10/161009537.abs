Title: New results on integrable structure of conformal field theory
Authors: H. Boos and F. Smirnov
Abstract: We explain how to incorporate the action of local integrals of motion into the fermionic basis for the sine-Gordon model and its UV CFT. The examples up to the level 4 are presented. Numerical computation support the results. Possible applications are discussed.
