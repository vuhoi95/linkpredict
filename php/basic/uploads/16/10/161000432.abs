Title: Linear perturbation analysis of hairy black holes in shift-symmetric  Horndeski theories I: odd-parity perturbations
Authors: Kazufumi Takahashi and Teruaki Suyama
Abstract: We analyze the mode stability of odd-parity perturbations of black holes with linearly time-dependent scalar hair in shift-symmetric Horndeski theories. We show that a large class of black-hole solutions in these theories suffer from ghost or gradient instability, while there are some classes of solutions that are stable under linear odd-parity perturbations in the context of mode analysis.
