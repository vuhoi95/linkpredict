Title: String field theory solution corresponding to constant background  magnetic field
Authors: Nobuyuki Ishibashi and Isao Kishimoto and Tomohiko Takahashi
Abstract: Following the method recently proposed by Erler and Maccaferri, we construct solutions to the equation of motion of Witten's cubic string field theory, which describe constant magnetic field background. We study the boundary condition changing operators relevant to such background and calculate the operator product expansions of them. We obtain solutions whose classical action coincide with the Born-Infeld action.
