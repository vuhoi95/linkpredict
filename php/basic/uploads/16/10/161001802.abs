Title: Infinity in string cosmology: A review through open problems
Authors: Ignatios Antoniadis and Spiros Cotsakis
Abstract: We review recent developments in the field of string cosmology with particular emphasis on open problems having to do mainly with geometric asymptotics and singularities. We discuss outstanding issues in a variety of currently popular themes, such as tree-level string cosmology asymptotics, higher-order string correction effects, M-theory cosmology, braneworlds, and finally ambient cosmology.
