Title: Time-independent wormholes
Authors: Zicao Fu and Donald Marolf and Eric Mefford
Abstract: We study two-sided static wormholes with an exact Killing symmetry that translates both mouths of the wormhole toward the future. This differs from the familiar Kruskal wormhole whose time translation is future-directed only in one asymptotic region and is instead past-directed in the other. Our spacetimes are solutions to Einstein-Hilbert gravity sourced by scalar domain walls. Explicit examples are found in the thin wall approximation. More generally, we show that such spacetimes can arise in the presence of scalar fields with potentials that are $C^1$ but not $C^2$ and find examples numerically. However, solutions with an exact such Killing symmetry are forbidden when the scalar potential is smooth. Finally, we consider the mutual information of boundary regions associated with such wormholes in AdS/CFT. Although the interior of our solutions are unstable, we find that even mutual informations between opposite boundaries are already thermalized at any finite $t$ in the sense that they agree with the $t\rightarrow \infty$ limit of results from the familiar AdS-Kruskal solution.
