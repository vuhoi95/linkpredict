Title: Algebraic approach to form factors in the complex sinh-Gordon theory
Authors: Michael Lashkevich and Yaroslav Pugai
Abstract: We study form factors of the quantum complex sinh-Gordon theory in the algebraic approach. In the case of exponential fields the form factors can be obtained from the known form factors of the $Z_N$-symmetric Ising model. The algebraic construction also provides an Ansatz for form factors of descendant operators. We obtain generating functions of such form factors and establish their main properties: the cluster factorization and reflection equations.
