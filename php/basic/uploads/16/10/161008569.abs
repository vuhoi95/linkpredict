Title: Relativistic dipole interaction and the topological nature for induced  HMW and AC phases
Authors: Xiao-Gang He and Bruce McKellar
Abstract: In this work we construct relativistic Lagrangian density for the AC and HMW topological phases by induced electric and magnetic dipoles and clarify some of the conditions for producing topological phases which have not been properly discussed in previous studies. We also found that in both cases, the topological phases are induced by the cross product of electric and magnetic fields in the form $\bm{B} \times \bm{E}$ which reinforces the dual nature of these two topological phases.
