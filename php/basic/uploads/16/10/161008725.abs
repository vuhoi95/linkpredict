Abstract: Advanced LIGO's discovery of gravitational-wave events GW150914 and GW151226 has stimulated extensive studies on the origin of binary black holes. Supposing the gravitational-wave events could be explained by binary primordial black hole (PBH) mergers, we investigate the corresponding stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) and point out the possibility to detect this SGWB spectrum, in particular from the subsolar mass PBHs, by the Advanced LIGO in the near future. We also use the non-detection of SGWB to give a new independent constraint on the abundance of PBHs in dark matter.
