Title: Spin Topological Field Theory and Fermionic Matrix Product States
Authors: Anton Kapustin and Alex Turzillo and Minyoung You
Abstract: We study state-sum constructions of G-equivariant spin-TQFTs and their relationship to Matrix Product States. We show that in the Neveu-Schwarz, Ramond, and twisted sectors, the states of the theory are generalized Matrix Product States. We apply our results to revisit the classification of fermionic Short-Range-Entangled phases with a unitary symmetry G and determine the group law on the set of such phases. Interesting subtleties appear when the total symmetry group is a nontrivial extension of G by fermion parity.
