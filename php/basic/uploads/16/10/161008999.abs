Title: Vortices with source, FQHE and nontrivial statistics in 2+1 dimensions
Authors: Horatiu Nastase and Francisco Rojas
Abstract: We investigate vortex soliton solutions in 2+1 dimensional scalar gauge theories, in the presence of source terms in the action. Concretely, this would be applied to anyons, as well as the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE). We classify solitons for renormalizable potentials, as well as some nonrenormalizable examples that could be relevant for the FQHE. The non-Abelian case, specifically for theories with global non-Abelian symmetries, is also investigated, as is the non-relativistic limit of the above theories, when we get a modification of the Jackiw-Pi model, with an interesting new vortex solution. We explore the application to the ABJM model, as well as more general SYM-CS models in 2+1 dimensions.
