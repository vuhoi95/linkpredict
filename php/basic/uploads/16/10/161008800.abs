Title: D = 3 Unification of Curious Supergravities
Authors: M. J. Duff and S. Ferrara and A. Marrani
Abstract: We consider the dimensional reduction to D = 3 of four maximal-rank supergravities which preserve minimal supersymmetry in D = 11, 7, 5 and 4. Such "curious" theories were investigated some time ago, and the four-dimensional one corresponds to an N = 1 supergravity with 7 chiral multiplets spanning the seven-disk manifold. Recently, this latter theory was considered to provide cosmological models for alpha-attractors, which are based on the disk geometry with possible restrictions on the parameter alpha. A unified picture emerges in D = 3, where the Ehlers group of General Relativity merges with the S-, T- and U- dualities of the D = 4 parent theories.
