Title: Bosonic Partition Functions at Nonzero (Imaginary) Chemical Potential
Authors: M. Kellerstein and J. J. M. Verbaarschot
Abstract: We consider bosonic random matrix partition functions at nonzero chemical potential and compare the chiral condensate, the baryon number density and the baryon number susceptibility to the result of the corresponding fermionic partition function. We find that as long as results are finite, the phase transition of the fermionic theory persists in the bosonic theory. However, in case that bosonic partition function diverges and has to be regularized, the phase transition of the fermionic theory does not occur in the bosonic theory, and the bosonic theory is always in the broken phase.
