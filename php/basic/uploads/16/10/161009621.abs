Title: Hamiltonian analysis of the BFCG theory for a generic Lie 2-group
Authors: Aleksandar Mikovic and Miguel Angelo Oliveira and Marko Vojinovic
Abstract: We perform a complete Hamiltonian analysis of the BFCG action for a general Lie 2-group by using the Dirac procedure. We show that the resulting dynamical constraints eliminate all local degrees of freedom which implies that the BFCG theory is a topological field theory.
