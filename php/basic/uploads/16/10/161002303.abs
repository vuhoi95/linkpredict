Title: Miura and Generalized BÃ¤cklund Transformation for KdV Hierarchy
Authors: J. F. Gomes and A. L. Retore and A. H. Zimerman
Abstract: Using the fact that Miura transformation can be expressed in the form of gauge transformation connecting the KdV and mKdV equations, we discuss the derivation of the B\"acklund transformation and its Miura-gauge transformation connecting both hierarchies.
