Title: SU(2) Flat Connection on Riemann Surface and Twisted Geometry with  Cosmological Constant
Authors: Muxin Han and Zichang Huang
Abstract: SU(2) flat connection on 2D Riemann surface is shown to relate to the generalized twisted geometry in 3D space with cosmological constant. Various flat connection quantities on Riemann surface are mapped to the geometrical quantities in discrete 3D space. We propose that the moduli space of SU(2) flat connections on Riemann surface generalizes the phase space of twisted geometry or Loop Quantum Gravity to include the cosmological constant.
