Title: Holographic QCD predictions for production and decay of pseudoscalar  glueballs
Authors: Frederic Br√ºnner and Anton Rebhan
Abstract: The top-down holographic Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model for low-energy QCD, augmented by finite quark masses, has recently been found to be able to reproduce the decay pattern of the scalar glueball candidate f0(1710) on a quantitative level. In this Letter we show that this model predicts a narrow pseudoscalar glueball heavier than the scalar glueball and with a very restricted decay pattern involving eta or eta' mesons. Production should be either in pairs or in association with eta(') mesons. We discuss the prospect of discovery in high-energy hadron collider experiments through central exclusive production by comparing with eta' pair production.
