Title: One-loop structure of the U(1) gauge model on the truncated Heisenberg  space
Authors: Maja Burić and Luka Nenadović and Dragan Prekrat
Abstract: We calculate divergent one-loop corrections to the propagators of the U(1) gauge theory on the truncated Heisenberg space, which is one of the extensions of the Grosse-Wulkenhaar model. The model is purely geometric, based on the Yang-Mills action; the corresponding gauge-fixed theory is BRST invariant. We quantize perturbatively and, along with the usual wave-function and mass renormalizations, we find divergent nonlocal terms of the $\Box^{-1}$ and $\Box^{-2}$ type. We discuss the meaning of these terms and possible improvements of the model.
