Title: RG flow of entanglement entropy to thermal entropy
Authors: Ki-Seok Kim and Chanyong Park
Abstract: Utilizing the holographic technique, we investigate how the entanglement entropy evolves along the RG flow. After defining a new generalized entanglement temperature which satisfies the thermodynamics-like law even in the IR regime, we show that the renormalized entanglement entropy and temperature in the IR limit approach to the thermal entropy and temperature of a real thermal system. Intriguingly, the thermalization of the IR entanglement entropy generally happens regardless of the detail of a dual field theory. We check such a universality for a two-dimensional CFT, a Lifshitz field theory, and a non-conformal field theory. In addition, we also show that for a two-dimensional scale invariant theory the first quantum correction to the IR entanglement entropy leads to a logarithmic term caused by the remnant of the short distance quantum correlation near the entangling surface.
