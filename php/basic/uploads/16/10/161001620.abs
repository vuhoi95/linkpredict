Title: F-brane Dynamics
Authors: William D. Linch III and Warren Siegel
Abstract: We generalize the current algebra of constraints of U-duality-covariant critical superstrings to include the generator responsible for the dynamics of the fundamental brane. This allows us to define $\kappa$ symmetry and to write a worldvolume action in Hamiltonian form that is manifestly supersymmetric in the target space. The Lagrangian form of this action is generally covariant, but the worldvolume metric has fewer components than expected.
