Title: Unitarity and Lee-Wick prescription at one loop level in Myers-Pospelov  electrodynamics: the $e^++e^-$ annihilation
Authors: Carlos M. Reyes and L. F. Urrutia
Abstract: We study perturbative unitarity in a Lorentz symmetry violating QED model with higher-order derivative operators in the light of the results of Lee and Wick to preserve unitarity in indefinite metric theories. Specifically, we consider the fermionic sector of the Myers-Pospelov model, which includes dimension five operators, coupled to standard photons. We canonically quantize the model and show that its Hamiltonian is stable, emphasizing the exact stage at which the indefinite metric appears and decomposes into a positive-metric sector and negative-metric sector. Finally, we verify the optical theorem at the one-loop level in the annihilation channel of the forward scattering process $e^+(p_2, r) + e^-(p_1,s)$ by applying the Lee-Wick prescription in which the states associated with the negative metric are left out from the asymptotic Hilbert space.
