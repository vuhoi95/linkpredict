Title: Vacua Morghulis
Authors: Ben Freivogel and Matthew Kleban
Abstract: We conjecture that all vacua in string theory decay. More precisely, non-supersymmetric vacua in string theory are at most metastable and eventually decay, while supersymmetric vacua are only marginally stable. All de Sitter vacua with small cosmological constant are metastable to decay via a process that occurs on scales small compared to the horizon size.
