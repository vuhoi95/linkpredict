Title: Pale Glares of Dark Matter in Quantum Spacetime
Authors: Sergio Doplicher and Klaus Fredenhagen and Gerardo Morsella and Nicola Pinamonti
Abstract: A U(1) gauge theory turns, on physically motivated models of Quantum Spacetime, into a U($\infty$) gauge theory, hence free classical electrodynamics is no longer free and neutral fields may have electromagnetic interactions. We discuss the last point for scalar fields, possibly describing dark matter; we have in mind the gravitational collapse of binary systems or future applications to self gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates as possible sources of evidence of quantum gravitational phenomena. The effects so far considered, however, seem too faint to be detectable at present.
