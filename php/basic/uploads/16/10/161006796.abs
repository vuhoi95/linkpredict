Abstract: The unification of quantum mechanics and gravity remains one of the main challenges in modern physics. Quantum-gravity-inspired phenomenological models offer a window to explore potential aspects of such a theory including observable consequences. One such phenomenological model is the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), which predicts a modified Heisenberg uncertainty relation and a deformed canonical commutator. It was recently shown that under some assumptions, opto-mechanical systems can put stringent experimental bounds on such models. In this paper, we introduce a scheme to increase the sensitivity of these experiments with an extended sequence of optomechanical interactions. We also analyze the effects of optical phase noise and optical loss and present a strategy to mitigate such deleterious effects.
