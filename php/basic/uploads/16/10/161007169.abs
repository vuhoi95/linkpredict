Title: Interaction-Free Effects Between Distant Atoms
Authors: Yakir Aharonov and Eliahu Cohen and Avshalom C. Elitzur and Lee Smolin
Abstract: A gedankenexperiment is presented where an excited and a ground-state atom are positioned such that, within the former's half-life time, they exchange a photon with 50% probability. A measurement of their energy state will therefore indicate in 50% of the cases that no photon was exchanged. Yet other measurements would reveal that, by the mere possibility of exchange, the two atoms become entangled. Consequently, the "no exchange" result, apparently precluding entanglement, is non-locally established between the atoms by this very entanglement. When densely repeated several times, this result gives rise to the Quantum Zeno effect as well, again exerted between distant atoms without photon exchange. We discuss these experiments as variants of IFM, now generalized for both spatial and temporal uncertainties. We next employ weak measurements for a sharper and simpler elucidation of the paradox. Interpretational issues are discussed in the conclusion, and a resolution is offered within the Two-State Vector Formalism and its new Heisenberg ontology.
