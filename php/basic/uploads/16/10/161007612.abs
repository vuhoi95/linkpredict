Abstract: We study extremal correlation functions of chiral primary operators in the large-N SU(N) ${\cal N} = 2$ superconformal QCD theory and present new results based on supersymmetric localization. We discuss extensively the basis-independent data that can be extracted from these correlators using the leading order large-N matrix model free energy given by the four-sphere partition function. Special emphasis is given to single-trace 2- and 3-point functions as well as a new class of observables that are scalars on the conformal manifold. These new observables are particular quadratic combinations of the structure constants of the chiral ring. At weak 't Hooft coupling we present perturbative results that, in principle, can be extended to arbitrarily high order. We obtain closed-form expressions up to the first subleading order. At strong coupling we provide analogous results based on an approximate Wiener-Hopf method.
