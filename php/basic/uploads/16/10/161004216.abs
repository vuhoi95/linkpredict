Abstract: This paper shows a new approach to obtain analytical topological defects for a 2D Myers-Pospelov Lagrangian for two scalar fields. Such a Lagrangian presents higher-order kinetic terms, which lead us to equations of motion which are non-trivial to be integrated. Here we describe three possible scenarios for the equations of motion, named by time-like, space-like and light-like respectively. We started our investigation with a kink-like travelling wave Ansatz for the free theory, which led us to constraints for the dispersion relations of each scenario. We also introduced a method to obtain analytical solution for the general theory in the three mentioned scenarios. We exemplified the method and discussed the behavior of the defects solutions.
