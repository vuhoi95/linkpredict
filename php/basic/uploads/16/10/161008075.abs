Title: Composite Genus One Belyi Maps
Authors: Raimundas Vidunas and Yang-Hui He
Abstract: Motivated by a demand for explicit genus 1 Belyi maps from theoretical physics, we give an efficient method of explicitly computing genus one Belyi maps by (1) composing covering maps from elliptic curves to the Riemann sphere with simpler (univariate) genus zero Belyi maps, as well as by (2) composing further with isogenies between elliptic curves. This gives many new explicit dessins on the doubly periodic plane, including several which have been realized in the physics literature as so-called brane-tilings in the context of quiver gauge theories.
