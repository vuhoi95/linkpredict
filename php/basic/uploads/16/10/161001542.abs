Title: Holographic Complexity for Time-Dependent Backgrounds
Authors: Davood Momeni and Mir Faizal and Sebastian Bahamonde and Ratbay Myrzakulov
Abstract: In this paper, we will analyse the holographic complexity for time-dependent asymptotically $AdS$ geometries. We will first use a covariant zero mean curvature slicing of the time-dependent bulk geometries, and then use this co-dimension one spacelike slice of the bulk spacetime to define a co-dimension two minimal surface. The time-dependent holographic complexity will be defined using the volume enclosed by this minimal surface. This time-dependent holographic complexity will reduce to the usual holographic complexity for static geometries. We will analyse the time-dependence as a perturbation of the asymptotically $AdS$ geometries. Thus, we will obtain time-dependent asymptotically $AdS$ geometries, and we will calculate the holographic complexity for such a time-dependent geometries.
