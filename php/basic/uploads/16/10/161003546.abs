Title: Classical Field-Theoretical approach to the non-linear q-Klein-Gordon  Equation
Authors: A. Plastino and M. C. Rocca
Abstract: In the wake of efforts made in [EPL {\bf 97}, 41001 (2012)], we extend them here by developing a classical field theory (FT)to the q-Klein-Gordon equation advanced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 106}, 140601 (2011)]. This makes it possible to generate a hipotetical conjecture regarding black matter. We also develop the classical field theory for a q-Schrodinger equation, different from the one in [EPL {\bf 97}, 41001 (2012)], that was deduced in [Phys. Lett. A {\bf 379}, 2690 (2015)] from the hypergeometric differential equation. Our two classical theories reduce to the usual quantum FT for $q\rightarrow 1$.
