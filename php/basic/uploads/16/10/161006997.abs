Title: The Area Term of the Entanglement Entropy of a Supersymmetric $O(N)$  Vector Model in Three Dimensions
Authors: Ling-Yan Hung and Yikun Jiang and Yixu Wang
Abstract: We studied the leading area term of the entanglement entropy of $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric $O(N)$ vector model in $2+1$ dimensions close to the line of second order phase transition in the large $N$ limit. We found that the area term is independent of the varying interaction coupling along the critical line, unlike what is expected in a perturbative theory. Along the way, we studied non-commuting limits $n-1\to 0$ verses UV cutoff $r\to 0$ when evaluating the gap equation and found a match only when appropriate counter term is introduced and whose coupling is chosen to take its fixed point value. As a bonus, we also studied Fermionic Green's functions in the conical background. We made the observation of a map between the problem and the relativistic hydrogen atom.
