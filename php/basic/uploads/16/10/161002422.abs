Title: Higher Dimensional Generalizations of the SYK Model
Authors: Micha Berkooz and Prithvi Narayan and Moshe Rozali and Joan Sim√≥n
Abstract: We discuss a 1+1 dimensional generalization of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. The model contains $N$ Majorana fermions at each lattice site with a nearest-neighbour hopping term. The SYK random interaction is restricted to low momentum fermions of definite chirality within each lattice site. This gives rise to an ordinary 1+1 field theory above some energy scale and a low energy SYK-like behavior. We exhibit a class of low-pass filters which give rise to a rich variety of hyperscaling behaviour in the IR. We also discuss another set of generalizations which describes probing an SYK system with an external fermion, together with the new scaling behavior they exhibit in the IR.
