Title: 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ minimal SCFTs from Wrapped M5-branes
Authors: Jin-Beom Bae and Dongmin Gang and Jaehoon Lee
Abstract: We study CFT data of 3-dimensional superconformal field theories (SCFTs) arising from wrapped two M5-branes on closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Via so-called 3d/3d correspondence, central charges of these SCFTs are related to a $SL(2)$ Chern-Simons (CS) invariant on the 3-manifolds. We give a rigorous definition of the invariant in terms of resurgence theory and a state-integral model for the complex CS theory. We numerically evaluate the central charges for several closed 3-manifolds with small hyperbolic volume. The computation suggests that the wrapped M5-brane systems give infinitely many discrete SCFTs with small central charges. We also analyze these `minimal' SCFTs in the eye of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal bootstrap.
