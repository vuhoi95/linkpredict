Abstract: We show that the recently observed gravitational-wave signal of the event GW150914 can be used to constrain dimensionless parameter of generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). According to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (HUP) and the event GW150914 data, we derive the standard energy-momentum dispersion relation and calculate difference between the speed of gravitonand the speed of light, that is $\Delta \upsilon$. Subsequently, by utilizing two proposals for GUP, we generalize our work to quantum gravity case and obtain the modified speed of graviton. Finally, comparing the modified speed of graviton with $\Delta \upsilon$, the improved upper bound of the GUP parameters are found. The results show that the upper limit of the GUP parameters $\beta_0$ and $\alpha_0$ are $2.33285 \times 10^ {60}$ and $1.80912 \times 10^{20}$.
