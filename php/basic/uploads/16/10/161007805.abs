Title: Linearized supergravity with a dynamical preferred frame
Authors: Arthur Marakulin and Sergey Sibiryakov
Abstract: We study supersymmetric extension of the Einstein-aether gravitational model where local Lorentz invariance is broken down to the subgroup of spatial rotations by a vacuum expectation value of a timelike vector field. By restricting to the level of linear perturbations around Lorentz-violating vacuum and using the superfield formalism we construct the most general action invariant under the linearized supergravity transformations. We show that, unlike its non-supersymmetric counterpart, the model contains only a single free dimensionless parameter, besides the usual dimensionful gravitational coupling. This makes the model highly predictive. An analysis of the spectrum of physical excitations reveal superluminal velocity of gravitons. The latter property leads to the extension of the gravitational multiplet by additional fermonic and bosonic states with helicities $\pm 3/2$ and $\pm 1$. We outline the observational constraints on the model following from its low-energy phenomenology.
