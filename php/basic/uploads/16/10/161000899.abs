Title: Localization of massive and massless fermion on two field brane
Authors: A. Farokhtabar and A. Tofighi
Abstract: In this paper we study fermion localization and resonances on a special type of braneworld model supporting brane splitting. In such models one can construct multi-wall branes which cause considerable simplification in field equations. We use a polynomial superpotential to construct this brane. The suitable Yukawa coupling between the background scalar field and localized fermion is determined. The massive fermion resonance spectrum is obtained. The number of resonances is increased for higher values of Yukawa coupling.
