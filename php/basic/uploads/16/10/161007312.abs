Title: Topological phase transition in a gravity description of the  transverse-field Ising model in one dimension
Authors: Ki-Seok Kim and Chanyong Park
Abstract: We develop a gravity reformulation for a topological phase transition of the Kitaev superconductor model in one dimension. Applying the Wilson's renormalization group procedure repeatedly, we find an effective theory with a renormalized coupling function, where the repetition index of the renormalization group transformation is identified with an extra dimension. Solving the renormalization group equation, we obtain an effective interaction vertex as a function of the extra dimension. The topological quantum phase transition is encoded into the gravity description as follows: First, the inter-site correlation (hopping and pairing) strength of spinless fermions given by a ferromagnetic coupling constant in the transverse-field Ising model is renormalized to vanish in a topologically trivial p-wave superconducting state, adiabatically connected to a trivial insulating behavior. Second, the inter-site correlation strength does not evolve at a quantum critical point, giving rise to a conformal field theory that does not change in the renormalization group transformation. Third, the hopping-pairing coefficient turns out to change its sign at a position $\Lambda_{H}$ in the extra dimension, implying that the renormalization group transformation is not allowed further beyond this length scale. In particular, we observe that the dynamics of such spinless fermions becomes extremely slow near $\Lambda \rightarrow \Lambda_{H}$, regarded to be "classical" essentially. Since the coupling function can be reformulated to result in a metric structure of the emergent space and time, we interpret such a length scale as an event horizon of a black hole. We argue this aspect more sincerely based on the comparison between the entanglement entropy and the thermodynamic entropy.
