Title: Causality Constraints on Massive Gravity
Authors: Xián O. Camanho and Gustavo Lucena Gómez and Rakibur Rahman
Abstract: The parameter space of the de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley massive gravity ought to be constrained essentially to a line. The theory is shown to admit pp-wave backgrounds on which linear fluctuations otherwise undergo significant time advances, potentially leading to closed time-like curves. This classical phenomenon takes place well within the theory's validity regime.
