Abstract: We test the holographic relation between the vacuum expectation values (vevs) of gauge invariant operators in ${\cal N} = 6$ ${\rm U}_{k}(N)\times {\rm U}_{-k}(N)$ mass-deformed ABJM theory and the LLM geometries with $\mathbb{Z}_k$ orbifold in 11-dimensional supergravity. To do that, we apply the Kaluza-Klein reduction to construct a 4-dimensional gravity theory and implement the holographic renormalization procedure. We obtain an exact holographic relation for the vevs of the chiral primary operator with conformal dimension $\Delta = 1$, which is given by $\langle {\cal O}^{(\Delta=1)}\rangle= N^{\frac32} \, f_{(\Delta=1)}$, for {\it finite} $N$ and $k=1$. Here factor $f_{(\Delta)}$ is independent of $N$. Our results involve infinite number of exact dual relations for all possible supersymmetric Higgs vacua and so provide a nontrivial test of gauge/gravity duality away from the conformal fixed point without taking the usual large $N$ limit. We also extend our results to the case of $k\ne 1$ for LLM geometries represented by rectangular-shaped Young-diagrams.
