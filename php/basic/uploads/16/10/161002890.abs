Title: On Butterfly effect in Higher Derivative Gravities
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha and Ali Davody and Ali Naseh and Seyed Farid Taghavi
Abstract: We study butterfly effect in $D$-dimensional gravitational theories containing terms quadratic in Ricci scalar and Ricci tensor. One observes that due to higher order derivatives in the corresponding equations of motion there are two butterfly velocities. The velocities are determined by the dimension of operators whose sources are provided by the metric. The three dimensional TMG model is also studied where we get two butterfly velocities at generic point of the moduli space of parameters. At critical point two velocities coincide.
