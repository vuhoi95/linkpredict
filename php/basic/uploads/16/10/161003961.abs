Title: Long N=2, 4 multiplets in supersymmetric mechanics
Authors: Evgeny Ivanov and Antonio Rivasplata Mendoza and Stepan Sidorov
Abstract: We define SU(2|1) supermultiplets described by chiral superfields having non-zero external spins with respect to SU(2) \subset SU(2|1) and show that their splitting into N=2, d=1 multiplets contains the so called "long" indecomposable N=2, d=1 multiplets (2, 4, 2)_l. We give superfield formulation for this type of N=2 long multiplets and construct their most general superfield action. A simple example of long N=4, d=1 multiplet is also considered, both in the superfield and the component formulations.
