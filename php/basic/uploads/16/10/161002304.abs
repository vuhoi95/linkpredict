Title: On the trace anomaly of a Weyl fermion
Authors: Fiorenzo Bastianelli and Riccardo Martelli
Abstract: We calculate the trace anomaly of a Weyl fermion coupled to gravity by using Fujikawa's method supplemented by a consistent regulator. The latter is constructed out of Pauli-Villars regulating fields. The motivation for presenting such a calculation stems from recent studies that suggest that the trace anomaly of chiral fermions in four dimensions might contain an imaginary part proportional to the Pontryagin density. We find that the trace anomaly of a Weyl fermion is given by half the trace anomaly of a Dirac fermion, so that no imaginary part proportional to the Pontryagin density is seen to arise.
