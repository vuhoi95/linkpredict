Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of the asymptotically flat static black hole in Lovelock back ground where the coupling constants of the Lovelock theory effects are taken into account. We consider the effects of the second order of the coupling constant, and third order of the Lovelock constant coefficient on the thermodynamics of asymptotically flat static black holes. In this case the effect of the coupling constants on the thermodynamics of the black hole are discussed for 5, 6, and 7 dimensional spacetime.
