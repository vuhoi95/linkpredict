Abstract: We study the diphoton excesses near $750$ GeV recently reported by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations within the context of a phenomenologically interesting intersecting/magnetized D-brane model on a toroidal orientifold. It is shown that the model contains a SM singlet scalar as well as vector-like quarks and leptons. In addition, it is shown that the singlet scalar has Yukawa couplings with vector-like quarks and leptons such that it may be produced in proton-proton collisions via gluon fusion as well as decay to diphotons through loops involving the vector-like quarks. Moreover, the required vector-like quarks and leptons may appear in complete $SU(5)$ multiplets so that gauge coupling unification may be maintained. Finally, it is shown that the diphoton signal may be explained within the model.
