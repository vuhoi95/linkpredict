Title: New supersymmetric black holes in four dimensional N=2 supergravity
Authors: Taniya Mandal and Prasanta K. Tripathy
Abstract: In this paper we consider the four dimensional N=2 supergravity theory arising from the compactification of type IIA string theory on a Calabi-Yau manifold. We analyse the supersymmetric flow equations for static, spherically symmetric, single-centered black holes. These flow equations are solved by a set of algebraic equations involving the holomorphic sections and harmonic functions. We examine black hole configurations with D0-D4-D6 charge for which the most general solution of these algebraic equations are considered. Though the black hole solution is unique for a given value of the charges, we find new phases of the black hole solutions upon varying them.
