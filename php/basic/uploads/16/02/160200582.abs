Title: Fusing defect for the N=2 super sinh-Gordon model
Authors: N. I. Spano and A. R. Aguirre and J. F. Gomes and A. H. Zimerman
Abstract: In this paper we derive the type-II integrable defect for the N = 2 supersymmetric sinh-Gordon (sshG) model by using the fusing procedure. In particular, we show explicitly the conservation of the modified energy, momentum and supercharges.
