Title: Deformed phase spaces with group valued momenta
Authors: Michele Arzano and Francisco Nettel
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for describing deformed phase spaces with group valued momenta. Using techniques from the theory of Poisson-Lie groups and Lie bi-algebras we develop tools for constructing Poisson structures on the deformed phase space starting from the minimal input of the algebraic structure of the generators of the momentum Lie group. The tools developed are used to derive Poisson structures on examples of group momentum space much studied in the literature such as the $n$-dimensional generalization of the $\kappa$-deformed momentum space and the $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$ momentum space in three space-time dimensions. We discuss classical momentum observables associated to multi-particle systems and argue that these combine according the usual four-vector addition despite the non-abelian group structure of momentum space.
