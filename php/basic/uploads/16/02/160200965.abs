Abstract: Lensing of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) changes the morphology of pattern of temperature fluctuations, so topological descriptors such as Minkowski Functionals can probe the gravity model responsible for the lensing. We show how the recently introduced two-to-two and three-to-one kurt-spectra (and their associated correlation functions), which depend on the power spectrum of the lensing potential, can be used to probe modified gravity theories such as $f({R})$ theories of gravity and quintessence models. We also investigate models based on effective field theory, which include the constant-$\Omega$ model, and low-energy Ho\vrava theories. Estimates of the cumulative signal-to-noise for detection of lensing-induced morphology changes, reaches ${\cal O}(10^3)$ for the future planned CMB polarization mission COrE$^{+}$. Assuming foreground removal is possible to $\ell_{max}=3000$, we show that many modified gravity theories can be rejected with a high level of significance, making this technique comparable in power to galaxy weak lensing or redshift surveys. These topological estimators are also useful in distinguishing {\em lensing} from other scattering secondaries at the level of the four-point function or trispectrum. Examples include the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect which shares, with lensing, a lack of spectral distortion. We also discuss the complication of foreground contamination from unsubtracted point sources.
