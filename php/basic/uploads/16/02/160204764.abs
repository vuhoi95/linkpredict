Title: Comments on Graviton Propagation in Light of GW150914
Authors: John Ellis and Nick E. Mavromatos and Dimitri V. Nanopoulos
Abstract: The observation of gravitational waves from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) event GW150914 may be used to constrain the possibility of Lorentz violation in graviton propagation, and the observation by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor of a transient source in apparent coincidence may be used to constrain the difference between the velocities of light and gravitational waves: $c_g - c_\gamma < 10^{-17}$.
