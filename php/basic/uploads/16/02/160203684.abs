Title: A non-supersymmetric model with unification of electro-weak and strong  interactions
Authors: Roberto Frezzotti and Marco Garofalo and Giancarlo Rossi
Abstract: In this note we present an example of an extension of the Standard Model where unification of strong and electroweak interactions occurs at a level comparable to that occurring in the minimal supersymmetric standard model.
