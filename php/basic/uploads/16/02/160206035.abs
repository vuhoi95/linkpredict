Title: Hawking Radiation as a Probe for the Interior Structure of Regular Black  Holes
Authors: Yanbin Deng and Gerald Cleaver
Abstract: The notion of the black hole singularity and the proof of the singularity theorem were considered great successes in classical general relativity. Singularities had presented deep puzzles to physicists. Conceptual challenges were set up by the intractability of the singularity. The existence of black hole horizons which cover up the interior, including the singularity of the black hole from outside observers, builds an information curtain, further hindering physicists from understanding the nature of the singularity and the interior structure of black holes. The regular black hole is a concept produced out of multiple attempts of establishing a tractable and understandable interior structure for black hole as well as avoiding the singularity behind the black hole horizon. A method is needed to check the correctness of the new constructions of black holes. After studying the Hawking radiation by fermion tunnelling from one type of regular black hole, structure dependent results were obtained. The result being structure dependent points out the prospects of employing the Hawking radiation as a method to probe into the structure of black holes.
