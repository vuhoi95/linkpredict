Title: Component versus Superspace Approaches to D=4, N=1 Conformal  Supergravity
Authors: Taichiro Kugo and Ryo Yokokura and Koichi Yoshioka
Abstract: The superspace formulation of N=1 conformal supergravity in four dimensions is demonstrated to be equivalent to the conventional component field approach based on the superconformal tensor calculus. The detailed correspondence between two approaches is explicitly given for various quantities; superconformal gauge fields, curvatures and curvature constraints, general conformal multiplets and their transformation laws, and so on. In particular, we carefully analyze the curvature constraints leading to the superconformal algebra and also the superconformal gauge fixing leading to Poincare supergravity since they look rather different between two approaches.
