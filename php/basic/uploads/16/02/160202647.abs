Title: The NS limit of the 5D Superconformal Index
Authors: Constantinos Papageorgakis and Alessandro Pini and Diego Rodriguez-Gomez
Abstract: We consider the Nekrasov-Shatashvili (NS) limit of the five-dimensional superconformal index and propose a novel prescription for selecting the finite contributions. Applying the latter to various examples of U(1) theories, we find that the 5D NS index can be reproduced using recent techniques of C\'ordova and Shao, who related the 4D Schur index to the BPS spectrum of the theory on the Coulomb branch. In this picture, the 5D instanton solitons are interpreted as additional flavour nodes in an associated 5D BPS quiver.
