Title: Noether's theorem in non-local field theories
Authors: M. I. Krivoruchenko and A. A. Tursunov
Abstract: Explicit expressions are constructed for a locally conserved vector current associated with a continuous internal symmetry and for energy-momentum and angular-momentum density tensors associated with the Poincar\'e group in field theories with higher-order derivatives and in non-local field theories. An example of non-local charged scalar field equations with broken C and CPT symmetries is considered. For this case, we find simple analytical expressions for the conserved currents.
