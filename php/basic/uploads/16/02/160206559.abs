Abstract: We investigate the continuum spectrum of the SU(2) gauge theory with $N_f=2$ flavours of fermions in the fundamental representation. This model provides a minimal template which is ideal for a wide class of Standard Model extensions featuring novel strong dynamics that range from composite (Goldstone) Higgs theories to several intriguing types of dark matter candidates, such as the SIMPs. We improve our previous lattice analysis [1] by adding more data at light quark masses, at two additional lattice spacings, by determining the lattice cutoff via a Wilson flow measure of the $w_0$ parameter, and by measuring the relevant renormalisation constants non-perturbatively in the RI'-MOM scheme. Our results for the lightest isovector states in the vector and axial channels, in units of the pseudoscalar decay constant, are $m_V/F_{\rm{PS}}\sim 13.1(2.2)$ and $m_A/F_{\rm{PS}}\sim 14.5(3.6)$ (combining statistical and systematic errors). In the context of the composite (Goldstone) Higgs models, our result for the spin-one resonances are $m_V > 3.2(5)$ TeV and $m_A > 3.6(9)$ TeV, which are above the current LHC constraints. In the context of dark matter models, for the SIMP case our results indicate the occurrence of a compressed spectrum at the required large dark pion mass, which implies the need to include the effects of spin-one resonances in phenomenological estimates.
