Title: Quantum walk on spin network
Authors: M. M. Amaral and R. Aschheim and Klee Irwin
Abstract: We apply a discrete quantum walk from a quantum particle on a discrete quantum spacetime from loop quantum gravity and show that the related Entanglement Entropy can drive a entropic force. We apply this concepts to propose a model of a walker position topologically encoded on a spin network.
