Title: Two-Field Born-Infeld with Diverse Dualities
Authors: S. Ferrara and A. Sagnotti and A. Yeranyan
Abstract: We elaborate on how to build, in a systematic fashion, two-field Abelian extensions of the Born-Infeld Lagrangian. These models realize the non-trivial duality groups that are allowed in this case, namely U(2), SU(2) and U(1)xU(1). For each class, we also construct an explicit example. They all involve an overall square root and reduce to the Born-Infeld model if the two fields are identified, but differ in quartic and higher interactions. The U(1)xU(1) and SU(2) examples recover some recent results obtained with different techniques, and we show that the U(1)xU(1) model admits an N=1 supersymmetric completion. The U(2) example includes some unusual terms that are not analytic at the origin of field space.
