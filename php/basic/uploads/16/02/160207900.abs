Title: A Topological-like Model for Gravity in 4D Space-time
Authors: Ivan Morales and Bruno Neves and Zui Oporto and Olivier Piguet
Abstract: In this paper we consider a model for gravity in 4-dimensional space-time originally proposed by Chamseddine, which may be derived by dimensional reduction and truncation from a 5-dimensional Chern-Simons theory. Its topological origin makes it an interesting candidate for an easier quantization, e.g., in the Loop Quantization framework. The present paper is dedicated to a classical analysis of the model's properties. Cosmological solutions as well as wave solutions are found and compared with the corresponding solutions of Einstein's General Relativity with cosmological constant.
