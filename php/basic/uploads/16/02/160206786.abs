Title: Generalized quark-antiquark potentials from a $q$-deformed AdS$_5 \times  $S$^5$ background
Authors: Takashi Kameyama and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We study minimal surfaces with a single cusp in a $q$-deformed AdS$_5\times$S$^5$ background. The cusp is composed of two half-lines with an arbitrary angle and is realized on a surface specified in the deformed AdS$_5$. The classical string solutions attached to this cusp are regarded as a generalization of configurations studied by Drukker and Forini in the undeformed case. By taking an antiparallel-lines limit, a quark-antiquark potential for the $q$-deformed case is derived with a certain subtraction scheme. The resulting potential becomes linear at short distances with a finite deformation parameter. In particular, the linear behavior for the gravity dual of noncommutative gauge theories can be reproduced as a special scaling limit. Finally we study the near straight-line limit of the potential.
