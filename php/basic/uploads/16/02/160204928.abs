Title: More on analytic bootstrap for O(N) models
Authors: Parijat Dey and Apratim Kaviraj and Kallol Sen
Abstract: This note is an extension of a recent work on the analytical bootstrapping of $O(N)$ models. An additonal feature of the $O(N)$ model is that the OPE contains trace and antisymmetric operators apart from the symmetric-traceless objects appearing in the OPE of the singlet sector. This in addition to the stress tensor $(T_{\mu\nu})$ and the $\phi_i\phi^i$ scalar, we also have other minimal twist operators as the spin-1 current $J_\mu$ and the symmetric-traceless scalar in the case of $O(N)$. We determine the effect of these additional objects on the anomalous dimensions of the corresponding trace, symmetric-traceless and antisymmetric operators in the large spin sector of the $O(N)$ model, in the limit when the spin is much larger than the twist. As an observation, we also verified that the leading order results for the large spin sector from the $\epsilon-$expansion are an exact match with our $n=0$ case. A plausible holographic setup for the special case when $N=2$ is also mentioned which mimics the calculation in the CFT.
