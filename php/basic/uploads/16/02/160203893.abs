Title: Hairy Black Holes in AdS$_5\times S^5$
Authors: Julija Markeviciute and Jorge E. Santos
Abstract: We use numerical methods to exhaustively study a novel family of hairy black hole solutions in AdS$_5$. These solutions can be uplifted to solutions of type IIB supergravity with AdS$_5\times S^5$ asymptotics and are thus expected to play an important role in our understanding of AdS/CFT. We find an intricate phase diagram, with the aforementioned family of hairy black hole solutions branching from the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole at the onset of the superradiance instability. We analyse black holes with spherical and planar horizon topology and explain how they connect in the phase diagram. Finally, we detail their global and local thermodynamic stability across several ensembles.
