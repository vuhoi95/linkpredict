Title: Extending the scope of holographic mutual information and chaotic  behavior
Authors: Nilanjan Sircar and Jacob Sonnenschein and Walter Tangarife
Abstract: We extend the use of holography to investigate the scrambling properties of various physical systems. Specifically, we consider: (i) non-conformal backgrounds of black $Dp$ branes, (ii) asymptotically Lifshitz black holes, and (iii) black $AdS$ solutions of Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We use the disruption of the entanglement entropy as a probe of the chaotic features of such systems. Our analysis shows that these theories share the same type of behavior as conformal theories as they undergo chaos; however, in the case of Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we find a stark difference in the evolution of the mutual information for negative Gauss-Bonnet coupling. This may signal an inconsistency of the latter.
