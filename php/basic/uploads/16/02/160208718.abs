Abstract: The purpose of this report is to provide a framework for defining phase transition processes in two dimensional holographic superconductors, and to illustrate how they are useful to be described by holographic entanglement entropy. We study holographic entanglement entropy in a two dimensional fully backrected model for holographic superconductors. We prove that phase transition could be observe using a discontinuty in the first order of entropy.
