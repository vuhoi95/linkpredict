Title: Comments on fusion matrix in N=1 super Liouville field theory
Authors: Hasmik Poghosyan and Gor Sarkissian
Abstract: We study several aspects of the $N=1$ super Liouville theory. We show that certain elements of the fusion matrix in the Neveu-Schwarz sector related to the structure constants according to the same rules which we observe in rational conformal field theory. We collect some evidences that these relations should hold also in the Ramond sector. Using them the Cardy-Lewellen equation for defects is studied, and defects are constructed.
