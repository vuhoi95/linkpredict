Title: Iterating free-field AdS/CFT: higher spin partition function relations
Authors: M. Beccaria and A. A. Tseytlin
Abstract: We find a simple relation between a free higher spin field partition function on thermal quotient of AdS(d+1) and the partition function of the associated d-dimensional conformal higher spin field on thermal quotient of AdS(d). Starting with a conformal higher spin field defined on AdS(d) one may also associate to it another conformal field in d-1 dimensions, thus "iterating" AdS/CFT. We observe that in the case of d=4 this iteration leads to a "trivial" 3d higher spin conformal theory with parity-even non-local action: it describes zero total number of dynamical degrees of freedom and the corresponding partition function on thermal AdS(3) is equal to 1.
