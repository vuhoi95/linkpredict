Title: Pair creation in the early universe
Authors: Cl√©ment Stahl and Eckhard Strobel and She-Sheng Xue
Abstract: In the very early universe, a generalized Schwinger effect can create pairs from both electrical and gravitational fields. The expectation value of fermionic current induced by these newly created pairs has been recently computed in de Sitter spacetime. I will discuss different limiting cases of this result and some of its possible physical interpretations.
