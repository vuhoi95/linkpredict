Abstract: We consider a charged scalar field in a $D$ dimensional de Sitter spacetime and investigate pair creation by Schwinger mechanism in a constant electric field background. Using a semiclassical approximation the current of the created pairs has been estimated. We find that, the semiclassical current of ultra-relativistic created pairs responses as $E^{\frac{D}{2}}$. In particular, in $D=3$ dimensional de Sitter spacetime, the quantum expectation value of the spacelike component of the induced current has been computed in the in-vacuum state by applying an adiabatic subtraction scheme. We find that, in the strong electric field limit, the current responses as $E^{\frac{3}{2}}$. In the weak electric field limit the current has a linear response in $E$ and an inverse dependence on the mass of the scalar field. In the case of a massless scalar field, the current varies with $E^{-1}$, which leads to a phenomenon of infrared hyperconductivity. A new relation between infrared hyperconductivity, tachyons and conformality is discussed and a scheme to avoid an infrared hyperconductivity regime is proposed.
