Title: Topological Excitations in Magnetic Materials
Authors: D. Bazeia and M. M. Doria and E. I. B. Rodrigues
Abstract: In this work we propose a new route to describe topological excitations in magnetic systems through a single real scalar field. We show here that spherically symmetric structures in two spatial dimensions, which map helical excitations in magnetic materials, admit this formulation and can be used to model skyrmion-like structures in magnetic materials.
