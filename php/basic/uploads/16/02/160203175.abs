Title: Fermionization in an Arbitrary Number of Dimensions
Authors: N. S. Mankoc Borstnik and H. B. F. Nielsen
Abstract: One purpose of this proceedings-contribution is to show that at least for free massless particles it is possible to construct an explicit boson theory which is exactly equivalent in terms of momenta and energy to a fermion theory. The fermions come as $2^{d/2-1}$ families and the to this whole system of fermions corresponding bosons come as a whole series of the Kalb-Ramond fields, one set of components for each number of indexes on the tensor fields. Since Kalb-Ramond fields naturally (only) couple to the extended objects or branes, we suspect that inclusion of interaction into such for a bosonization prepared system - except for the lowest dimensions - without including branes or something like that is not likely to be possible. The need for the families is easily seen just by using the theorem long ago put forward by Aratyn and one of us (H.B.F.N.), which says that to have the statistical mechanics of the fermion system and the boson system to match one needs to have the number of the field components in the ratio $\frac{2^{d-1}-1}{2^{d-1}}= \frac{\# bosons}{\# fermions}$, enforcing that the number of fermion components must be a multiple of $2^{d-1}$, where $d$ is the space-time dimension. This "explanation" of the number of dimension is potentially useful for the explanation for the number of dimension put forward by one of us (S.N.M.B.) since long in the spin-charge-family theory, and leads like the latter to typically (a multiple of) $4$ families. And this is the second purpose for our work on the fermionization in an arbitrary number of dimensions - namely to learn how "natural" is the inclusion of the families in the way the spin-charge-family theory does.
