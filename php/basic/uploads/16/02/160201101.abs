Title: Three-point Functions in Duality-Invariant Higher-Derivative Gravity
Authors: Usman Naseer and Barton Zwiebach
Abstract: Doubled $\alpha'$-geometry is the simplest higher-derivative gravitational theory with exact global duality symmetry. We use the double metric formulation of this theory to compute on-shell three-point functions to all orders in $\alpha'$. A simple pattern emerges when comparing with the analogous bosonic and heterotic three-point functions. As in these theories, the amplitudes factorize. The theory has no Gauss-Bonnet term, but contains a Riemann-cubed interaction to second order in $\alpha'$.
