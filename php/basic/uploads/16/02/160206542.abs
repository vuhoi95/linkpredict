Abstract: In this letter we investigate measures of chaos and entanglement in rational conformal field theories in 1+1 dimensions. First, we derive a formula for the late time value of the out-of-time-order corre- lators for these class of theories. Our universal result can be expressed as a particular combination of the modular S-matrix elements known as anyon monodromy scalar. Next, in the explicit setup of a $SU(N)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model, we compare the late time behaviour of the out-of-time-ordered correlators and the purity. Interestingly, in the large-c limit, the purity grows logarithmically as in holographic theories, in contrast the out-of-time-order correlators remain, in general, non-vanishing.
