Title: Universal transport and resonant current from chiral magnetic effect
Authors: Hiroyuki Fujita and Masaki Oshikawa
Abstract: For relativistic Weyl fermions in 3+1 dimensions, an electric current proportional to the external magnetic field is predicted. This remarkable phenomenon is called Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME). Here we show that actual transports in Weyl semimetals supporting CME cannot be discussed without proper consideration of the law of electromagnetism. First, even in the absence of an external magnetic field, CME leads to a material-independent, universal effective capacitance. Moreover, the induced current by a time-dependent external magnetic field can be resonantly enhanced reflecting a formation of electromagnetic standing waves.
