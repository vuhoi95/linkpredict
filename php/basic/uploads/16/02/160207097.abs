Title: The Most General $4\mathcal{D}$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ Superconformal Blocks  for Scalar Operators
Authors: Zhijin Li and Ning Su
Abstract: We compute the most general superconformal blocks for scalar operators in $4\mathcal{D}$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories. Specifically we employ the supershadow formalism to study the four-point correlator $\langle\Phi_1 \Phi_2 \Phi_3 \Phi_4\rangle$, in which the four scalars $\Phi_i$ have arbitrary scaling dimensions and R-charges with the only constraint from R-symmetry invariance of the four-point function. The exchanged operators can have arbitrary R-charges. Our results extend previous studies on $4\mathcal{D}$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconmformal blocks to the most general case, which are the essential ingredient for superconformal bootstrap, especially for bootstrapping mixed correlators of scalars with independent scaling dimensions and R-charges.
