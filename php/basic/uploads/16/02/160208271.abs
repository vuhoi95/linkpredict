Title: Bouncing cosmologies from quantum gravity condensates
Authors: Daniele Oriti and Lorenzo Sindoni and Edward Wilson-Ewing
Abstract: We show how the large-scale cosmological dynamics can be obtained from the hydrodynamics of isotropic group field theory condensate states in the Gross-Pitaevskii approximation. The correct Friedmann equations are recovered in the semi-classical limit for some choices of the parameters in the action for the group field theory, and quantum gravity corrections arise in the high-curvature regime causing a bounce which generically resolves the big-bang and big-crunch singularities.
