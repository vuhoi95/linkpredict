Abstract: Thermodynamic geometry analysis of interesting Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 111302 (2015)] for charged AdS black holes, which is based on studying the Ruppeiner invariant behavior is not correct and the authors made a mistake in calculating this quantity. In the present Letter, we address the correct Ruppeiner scalar curvature and reveal the correct possible microscopic properties of 4-dimensional charged AdS black holes arise from it. Some of these properties have not been discussed in pointed out Letter.
