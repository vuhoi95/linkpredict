Authors: M. V. Ioffe and E. V. Kolevatova and D. N. Nishnianidze
Abstract: Two-dimensional Scarf~II quantum model is considered in the framework of Supersymmetrical Quantum Mechanics (SUSY QM). Previously obtained results for this integrable system are systematized, and some new properties are derived. In particular, it is shown that the model is exactly or quasi-exactly solvable in different regions of parameter of the system. The degeneracy of the spectrum is detected for some specific values of parameters. The action of the symmetry operators of fourth order in momenta is calculated for the arbitrary wave functions, obtained by means of double shape invariance.
