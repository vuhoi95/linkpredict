Title: Flag-dipole and flagpole spinors fluid flows in Kerr spacetimes
Authors: Roldao da Rocha and R. T. Cavalcanti
Abstract: Flagpole and flag-dipole spinors are particular classes of spinor fields that has been recently used in different branches of theoretical physics. In this paper, we study the possibility and consequences of these spinor fields to induce an underlying fluid flow structure in the background of Kerr spacetimes. We show that flag-dipole spinor fields are solutions of the equations of motion in this context. To our knowledge, this is the second time that this class of spinor field appears as a physical solution, the first one occurring as a solution of the Dirac equation in ESK gravities.
