Title: Classifying the behavior of noncanonical quintessence
Authors: Dan Li and Robert J. Scherrer
Abstract: We derive general conditions for the existence of stable scaling solutions for the evolution of noncanonical quintessence, with a Lagrangian of the form $\mathcal{L}(X,\phi)=X^{\alpha}-V(\phi)$, for power-law and exponential potentials when the expansion is dominated by a background barotropic fluid. Our results suggest that in most cases, noncanonical quintessence with such potentials does not yield interesting models for the observed dark energy. When the scaling solution is not an attractor, there is a wide range of model parameters for which the evolution asymptotically resembles a zero-potential solution with equation of state parameter $w = 1/(2\alpha -1)$, and oscillatory solutions are also possible for positive power-law potentials; we derive the conditions on the model parameters which produce both types of behavior. We investigate thawing noncanonical models with a nearly-flat potential and derive approximate expressions for the evolution of $w(a)$. These forms for $w(a)$ differ in a characteristic way from the corresponding expressions for canonical quintessence.
