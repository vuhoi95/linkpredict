Title: Super Yang-Mills and theta-exact Seiberg-Witten map: Absence of  quadratic noncommutative IR divergences
Authors: Carmelo P. Martin and Josip Trampetic and Jiangyang You
Abstract: We compute the one-loop 1PI contributions to all the propagators of the noncommutative N=1, 2, 4 super Yang-Mills (SYM) U(1) theories defined by the means of the theta-exact Seiberg-Witten (SW) map in the Wess-Zumino gauge. Then we extract the UV divergent contributions and the noncommutative IR divergences. We show that all the quadratic noncommutative IR divergences add up to zero in each propagator.
