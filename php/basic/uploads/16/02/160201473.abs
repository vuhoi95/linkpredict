Title: Chaos in Matrix Models and Black Hole Evaporation
Authors: Evan Berkowitz and Masanori Hanada and Jonathan Maltz
Abstract: Is the evaporation of a black hole described by a unitary theory? In order to shed light on this question ---especially aspects of this question such as a black hole's negative specific heat---we consider the real-time dynamics of a solitonic object in matrix quantum mechanics, which can be interpreted as a black hole (black zero-brane) via holography. We point out that the chaotic nature of the system combined with the flat directions of its potential naturally leads to the emission of D0-branes from the black brane, which is suppressed in the large $N$ limit. Simple arguments show that the black zero-brane, like the Schwarzschild black hole, has negative specific heat, in the sense that the temperature goes up when it evaporates by emitting D0-branes. While the largest Lyapunov exponent grows during the evaporation, the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy decreases. These are consequences of the generic properties of matrix models and gauge theory. Based on these results, we give a possible geometric interpretation of the eigenvalue distribution of matrices in terms of gravity. Applying the same argument in the M-theory parameter region, we provide a scenario to derive the Hawking radiation of massless particles from the Schwarzschild black hole. Finally, we suggest that by adding a fraction of the quantum effects to the classical theory, we can obtain a matrix model whose classical time evolution mimics the entire life of the black brane, from its formation to the evaporation.
