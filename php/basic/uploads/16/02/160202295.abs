Title: On Unification of Gravity and Gauge Interactions
Authors: Ali H. Chamseddine and Viatcheslav Mukhanov
Abstract: Considering a higher dimensional Lorentz group as the tangent symmetry, we unify gravity and gauge interactions in a natural way. The spin connection of the gauged Lorentz group is then responsible for both gravity and gauge fields, and the action for the gauged fields becomes part of the spin curvature squared. The realistic group which unifies all known particles and interactions is the $SO(1,13)$ Lorentz group whose gauge part leads to $SO(10)$ grand unified theory and contains double the number of required fermions in the fundamental spinor representation. Mirror fermions could acquire mass utilizing a mechanism employed for topological superconductors. Family unification could be achieved by considering the $SO(1,21)$ Lorentz group.
