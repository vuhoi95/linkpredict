Title: Equivariant A-twisted GLSM and Gromov--Witten invariants of CY 3-folds  in Grassmannians
Authors: Kazushi Ueda and Yutaka Yoshida
Abstract: We compute genus-zero Gromov--Witten invariants of Calabi--Yau complete intersection 3-folds in Grassmannians using supersymmetric localization in A-twisted non-Abelian gauged linear sigma models. We also discuss a Seiberg-like duality interchanging Gr(n,m) and Gr(m-n,m).
