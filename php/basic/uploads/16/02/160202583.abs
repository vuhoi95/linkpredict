Title: Open Superstring Field Theory on the Restricted Hilbert Space
Authors: Sebastian Konopka and Ivo Sachs
Abstract: Recently an action for open superstring field theory was proposed where the Neveu-Schwarz sector is formulated in the large Hilbert space while the Ramond sector lives in a restriction of the small Hilbert space. The purpose of this note is to clarify the relation of the restricted Hilbert space with other approaches and to formulate open superstring field theory entirely in the small Hilbert space.
