Title: Coupling between Majorana fermions and Nambu-Goldstone bosons inside a  non-Abelian vortex in dense QCD
Authors: Chandrasekhar Chatterjee and Mattia Cipriani and Muneto Nitta
Abstract: Quark matter at high density may exhibit color superconductivity. As magnetic flux tubes in metallic superconductors, color magnetic flux tubes as non-Abelian vortices appear in the color-flavor locked phase of high density QCD. ${\mathbb C}P^2$ Nambu-Goldstone bosons and Majorana fermions belonging to the triplet representation are known to be localized around a non-Abelian vortex. In this paper, we determine the coupling of these bosonic and fermionic modes by using the nonlinear realization method.
