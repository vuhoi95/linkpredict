Title: Three-body force for baryons from the D0-D4/D8 matrix model
Authors: Si-wen Li and Tuo Jia
Abstract: This is an extensive work to our previous paper \cite{key-08} studied on the D0-D4/D8 holographic system. We compute the three-body force for baryons with the D0-D4/D8 matrix model derived in \cite{key-08} with considering the non-zero QCD vacuum. We obtain the three-body force at short distances but modified by the appearance of the smeared D0-branes i.e. considering the effects from the non-trivial QCD vacuum. We firstly test our matrix model in the case of 't Hooft instanton and then in two more realistic case: (1) three-neutrons with averaged spins and (2) proton-proton-neutron (or proton-neutron-proton). The three-body potential vanishes in the former case while in two latter cases it is positive i.e. repulsive and makes sense only if the constraint for stable baryonic state is satisfied. We require all the baryons in our computation aligned on a line. These may indicate that the cases in dense states of neutrons such as in neutron stars, Helium-3 or Tritium nucleus all with the non-trivial QCD vacuum.
