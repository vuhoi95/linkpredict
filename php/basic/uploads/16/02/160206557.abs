Title: Invisible QCD as Dark Energy
Authors: Stephon Alexander and Antonino Marcian√≤ and Zhi Yang
Abstract: We account for the late time acceleration of the Universe by extending the QCD color to a $SU(3)$ invisible sector (IQCD). If the Invisible Chiral symmetry is broken in the early universe, a condensate of dark pions (dpions) and dark gluons (dgluons) forms. The condensate naturally forms due to strong dynamics similar to the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio mechanism. As the Universe evolves from early times to present times the interaction energy between the dgluon and dpion condensate dominates with a negative pressure equation of state and causes late time acceleration. We conclude with a stability analysis of the coupled perturbations of the dark pions and dark gluons.
