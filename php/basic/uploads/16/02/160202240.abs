Title: Exactly solvable dynamical models with a minimal length uncertainty
Authors: Reginald Christian Bernardo and Jose Perico Esguerra
Abstract: We present exact analytical solutions to the classical equations of motion and analyze the dynamical consequences of the existence of a minimal length for the free particle, particle in a linear potential, anti-symmetric constant force oscillator, harmonic oscillator, vertical harmonic oscillator, linear diatomic chain, and linear triatomic chain. It turns out that a minimal length increases the speed of a free particle and the rate of fall of a particle that is subject to the influence of a linear potential. Our results suggest that the characteristic frequency of systems tend to increase when there is a minimal length. This is a common feature that we observed for the oscillator systems that we have considered.
