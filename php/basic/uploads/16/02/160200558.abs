Title: Geometric dark energy traversable wormholes constrained by astrophysical  observations
Authors: Deng Wang and Xin-He Meng
Abstract: In this letter, we introduce the astrophysical observations into the wormhole research, which is not meant to general parameters constraints for the dark energy models, in order to understand more about in which stage of the universe evolutions wormholes may exist through the investigation of the evolution behavior of the cosmic equation of state parameter. As a concrete instance, we investigate the Ricci dark energy (RDE) traversable wormholes constrained by astrophysical data-sets. Particularly, we can discover from Fig. \ref{fig5} of the present work, when the effective equation of state parameter $\omega_X<-1$, namely, the Null Energy conditions (NEC) is violated clearly, the wormholes will appear (open). Subsequently, six specific solutions of static and spherically symmetric traversable wormhole supported by the RDE are obtained. Except for the case of constant redshift function, in which the solution is not only asymptotically flat but also traversable, the remaining five solutions are all not asymptotically flat, therefore, the exotic matter from the RDE fluids is spatially distributed in the vicinity of the throat. Furthermore, we analyze the physical characteristics and properties of the RDE traversable wormholes. It is worth noting that, through the astrophysical observations, we get constraints on the parameters of RDE model, explore the type of exotic RDE fluids in different stages of the universe changing, limit the number of available models for wormhole research, reduce the number of the wormholes corresponding to different parameters for RDE model and provide a more apparent picture for wormhole investigations from the new perspective of observational cosmology background
