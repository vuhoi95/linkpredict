Title: Back reaction effects on the dynamics of heavy probes in heavy quark  cloud
Authors: Shankhadeep Chakrabortty and Tanay K. Dey
Abstract: We holographically study the effect of back reaction on the hydrodynamical properties of $\mathcal{N} = 4$ strongly coupled super Yang-Mills (SYM) thermal plasma. The back reaction we consider arises from the presence of static heavy quarks uniformly distributed over $\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM plasma. In order to study the hydrodynamical properties, we use heavy quark as well as heavy quark-antiquark bound state as probes and compute the jet quenching parameter, screening length and binding energy. We also consider the rotational dynamics of heavy probe quark in the back-reacted plasma and analyse associated energy loss. We observe that the presence of back reaction enhances the energy-loss in the thermal plasma. Finally, we show that there is no effect of angular drag on the rotational motion of quark-antiquark bound state probing the back reacted thermal plasma.
