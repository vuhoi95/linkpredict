Title: VEV of Baxter's Q-operator in N=2 gauge theory and the BPZ differential  equation
Authors: Gabriel Poghosyan and Rubik Poghossian
Abstract: In this short notes using AGT correspondence we express simplest fully degenerate primary fields of Toda field theory in terms an analogue of Baxter's $Q$-operator naturally emerging in ${\cal N}=2$ gauge theory side. This quantity can be considered as a generating function of simple trace chiral operators constructed from the scalars of the ${\cal N}=2$ vector multiplets. In the special case of Liouville theory, exploring the second order differential equation satisfied by conformal blocks including a degenerate at the second level primary field (BPZ equation) we derive a mixed difference-differential relation for $Q$-operator. Thus we generalize the $T$-$Q$ difference equation known in Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit of the $\Omega$-background to the generic case.
