Title: Inflation and the Measurement Problem
Authors: Stephon Alexander and Dhrubo Jyoti and Joao Magueijo
Abstract: We propose a solution to the quantum measurement problem in Inflation. Our model treats Fourier modes of cosmological perturbations as analogous to particles in a weakly-interacting Bose gas. We generalize the idea of a macroscopic wavefunction to cosmological fields, and construct a self-interaction Hamiltonian that focuses that wavefunction. By appropriately setting the coupling between modes, we obtain the standard adiabatic, scale-invariant power spectrum. Because of Central Limit Theorem (CLT), we recover a Gaussian Random Field, consistent with observations.
