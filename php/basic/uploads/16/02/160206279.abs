Title: Pauli equation on noncommutative plane and the Seiberg-Witten map
Authors: Aslam Halder and Sunandan Gangopadhyay
Abstract: We study the Pauli equation in noncommutative two dimensional plane which exhibits the supersymmetry algebra when the gyro-magnetic ratio is $2$. The significance of the Seiberg-Witten map in this context is discussed and its effect in the problem is incorporated to all orders in $\theta$. We map the noncommutative problem to an equivalent commutative problem by using a set of generalised Bopp-shift transformations containing a scaling parameter. The energy spectrum of the noncommutative Pauli Hamiltonian is obtained and found to be $\theta$ corrected which is valid to all orders in $\theta$.
