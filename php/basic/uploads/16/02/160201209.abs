Title: q-Vertex Operator from 5D Nekrasov Function
Authors: Hiroshi Itoyama and Takeshi Oota and Reiji Yoshioka
Abstract: The five dimensional AGT correspondence implies the connection between the q-deformed Virasoro block and the 5d Nekrasov partition function. In this paper, we determine a q-deformation of the four-point block in the Coulomb gas representation from the 5d Nekrasov function, and obtain an expression of the q-deformed vertex operator. If we use only one kind of the q-vertex operators, one of the insertion points of them must be modified in order to hold the 2d/5d correspondence.
