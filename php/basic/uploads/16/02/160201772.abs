Title: Dark Energy and Dark Matter from Yang-Mills Condensate and the  Peccei-Quinn mechanism
Authors: Andrea Addazi and Pietro Donà and Antonino Marcianò
Abstract: We analyze a model of cold axion Dark Matter weakly coupled with a dark gluon condensate, reproducing Dark Energy. We first review how to recover the Dark Energy behavior using the functional renormalization group approach, and ground our study on the properties of the effective Lagrangian, to be determined non-perturbatively. Then, within the context of $G_{SM}\times SU(2)_{D}\times U(1)_{PQ}$, we consider YMC interactions with QCD axions. We predict a transfer of Dark Energy density into Dark Matter density in a cosmological time that can be tested in the next generation of experiments dedicated to Dark Energy measures.
