Title: Electric Conductivity of a hot hadron gas from a kinetic approach
Authors: Moritz Greif and Carsten Greiner and Gabriel S. Denicol
Abstract: We calculate the electric conductivity of a gas of relativistic particles with isotropic cross sections using the Boltzmann equation as the starting point. Our analyses is restricted to elastic collisions. We show the perfect agreement with previously published numerical results for a massless quark- gluon plasma, and give results for the electric conductivity of an interacting hadron gas, employing realistic resonance cross sections. These results for the electric conductivity of a hot hadron gas, as created in (ultra-)relativistic heavy-ion collisions, are of rich phenomenological as well as theoretical interest and can be compared to, e.g., lattice quantum field theory calculations.
