Title: Complete Action for Open Superstring Field Theory with Cyclic $A_\infty$  Structure
Authors: Theodore Erler and Yuji Okawa and Tomoyuki Takezaki
Abstract: We construct a gauge invariant action for the Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond sectors of open superstring field theory realizing a cyclic $A_\infty$ structure, providing the first complete and fully explicit solution to the classical Batalin-Vilkovisky master equation in superstring field theory. We also demonstrate the equivalence of our action to the Wess-Zumino-Witten-based construction of Kunitomo and one of the authors.
