Title: Entanglement negativity, Holography and Black holes
Authors: Pankaj Chaturvedi and Vinay Malvimat and Gautam Sengupta
Abstract: Our recent conjecture for the holographic entanglement negativity is applied to the case of $d$-dimensional conformal field theories at finite temperatures dual to bulk $AdS_{d+1}$-Schwarzschild black holes in a generic $AdS_{d+1}/CFT_d$ scenario. It is observed that the holographic entanglement negativity is related to the holographic mutual information and precisely captures the distillable quantum entanglement for the $d$-dimensional conformal field theories at finite temperatures. This non trivial example provides extremely strong evidence in favour of the universality of our proposed holographic conjecture.
