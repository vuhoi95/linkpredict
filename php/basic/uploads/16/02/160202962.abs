Title: Holographic Conformal Partial Waves as Gravitational Open Wilson  Networks
Authors: Atanu Bhatta and Prashanth Raman and Nemani V. Suryanarayana
Abstract: We propose a method to holographically compute the conformal partial waves in any decomposition of correlation functions of primary operators in conformal field theories using open Wilson network operators in the holographic gravitational dual. The Wilson operators are the gravitational ones where gravity is written as a gauge theory in the first order Hilbert-Palatini formalism. We apply this method to compute the global conformal blocks and partial waves in 2d CFTs reproducing many of the known results.
