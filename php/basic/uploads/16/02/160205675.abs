Title: Rotating Restricted Schur Polynomials
Authors: Nicholas Bornman and Robert de Mello Koch and Laila Tribelhorn
Abstract: Large $N$ but non-planar limits of ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory can be described using restricted Schur polynomials. Previous investigations demonstrate that the action of the one loop dilatation operator on restricted Schur operators, with classical dimension of order $N$ and belonging to the $su(2)$ sector, is largely determined by the $su(2)$ ${\cal R}$ symmetry algebra as well as structural features of perturbative field theory. Studies presented so far have used the form of ${\cal R}$ symmetry generators when acting on small perturbations of half-BPS operators. In this article, as a first step towards going beyond small perturbations of the half-BPS operators, we explain how the exact action of symmetry generators on restricted Schur polynomials can be determined.
