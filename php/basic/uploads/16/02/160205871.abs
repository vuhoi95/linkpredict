Title: The local vicinity of spins sum for certain mass dimension one spinors
Authors: R. J. Bueno Rog√©rio and J. M. Hoff da Silva
Abstract: It is well known that the usual formulation of Elko spinor fields leads to a subtle Lorentz symmetry break encoded in the spin sums. Recently it was proposed a redefinition in the dual structure, along with a given mathematical device, which eliminate the Lorentz breaking term in the spin sums. In this work we delve into the analysis of this mathematical device providing a solid framework to the used method.
