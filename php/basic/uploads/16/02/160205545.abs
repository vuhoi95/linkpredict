Title: A Small Deformation of a Simple Theory
Authors: Matthew Buican and Takahiro Nishinaka
Abstract: We study an interesting relevant deformation of the simplest interacting N=2 SCFT---the original Argyres-Douglas (AD) theory. We argue that, although this deformation is not strictly speaking Banks-Zaks like (certain operator dimensions change macroscopically), there are senses in which it constitutes a mild deformation of the parent AD theory: the exact change in the "a" anomaly is small and is essentially saturated at one loop. Moreover, contributions from IR operators that have a simple description in the UV theory reproduce a particular limit of the IR index to a remarkably high order. These results lead us to conclude that the IR theory is an interacting N=1 SCFT with particularly small "a" and "c" central charges and that this theory sheds some interesting light on the spectrum of its AD parent.
