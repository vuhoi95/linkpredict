Abstract: In this paper, we perform a parallel analysis to the model proposed in [25]. By considering the central co-tetrad (instead of the central metric), we investigate the modifications in the gravitational metrics coming from the noncommutative spacetime of the $\kappa$-Minkowski type in four dimensions. The differential calculus corresponding to a class of Jordanian $\kappa$-deformations provides metrics, which lead either to cosmological constant or spatial curvature type solutions of non-vacuum Einstein equations. Among vacuum solutions, we find pp-wave type.
