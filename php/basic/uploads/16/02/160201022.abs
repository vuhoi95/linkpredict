Title: Cosets of Meromorphic CFTs and Modular Differential Equations
Authors: Matthias R. Gaberdiel and Harsha R. Hampapura and Sunil Mukhi
Abstract: Some relations between families of two-character CFTs are explained using a slightly generalised coset construction, and the underlying theories (whose existence was only conjectured based on the modular differential equation) are constructed. The same method also gives rise to interesting new examples of CFTs with three and four characters.
