Title: Singularity-free interaction in dilaton-Maxwell electrodynamics
Authors: Oleg Kechkin and Pavel Mosharev
Abstract: An effective potential is created for the dynamics of a test particle, which preserves dilatation symmetry for nonlinear static dilaton-Maxwell background. It is found that the central interaction in this theory is regular everywhere, and that the theory is asymptotically free at short distances and that it has a Coulomb properties at great distances from the source. It is shown that static and spherically symmetric source, behaves like a soliton: it has the finite energy characteristics that are inversely proportional to the dilaton-Maxwell coupling constant.
