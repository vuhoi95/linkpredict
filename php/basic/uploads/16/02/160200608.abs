Title: Quantum theory of the Generalised Uncertainty Principle and the  existence of a Minimal Length
Authors: Jean-Philippe Bruneton and Julien Larena
Abstract: We extend significantly previous works on the Hilbert space representations of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) in 3+1 dimensions of the form $[X_i,P_j] = i F_{ij}$ where $ F_{ij} = f(P^2) \delta_{ij} + g(P^2) P_i P_j $ for any functions $f$. However, we restrict our study to the case of commuting $X$'s. We focus in particular on the symmetries of the theory, and the minimal length that emerge in some cases. We first show that, at the algebraic level, there exists an unambiguous mapping between the GUP with a deformed quantum algebra and a quadratic Hamiltonian into a standard, Heisenberg algebra of operators and an aquadratic Hamiltonian, provided the boost sector of the symmetries is modified accordingly. The theory can also be mapped to a completely standard Quantum Mechanics with standard symmetries, but with momentum dependent position operators. Next, we investigate the Hilbert space representations of these algebraically equivalent models, and focus, specifically on whether they exhibit a minimal length. We carry the functional analysis of the various operators involved, and show that the appearance of a minimal length critically depends on the relationship between the generators of translations and the physical momenta. In particular, because this relationship is preserved by the algebraic mapping presented in this paper, when a minimal length is present in the standard GUP, it is also present in the corresponding Aquadratic Hamiltonian formulation, despite the perfectly standard algebra of this model. In general, a minimal length requires bounded generators of translations, i.e. a specific kind of quantization of space, and this depends on the precise shape of the function $f$ defined previously. This result provides an elegant and unambiguous classification of which universal quantum gravity corrections lead to the emergence of a minimal length.
