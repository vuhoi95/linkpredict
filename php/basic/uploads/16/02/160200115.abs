Title: Counting master integrals: Integration by parts vs. functional equations
Authors: Bernd A. Kniehl and Oleg V. Tarasov
Abstract: We illustrate the usefulness of functional equations in establishing relationships between master integrals under the integration-by-parts reduction procedure by considering a certain two-loop propagator-type diagram as an example.
