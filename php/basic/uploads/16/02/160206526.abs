Abstract: The possible gamma ray burst occurred in location and temporal consistence with gravitational wave event GW150914, as reported by FERMI GBM, offers a new way of constraining models with extra dimensions. Using the time delay in arrival of the gamma ray transient observed by FERMI GBM relative to the gravitational waves event triggered the LIGO detectors we investigate the size of the spherical brane-universe expanding in multi-dimensional space-time. It is shown that a joint observation of gravitational waves in association with gamma ray burst can provide a very stringent bound on the spatial curvature of the brain.
