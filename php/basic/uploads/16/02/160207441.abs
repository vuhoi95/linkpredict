Title: The evolution of gauge couplings and the Weinberg angle in 5 dimensions  for an SU(3) gauge group
Authors: Mohammed Omer Khojali and A. S. Cornell and Aldo Deandrea
Abstract: We test in a simplified 5-dimensional model with SU(3) gauge symmetry, the evolution equations of the gauge couplings of a model containing bulk fields, gauge fields and one pair of fermions. In this model we assume that the fermion doublet and two singlet fields are located at fixed points of the extra-dimension compactified on an $S^{1}/Z_{2}$ orbifold. The gauge coupling evolution is derived at one-loop in 5-dimensions, for the gauge group $G = SU(3)$, and used to test the impact on lower energy observables, in particular the Weinberg angle. The gauge bosons and the Higgs field arise from the gauge bosons in 5 dimensions, as in a gauge-Higgs model. The model is used as a testing ground as it is not a complete and realistic model for the electroweak interactions.
