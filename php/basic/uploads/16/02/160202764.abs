Abstract: We refine our previous proposal for systematically classifying 4d rank-1 $\mathcal N=2$ SCFTs by constructing their possible Coulomb branch geometries. Four new recently discussed rank-1 theories, including novel $\mathcal{N}=3$ SCFTs, sit beautifully in our refined classification framework. By arguing for the consistency of their RG flows we can make a strong case for the existence of at least four additional rank-1 SCFTs, nearly doubling the number of known rank-1 SCFTs. The refinement consists of relaxing the assumption that the flavor symmetries of the SCFTs have no discrete factors. This results in an enlarged (but finite) set of possible rank-1 SCFTs. Their existence can be further constrained using consistency of their central charges and RG flows.
