Title: Supersymmetric geometries of IIA supergravity III
Authors: Ulf Gran and George Papadopoulos and Christian von Schultz
Abstract: We find that (massive) IIA backgrounds that admit a $G_2\ltimes \mathbb{R}^8$ invariant Killing spinor must exhibit a null Killing vector field which leaves the Killing spinor invariant and that the rotation of the Killing vector field satisfies a certain $\mathfrak{g}_2$ instanton condition. This result together with those in [4] and [5] complete the classification of geometries of all (massive) IIA backgrounds that preserve one supersymmetry. We also explore the geometry of a class of backgrounds which admit a $G_2\ltimes \mathbb{R}^8$ invariant Killing spinor and where in addition an appropriate 1-form bilinear vanishes. In all cases, we express the fluxes of the theory in terms of the geometry.
