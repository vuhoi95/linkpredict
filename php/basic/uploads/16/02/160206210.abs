Title: Birth and growth of nonlinear massive gravity and its transition to  nonlinear electrodynamics in a system of Mp-branes
Authors: Alireza Sepehri and Ahmed Farag Ali
Abstract: Recently, an interesting mechanism [Phys.Rev.Lett.106:231101,2011] has been proposed which produces all nonlinear terms in massive gravity to all orders . In this work, we reproduce these results in M-theory and consider the process of birth and growth of nonlinear gravity during the construction of Mp-branes. It has been shown that Mp brane are built up of p- M1-branes which each of them are connected to M1-branes of other Mp-brane through a wormhole. In this model, by increasing the number of dimensions, the number of nonlinear terms in relevant action of branes enhances and some theories like lovelock and nonlinear gravity are raised. By compacting M-branes, graviton fields in nonlinear gravity converts to photon fields and thus nonlinear electrodynamics are produced.
