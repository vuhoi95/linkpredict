Title: The Resolution of an Entropy Puzzle for 4D non-BPS Black Holes
Authors: Nabamita Banerjee and Sukruti Bansal and Ivano Lodato
Abstract: We show the equality between macroscopic and microscopic black hole entropy for a class of four dimensional non-supersymmetric black holes in ${\cal N}=2$ supergravity theory, up to the first subleading order in their charges. This solves a long standing entropy puzzle for this class of black holes. The macroscopic entropy has been computed in the presence of a newly derived higher-derivative supersymmetric invariant of \cite{{Butter:2013lta}}, connected to the five dimensional supersymmetric Weyl squared Lagrangian. Microscopically, the crucial role in obtaining the equivalence is played by the anomalous gauge gravitational Chern-Simons term.
