Title: Symanzik-Becchi-Rouet-Stora lessons on renormalizable models with broken  symmetry: the case of Lorentz violation
Authors: Oswaldo M. Del Cima and Daniel H. T. Franco and Olivier Piguet
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the issue intensively studied in recent years on the generation of terms by radiative corrections in models with broken Lorentz symmetry. The algebraic perturbative method of handling the problem of renormalization of the theories with Lorentz symmetry breaking, is used. We hope to make clear the Symanzik's aphorism: "{\it Whether you like it or not, you have to include in the lagrangian all counter terms consistent with locality and power-counting, unless otherwise constrained by Ward identities.}"
