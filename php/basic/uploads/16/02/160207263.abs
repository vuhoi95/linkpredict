Title: Supersymmetric solutions of $N=(2,0)$ Topologically Massive Supergravity
Authors: Nihat Sadik Deger and George Moutsopoulos
Abstract: We first make a Killing spinor analysis for a general three-dimensional off-shell $N=(2,0)$ supergravity and find conditions for a bosonic background to preserve some supersymmetry . We then consider a particular model, namely $N=(2,0)$ topologically massive supergravity and impose its field equations. By making a suitable ansatz on metric functions we find a large class of solutions that include spacelike, timelike and null warped $AdS_3$ among others. Isometric quotients of spacelike and timelike squashed $AdS_3$ solutions yield extremal black holes without closed causal curves.
