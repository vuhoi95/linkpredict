Title: Information content of interacting fields in an expanding spacetime
Authors: Helder Alexander and Gustavo de Souza and I. G. da Paz and Marcos Sampaio
Abstract: We study the interplay between particle creation, quantum mutual information and bipartite entanglement for two massive interacting scalar fields in a Robertson-Walker spacetime. By considering a solvable two-field model generating bipartite correlations, we show explicitly how the modewise free-field quantum entanglement experiences gravitational enhancement generated by the interaction. Moreover, we verify that this enhancement is increased for stronger coupling between the two fields.
