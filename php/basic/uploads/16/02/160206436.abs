Title: On a Lattice-Independent Formulation of Quantum Holonomy Theory
Authors: Johannes Aastrup and Jesper M. Grimstrup
Abstract: Quantum holonomy theory is a candidate for a non-perturbative theory of quantum gravity coupled to fermions. The theory is based on the QHD(M) algebra, which essentially encodes how matter degrees of freedom are moved on a three-dimensional manifold. In this paper we commence the development of a lattice-independent formulation. We first introduce a flow-dependent version of the QHD(M) algebra and formulate necessary conditions for a state to exist hereon. We then use the GNS construction to build a kinematical Hilbert space. Finally we find that operators, that correspond to the Dirac and gravitational Hamiltonians in a semi-classical limit, are background independent.
