Title: Scalar triplet on a domain wall
Authors: Vakhid A. Gani and Mariya A. Lizunova and Roman V. Radomskiy
Abstract: We consider a model with a real scalar field with polynomial self-interaction of the fourth degree and a coupled scalar triplet. We demonstrate that there is an exact analytic solution in the form of a domain wall with a localised configuration of the scalar triplet coupled to the wall. We study some properties of this solution.
