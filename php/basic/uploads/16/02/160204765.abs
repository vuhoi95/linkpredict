Title: Resolved gravity duals of ${\cal N}=4$ quiver field theories in 2+1  dimensions
Authors: William Cottrell and Akikazu Hashimoto
Abstract: We generalize the construction by Aharony, Hashimoto, Hirano, and Ouyang of ${\cal N}=4$ quiver gauge theory with gauge group $U(N+M) \times U(N)$, $k$ fundamentals charged under $U(N)$ and bi-fundamentals, to the case with gauge group $\prod_{i=1}^{\hat k} U(N_i)$ with $k_i$ fundamentals charged under $U(N_i)$. This construction is facilitated by considering the resolved $ALE_{\hat k} \times TN_{k}$ background in M-theory including non-trivial fluxes through the resolved 4-cycles in the geometry. We also describe the M-theory lift of the IIA Page charge quantization condition. Finally, we clarify the role of string corrections in various regimes of parameter space.
