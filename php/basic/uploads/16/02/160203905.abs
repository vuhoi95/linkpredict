Title: The Makeenko-Migdal equation for Yang-Mills theory on compact surfaces
Authors: Bruce K. Driver and Franck Gabriel and Brian C. Hall and Todd Kemp
Abstract: We prove the Makeenko-Migdal equation for two-dimensional Euclidean Yang-Mills theory on an arbitrary compact surface, possibly with boundary. In particular, we show that two of the proofs given by the first, third, and fourth authors for the plane case extend essentially without change to compact surfaces.
