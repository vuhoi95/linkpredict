Title: First law of black hole mechanics in variable background fields
Authors: Shao-Feng Wu and Xian-Hui Ge and Yu-Xiao Liu
Abstract: It is well known that in general theories of gravity with the diffeomorphism symmetry, the black hole entropy is a Noether charge. But what will happen if the symmetry is explicitly broken? By investigating the covariant first law of black hole mechanics with background fields, we show that the Noether entropy is still applicable due to the local nature of the black hole entropy. Moreover, motivated by the proposal that the cosmological constant behaves as a thermodynamic variable, we allow the non-dynamical background fields to be varied. As an illustration of this general formalism, we study a generic static black brane in massive gravity. By deriving two Smarr formulas using different ways, we find that either the cosmological constant or the reference metric must be a thermodynamic variable. This work provides a rare case that the general coordinate invariance would induce nontrivial physics although the diffeomorphism symmetry may be broken. It also suggests a potential relation between the cosmological constant and the background fields.
