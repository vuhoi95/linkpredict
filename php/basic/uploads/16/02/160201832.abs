Abstract: Violation of Lorentz invariancy in the high energy quantum gravity, motivates one to consider an energy dependent spacetime with massive deformation of standard general relativity. In this paper, we take into account an energy dependent metric in the context of a massive gravity model to obtain exact solutions. We investigate the geometry of the solutions and show that that there is a curvature singularity at the origin ($r=0$) which can be covered with an event horizon. We also calculate the conserved and thermodynamic quantities, which are fully reproduced by the analysis performed with the standard techniques. Finally, we examine the validity of the first law of thermodynamics. Next, we conduct a study regarding the positivity and negativity of total mass in de Sitter and anti de Sitter spacetime.
