Title: Maximally extended sl(2|2) as a quantum double
Authors: Niklas Beisert and Marius de Leeuw and Reimar Hecht
Abstract: We derive the universal R-matrix of the quantum-deformed enveloping algebra of centrally extended sl(2|2) using Drinfeld's quantum double construction. We are led to enlarging the algebra by additional generators corresponding to an sl(2) automorphism. For this maximally extended algebra we construct a consistent Hopf algebra structure where the extensions exhibit several uncommon features. We determine the corresponding universal R-matrix containing some non-standard functions. Curiously, this Hopf algebra has one extra deformation parameter for which the R-matrix does not factorize into products of exponentials.
