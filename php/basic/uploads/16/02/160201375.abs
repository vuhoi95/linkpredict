Title: Holographic Equilibration of Nonrelativistic Plasmas
Authors: Umut GÃ¼rsoy and Aron Jansen and Watse Sybesma and Stefan Vandoren
Abstract: We study far-from-equilibrium physics of strongly interacting plasmas at criticality and zero charge density for a wide range of dynamical scaling exponents z in d dimensions using holographic methods. In particular, we consider homogeneous isotropization of asymptotically Lifshitz black branes with full backreaction. We find stable evolution and equilibration times that exhibit small dependence of z and are of the order of the inverse temperature. Performing a quasinormal mode analysis we find a corresponding narrow range of relaxation times, fully characterized by the fraction z/(d-1). For z>=d-1, equilibration is overdamped, whereas for z<d-1 we find oscillatory behavior.
