Title: Effective holographic theories of momentum relaxation and violation of  conductivity bound
Authors: Blaise Gout√©raux and Elias Kiritsis and Wei-Jia Li
Abstract: We generalize current holographic models with homogeneous breaking of translation symmetry by incorporating higher derivative couplings, in the spirit of effective field theories. Focusing on charge transport, we specialize to two simple couplings between the charge and translation symmetry breaking sectors. We obtain analytical charged black brane solutions and compute their DC conductivity in terms of horizon data. We constrain the allowed values of the couplings and note that the DC conductivity can vanish at zero temperature for strong translation symmetry breaking, thus showing that in general there is no lower bound on the conductivity.
