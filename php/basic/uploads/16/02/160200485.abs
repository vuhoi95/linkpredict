Title: The fate of Schwarzschild-de Sitter Black Holes in $f(R)$ gravity
Authors: Andrea Addazi and Salvatore Capozziello
Abstract: The semiclassical effects of antievaporating black holes can be discussed in the framework of $f(R)$ gravity. In particular, the Bousso-Hawking-Nojiri-Odinstov antievaporation instability of degenerate Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes (the so called Nariai space-time) leads to a dynamical increasing of black hole horizon in $f(R)$ gravity. This phenomenon causes the following transition: emitting marginally trapped surfaces become space-like surfaces before the effective Bekenstein-Hawking emission time. As a consequence, Bousso-Hawking thermal radiation cannot be emitted in an antievaporating Nariai black hole. Possible implications in cosmology and black hole physics are also discussed.
