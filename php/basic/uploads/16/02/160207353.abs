Title: Aspects of Holographic Entanglement at Finite Temperature and Chemical  Potential
Authors: Sandipan Kundu and Juan F. Pedraza
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of entanglement entropy at finite temperature and chemical potential for strongly coupled large-N gauge theories in $d$-dimensions ($d\ge 3$) that are dual to Anti-de Sitter-Reissner-Nordstrom geometries in $(d+1)-$dimensions, in the context of gauge-gravity duality. We develop systematic expansions based on the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription that enable us to derive analytic expressions for entanglement entropy and mutual information in different regimes of interest. Consequently, we identify the specific regions of the bulk geometry that contribute most significantly to the entanglement entropy of the boundary theory at different limits. We define a scale, dubbed as the effective temperature, which determines the behavior of entanglement in different regimes. At high effective temperature, entanglement entropy is dominated by the thermodynamic entropy, however, mutual information subtracts out this contribution and measures the actual quantum entanglement. Finally, we study the entanglement/disentanglement transition of mutual information in the presence of chemical potential which shows that the quantum entanglement between two sub-regions decreases with the increase of chemical potential.
