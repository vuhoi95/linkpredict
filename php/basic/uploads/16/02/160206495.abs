Title: Scalar model of SU(N) glueball Ã  la Heisenberg
Authors: Vladimir Dzhunushaliev and Vladimir Folomeev
Abstract: Nonperturbative model of glueball is studied. The model is based on the nonperturbative quantization technique suggested by Heisenberg. 2- and 4-point Green functions for a gauge potential are expressed in terms of two scalar fields. The first scalar field describes quantum fluctuations of the subgroup $SU(n) \subset SU(N)$, and the second one describes quantum fluctuations of the coset $SU(N) / SU(n)$. An effective Lagrangian for the scalar fields is obtained. The coefficients for all terms in the Lagrangian are calculated, and it is shown that they depend on $\dim SU(n), \dim SU(N)$. It is demonstrated that a spherically symmetric solution describing the glueball does exist.
