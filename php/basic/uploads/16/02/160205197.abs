Title: Classical static final state of collapse with supertranslation memory
Authors: Geoffrey Comp√®re and Jiang Long
Abstract: The Kerr metric models the final classical black hole state after gravitational collapse of matter and radiation. Any stationary metric which is close to the Kerr metric has been proven to be diffeomorphic to it. Now, finite supertranslation diffeomorphisms are symmetries which map solutions to inequivalent solutions as such diffeomorphisms generate conserved superrotation charges. The final state of gravitational collapse is therefore parameterized by its mass, angular momentum and supertranslation field, signaled by its conserved superrotation charges. In this paper, we first derive the angle-dependent energy conservation law relating the asymptotic value of the supertranslation field of the final state to the details of the collapse and subsequent evolution of the system. We then generate the static solution with an asymptotic supertranslation field and we study some of its properties. Up to a caveat, the deviation from the Schwarzschild metric could therefore be predicted on a case-by-case basis from accurate modeling of the angular dependence of the ingoing and outgoing energy fluxes leading to the final state.
