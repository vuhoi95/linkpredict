Title: S-folds and 4d N=3 superconformal field theories
Authors: Ofer Aharony and Yuji Tachikawa
Abstract: S-folds are generalizations of orientifolds in type IIB string theory, such that the geometric identifications are accompanied by non-trivial S-duality transformations. They were recently used by Garcia-Etxebarria and Regalado to provide the first construction of four dimensional N=3 superconformal theories. In this note, we classify the different variants of these N=3 preserving S-folds, distinguished by an analog of discrete torsion, using both a direct analysis of the different torsion classes and the compactification of the S-folds to three dimensional M-theory backgrounds. Upon adding D3-branes, these variants lead to different classes of N=3 superconformal field theories. We also analyze the holographic duals of these theories, and in particular clarify the role of discrete gauge and global symmetries in holography.
