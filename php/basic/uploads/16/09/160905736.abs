Title: BMS symmetries at null infinity and near horizon of non-extermal black  holes
Authors: M. R. Setare and H. Adami
Abstract: In this paper we consider a generally covariant theory of gravity, and extend the generalized off-shell ADT current such that it becomes conserved for field dependent (asymptotically) Killing vector field. Then we define extended off-shell ADT current and extended off-shell ADT charge. Consequently, we define the conserved charge perturbation by integrating from the extended off-shell ADT charge over a spacelike codimension two surface. Eventually, we apply the presented formalism to find conserved charge perturbation of an asymptotically flat spacetime. The conserved charge perturbation we obtain is exactly matched with the result of the paper \cite{6'}. These charges are as representations of the $BMS_4$ symmetry algebra. Also, we find the near horizon conserved charges of a non-extremal black hole with extended symmetries as the Noether charges. Our result for this case also exactly matched with the result of the paper \cite{15}.
