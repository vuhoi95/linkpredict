Title: Thermodynamics of the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole with a minimal length
Authors: Yan-Gang Miao and Yu-Mei Wu
Abstract: Using the mass-smeared scheme of black holes, we study the thermodynamics of black holes. Two interesting models are considered. One is the self-regular Schwarzschild-AdS black hole whose mass density is given by the analogue to probability densities of quantum hydrogen atoms. The other model is the same black hole but whose mass density is chosen to be a rational fractional function of radial coordinates. Both mass densities are in fact analytic expressions of the ${\delta}$-function. We analyze the phase structures of the two models by investigating the heat capacity at constant pressure and the Gibbs free energy in an isothermal-isobaric ensemble. Both models fail to decay into the pure thermal radiation even with the positive Gibbs free energy due to the existence of a minimal length. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to a general mass-smeared form that is also associated with the ${\delta}$-function, and indicate the similar thermodynamic properties for various possible mass-smeared forms based on the ${\delta}$-function.
