Title: On-shell diagrams and the geometry of planar N < 4 SYM theories
Authors: Paolo Benincasa and David Gordo
Abstract: We continue the discussion of the decorated on-shell diagrammatics for planar N < 4 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories started in arXiv:1510.03642. In particular, we focus on its relation with the structure of varieties on the Grassmannian. The decoration of the on-shell diagrams, which physically keeps tracks of the helicity of the coherent states propagating along their edges, defines new on-shell functions on the Grassmannian and can introduce novel higher-order singularities, which graphically are reflected into the presence of helicity loops in the diagrams. These new structures turn out to have similar features as in the non-planar case: the related higher-codimension varieties are identified by either the vanishing of one (or more) Plucker coordinates involving at least two non-adjacent columns, or new relations among Plucker coordinates. A distinctive feature is that the functions living on these higher-codimenson varieties can be thought of distributionally as having support on derivative delta-functions. After a general discussion, we explore in some detail the structures of the on-shell functions on Gr(2,4) and Gr(3,6) on which the residue theorem allows to obtain a plethora of identities among them.
