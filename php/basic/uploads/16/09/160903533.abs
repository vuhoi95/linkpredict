Title: Propagating q-field and q-ball solution
Authors: F. R. Klinkhamer and G. E. Volovik
Abstract: One possible solution of the cosmological constant problem involves a so-called $q$-field, which self-adjusts so as to give a vanishing gravitating vacuum energy density (cosmological constant) in equilibrium. We show that this $q$-field can manifest itself in other ways. Specifically, we establish a propagating mode ($q$-wave) in the nontrivial vacuum and find a particular soliton-type solution in flat spacetime, which we call a $q$-ball by analogy with the well-known $Q$-ball solution. Both $q$-waves and $q$-balls are expected to play a role for the equilibration of the $q$-field in the very early universe.
