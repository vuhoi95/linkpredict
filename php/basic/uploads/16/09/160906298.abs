Title: The scalar glueball and the loss of conformality
Authors: Tiago Nunes da Silva and Elisabetta Pallante and Lasse Robroek
Abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of the behaviour of the anomalous dimension $\gamma_G$ of the scalar glueball operator $G_{\mu\nu}^a G_{\mu\nu}^a$ at the non-trivial infrared fixed point inside the conformal window of a non-Abelian gauge theory. By virtue of the non-renormalisability of the energy-momentum tensor, $\gamma_G$ is determined by the derivative of the gauge coupling beta function at the fixed point. We therefore predict $\gamma_G$ from the perturbative beta-function to 2, 3, 4 loops, and show that its flavour number ($N_f$) dependence along the infrared fixed-point line is opposite to that implied by an ultraviolet-infrared fixed-point merging mechanism at the lower edge of the conformal window. A nonperturbative determination of $\gamma_G$ can thus establish the mechanism for the loss of conformality and the fate of the preconformal phase. We also discuss large-N massless QCD in the Veneziano limit in this context.
