Title: Mass Formulae for Broken Supersymmetry in Curved Space-Time
Authors: Sergio Ferrara and Antoine Van Proeyen
Abstract: We derive the mass formulae for ${\cal N}=1$, $D=4$ matter-coupled Supergravity for broken (and unbroken) Supersymmetry in curved space-time. These formulae are applicable to de Sitter configurations as is the case for inflation. For unbroken Supersymmetry in anti-de Sitter (AdS) one gets the mass relations modified by the AdS curvature. We compute the mass relations both for the potential and its derivative non-vanishing.
