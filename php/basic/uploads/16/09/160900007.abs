Title: Amplitudes and Correlators to Ten Loops Using Simple, Graphical  Bootstraps
Authors: Jacob L. Bourjaily and Paul Heslop and Vuong-Viet Tran
Abstract: We introduce two new graphical-level relations among possible contributions to the four-point correlation function and scattering amplitude in planar, maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. When combined with the rung rule, these prove powerful enough to fully determine both functions through ten loops. This then also yields the full five-point amplitude to eight loops and the parity-even part to nine loops. We derive these rules, illustrate their applications, compare their relative strengths for fixing coefficients, and survey some of the features of the previously unknown nine and ten loop expressions. Explicit formulae for amplitudes and correlators through ten loops are available at: http://goo.gl/JH0yEc.
