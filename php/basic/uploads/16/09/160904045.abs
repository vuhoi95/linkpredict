Title: Hori-mological projective duality
Authors: JÃ¸rgen Vold Rennemo and Ed Segal
Abstract: Kuznetsov has conjectured that Pfaffian varieties should admit non-commutative crepant resolutions which satisfy his Homological Projective Duality. We prove half the cases of this conjecture, by interpreting and proving a duality of non-abelian gauged linear sigma models proposed by Hori.
