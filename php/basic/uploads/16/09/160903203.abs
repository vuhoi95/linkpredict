Title: Parity-doublet representation of Majorana fermions and neutron  oscillation
Authors: Kazuo Fujikawa and Anca Tureanu
Abstract: We present a parity-doublet theorem for the representation of the intrinsic parity of Majorana fermions, which is expected to be useful also in condensed matter physics, and it is illustrated to provide a criterion of neutron-antineutron oscillation in a BCS-like effective theory with $\Delta B=2$ baryon number violating terms. The CP violation in the present effective theory causes no direct CP violating effects in the oscillation itself, which is demonstrated by the exact solution, although it influences the neutron electric dipole moment in the leading order of small $\Delta B=2$ parameters. An analogue of Bogoliubov transformation, which preserves P and CP, is crucial in the analysis.
