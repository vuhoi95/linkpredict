Title: P-V criticality of AdS black holes in a general framework
Authors: Bibhas Ranjan Majhi and Saurav Samanta
Abstract: Interpreting the cosmological constant as pressure, it has been observed that AdS black holes behave as van der Waals system. The critical exponents for the phase transition for all AdS black holes are exactly same as those for the van der Waals system. Till now this has been observed case by case. Here, without using any specific form of the black hole metric, we present a general framework based on just two universal inputs. These are the general forms of the Smarr formula and the first law of thermodynamics. We find that the same values of the critical exponents can be obtained by this general analysis. Therefore there is no need to investigate for a particular metric. The importance of our analysis is that it highlights the observed universality, as well as revels the reason for such universality.
