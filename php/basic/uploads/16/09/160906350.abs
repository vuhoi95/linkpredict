Abstract: The spinor representations of the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebras osp(m|n) are considered and constructed. These are infinite-dimensional irreducible representations, of which the superdimension coincides with the dimension of the spinor representation of so(m-n). Next, we consider the self dual tensor representations of osp(m|n) and their generalizations: these are also infinite-dimensional and correspond to the highest irreducible component of the $p^{th}$ power of the spinor representation. We determine the character of these representations, and deduce a superdimension formula. From this, it follows that also for these representations the osp(m|n)~ so(m-n) correspondence holds.
