Title: Collective Coordinates in One-Dimensional Soliton Models Revisited
Authors: I. Takyi and H. Weigel
Abstract: We compare numerical solutions to the full field equations to simplified approaches based on implementing three collective coordinates for kink-antikink interactions within the $\varphi^4$ and $\phi^6$ models in one time and one space dimensions. We particularly pursue the question whether the collective coordinate approximation substantiates the conjecture that vibrational modes are important for resonance structures to occur in kink-antikink scattering.
