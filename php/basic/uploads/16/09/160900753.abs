Abstract: We study localization of five-dimensional supersymmetric $U(1)$ gauge theory on $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}_{\theta}^{2}$ where $\mathbb{R}_{\theta}^{2}$ is a noncommutative (NC) plane. The theory can be isomorphically mapped to three-dimensional supersymmetric $U(N \to \infty)$ gauge theory on $\mathbb{S}^3$ using the matrix representation on a separable Hilbert space on which NC fields linearly act. Therefore the NC space $\mathbb{R}_{\theta}^{2}$ allows for a flexible path to derive matrix models via localization from a higher-dimensional supersymmetric NC $U(1)$ gauge theory. The result shows a rich duality between NC $U(1)$ gauge theories and large $N$ matrix models in various dimensions.
