Title: Global anomalies on physical space-times
Authors: Alexander Schenkel and Jochen Zahn
Abstract: We formulate an algebraic criterion for the presence of global anomalies on globally hyperbolic space-times in the framework of locally covariant field theory. We discuss some consequences and check that it reproduces the well-known global $SU(2)$ anomaly in four space-time dimensions.
