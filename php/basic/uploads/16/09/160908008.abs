Title: Observables in the Guarino-Jafferis-Varela/CS-SYM duality
Authors: Thiago R. Araujo and Horatiu Nastase
Abstract: We study various semiclassical observables in the duality proposed by Guarino, Jafferis and Varela, between a warped $AdS_4\times$ squashed $S^6$ gravitational solution and a 3 dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ SYM-CS$_k$ conformal gauge theory, deformed from the maximal $SU(N)$ ${\cal N}=8$ SYM. Baryon vertices corresponding to particle-like branes have unusual behaviour with $N$ and $k$ and present strong evidence for a certain level-rank duality. Wilson loops and the anomalous dimensions of operators of high spin scale like $(N/k)^{3/2}$. The entanglement entropy behaves like in a usual CFT. Giant magnon operators obey the same law as in 4 dimensional ${\cal N}=4$ SYM, and giant gravitons are also sub-determinant operators.
