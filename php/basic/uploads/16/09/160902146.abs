Title: Emergence of supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics on the surface of a  correlated topological insulator
Authors: Shao-Kai Jian and Chien-Hung Lin and Joseph Maciejko and Hong Yao
Abstract: We show that a supersymmetric gauge theory with dynamical gauge bosons and fermionic gauginos emerges naturally at the pair-density-wave (PDW) quantum phase transition on the surface of a correlated topological insulator (TI) hosting three Dirac cones, such as the candidate topological Kondo insulator SmB$_6$. At the tricritical point separating the first- and second-order quantum phase transitions between the surface Dirac semimetal and nematic PDW phases, three massless bosonic Cooper pair fields emerge as the superpartners of three massless surface Dirac fermions. The resulting low-energy effective theory is the supersymmetric XYZ model, which is dual by mirror symmetry to $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics (SQED) in 2+1 dimensions. Using supersymmetry, we calculate exactly certain critical exponents and the optical conductivity of the surface states at the tricritical point, which may be measured in future experiments.
