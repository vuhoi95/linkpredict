Title: On aether terms in a space-time with a compact extra dimension
Authors: T. Mariz and J. R. Nascimento and A. Yu. Petrov
Abstract: In this paper, for the CPT-even and CPT-odd extensions of the QED, we explicitly obtain the aether-like corrections for the electromagnetic field in the case when the space-time involves an extra compact spatial dimension besides of usual four dimensions. Our methodology is based on an explicit summation over the Kaluza-Klein tower of fields which is no more difficult than the finite-temperature calculations. The quantum corrections turn out to be large as the extra dimension is small. We demonstrate that in the CPT-even case, the extra dimension manifests itself through a new scalar particle.
