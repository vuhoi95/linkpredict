Title: Holographic superconductor in a deformed four-dimensional STU model
Authors: B. Pourhassan and M. M. Bagheri-Mohagheghi
Abstract: In this paper, we consider deformed STU model in four dimension including both electric and magnetic charges. Using AdS/CFT we study holographic superconductor and obtain transport properties. We find that presence of magnetic charge is necessary to have maximum electrical conductivity. Also we show that thermal conductivity increases with magnetic charge.
