Title: Naturalness in see-saw mechanism and Bogoliubov transformation
Authors: Kazuo Fujikawa and Anca Tureanu
Abstract: The see-saw mechanism is customarily regarded as the ratio of two masses leading to the tiny neutrino mass. We propose an alternative perspective on the see-saw, according to which the small neutrino mass is given as a difference of two large fermion masses of the order of the grand unification scale, and thus hitherto unrecognized fine tuning. This alternative view is motivated by the use of an analogue of Bogoliubov transformation to describe Majorana neutrinos in the Lagrangian defining the see-saw mechanism, which is analogous to the Lagrangian of the BCS theory. The naturalness issue of the neutrino mass thus becomes related to that of the Higgs mass in the Standard Model.
