Title: Static and rotating solutions for Vector-Galileon theories
Authors: Adolfo Cisterna and Mokhtar Hassaine and Julio Oliva and Massimiliano Rinaldi
Abstract: We consider a particular truncation of the generalized Proca field theory in four dimensions for which we construct a static and axisymmetric rotating black hole "stealth solutions", namely solutions with (Anti) de Sitter or Kerr metric but non-trivial vector field. The static configuration is promoted to a backreacting black hole with asymptotic (Anti) de Sitter behavior by turning on a nonlinear electrodynamic source given as a fixed power of the Maxwell invariant. Finally we extend our solutions to arbitrary dimensions.
