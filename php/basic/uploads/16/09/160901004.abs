Title: Note on "Equivalence Between Different Auxiliary Field Formulations of  ${\cal N}=1$ Supergravity Coupled to Matter"
Authors: Shuntaro Aoki and Yusuke Yamada
Abstract: In the version 1 of this paper, we claimed that 4D ${\cal N}=1$ supergravity formulations with different auxiliary fields can be unified using U(1) gauge symmetry, whose gauge superfield does not have a kinetic term. However, after submission, we found a critical error in our statement. This is the note on the paper of the version 1.
