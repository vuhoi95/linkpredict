Abstract: In this paper we construct a new Type IIB background with an $AdS_4$ factor that preserves ${\cal N}=4$ Supersymmetry. This solution is obtained using a non-Abelian T-duality transformation on the Type IIA reduction of the $AdS_4\times S^7$ background. We interpret our configuration as a patch of a more general background with localised sources, dual to the renormalisation fixed point of a $T_{\rho}^{\hat{\rho}} (SU(N))$ quiver field theory. This relates explicitly the $AdS_4$ geometry to a D3-D5-NS5 brane intersection, illuminating what seems to be a more general phenomenon, relating $AdS_{p+1}$ backgrounds generated by non-Abelian T-duality to Dp-D(p+2)-NS5 branes intersections.
