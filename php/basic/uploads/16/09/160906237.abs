Title: Thermodynamic properties of neutral particle in presence of Topological  defects in Magnetic Cosmic String Background
Authors: Hassan Hassanabadi and Mansoureh Hosseinpour
Abstract: In this paper, we study the covariant form of the non-relativistic Schrodinger-Pauli equation in the space-time generated by a cosmic string and discuss the solutions of this equation in present of interaction between the magnetic dipole momentum and electromagnetic field. We study the influence of the topology on this system. We obtain the solution of radial part as well as the energy levels. We consider all thermodynamic properties of neutral particle in magnetic cosmic string background by using an approach based on the partition function method.
