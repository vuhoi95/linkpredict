Title: Exact Growth of Entanglement and Dynamical Phase Transition in Global  Fermionic Quench
Authors: Shruti Paranjape and Nilakash Sorokhaibam
Abstract: Critical quantum quench of free Dirac fermions in an infinite system is examined carefully. A much broader analysis, with more emphasis on free scalar fields, has been done in hep-th/1512.0218. For specially prepared squeezed states of the massive theory, quenched states obtained are Calabrese-Cardy(CC) states and generalized Calabrese-Cardy(gCC) states with higher-spin charges. Exact time dependence of correlators are computed showing thermalization explicitly. We also calculate the exact monotonic growth of entanglement entropy in CC states. In case of gCC states, for a particular charge, we show that there is a dynamical phase transition from monotonic to non-monotonic entanglement entropy growth when the effective chemical potential is increased beyond a critical value.
