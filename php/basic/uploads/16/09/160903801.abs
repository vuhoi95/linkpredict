Abstract: We apply a definition of generalised super Calabi-Yau variety (SCY) to supermanifolds of complex dimension one. We get that the class of all SCY's of bosonic dimension one and reduced manifold equal to $\mathbb{P}^1$ is given by $\mathbb{P}^{1|2} $ and the weighted projective super space $\mathbb{WP}^{1|1}_{(2)}$. Then we compute the corresponding sheaf cohomology of superforms, showing that the cohomology with picture number one is infinite dimensional, while the de Rham cohomology remains finite dimensional. Moreover, we provide the complete real and holomorphic de Rham cohomology for generic projective super spaces $\mathbb P^{n|m}$. We also determine the automorphism groups, which for $\mathbb{P}^{1|2} $ results to be larger than the projective supergroup. Finally, we show that $\mathbb{P}^{1|2} $ is self mirror, whereas $\mathbb{WP} ^{1|1}_{(2)}$ has a zero dimensional mirror. The mirror map for $\mathbb{P}^{1|2}$ endows it with a structure of $N=2$ super Riemann surface.
