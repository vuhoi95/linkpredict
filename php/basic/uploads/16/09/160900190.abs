Title: Hadamard property of the in and out states for Klein-Gordon fields on  asymptotically static spacetimes
Authors: Christian Gérard and Michał Wrochna
Abstract: We consider the massive Klein-Gordon equation on a class of asymptotically static spacetimes (in the long range sense) with Cauchy surface of bounded geometry. We prove the existence and Hadamard property of the in and out states constructed by scattering theory methods.
