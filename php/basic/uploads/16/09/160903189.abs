Title: Radiation Like Scalar Field and Gauge Fields in Cosmology for a theory  with Dynamical Time
Authors: David Benisty and E. I. Guendelman
Abstract: Cosmological solutions with a scalar field behaving as radiation are obtained, in the context of gravitational theory with dynamical time. The solution requires the spacial curvature of the universe k, to be zero, unlike the standard radiation solutions, which do not impose any constraint on the spacial curvature of the universe. This is because only such $ k=0 $ radiation solutions poses a homothetic Killimg vector. This kind of theory can be used to generalize electromagnetism and other gauge theories, in curved space time, and there are no deviations from standard gauge filed equation (like Maxwell equations) in the case there exist a conformal Killing vector. But there could be departures from Maxwell and Yang Mills equations, for more general space times.
