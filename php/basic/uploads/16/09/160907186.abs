Abstract: We use holography to compute spectral functions of certain fermionic operators in three different finite-density, zero-temperature states of ABJM theory with a broken U(1) symmetry. In each of the three states, dual to previously studied domain wall solutions of four-dimensional gauged supergravity, we find that the fermionic operators have gapped spectra. In one case the gap can be traced to the small charge of the fermions, while in the other cases it is due to a particular interaction that mixes particles and holes.
