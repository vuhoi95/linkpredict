Title: D-branes from Pure Spinor Superstring in AdS_5 x S^5 Background
Authors: Sota Hanazawa and Makoto Sakaguchi
Abstract: We examine the surface term for the BRST transformation of the open pure spinor superstring in an AdS_5 x S^5 background. We find that the boundary condition to eliminate the surface term leads to a classification of possible configurations of 1/2 supersymmetric D-branes.
