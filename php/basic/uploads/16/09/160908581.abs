Title: A Probability Density Function for Neutrino Masses and Mixings
Authors: Jean-Fran√ßois Fortin and Nicolas Giasson and Luc Marleau
Abstract: The anarchy principle leading to the see-saw ensemble is studied analytically with the usual tools of random matrix theory. The probability density function for the see-saw ensemble of $N\times N$ matrices is obtained in terms of a multidimensional integral. This integral involves all light neutrino masses, leading to a complicated probability density function. It is shown that the probability density function for the neutrino mixing angles and phases is the appropriate Haar measure. The decoupling of the light neutrino masses and neutrino mixings implies no correlation between the neutrino mass eigenstates and the neutrino mixing matrix, in contradiction with observations but in agreement with some of the claims found in the literature.
