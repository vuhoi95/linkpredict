Title: Bose-Einstein graviton condensate in a Schwarzschild black hole
Authors: Jorge Alfaro and Dom√®nec Espriu and Luciano Gabbanelli
Abstract: We analyze in detail a previous proposal by Dvali and G\'omez that black holes could be treated as consisting of a Bose-Einstein condensate of gravitons. In order to do so we extend the Einstein-Hilbert action with a chemical potential-like term, thus placing ourselves in a grand-canonical ensemble. The form and characteristics of this chemical potential-like piece are discussed in some detail. After this, we proceed to expand the ensuing equations of motion up to second order around the classical Schwarzschild metric so that some non-linear terms in the metric fluctuation are kept. We argue that the resulting equations could be interpreted as the Gross-Pitaevskii equation describing a graviton Bose-Einstein condensate trapped by the black hole gravitational field. Next we search for solutions and, modulo some very plausible assumptions, we find out that the condensate vanishes outside the horizon but is non-zero in its interior. Based on hints from a numerical integration of the equations we formulate an ansatz and eventually find an exact non-trivial solution for a mean-field wave-function describing the graviton Bose-Einstein condensate in the black hole interior. Based on this we can rederive some of the relations involving the number of gravitons $N$ and the black hole characteristics, summarized in its Schwarzschild radius, along the lines suggested by Dvali and G\'omez. These relations are parametrized by a single parameter ---a dimensionless chemical potential.
