Title: On W algebras commuting with a set of screenings
Authors: Alexey Litvinov and Lev Spodyneiko
Abstract: We consider the problem of classification of all W algebras which commute with a set of exponential screening operators. Assuming that the W algebra has a nontrivial current of spin 3, we find equations satisfied by the screening operators and classify their solutions.
