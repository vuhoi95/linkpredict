Title: An investgation on the electron's EDM from the electron's MDM
Authors: N. Panza and Y. M. P. Gomes and J. A. HelayÃ«l
Abstract: We pursue, in this contribution, an investigation of the contribution of the electron's magnetic dipole moment (MDM) to the electron's electric dipole moment (EDM) (or the charged leptons, more generally) in the framework of the Born-Infeld Electrodynamics and in a gravity background with a non-vanishing cosmological constant, where CP-symmetry is broken down. Our point of view consist in associating a non-trivial EDM to a non-symmetry of the charge distribution of the elementary particle under consideration. The bound on the electron's EDM published in 2014 is used to constrain the coupling parameter of the electromagnetic sector to the scalar curvature of the space-time in the case we consider gravity to be responsible for the asymmetry in the distribution.
