Title: Conditional entropy of glueball states
Authors: Alex E. Bernardini and Nelson R. F. Braga and Roldao da Rocha
Abstract: The conditional entropy of glueball states is calculated using a holographic description. Glueball states are represented by a supergravity dual picture, consisting of a 5-dimensional graviton-dilaton action of a dynamical holographic AdS/QCD model. The conditional entropy is studied as a function of the glueball spin and of the mass, providing information about the stability of the glueball states.
