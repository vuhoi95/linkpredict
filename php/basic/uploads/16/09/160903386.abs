Abstract: We present cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectra from recent numerical simulations of cosmic strings in the Abelian Higgs model and compare them to CMB power spectra measured by Planck. We obtain revised constraints on the cosmic string tension parameter $G\mu$. For example, in the $\Lambda$CDM model with the addition of strings and no primordial tensor perturbations, we find $G\mu < 2.0 \times 10^{-7}$ at 95% confidence, about 20% lower than the value obtained from previous simulations, which had 1/64 of the spatial volume. We investigate the source of the difference, showing that the main cause is an improved treatment of the string evolution across the radiation-matter transition. The increased computational volume also makes possible to simulate fully the physical equations of motion, in which the string cores shrink in comoving coordinates. This, and the larger dynamic range, changes the amplitude of the power spectra by only about 10%, demonstrating that field theory simulations of cosmic strings have now reached the required dynamic range for CMB calculations.
