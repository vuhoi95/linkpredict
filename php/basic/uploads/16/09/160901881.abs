Title: Light dilatons in warped space: Higgs boson and LHCb anomalies
Authors: Eugenio Megias and Giuliano Panico and Oriol Pujolas and Mariano Quiros
Abstract: We study the extension of the Standard Model (SM) with a light dilaton in a five dimensional warped model. In particular, we analyze the coupling of the dilaton with the SM matter fields, compare the model predictions with Electroweak Precisions Tests and find the corresponding bounds on the mass of the lightest Kaluza-Klein modes. We also investigate the possibility that the Higgs-like resonance found at the LHC can be a dilaton. Finally, we show that our set-up can also provide an explanation of the anomalies recently observed in $B$-meson decays.
