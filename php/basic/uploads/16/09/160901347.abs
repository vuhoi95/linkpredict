Title: Beyond Special Relativity at second order
Authors: J. M. Carmona and J. L. Cortes and J. J. Relancio
Abstract: The study of generic, non-linear, deformations of Special Relativity parametrized by a high-energy scale $M$, which was carried out at first order in $M$ in Phys.Rev. D86, 084032 (2012), is extended to second order. This can be done systematically through a ('generalized') change of variables from momentum variables that transform linearly. We discuss the different perspectives on the meaning of the change of variables, obtain the coefficients of modified composition laws and Lorentz transformations at second order, and work out how $\kappa$-Poincar\'e, the most commonly used example in the literature, is reproduced as a particular case of the generic framework exposed here.
