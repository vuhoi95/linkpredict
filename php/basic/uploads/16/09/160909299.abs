Title: Yukawa's of light stringy states
Authors: Pascal Anastasopoulos and Massimo Bianchi and Dario Consoli
Abstract: Light massive string states can appear at D-brane intersections with small angles. We compute tri-linear Yukawa couplings of such open-string states to massless ones and to one another. Due to ambiguities in the normalisation of the vertex operators, that involve twist fields, we proceed via factorization of appropriate scattering amplitudes. Some peculiar features are observed that may lead to interesting signatures at colliders in the future.
