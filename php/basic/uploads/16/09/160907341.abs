Title: A supersymmetric exotic field theory in (1+1) dimensions. One loop  soliton quantum mass corrections
Authors: A. R. Aguirre and G. Flores-Hidalgo
Abstract: We consider one loop quantum corrections to soliton mass for the $N=1$ supersymmetric extension of the $\phi^2 \cos^2(\ln \phi^2)$ scalar field theory in (1+1) dimensions. First, we compute the one loop quantum soliton mass correction of the bosonic sector by using a mixture of the scattering phase shift and the Euclidean effective action technique. Afterwards the computation in the supersymmetric case is naturally extended by considering the fermionic phase shifts associated to the Majorana fields. As a result we derive a general formula for the one loop quantum corrections to the soliton mass of the SUSY kink, and obtain for this exotic model the same value as for the SUSY sine-Gordon and $\phi^4$ models.
