Title: Classical Universe emerging from quantum cosmology without horizon and  flatness problems
Authors: M. Fathi and S. Jalalzadeh and P. V. Moniz
Abstract: We apply the complex de Broglie-Bohm formulation of quantum mechanics [1] to a spatially closed homogeneous and isotropic early Universe whose matter content are radiation and dust perfect fluids. We then show that an expanding classical Universe can emerge from an oscillating (with complex scale factor) quantum Universe without singularity. Furthermore, the Universe obtained in this process has no horizon or flatness problems.
