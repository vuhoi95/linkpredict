Title: AdS and dS black hole solutions in analogue gravity: The relativistic  and non-relativistic cases
Authors: Ramit Dey and Stefano Liberati and Rodrigo Turcati
Abstract: We show that Schwarzschild black hole solutions in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) and de Sitter (dS) spaces may, up to a conformal factor, be reproduced in the framework of analogue gravity. The aforementioned derivation is performed using relativistic and non-relativistic Bose-Einstein condensates. In addition, we demonstrate that the (2+1) planar AdS black hole can be mapped into the non-relativistic acoustic metric. Given that AdS black holes are extensively employed in the gauge/gravity duality, we then comment on the possibility to study the AdS/CFT correspondence and gravity/fluid duality from an analogue gravity perspective.
