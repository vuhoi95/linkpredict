Title: On the thermodynamics of scale factor dual Universes
Authors: G. M. Sotkov and A. L. Alves Lima and U. Camara da Silva
Abstract: The thermodynamical aspects of the conformal time scale factor duality (SFD) of cosmological models within Einstein Gravity are investigated. We derive the SFD transformations of the thermodynamical quantities describing the thermal evolution of the matter fluid and of the apparent horizon. The thermodynamical properties of the self-dual cosmological models with a modified Chaplygin gas are studied in detail. We deduce the restrictions on the equation of state parameters that allow to extend scale factor duality as a UV/IR symmetry of the cosmological models consistent with their thermodynamical behavior.
