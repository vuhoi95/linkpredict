Abstract: A set of Schwinger-Dyson equations forming constraints for at most three resolvent functions are considered for a class of Chern-Simons matter matrix models with two nodes labelled by a non-vanishing number $n$. The two cases $n=2$ and $n= -2$ label respectively the ABJM matrix model, which is the hyperbolic lift of the affine $A_1^{(1)}$ quiver matrix model, and the lens space matrix model. In the planar limit, we derive two cubic loop equations for the two planar resolvents. One of these reduces to the quadratic one when $n = \pm 2$.
