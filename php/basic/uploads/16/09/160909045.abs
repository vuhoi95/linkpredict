Title: Kaluza--Klein Cosmology from five-dimensional Lovelock--Cartan Theory
Authors: Oscar Castillo-Felisola and Cristóbal Corral and Simón del Pino and Francisca Ramírez
Abstract: We study the Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction of the Lovelock-Cartan theory in five-dimensional spacetime, with a compact dimension of $S^1$ topology. We find cosmological solutions of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker class in the reduced spacetime. The torsion and the fields arising from the dimensional reduction induce a nonvanishing energy-momentum tensor in four dimensions. We find solutions describing expanding, contracting and bouncing universes. The model shows a dynamical compactification of the extra dimension in some regions of the parameter space.
