Title: Accretion onto a Moving Reissner-Nordstr√∂m Black Hole
Authors: Lei Jiao and Rong-Jia Yang
Abstract: We obtain an analytic solution for accretion of a gaseous medium with a adiabatic equation of state ($P=\rho$) onto a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole which moves at a constant velocity through the medium. We present the mass accretion rate which depends on the mass and the electric charge. The flow is two dimensional for Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole but is independent of the orientation of the black hole's spin with respect to the incident direction of the flow.
