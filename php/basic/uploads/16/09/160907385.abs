Title: Exact solution of the relativistic quantum Toda chain
Authors: Xin Zhang and Junpeng Cao and Wen-Li Yang and Kangjie Shi and Yupeng Wang
Abstract: The relativistic quantum Toda chain model is studied with the generalized algebraic Bethe Ansatz method. By employing a set of local gauge transformations, proper local vacuum states can be obtained for this model. The exact spectrum and eigenstates of the model are thus constructed simultaneously.
