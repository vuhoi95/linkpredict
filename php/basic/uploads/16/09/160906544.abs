Title: Phase space analysis for a scalar-tensor model with kinetic and  Gauss-Bonnet couplings
Authors: L. N. Granda and E. Loaiza
Abstract: We study the phase space for an scalar-tensor string inspired model of dark energy with non minimal kinetic and Gauss Bonnet couplings. The form of the scalar potential and of the coupling terms is of the exponential type, which give rise to appealing cosmological solutions. The critical points describe a variety of cosmological scenarios that go from matter or radiation dominated universe to dark energy dominated universe. There were found trajectories in the phase space departing from unstable or saddle fixed points and arriving to the stable scalar field dominated point corresponding to late-time accelerated expansion.
