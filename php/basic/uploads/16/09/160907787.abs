Title: Modulus stabilisation in a backreacted warped geometry model via  Goldberger-Wise mechanism
Authors: Ashmita Das and Tanmoy Paul and Soumitra SenGupta
Abstract: In the context of higher dimensional braneworld scenario, the stabilisation of extra dimensional modulus is an essential requirement for resolving the gauge hierarchy problem in the context of Standard Model of elementary particle Physics. For Randall-Sundrum (RS) warped extra dimensional model, Goldberger and Wise (GW) proposed a much useful mechanism to achieve this using a scalar field in the bulk spacetime ignoring the effects of backreaction of the scalar field on the background metric. In this article we examine the influence of the backreaction of the stabilising field on the stabilisation condition as well as that on the Physics of the extra dimensional modulus namely radion. In particular we obtain the modifications of the mass and the coupling of the radion with the Standard Model (SM) matter fields on the TeV brane due to backreaction effect. Our calculation also brings out an important equivalence between the treatments followed by Csaki et.al. in \cite{kribs} and Goldberger-Wise in \cite{GW1,GW_radion}.
