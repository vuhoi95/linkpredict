Title: Exceptionally simple exceptional models
Authors: Shlomo S. Razamat and Gabi Zafrir
Abstract: We discuss models with no dynamical vector fields in various dimensions which we claim might have exceptional symmetry on some loci of their parameter space. In particular we construct theories with four supercharges flowing to theories with global symmetry enhancing to $F_4$, $E_6$, and $E_7$. The main evidence for these claims is based on extracting information about the symmetry properties of the theories from their supersymmetric partition functions.
