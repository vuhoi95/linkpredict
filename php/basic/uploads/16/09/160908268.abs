Title: Deriving analytic solutions for compact binary inspirals without  recourse to adiabatic approximations
Authors: Chad R. Galley and Ira Z. Rothstein
Abstract: We utilize the dynamical renormalization group formalism to calculate the real space trajectory of a compact binary inspiral for long times via a systematic resummation of secularly growing terms. This method generates closed form solutions without orbit averaging, and the accuracy can be systematically improved. The expansion parameter is $v^5 \nu \Omega(t-t_0)$ where $t_0$ is the initial time, $t$ is the time elapsed, and $\Omega$ and $v$ are the angular orbital frequency and initial speed, respectively, and $\nu$ is the binary's symmetric mass ratio. We demonstrate how to apply the renormalization group method to resum solutions beyond leading order in two ways. First, we calculate the second order corrections of the leading radiation reaction force, which involves highly non-trivial checks of the formalism (i.e. its renormalizability). Second, we show how to systematically include post-Newtonian corrections to the radiation reaction force. By avoiding orbit averaging we gain predictive power and eliminate ambiguities in the initial conditions. Finally, we discuss how this methodology can be used to find analytic solutions to the spin equations of motion that are valid over long times.
