Title: The many faces of mirror symmetry
Authors: Shamit Kachru and Michael Mulligan and Gonzalo Torroba and Huajia Wang
Abstract: We study supersymmetry breaking perturbations of the simplest dual pair of 2+1-dimensional N = 2 supersymmetric field theories -- the free chiral multiplet and N = 2 super-QED with a single flavor. We find dual descriptions of a phase diagram containing four distinct massive phases. The equivalence of the intervening critical theories gives rise to several non-supersymmetric avatars of mirror symmetry: we find dualities relating scalar QED to a free fermion and Wilson-Fisher theories to both scalar and fermionic QED. Thus, mirror symmetry can be viewed as the multicritical parent duality from which these non-supersymmetric dualities directly descend.
