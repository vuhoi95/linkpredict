Abstract: Simplicity constraints play a crucial role in the construction of spin foam models, yet their effective behaviour on larger scales is scarcely explored. In this article we introduce intertwiner and spin net models for the quantum group $\text{SU}(2)_k \times \text{SU}(2)_k$, which implement the simplicity constraints analogous to 4D Euclidean spin foam models, namely the Barrett-Crane (BC) and the Engle-Pereira-Rovelli-Livine/Freidel-Krasnov (EPRL/FK) model. These models are numerically coarse grained via tensor network renormalization, allowing us to trace the flow of simplicity constraints to larger scales. In order to perform these simulations we have substantially adapted tensor network algorithms, which we discuss in detail. The BC and the EPRL/FK model behave very differently under coarse graining: While the unique BC intertwiner model is a fixed point and therefore constitutes a 2D topological phase, BC spin net models flow away from the initial simplicity constraints and converge to several different topological phases. Most of these phases correspond to decoupling spin foam vertices, however we find also a new phase in which this is not the case, and in which a non-trivial version of the simplicity constraints holds. The coarse graining flow of the BC spin net models indicates furthermore that the phase transitions are not of second order. The EPRL/FK model by contrast reveals a far more intricate and complex dynamics. We observe an immediate flow away from the original simplicity constraints, however, with the truncation employed here, the models generically do not converge to a fixed point. The results show that the imposition of simplicity constraints can indeed lead to interesting and complex dynamics. Thus we will need to further develop coarse graining tools to efficiently study the large scale behaviour of spin foam models, in particular for the EPRL/FK model.
