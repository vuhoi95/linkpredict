Title: The Complexity of Identifying Ryu-Takayanagi Surfaces in AdS3/CFT2
Authors: Ning Bao and Aidan Chatwin-Davies
Abstract: We present a constructive algorithm for the determination of Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces in AdS3/CFT2 which exploits previously noted connections between holographic entanglement entropy and max-flow/min-cut. We then characterize its complexity as a polynomial time algorithm.
