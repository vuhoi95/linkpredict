Abstract: The periodic $Z_n$-Belavin model on a lattice with an arbitrary number of sites $N$ is studied via the off-diagonal Bethe Ansatz method (ODBA). The eigenvalues of the corresponding transfer matrix are given in terms of an unified inhomogeneous $T-Q$ relation. In the special case of $N=nl$ with $l$ being also a positive integer, the resulting $T-Q$ relation recovers the homogeneous one previously obtained via algebraic Bethe Ansatz.
