Title: $\mathcal{N} = 1$ superconformal theories with $D_N$ blocks
Authors: Marco Fazzi and Simone Giacomelli
Abstract: We study the chiral ring of four-dimensional superconformal field theories obtained by wrapping M5-branes on a complex curve inside a Calabi-Yau three-fold. We propose a field theoretic construction of all the theories found by Bah, Beem, Bobev and Wecht by introducing new building blocks, and prove several $\mathcal{N} = 1$ dualities featuring the latter. We match the central charges with those computed from the M5-brane anomaly polynomial, perform the counting of relevant operators and analyze unitarity bound violations. As a byproduct, we compute the exact dimension of "heavy operators" obtained by wrapping an M2-brane on the complex curve.
