Title: Violation of the PT-symmetry and structure formation in the dark  matter-gravitational wave interaction
Authors: Catarina Bastos and Hugo Ter√ßas
Abstract: In flat spacetime, quantum fluctuations in dark matter, as described as a Bose-Einstein condensate, are stable and display a relativistic Bogoliubov dispersion relation. In the weak gravitational field limit, both relativistic and nonrelativistic models self-gravitating dark matter suggest the formation of structures as the result of a dynamical (Jeans) instability. Here, we show that in the presence of spontaneous symmetry breaking of the dark matter field, the gravitational wave is damped for wave-lengths larger than the Jeans length. Such energy is converted to the Bogoliubov modes of the BEC that in their turn become unstable and grow, leading to the formation of structures even in the absence of expansion. Remarkably, this compensated attenuation/amplification mechanism is the signature of a discrete PT-symmetry-breaking of the system.
