Title: Warm inflation with an oscillatory inflaton in non-minimal kinetic  coupling model
Authors: Parviz Goodarzi and H. Mohseni Sadjadi
Abstract: Inflation with an oscillatory inflaton in the non-minimal derivative coupling model is considered. Radiation generation during this era is taken into account. Cosmological perturbations for thermal fluctuation and the temperature at the end of warm oscillatory inflation are computed.
