Title: BPS relations from spectral problems and blowup equations
Authors: Alba Grassi and Jie Gu
Abstract: Recently an exact duality between topological string and the spectral theory of operators constructed from mirror curves to toric Calabi-Yau threefolds has been proposed. At the same time an exact quantization condition for the cluster integrable systems associated to these geometries has been conjectured. The consistency between the two approaches leads to an infinite set of constraints for the refined BPS invariants of the toric Calabi-Yau threefolds. We show that, for the Y^{N,m} geometries, these constraints can be derived from the K-theoretic blowup equations for SU(N) SYM with generic Chern-Simons invariant m. In particular this furnishes a proof of the BPS constraints in the case of m = 0.
