Title: Generalized Skyrme model with the loosely bound potential
Authors: Sven Bjarke Gudnason and Baiyang Zhang and Nana Ma
Abstract: We study a generalization of the loosely bound Skyrme model which consists of the Skyrme model with a sixth-order derivative term - motivated by its fluid-like properties - and the second-order loosely bound potential - motivated by lowering the classical binding energies of higher-charged Skyrmions. We use the rational map approximation for the Skyrmion of topological charge B=4, calculate the binding energy of the latter and estimate the systematic error in using this approximation. In the parameter space that we can explore within the rational map approximation, we find classical binding energies as low as 1.8% and once taking into account the contribution from spin-isospin quantization we obtain binding energies as low as 5.3%. We also calculate the contribution from the sixth-order derivative term to the electric charge density and axial coupling.
