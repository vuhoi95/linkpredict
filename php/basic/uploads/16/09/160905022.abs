Title: A double copy for ${\cal N}=2$ supergravity: a linearised tale told  on-shell
Authors: G. L. Cardoso and S. Nagy and Suresh Nampuri
Abstract: We construct the on-shell double copy for linearised four-dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ supergravity coupled to one vector multiplet with a quadratic prepotential. We apply this dictionary to the weak-field approximation of dyonic BPS black holes in this theory.
