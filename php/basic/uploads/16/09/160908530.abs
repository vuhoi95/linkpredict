Title: The Quantum Sine Gordon model in perturbative AQFT
Authors: Dorothea Bahns and Kasia Rejzner
Abstract: We study the Sine Gordon model in the framework of perturbative algebraic quantum field theory, without making use of a representation on Fock space. In particular, we calculate the vertex operator algebra braiding property. We prove that in the finite regime of the model, the vacuum expectation value of the Epstein Glaser S-matrix and the interacting current, both given as formal power series, converge in a suitable topology on the space of functionals.
