Abstract: D-brane inflationary models propose candidates for an inflaton embedded in the string theory. In these models, two distinct metrics/frames are naturally introduced, brane and bulk metrics/frames, which are connected by a conformal$+$disformal transformation that depends on the inflaton and its derivatives. It has been shown that physical observables, such as curvature perturbations, that are generated by the inflaton are identical in both frames. However, in the case of curvaton scenarios, the results differ depending on the frames to which the curvaton minimally couples. We examine two models, a slow-roll inflation with an inflection point potential and a model of a rapidly rolling inflaton that conformally couples to gravity. In the first model, the difference between the frames in which the curvaton resides is encoded in the spectral index of the curvature perturbations, depicting the nature of the frame transformation. In the second model, the curvaton on the brane induces a spectral index significantly different from that in the bulk and is even falsified by the observations. This work thus demonstrates that two frames connected by a conformal/disformal transformation are distinguishable in curvaton models.
