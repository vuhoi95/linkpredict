Title: Black holes with constant topological Euler density
Authors: Pedro Bargue√±o and Elias C. Vagenas
Abstract: A class of four dimensional spherically symmetric and static geometries with constant topological Euler density is studied. These geometries are shown to solve the coupled Einstein-Maxwell system when non-linear Born-Infeld-like electrodynamics is employed.
