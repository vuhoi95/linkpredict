Title: Sneutrino driven GUT Inflation in Supergravity
Authors: Tomas E. Gonzalo and Lucien Heurtier and Ahmad Moursy
Abstract: In this paper, we embed the model of flipped GUT sneutrino inflation -in a flipped SU(5) or SO(10) set up- developed by Ellis et al. in a supergravity framework. The GUT symmetry is broken by a waterfall which could happen at early or late stage of the inflationary period. The full field dynamics is thus studied in detail and these two main inflationary configurations are exposed, whose cosmological predictions are both in agreement with recent astrophysical measurements. The model has an interesting feature where the inflaton has natural decay channels to the MSSM particles allowed by the GUT gauge symmetry. Hence it can account for the reheating after the inflationary epoch.
