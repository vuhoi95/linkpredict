Title: Gravity and non-locality
Authors: Pablo Diaz and Saurya Das and Mark Walton
Abstract: With the aim of investigating the relation between gravity and non-locality at the classical level, we study a bilocal scalar field model. Bilocality introduces new (internal) degrees of freedom that seem to reproduce gravity. We show that the equations of motion of the massless branch of the free bilocal model match those of linearized gravity. We also discuss higher orders of perturbation theory, where there is self-interaction in both gravity and the bilocal field sectors.
