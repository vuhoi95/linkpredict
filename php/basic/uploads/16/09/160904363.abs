Authors: Sergei Gukov and Chiu-Chu Melissa Liu and Artan Sheshmani and Shing-Tung Yau
Abstract: We study the web of dualities relating various enumerative invariants, notably Gromov-Witten invariants and invariants that arise in topological gauge theory. In particular, we study Donaldson-Thomas gauge theory and its reductions to D=4 and D=2 which are relevant to the local theory of surfaces in Calabi-Yau threefolds.
