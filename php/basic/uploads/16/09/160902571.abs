Abstract: We, in the present paper, investigate the formation and evolution of primordial black hole (PBH) within the scenario of nonsingular bouncing cosmology. We first analyze the PBH formation during the phase of matter contraction, which is different from that in an expanding background, and then evaluate the PBH abundance at the end of the contracting phase. Our result shows that it is generally small unless the energy scale parameter associated with the bouncing phase is as high as the Planck scale, i.e., $|H_{-}|\gtrsim M_p$, or the sound speed parameter of cosmological perturbations is sufficiently small, which implies, $c_s \ll 1$. Afterwards, we study the subsequent evolution of generating PBHs during the bouncing phase. For the PBH growth ignoring the Hawking radiation, a relation upon model parameters of the bouncing phase $\Upsilon \geq c_s^2 \pi^2 H^2_{-}$ is expected to be satisfied, in case that PBHs would grow to infinity before the bouncing point. We also calculate the back-reaction of PBHs in order to theoretically constrain bounce cosmologies by considering the effects of both PBH growth and the associated Hawking radiation. The constraint is in accordance to the relation $\Upsilon \geq c_s^2 \pi^2 H^2_{-}$ for the bounce cosmology with a relatively low energy scale $H_{-}^2 \ll 10^9 c_s^5 M_p^2$.
