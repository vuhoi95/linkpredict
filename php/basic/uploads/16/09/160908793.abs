Title: Non-renormalization theorem in a lattice supersymmetric theory and the  cyclic Leibniz rule
Authors: Mitsuhiro Kato and Makoto Sakamoto and Hiroto So
Abstract: N=4 supersymmetric quantum mechanical model is formulated on the lattice. Two supercharges, among four, are exactly conserved with the help of the cyclic Leibniz rule without spoiling the locality. In use of the cohomological argument, any possible local terms of the effective action are classified into two categories which we call type-I and type-II, analogous to the D- and F-terms in the supersymmetric field theories. We prove non-renormalization theorem on the type-II terms which include mass and interaction terms with keeping a lattice constant finite, while type-I terms such as the kinetic terms have nontrivial quantum corrections.
