Authors: Sayuri Singh and George F. R. Ellis and Rituparno Goswami and Sunil D. Maharaj
Abstract: We establish the existence and find the necessary and sufficient conditions for a new class of solutions of Locally Rotationally Symmetric spacetimes that have non vanishing rotation and spatial twist simultaneously. We transparently show that the existence of such solutions demand non vanishing and bounded heat flux and these solutions are self similar. We provide a brief algorithm indicating how to solve the system of field equations with the given Cauchy data on an initial spacelike Cauchy surface. Finally we argue that these solutions can be used as a first approximation from spherical symmetry to study rotating, inhomogeneous, dynamic and radiating astrophysical stars.
