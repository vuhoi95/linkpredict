Title: Revisit to Thermodynamic Relations in the AdS/CMT Models
Authors: Seungjoon Hyun and Sang-A Park and Sang-Heon Yi
Abstract: Motivated by the recent unified approach to the Smarr-like relation of AdS planar black holes in conjunction with the quasi-local formalism on conserved charges, we revisit the quantum statistical and thermodynamic relations of hairy AdS planar black holes. By extending the previous results, we identify the hairy contribution in the bulk and show that the holographic computation can be improved so that it is consistent with the bulk computation. We argue that the first law can be retained in its universal form while the relation between the on-shell renormalized Euclidean action and its free energy interpretation in gravity may be deformed to contain the hairy contribution in hairy AdS black holes.
