Title: Photon polarization tensor in a magnetized plasma system
Authors: Jingyi Chao and Mei Huang
Abstract: We investigate the photon polarization tensor at finite temperature in the presence of a static and homogeneous external magnetic field. In our scheme, the Matsubara frequency summation is performed after Poisson summation, which will be taken easily and convergent quickly in the frame of proper time representation. Moreover, the dependence of Landau levels is expressed explicitly. It demonstrates the convergence of summing Landau levels as it has to be. Consequently, there is no necessary to truncate the Landau level in a numerical estimation. At zero temperature, the Lowest Landau Level (LLL) approximation is analytically satisfied for the imaginary parts of the vacuum photon polarization tensor. Our results examine that, the LLL approximation is not enough for the thermal photon polarization tensor, it gains the contribution not only from the lowest Landau level but also up to the finite-$n$ levels. Such large imaginary ones only show up at finite temperatures, which is the so called Landau damping. It originates from the absorption of soft fields by hard plasma constituents, which is a universal feature of plasma systems. Finally, it was argued that the summation of Matsubara frequency is not commuted with Landau level ones, such conjecture is excluded in our calculations.
