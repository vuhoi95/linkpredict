Abstract: We explore a contact point between two distinct approaches to the confinment problem. We show that BLG-ABJM like theories generate gauge propagators with just the complex pole structure prescribed by the Gribov scenario for confinemnt. This structure, known as i-particles in Gribov-Zwanziger theories, effectively allows the definition of composite operators with a positive K\"{a}ll\'{e}n-Lehmann spectral representation for their two-point functions . Then, these operators satisfy the criteria to describe glue-ball condensates. We calculate the (first order) contribution to the two-point function of the gauge invariant condensate in an ABJM environment, showing its interpretation as a physical particle along K\"{a}ll\'{e}n-Lehmann. In the meantime, we argue for the necessity of absorbing Witten's work on holomorphic complex theories in order to settle the physical interpretation of this non-perturbative scenario.
