Abstract: We investigate a 6d Dirac fermion on a rectangle. It is found that the 4d spectrum is governed by $N = 2$ supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Then we demonstrate that the supersymmetry is very useful to classify all allowed boundary conditions and to expand the 6d Dirac field in Kaluza-Klein modes. A striking feature of the model is that even though the 6d Dirac fermion has non-vanishing bulk mass, the 4d mass spectrum can contain degenerate massless chiral fermions, which may provide a hint to solve the generation problem of the quarks and leptons. It is pointed out that zero energy solutions are not affected by the presence of the boundaries, while the boundary conditions work well for determining the positive energy solutions.
