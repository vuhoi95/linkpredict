Abstract: We consider localized soliton-like solutions in the presence of a stable scalar condensate background. By the analogy with classical mechanics, it can be shown that there may exist solutions of the nonlinear equations of motion that describe dips or rises in the spatially-uniform charge distribution. We also present explicit analytical solutions for some of such objects and examine their properties.
