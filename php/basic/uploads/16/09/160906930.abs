Title: Spectra of Certain Holographic ABJM Wilson Loops in Higher Rank  Representations
Authors: Wolfgang MÃ¼ck and Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas and Vimal Rathee
Abstract: The holographic configurations dual to Wilson loops in higher rank representations in the ABJM theory are described by branes with electric flux along their world volumes. In particular, D2 and D6 branes with electric flux play a central role as potential dual to totally symmetric and totally antisymmetric representations, respectively. We compute the spectra of excitations of these brane configurations in both, the bosonic and fermionic sectors. We highlight a number of aspects that distinguish these configurations from their D3 and D5 cousins including new peculiar mixing terms in the fluctuations. We neatly organize the spectrum of fluctuations into the corresponding supermultiplets.
