Title: An inhomogeneous Lax representation for the Hirota equation
Authors: Davide Fioravanti and Rafael I. Nepomechie
Abstract: Motivated by recent work on quantum integrable models without U(1) symmetry, we show that the sl(2) Hirota equation admits a Lax representation with inhomogeneous terms. The compatibility of the auxiliary linear problem leads to a new consistent family of Hirota-like equations.
