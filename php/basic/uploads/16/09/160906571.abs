Abstract: The main purpose of the present paper is analyzing magnetic brane solutions of cubic quasi-topological gravity in the presence of a linear electromagnetic Maxwell field and a nonlinear electromagnetic Born-Infeld field. We show that, the mentioned magnetic solutions have no curvature singularity and also no horizons, but we observe that there is a conic geometry with a related deficit angle. We obtain the metric function and deficit angle and consider the behavior of them. We show that the attributes of our solution are dependent of cubic quasi-topological coefficient and the GB parameter.
