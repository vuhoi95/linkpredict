Title: Motion of charged particle in Reissner - Nordstr√∂m spacetime: A Jacobi  metric approach
Authors: Praloy Das and Ripon Sk and Subir Ghosh
Abstract: The present work discusses motion of neutral and charged particles in Reissner - Nordstr\"{o}m spacetime. The constant energy paths are derived in a variational principle framework using the Jacobi metric which is parameterized by conserved particle energy. Of particular interest is the case of particle charge and Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole charge being of same sign since this leads to a clash of opposing forces - gravitational (attractive) and Coulomb (repulsive).
