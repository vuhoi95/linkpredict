Title: Exact Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula for the contact Heisenberg  algebra
Authors: Alessandro Bravetti and Angel Garcia-Chung and Diego Tapias
Abstract: In this work we introduce the contact Heisenberg algebra which is the restriction of the Jacobi algebra on contact manifolds to the linear and constant functions. We give the exact expression of its corresponding Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. We argue that this result is relevant to the quantization of contact systems.
