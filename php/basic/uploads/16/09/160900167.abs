Abstract: The axial-vector form factor of the nucleons is considered in the framework of hard-wall model of holographic QCD. A new interaction term between the bulk gauge and matter fields was included into the interaction Lagrangian. We obtain the axial-vector form factor of nucleons in the boundary QCD from the bulk action using AdS/CFT correspondence. The momentum square dependence of the axial-vector form factor is analysed numerically.
