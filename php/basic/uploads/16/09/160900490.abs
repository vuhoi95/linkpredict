Title: SU(2|2) supersymmetric mechanics
Authors: Evgeny Ivanov and Olaf Lechtenfeld and Stepan Sidorov
Abstract: We introduce a new kind of non-relativistic ${\cal N}{=}\,8$ supersymmetric mechanics, associated with worldline realizations of the supergroup $SU(2|2)$ treated as a deformation of flat ${\cal N}{=}\,8$, $d{=}1$ supersymmetry. Various worldline $SU(2|2)$ superspaces are constructed as coset manifolds of this supergroup, and the corresponding superfield techniques are developed. For the off-shell $SU(2|2)$ multiplets $({\bf 3,8,5})$, $({\bf 4,8,4})$ and $({\bf 5,8,3})$, we construct and analyze the most general superfield and component actions. Common features are mass oscillator-type terms proportional to the deformation parameter and a trigonometric realization of the superconformal group $OSp(4^*|4)$ in the conformal cases. For the simplest $({\bf 5, 8, 3})$ model the quantization is performed.
