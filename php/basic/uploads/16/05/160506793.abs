Title: Multimetric Supergravities
Authors: F. Del Monte and D. Francia and P. A. Grassi
Abstract: Making use of integral forms and superfield techniques we propose supersymmetric extensions of the multimetric gravity Lagrangians in dimensions one, two, three and four. The supersymmetric interaction potential covariantly deforms the bosonic one, producing in particular suitable super-symmetric polynomials generated by the Berezinian. As an additional application of our formalism we construct supersymmetric multi-Maxwell theories in dimensions three and four.
