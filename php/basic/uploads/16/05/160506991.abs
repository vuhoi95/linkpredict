Title: A duality web of linear quivers
Authors: Frederic Br√ºnner and Vyacheslav P. Spiridonov
Abstract: We show that applying the Bailey lemma to elliptic hypergeometric integrals on the $A_n$ root system leads to a large web of dualities for $\mathcal{N} = 1$ supersymmetric linear quiver theories. The superconformal index of Seiberg's SQCD with $SU(N_c)$ gauge group and $SU(N_f)\times SU(N_f)\times U(1)$ flavour symmetry is equal to that of $N_f-N_c-1$ distinct linear quivers. Seiberg duality further enlarges this web by adding new quivers. In particular, both interacting electric and magnetic theories with arbitrary $N_c$ and $N_f$ can be constructed by quivering an $s$-confining theory with $N_f=N_c+1$.
