Title: Topologically Twisted SUSY Gauge Theory, Gauge-Bethe Correspondence and  Quantum Cohomology
Authors: Hee-Joong Chung and Yutaka Yoshida
Abstract: We calculate partition function and correlation functions in A-twisted 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ theories and topologically twisted 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories containing adjoint chiral multiplet with particular choices of $R$-charges and the magnetic fluxes for flavor symmetries. According to Gauge-Bethe correspondence, they correspond to Heisenberg XXX and XXZ spin chain models. We identify the partition function as the inverse of the norm of the Bethe eigenstates. Correlation functions are identified as the coefficients of the expectation value of Baxter $Q$-operators. In addition, we consider correlation functions of 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)^*$ theory and their relation to equivariant quantum cohomology and equivariant integration of cotangent bundle of Grassmann manifolds. Also, we study the ring relations of supersymmetric Wilson loops in 3d $\mathcal{N}=2^*$ theory and Bethe subalgebra of XXZ spin chain model.
