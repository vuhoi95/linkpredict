Title: Cosmological Constant, Fine Structure Constant and Beyond

Abstract: In this work, we consider the cosmological constant model $\Lambda\propto\alpha^{-6}$, which is well motivated from three independent approaches. As is well known, the evidence of varying fine structure constant $\alpha$ was found in 1998. If $\Lambda\propto\alpha^{-6}$ is right, it means that the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ should be also varying. In this work, we try to develop a suitable framework to model this varying cosmological constant $\Lambda\propto\alpha^{-6}$, in which we view it from an interacting vacuum energy perspective. We propose two types of models to describe the evolutions of $\Lambda$ and $\alpha$. Then, we consider the observational constraints on these models, by using the 293 $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ data from the absorption systems in the spectra of distant quasars, and the data of type Ia supernovae (SNIa), cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO). We find that the model parameters can be tightly constrained to the narrow ranges of ${\cal O}(10^{-5})$ typically. In particular, 3 of 4 models considered in this work favor the varying $\Lambda$ and $\alpha$, while $\Lambda$CDM model and $\alpha=const.$ deviate from the best fit beyond $2\sigma$ or at least $1\sigma$. On the other hand, we can also view the varying cosmological constant model $\Lambda\propto\alpha^{-6}$ from another perspective, namely it can be equivalent to a model containing "dark energy" (whose equation-of-state parameter (EoS) $w_{de}\not=-1$) and "warm dark matter" (whose EoS $w_{dm}\not=0$), but there is no interaction between them. We derive the effective EoS of "warm dark matter" and "dark energy", and find that they are fully consistent with the observational constraints on warm dark matter. We consider that the varying cosmological constant model $\Lambda\propto\alpha^{-6}$ is viable and deserves further studies.
