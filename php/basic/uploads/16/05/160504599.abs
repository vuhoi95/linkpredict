Title: Modified teleparallel gravity with higher-derivative torsion terms
Authors: Giovanni Otalora and Emmanuel N. Saridakis
Abstract: We construct $F(T,\left(\nabla{T}\right)^2,\Box {T})$ gravitational modifications, which are novel classes of modified theories arising from higher-derivative torsional terms in the action, and are different than their curvature analogue. Applying them in a cosmological framework we obtain an effective dark energy sector that comprises of the novel torsional contributions. We perform a detailed dynamical analysis for two specific examples, extracting the stable late-time solutions and calculating the corresponding observables. We show that the thermal history of the universe can be reproduced, and it can result in a dark-energy dominated, accelerating universe, where the dark-energy equation-of-state parameter lies in the quintessence regime, or may exhibit the phantom-divide crossing during the cosmological evolution. Finally, the scale factor behaves asymptotically either as a power-law or as an exponential, in agreement with observations.
