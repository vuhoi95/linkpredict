Authors: O. F. Dayi and E. Kilincarslan and E. Yunt
Abstract: Semiclassical kinetic theory of Dirac particles in the presence of external electromagnetic fields and global rotation is established. To provide the Hamiltonian formulation of Dirac particles a symplectic two-form which is a matrix in spin indices is proposed. The particle number and current densities for the Dirac particles are acquired in the helicity basis. Following a similar procedure, semiclassical kinetic theory of the Weyl particles is accomplished. It is shown that phase space dynamics of the Weyl and Dirac particles are directly linked and their continuity equations with source terms are derived. The anomalies and anomalous chiral effects due to the external electromagnetic fields and angular velocity of the frame are calculated.
