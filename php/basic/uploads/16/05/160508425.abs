Title: Form Invariance, Topological Fluctuations and Mass Gap of Yang-Mills  Theory
Authors: Yachao Qian and Jun Nian
Abstract: In order to have a new perspective on the long-standing problem of the mass gap in Yang-Mills theory, we study the quantum Yang-Mills theory in the presence of topologically nontrivial backgrounds in this paper. The topologically stable gauge fields are constrained by the form invariance condition and the topological properties. Obeying these constraints, the known classical solutions to the Yang-Mills equation in the 3- and 4-dimensional Euclidean spaces are recovered, and the other allowed configurations form the nontrivial topological fluctuations at quantum level. Together, they constitute the background configurations, upon which the quantum Yang-Mills theory can be constructed. We demonstrate that the theory mimics the Higgs mechanism in a certain limit and develops a mass gap at semi-classical level on a flat space with finite size or on a sphere.
