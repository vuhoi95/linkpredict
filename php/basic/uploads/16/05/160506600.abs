Title: Non-local form factors for curved-space antisymmetric fields
Authors: Tiberio de Paula Netto and Ilya L. Shapiro
Abstract: In the recent paper Buchbinder, Kirillova and Pletnev presented formal arguments concerning quantum equivalence of free massive antisymmetric tensor fields of second and third rank to the free Proca theory and massive scalar field with minimal coupling to gravity, respectively. We confirm this result using explicit covariant calculations of non-local form factors based on the heart-kernel technique, and discuss the discontinuity of quantum contributions in the massless limit.
