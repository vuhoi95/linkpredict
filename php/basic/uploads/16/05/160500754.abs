Title: General quantum-mechanical setting for field-antifield formalism as a  hyper-gauge theory
Authors: Igor A. Batalin and Peter M. Lavrov
Abstract: A general quantum-mechanical setting is proposed for the field-antifield formalism as a unique hyper-gauge theory in the field-antifield space. We formulate a Schr\"odinger-type equation to describe the quantum evolution in a "current time" purely formal in its nature. The corresponding Hamiltonian is defined in the form of a supercommutator of the delta-operator with a hyper-gauge Fermion. The initial wave function is restricted to be annihilated with the delta-operator. The Schr\"odinger's equation is resolved in a closed form of the path integral, whose action contains the symmetric Weyl's symbol of the Hamiltonian. We take the path integral explicitly in the case of being a hyper-gauge Fermion an arbitrary function rather than an operator.
