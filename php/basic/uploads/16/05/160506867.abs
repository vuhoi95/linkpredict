Title: Toda chain from the kink-antikink lattice
Authors: Song He and Yunguo Jiang and Jiazhen Liu
Abstract: In this paper, we have studied the kink and antikink solutions in several neutral scalar models in 1+1 dimension. We follow the standard approach to write down the leading order and the second order force between long distance separated kink and antikink. The leading order force is proportional to exponential decay with respect to the distance between the two nearest kinks or antikinks. The second order force have a similar behavior with the larger decay factor, namely $3\over 2$. We make use of these properties to construct the kink lattice. The dynamics of the kink lattice with leading order force can be identified as ordinary nonperiodic Toda lattice. Also the periodic Toda lattice can be obtained when the number of kink lattice is even. The system of kink lattice with force up to the next order corresponds to a new specific deformation of Toda lattice system. There is no well study on this deformation in the integrable literatures.We found that the deformed Toda system are near integrable system, since the integrability are hindered by high order correction terms. Our work provides a effective theory for kink interactions and a new near or quasi integrable model.
