Title: Local Calabi-Yau manifolds of affine type A and open Yau-Zaslow formula  via SYZ mirror symmetry
Authors: Atsushi Kanazawa and Siu-Cheong Lau
Abstract: We construct SYZ mirrors of the local Calabi-Yau manifolds of affine type A by developing an equivariant SYZ theory for the toric Calabi-Yau manifolds of infinite-type. The equations for the SYZ mirrors involve the Riemann theta functions and generating functions of the open Gromov-Witten invariants. We obtain explicit formulae for the generating functions which are open analogs of the Yau-Zaslow formula in dimension 2, and show that they have nice modular properties. We also relate the SYZ pairs with mirror symmetry for the abelian varieties and hypersurfaces therein.
