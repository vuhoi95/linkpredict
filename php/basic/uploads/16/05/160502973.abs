Title: Comments on interactions in the SUSY models
Authors: Sudhaker Upadhyay and Alexander Reshetnyak and Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: We consider special supersymmetry (SUSY) transformations with $m$ generators $\overleftarrow{s}_{\alpha }$ for a certain class of models and study some physical consequences of Grassmann-odd transformations which form an Abelian supergroup with finite parameters and respective group-like elements being functionals of field variables. The SUSY-invariant path integral measure within conventional quantization implies the appearance, under a change of variables related to such SUSY transformations, of a Jacobian which is explicitly calculated. The Jacobian implies, first of all, the appearance of trivial interactions in the transformed action, and, second, the presence of a modified Ward identity which reduces to the standard Ward identities in the case of constant parameters. We examine the case of ${N}=1$ and $N=2$ supersymmetric harmonic oscillators to illustrate the general concept by a simple free model with $(1,1)$ physical degrees of freedom. It is shown that the interaction terms $U_{tr}$ have a corresponding SUSY-exact form: $U_{tr}=% \big(V_{(1)}\overleftarrow{s};V_{(2)}\overleftarrow{\bar{s}}\overleftarrow{s}% \big)$ naturally generated in this generalized formulation. We argue that the case of non-trivial interactions cannot be obtained in such a way.
