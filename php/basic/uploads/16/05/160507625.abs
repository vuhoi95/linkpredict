Title: Hairy black holes in the general Skyrme model
Authors: C. Adam and O. Kichakova and Ya. Shnir and A. Wereszczynski
Abstract: We study the existence of hairy black holes in the generalized Einstein-Skyrme model. It is proven that in the BPS model limit there are no hairy black hole solutions, although the model admits gravitating (and flat space) solitons. Furthermore, we find strong evidence that a necessary condition for the existence of black holes with Skyrmionic hair is the inclusion of the Skyrme term $\mathcal{L}_4$. As an example, we show that there are no hairy black holes in the $\mathcal{L}_2+\mathcal{L}_6+\mathcal{L}_0$ model and present a new kind of black hole solutions with compact Skyrmion hair in the $\mathcal{L}_4+\mathcal{L}_6+\mathcal{L}_0$ model.
