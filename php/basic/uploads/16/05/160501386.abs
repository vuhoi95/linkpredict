Title: Composite operators and form factors in N=4 SYM
Authors: Dmitry Chicherin and Emery Sokatchev
Abstract: We construct the most general composite operators of N = 4 SYM in Lorentz harmonic chiral ($\approx$ twistor) superspace. The operators are built from the SYM supercurvature which is nonpolynomial in the chiral gauge prepotentials. We reconstruct the full nonchiral dependence of the supercurvature. We compute all tree-level MHV form factors via the LSZ redcution procedure with on-shell states made of the same supercurvature.
