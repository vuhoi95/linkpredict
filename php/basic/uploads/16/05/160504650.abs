Title: Higher-order theories from the minimal length
Authors: Marco Dias and Julio M. Hoff da Silva and Eslley Scatena
Abstract: We show that the introduction of a minimal length in the context of non-commutative spacetime gives rise (after some considerations) to higher-order theories. We then explicitly demonstrate how these higher-derivative theories appear as a generalization of the standard electromagnetism and general relativity by applying a consistent procedure that modifies the original Maxwell and Einstein-Hilbert actions. In order to set a bound on the minimal length, we compare the deviations from the inverse-square law with the potentials obtained in the higher-order theories and discuss the validity of the results. The introduction of a quantum bound for the minimal length parameter $\sqrt{\beta}$ in the higher-order QED allows us to lower the actual limits on the parameters of higher-derivative gravity by almost half of their order of magnitude.
