Title: Criteria for resolving the cosmological singularity in Infinite  Derivative Gravity
Authors: Aindri√∫ Conroy and Alexey S. Koshelev and Anupam Mazumdar
Abstract: Einstein's General theory of relativity permits space-time singularities, where null congruences \emph{focus} in the presence of matter, which satisfies an appropriate energy condition. In this paper, we argue that such a singularity may be avoided if two important criteria are satisfied: (1) An additional scalar degree of freedom, besides the massless graviton, must be introduced to the spacetime; and (2) An infinite-derivative extension is required in order to avoid tachyons or ghosts from the graviton propagator.
