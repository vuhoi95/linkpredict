Title: Dirac's Equation in $R$-Minkowski Spacetime
Authors: T. Foughali and A. Bouda
Abstract: We recently constructed the $R$-Poincar\'e algebra from an appropriate deformed Poisson brackets which reproduce the Fock coordinate transformation. We showed then that the spacetime of this transformation is the de Sitter one. In this paper, we derive in the $R$-Minkowski spacetime the Dirac equation and show that this is none other than the Dirac equation in the de Sitter spacetime given by its conformally flat metric. Furthermore, we propose a new approach for solving Dirac's equation in the de Sitter spacetime using the Schr\"{o}dinger picture.
