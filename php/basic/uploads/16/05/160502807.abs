Title: Scattering solutions of Bethe-Salpeter equation in Minkowski and  Euclidean spaces
Authors: J. Carbonell and V. A. Karmanov
Abstract: We shortly review different methods to obtain the scattering solutions of the Bethe-Salpeter equation in Minkowski space. We emphasize the possibility to obtain the zero energy observables in terms of the Euclidean scattering amplitude.
