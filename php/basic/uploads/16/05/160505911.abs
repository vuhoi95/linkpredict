Title: A particle-like description of Planckian black holes
Authors: Euro Spallucci and Anais Smailagic
Abstract: In this paper we abandon the idea that even a "quantum" black hole, of Planck size, can still be described as a classical, more or less complicated, geometry. Rather, we consider a genuine quantum mechanical approach where a Planckian black hole is, by all means, just another "particle", even if with a distinguishing property: its linear size increases with the energy. The horizon dynamics is equivalently described in terms of a particle moving in gravitational potential derived from the horizon equation itself in a self-consistent manner. The particle turning-points match the radius of the inner and outer horizons of a charged black hole. This classical model pave the way towards the wave equation for a truly quantum black hole. We compute the exact form of the wave function and determine the energy spectrum. Finally, we describe the classical limit in which the quantum picture correctly approaches the classical geometric formulation. We find that the quantum-to-classical transition occurs far above the Planck scale.
