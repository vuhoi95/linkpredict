Title: Galileon Radiation from a Spherical Collapsing Shell
Authors: Javier Martin-Garcia and Miguel A. Vazquez-Mozo
Abstract: Galileon radiation in the collapse of a thin spherical shell of matter is analyzed. In the framework of a cubic Galileon theory, we compute the field profile produced at large distances by a short collapse, finding that the radiated field has two peaks traveling ahead of light fronts. The total energy radiated during the collapse follows a power law scaling with the shell's physical width and results from two competing effects: a Vainshtein suppression of the emission and an enhancement due to the thinness of the shell.
