Title: Dynamics of Carroll Strings
Authors: Biel Cardona and Joaquim Gomis and Josep M Pons
Abstract: We construct the canonical action of a Carroll string doing the Carroll limit of a canonical relativistic string. We also study the Killing symmetries of the Carroll string, which close under an infinite dimensional algebra. The tensionless limit and the Carroll $p$-brane action are also discussed.
