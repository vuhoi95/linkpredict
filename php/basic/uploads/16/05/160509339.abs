Title: About the triviality of the higher derivative sector in the abelian  Lee-Wick model
Authors: D. Fiorentini and V. J. Vasquez Otoya
Abstract: Canonical quantization is reviewed here for the Abelian Lee-Wick model by using the Dirac constraints method. New degrees of freedom associated to the (higher derivatives) Lee-Wick ghost are excluded from the (physical) space of observables by a new prescription, based on the Nielsen-type BRST-extended symmetry for the Lee-Wick mass term. We prove that this prescription is nothing but an effective form of implementing the cohomological triviality of the higher-derivative pure sector associated to the existence of a new exclusive higher-derivative BRST symmetry.
