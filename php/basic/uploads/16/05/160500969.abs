Title: Schr√∂dinger-like quantum dynamics in loop quantized black holes
Authors: Rodolfo Gambini and Javier Olmedo and Jorge Pullin
Abstract: We show, following a previous quantization of a vacuum spherically symmetric spacetime carried out in Ref. \cite{gop}, that this setting admits a Schr\"odinger-like picture. More precisely, the technique adopted there for the definition of parametrized Dirac observables (that codify local information of the quantum theory) can be extended in order to accommodate different pictures. In this new picture, the quantum states are parametrized in terms of suitable gauge parameters and the observables constructed out of the kinematical ones on this space of parametrized states.
