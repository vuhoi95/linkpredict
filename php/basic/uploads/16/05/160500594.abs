Title: Lattice Gluon and Ghost Propagators, and the Strong Coupling in Pure  SU(3) Yang-Mills Theory: Finite Lattice Spacing and Volume Effects
Authors: Anthony G. Duarte and Orlando Oliveira and Paulo J. Silva
Abstract: The dependence of the Landau gauge two point gluon and ghost correlation functions on the lattice spacing and on the physical volume are investigated for pure SU(3) Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions using lattice simulations. We present data from very large lattices up to $128^4$ and for two lattice spacings $0.10$ fm and $0.06$ fm corresponding to volumes of $\sim$ (13 fm)$^4$ and $\sim$ (8 fm)$^4$, respectively. Our results show that, for sufficiently large physical volumes, both propagators have a mild dependence on the lattice volume. On the other hand, the gluon and ghost propagators change with the lattice spacing $a$ in the infrared region, with the gluon propagator having a stronger dependence on $a$ compared to the ghost propagator. In what concerns the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s (p^2)$, as defined from gluon and ghost two point functions, the simulations show a sizeable dependence on the lattice spacing for the infrared region and for momenta up to $\sim 1$ GeV.
