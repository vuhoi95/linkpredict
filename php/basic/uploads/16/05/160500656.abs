Abstract: We construct the five-dimensional supergravity dual of the $\mathcal{N}=1^*$ mass deformation of the $\mathcal{N} =4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on $S^4$ and use it to calculate the universal contribution to the corresponding $S^4$ free energy at large 't Hooft coupling in the planar limit. The holographic RG flow solutions are smooth and preserve four supercharges. As a novel feature compared to the holographic duals of $\mathcal{N} = 1^*$ on $\mathbb{R}^4$, in our backgrounds the five-dimensional dilaton has a non-trivial profile, and the gaugino condensate is fixed in terms of the mass-deformation parameters. Important aspects of the analysis involve characterizing the ambiguities in the partition function of non-conformal $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric theories on $S^4$ as well as the action of S-duality on the $\mathcal{N}=1^*$ theory.
