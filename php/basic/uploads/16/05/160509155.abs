Title: A stable vacuum monopole condensate in QCD
Authors: Youngman Kim and Bum-Hoon Lee and D. G. Pak and Takuya Tsukioka
Abstract: A stationary finite energy density monopole solution in a pure SU(3) quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is proposed. The solution describes a colored Wu-Yang monopole dressed in gluon field. We have proved that such a classical solution corresponds to a stable vacuum monopole condensate in quantum theory. The generation of a mass gap and QCD vacuum structure are discussed.
