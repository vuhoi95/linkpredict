Title: Q-balls in the Wick-Cutkosky model
Authors: E. Ya. Nugaev and M. N. Smolyakov
Abstract: In the present paper Q-ball solutions in the Wick-Cutkosky model are examined in detail. A remarkable feature of the Wick-Cutkosky model is that it admits analytical treatment for the most part of the analysis of Q-balls. An attempt is made to describe Q-balls as bound states of scalar particles.
