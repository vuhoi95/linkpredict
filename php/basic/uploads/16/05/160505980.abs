Abstract: Much effort has been devoted into understanding the quantum mechanical properties of gravitational interactions. Here we explore the recent suggestion that gravitational interactions are a fundamental classical channel that is described by continuous quantum measurements and feedforward (CQMF). Specifically, we investigate the possibility that some properties of our universe, modeled using a Friedman-Robertson-Walker metric, can emerge from CQMF by introducing an underlying quantum system for the dynamical variables, avoiding well known difficulties in trying to quantize the spacetime itself. We show that the quantum decoherence necessary in such a measurement model manifests itself as a dark energy fluid that fills the spacetime and whose equation of state asymptotically oscillates around the value $w=-1/3$, regardless of the spatial curvature, which provides the bound between accelerating and decelerating expanding FRW cosmologies.
