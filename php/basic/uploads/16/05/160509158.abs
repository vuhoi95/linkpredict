Title: On the Study of Non-Relativistic Spin Half-Integer Systems
Authors: Hadi Sobhani and Hassan Hassanabadi
Abstract: In this article, after introducing appropriate equation for non-relativistic spin half-integer system, Lagrange density of such system has been derived. Then time-evolution of this system in presence of a time-dependent interaction has been done
