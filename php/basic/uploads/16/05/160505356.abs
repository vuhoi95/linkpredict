Title: Squeezed vacua in loop quantum gravity
Authors: Eugenio Bianchi and Jonathan Guglielmon and Lucas Hackl and Nelson Yokomizo
Abstract: We introduce squeezed vacua in loop quantum gravity, a new overcomplete basis of states that contain prescribable correlations between geometric operators. We study the behavior of long-range correlations and discuss the relevance of these states for the reconstruction of a semiclassical spacetime from loop quantum gravity.
