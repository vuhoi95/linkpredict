Title: Quantum-to-classical transition and imprints of wavefunction collapse in  bouncing universes
Authors: D. Jaffino Stargen and V. Sreenath
Abstract: Quantum perturbations produced in the early universe are a result of an interplay of quantum field theory and gravitation. Since these perturbations lead to anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background and then to inhomogeneities in the Large Scale Structure (LSS), this provides a unique opportunity to probe issues which are fundamental to our understanding of quantum physics and gravitation. One such fundamental issue is how exactly does the quantum perturbations produce something as classical as LSS. In other words, how does the quantum perturbations produced in the early universe turn classical as the universe evolves. In this work, we study certain aspects of this question in the context of tensor perturbations produced in bouncing universes. We investigate this issue mainly from two perspectives. Firstly, we approach this issue by studying the squeezing of a quantum state corresponding to the tensor perturbations using the Wigner function. Secondly, we analyze this issue from the perspective of the quantum measurement problem. In particular, we study the effects of wave function collapse, using a phenomenological model known as continuous spontaneous localization, on the tensor power spectra. We conclude with a discussion of results.
