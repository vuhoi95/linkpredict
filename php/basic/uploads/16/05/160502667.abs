Title: Unimodular Trees versus Einstein Trees
Authors: Enrique Alvarez and Sergio Gonzalez-Martin and Carmelo P. Martin
Abstract: The maximally helicity violating (MHV) tree level scattering amplitudes involving three, four or five gravitons are worked out in Unimodular Gravity. They are found to coincide with the corresponding amplitudes in General Relativity. This a remarkable result, insofar as both the propagators and the vertices are quite different in both theories.
