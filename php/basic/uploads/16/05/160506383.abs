Title: Generalized geometric vacua with eight supercharges
Authors: Mariana Gra√±a and Praxitelis Ntokos
Abstract: We investigate compactifications of type II and M-theory down to $AdS_5$ with generic fluxes that preserve eight supercharges, in the framework of Exceptional Generalized Geometry. The geometric data and gauge fields on the internal manifold are encoded in a pair of generalized structures corresponding to the vector and hyper-multiplets of the reduced five-dimensional supergravity. Supersymmetry translates into integrability conditions for these structures, generalizing, in the case of type IIB, the Sasaki-Einstein conditions. We show that the ten and eleven-dimensional type IIB and M-theory Killing-spinor equations specialized to a warped $AdS_5$ background imply the generalized integrability conditions.
