Title: Aharonov-Bohm phases and Dynamical Casimir Effect in a quantum LC  circuit
Authors: Yuan Yao and Ariel R. Zhitnitsky
Abstract: We study novel types of contributions to the partition function of the Maxwell system defined on a small compact manifold ${\mathbb{M}}$ with nontrivial mappings $\pi_1[U(1)]\cong\mathbb{Z}$. These novel contributions cannot be described in terms of conventional physical propagating photons with two transverse polarizations, and instead emerge as a result of tunneling transitions between topologically different but physically identical vacuum winding states. These new terms give an extra contribution to the Casimir pressure, yet to be measured. We argue that if the same system is considered in the background of a small external time-dependent E\&M field, then real physical photons will be emitted from the vacuum, similar to the dynamical Casimir effect (DCE) where photons are radiated from the vacuum due to time-dependent boundary conditions. We propose an experimental realization of such small effects using a microwave cavity. We also comment on the possible cosmological implications of this effect.
