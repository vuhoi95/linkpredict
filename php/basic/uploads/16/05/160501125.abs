Title: Barbero's formulation from a $BF$-type action with the Immirzi parameter
Authors: Mariano Celada and Merced Montesinos and Jorge Romero
Abstract: Starting from a constrained real $BF$-type action for general relativity that includes both the Immirzi parameter and the cosmological constant, we obtain the Ashtekar-Barbero variables used in the canonical approach to the quantization of the gravitational field. This is accomplished by explicitly solving the second-class constraints resulting from the Hamiltonian analysis of the considered action, and later imposing the time gauge. All throughout this work the tetrad formalism is left aside, obtaining the Ashtekar-Barbero variables entirely in terms of the $B$-fields that define the action.
