Title: On jordanian deformations of AdS_5 and supergravity
Authors: Ben Hoare and Stijn J. van Tongeren
Abstract: We consider various homogeneous Yang-Baxter deformations of the AdS_5 x S^5 superstring that can be obtained from the eta-deformed superstring and related models by singular boosts. The jordanian deformations we obtain in this way behave similarly to the eta-deformed model with regard to supergravity: T dualizing the classical sigma model it is possible to find corresponding solutions of supergravity, which, however, have dilatons that prevent T dualizing back. Hence the backgrounds of these jordanian deformations are not solutions of supergravity. Still, they do satisfy a set of recently found modified supergravity equations which implies that the corresponding sigma models are scale invariant. The abelian models that we obtain by singular boosts do directly correspond to solutions of supergravity. In addition to our main results we consider contraction limits of our main example, which do correspond to supergravity solutions.
