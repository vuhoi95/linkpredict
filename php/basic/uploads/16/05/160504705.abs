Title: The Dual Formulation of M5-brane Action
Authors: Sheng-Lan Ko and Pichet Vanichchapongjaroen
Abstract: We construct a dual formulation, with respect to the conventional PST formalism, of the M5-brane action propagating in a generic 11d supergravity background. Constraint analysis is performed to further justify that our theory has the correct number of degrees of freedom. Comparison of this action with the existing M5-brane actions is carried out. We also show that a conventional D4-brane action is obtained upon double dimensional reduction.
