Title: Heat kernel for Newton-Cartan trace anomalies
Authors: Roberto Auzzi and Giuseppe Nardelli
Abstract: We compute the leading part of the trace anomaly for a free non-relativistic scalar in 2+1 dimensions coupled to a background Newton-Cartan metric. The anomaly is proportional to 1/m, where m is the mass of the scalar. We comment on the implications of a conjectured a-theorem for non-relativistic theories with boost invariance.
