Title: On the Light dilaton in the Large N Tri-critical O(N) Model
Authors: Hamid Omid and Gordon W. Semenoff and L. C. R. Wijewardhana
Abstract: The leading order of the large N limit of the O(N) symmetric phi-six theory in three dimensions has a phase which exhibits spontaneous breaking of scale symmetry accompanied by a massless dilaton which is a Goldstone boson. At the next-to-leading order in large N, the phi-six coupling has a beta function of order 1/N and it is expected that the dilaton acquires a small mass, proportional to the beta function and the condensate. In this note, we show that this "light dilaton" is actually a tachyon. This indicates an instability of the phase of the theory with spontaneously broken approximate scale invariance.
