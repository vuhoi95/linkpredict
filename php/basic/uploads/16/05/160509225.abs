Title: Eigenstate Gibbs Ensemble in Integrable Quantum Systems
Authors: Sourav Nandy and Arnab Sen and Arnab Das and Abhishek Dhar
Abstract: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis implies that for a thermodynamically large system in one of its eigenstates, the reduced density matrix describing any finite subsystem is determined solely by a set of {\it relevant} conserved quantities. In a generic system, only the energy plays that role and hence eigenstates appear locally thermal. Integrable systems, on the other hand, possess an extensive number of such conserved quantities and hence the reduced density matrix requires specification of an infinite number of parameters (Generalized Gibbs Ensemble). However, here we show by unbiased statistical sampling of the individual eigenstates with a given finite energy density, that the local description of an overwhelming majority of these states of even such an integrable system is actually Gibbs-like, i.e. requires only the energy density of the eigenstate. Rare eigenstates that cannot be represented by the Gibbs ensemble can also be sampled efficiently by our method and their local properties are then shown to be described by appropriately {\it truncated} Generalized Gibbs Ensembles. We further show that the presence of these rare eigenstates differentiates the model from the generic (non-integrable) case and leads to the system being described by a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble at long time under a unitary dynamics following a sudden quench, even when the initial state is a Gibbs-like eigenstate of the pre-quench Hamiltonian.
