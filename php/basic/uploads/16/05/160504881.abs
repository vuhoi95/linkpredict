Title: Racah matrices and hidden integrability in evolution of knots
Authors: A. Mironov and A. Morozov and An. Morozov and A. Sleptsov
Abstract: We construct a general procedure to extract the exclusive Racah matrices S and \bar S from the inclusive 3-strand mixing matrices by the evolution method and apply it to the first simple representations R =[1], [2], [3] and [2,2]. The matrices S and \bar S relate respectively the maps (R\otimes R)\otimes \bar R\longrightarrow R with R\otimes (R \otimes \bar R) \longrightarrow R and (R\otimes \bar R) \otimes R \longrightarrow R with R\otimes (\bar R \otimes R) \longrightarrow R. They are building blocks for the colored HOMFLY polynomials of arbitrary arborescent (double fat) knots. Remarkably, the calculation realizes an unexpected integrability property underlying the evolution matrices.
