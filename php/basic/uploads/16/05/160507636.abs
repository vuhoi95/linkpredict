Title: Fixed point structure of the conformal factor field in quantum gravity
Authors: Juergen A. Dietz and Tim R. Morris and Zoe H. Slade
Abstract: The $\mathcal{O}(\partial^2)$ background independent flow equations for conformally reduced gravity are shown to be equivalent to flow equations naturally adapted to scalar field theory with a wrong sign kinetic term. This sign change is shown to have a profound effect on the renormalization group properties, broadly resulting in a continuum of fixed points supporting both a discrete and a continuous eigenoperator spectrum, the latter always including relevant directions. The properties at the Gaussian fixed point are understood in particular depth, but also detailed studies of the local potential approximation, and the full $\mathcal{O}(\partial^2)$ approximation are given. These results are related to evidence for asymptotic safety found by other authors.
