Title: Photons with half-integral spin as q-Fermions
Authors: R. Parthasarathy and K. S. Viswanathan
Abstract: The recently discovered 'light (photons) with half-integral spin' is interpreted as q-Fermions proposed by us in 1991, as these q-Fermions satisfy q-deformed anti-commutation relations (pertaining to spin half) and have the property that more than one q-Fermion can occupy a given quantum state. In this article, in view of the recent discovery, we recall the construction of q-Fermions and give the statistical properties of q-Fermion gas, based on our preprint in 1992.
