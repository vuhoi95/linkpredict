Title: Localised $\bf{AdS_5\times S^5}$ Black Holes
Authors: Oscar J. C. Dias and Jorge E. Santos and Benson Way
Abstract: We numerically construct asymptotically global $\mathrm{AdS}_5\times \mathrm{S}^5$ black holes that are localised on the $\mathrm{S}^5$. These are solutions to type IIB supergravity with $\mathrm S^8$ horizon topology that dominate the theory in the microcanonical ensemble at small energies. At higher energies, there is a first-order phase transition to $\mathrm{AdS}_5$-Schwarzschild$\times \mathrm{S}^5$. By the AdS/CFT correspondence, this transition is dual to spontaneously breaking the $SO(6)$ R-symmetry of $\mathcal N=4$ super Yang-Mills down to $SO(5)$. We extrapolate the location of this phase transition and compute the expectation value of the resulting scalar operators in the low energy phase.
