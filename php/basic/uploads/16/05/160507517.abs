Title: Generalized Kadanoff-Baym relation in nonequilibrium quenched models
Authors: A. L. M. Britto and Ashok K. Das and J. Frenkel
Abstract: In the context of a broad class of quenched models, we derive a generalized differential form of the Kadanoff-Baym (KB) ansatz which relates the out of equilibrium correlated and spectral Green's functions. This relation holds at any time both before the quench (when it coincides with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem) as well as after it. We also examine, in the context of exactly soluble quenched models, the validity of some of the earlier alternative extensions of the KB ansatz.
