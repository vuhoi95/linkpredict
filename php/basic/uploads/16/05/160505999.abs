Title: Thermal geometry from CFT at finite temperature
Authors: Wen-Cong Gan and Fu-Wen Shu and Meng-He Wu
Abstract: We present how the thermal geometry emerges from CFT at finite temperature by using the truncated entanglement renormalization network, the cMERA. For the case of $2d$ CFT, the reduced geometry is the BTZ black hole or the thermal AdS as expectation. In order to determine which spacetimes prefer to form, we propose a cMERA description of the Hawking-Page phase transition. Our proposal is in agreement with the picture of the recent proposed surface/state correspondence.
