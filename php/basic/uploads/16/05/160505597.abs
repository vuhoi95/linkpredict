Abstract: We study the high temperature series expansion of the Berkooz-Douglas matrix model which describes the D0/D4--brane system. At high temperature the model is weakly coupled and we develop the series to second order. We check our results against the high temperature regime of the bosonic model (without fermions) and find excellent agreement. We track the temperature dependence of the bosonic model and find backreaction of the fundamental fields lifts the zero temperature adjoint mass degeneracy. In the low temperature phase the system is well described by a gaussian model with three masses $m^t_A=1.964 \pm 0.003$, $m^l_A=2.001 \pm 0.003$ and $m_f=1.463 \pm 0.001$, the adjoint longitudional and transverse masses and the mass of the fundamental fields respectively.
