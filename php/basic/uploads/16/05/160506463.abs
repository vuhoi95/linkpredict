Title: Quantum Mechanical Corrections to the Schwarzschild Black Hole Metric
Authors: P. Bargue√±o and S. Bravo Medina and M. Nowakowski and D. Batic
Abstract: Motivated by quantum mechanical corrections to the Newtonian potential, which can be translated into an $\hbar$-correction to the $g_{00}$ component of the Schwarzschild metric, we construct a quantum mechanically corrected metric assuming $-g_{00}=g^{rr}$. We show how the Bekenstein black hole entropy $S$ receives its logarithmic contribution provided the quantum mechanical corrections to the metric are negative. In this case the standard horizon at the Schwarzschild radius $r_S$ increases by small terms proportional to $\hbar$ and a remnant of the order of Planck mass emerges. We contrast these results with a positive correction to the metric which, apart from a corrected Schwarzschild horizon, leads to a new purely quantum mechanical horizon. In such a case the quantum mechanical corrections to the entropy are logarithmic and polynomial.
