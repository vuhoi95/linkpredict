Title: Non-relativistic anyons from holography
Authors: Niko Jokela and Jarkko Järvelä and Alfonso V. Ramallo
Abstract: We study generic types of holographic matter residing in Lifshitz invariant defect field theory as modeled by adding probe D-branes in the bulk black hole spacetime characterized by dynamical exponent $z$ and with hyperscaling violation exponent $\theta$. Our main focus will be on the collective excitations of the dense matter in the presence of an external magnetic field. Constraining the defect field theory to 2+1 dimensions, we will also allow the gauge fields become dynamical and study the properties of a strongly coupled anyonic fluid. We will deduce the universal properties of holographic matter and find that the Einstein relation always holds.
