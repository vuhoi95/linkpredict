Title: Towards Quantum Turbulence in Finite Temperature Bose-Einstein  Condensates
Authors: Shanquan Lan and Yu Tian and Hongbao Zhang
Abstract: Motivated by the various indications that holographic superfluid is BCS like at the standard quantization but BEC like at the alternative quantization, we have implemented the alternative quantization in the dynamical holographic superfluid for the first time. With this accomplishment, we further initiate the detailed investigation of quantum turbulence in finite temperature BEC by a long time stable numerical simulation of bulk dynamics, which includes the two body decay of vortex number caused by vortex pair annihilation, the onset of superfluid turbulence signaled by Kolmogorov scaling law, and a direct energy cascade demonstrated by injecting energy to the turbulent superfluid. All of these results share the same patterns as the holographic superfluid at the standard quantization, thus suggest that these should be universal features for quantum turbulence at temperatures order of the critical temperature.
