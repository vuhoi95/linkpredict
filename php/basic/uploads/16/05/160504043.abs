Title: From Extended theories of Gravity to Dark Matter
Authors: Sayantan Choudhury and Manibrata Sen and Soumya Sadhukhan
Abstract: In this work, we propose different models of extended theories of gravity, which are minimally coupled to the SM fields, to explain the possibility of a dark matter (DM) candidate, without ad-hoc additions to the Standard Model (SM). We modify the gravity sector by allowing quantum corrections motivated from local $f(R)$ gravity, and non-minimally coupled gravity with SM sector and dilaton field. Using an effective field theory (EFT) framework, we constrain the scale of the EFT and DM mass. We consider two cases-Light DM (LDM) and Heavy DM (HDM), and deduce upper bounds on the DM annihilation cross section to SM particles.
