Title: Perturbatively deformed defects in PÃ¶schl-Teller-driven scenarios for  quantum mechanics
Authors: Alex E. Bernardini and Roldao da Rocha
Abstract: P\"oschl-Teller-driven solutions for quantum mechanical fluctuations are triggered off by single scalar field theories obtained through a systematic perturbative procedure for generating deformed defects. The analytical properties concerning the quantum fluctuations in one-dimension, zero-mode states, first- and second- excited states, and energy density profiles are all obtained from deformed topological and non-topological structures supported by real scalar fields. Results are firstly derived from an integrated $\lambda \phi^4$ theory, with corresponding generalizations applied to starting $\lambda \chi^4$ and {\em sine}-Gordon theories. By focusing our calculations on structures supported by the $\lambda\phi^4$ theory, the outcome of our study suggests an exact quantitative correspondence to P\"oschl-Teller-driven systems. Embedded into the perturbative quantum mechanics framework, such a correspondence turns into a helpful tool for computing excited states and continuous mode solutions, as well as their associated energy spectrum, for quantum fluctuations of perturbatively deformed structures. Perturbative deformations create distinct physical scenarios in the context of exactly solvable quantum systems and may also work as an analytical support for describing novel braneworld universes embedded into a $5$-dimensional gravity bulks.
