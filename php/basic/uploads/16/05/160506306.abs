Title: A modification of the projective construction of quantum states for  field theories
Authors: Jerzy Kijowski and Andrzej Okolow
Abstract: It turned out that there may be a flaw in the projective construction of quantum states for field theories described in our earlier papers. Here we present a slight modification of the construction which is free from the flaw.
