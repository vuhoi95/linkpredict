Title: New Electrically Charged Black Hole in Higher Derivative Gravity
Authors: Kai Lin and A. B. Pavan and G. Flores-Hidalgo and E. Abdalla
Abstract: In this paper, new electrically charged asymptotically flat black hole solutions are numerically derived in the context of higher derivative gravity. These solutions can be interpreted as generalizations of two different classes of non-charged asymptotically flat spacetimes: Schwarzschild and non-Schwarzschild solutions. Extreme black hole solutions and black holes with negative mass were found.
