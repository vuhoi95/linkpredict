Abstract: In the standard model of cosmology (SMC) the B-mode polarization of the CMB can be explained by the gravitational effects in the inflation epoch. However, this is not the only way to explain the B-mode polarization for the CMB. It can be shown that the Compton scattering in presence of a background besides generating a circularly polarized microwave, can leads to a B-mode polarization for the CMB. Here we consider the non-commutative (NC) space time as a background to explore the CMB polarization at the last scattering surface. We obtain the B-mode spectrum of the CMB radiation by scalar perturbation of metric via a correction on the Compton scattering in NC-space-time in terms of the circular polarization power spectrum and the non-commutative energy scale. It can be shown that even for the NC-scale as large as $10TeV$ the NC-effects on the CMB polarization and the r-parameter is significant. We show that the V-mode power spectrum can be obtained in terms of linearly polarized power spectrum in the range Micro to Nano-Kelvin squared for the NC-scale about $1TeV$ to $10TeV$, respectively.
