Title: Quantized gravitoelectromagnetism theory at finite temperature
Authors: A. F. Santos and Faqir C. Khanna
Abstract: The Gravitoelectromagnetism (GEM) theory is considered in a lagrangian formulation using the Weyl tensor components. A perturbative approach to calculate processes at zero temperature has been used. Here the GEM at finite temperature is analyzed using Thermo Field Dynamics, real time finite temperature quantum field theory. Transition amplitudes involving gravitons, fermions and photons are calculated for various processes. These amplitudes are likely of interest in astrophysics.
