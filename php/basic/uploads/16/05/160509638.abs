Title: Two-particle system in noncommutative space with preserved rotational  symmetry
Authors: Kh. P. Gnatenko and V. M. Tkachuk
Abstract: We consider a system of two particles in noncommutative space which is rotationally invariant. It is shown that the coordinates of the center-of-mass position and the coordinates of relative motion satisfy noncommutative algebra with corresponding effective tensors of noncommutativity. The hydrogen atom is studied as a two-particle system. We find the corrections to the energy levels of the hydrogen atom up to the second order over the parameter of noncommutativity.
