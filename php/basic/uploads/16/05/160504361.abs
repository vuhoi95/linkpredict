Title: Observable Effects of Quantum Gravity
Authors: Lay Nam Chang and Djordje Minic and Chen Sun and Tatsu Takeuchi
Abstract: We discuss the generic phenomenology of quantum gravity and, in particular, argue that the observable effects of quantum gravity, associated with new, extended, non-local, non-particle-like quanta, and accompanied by a dynamical energy-momentum space, are not necessarily Planckian and that they could be observed at much lower and experimentally accessible energy scales.
