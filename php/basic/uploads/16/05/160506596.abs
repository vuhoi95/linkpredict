Title: Cohomological orientifold Donaldson-Thomas invariants as Chow groups
Authors: Hans Franzen and Matthew B. Young
Abstract: We establish a geometric interpretation of orientifold Donaldson-Thomas invariants of $\sigma$-symmetric quivers with involution. More precisely, we prove that the cohomological orientifold Donaldson-Thomas invariant is isomorphic to the rational Chow group of the moduli space of $\sigma$-stable self-dual quiver representations. As an application we prove that the Chow Betti numbers of moduli spaces of stable $m$-tuples in classical Lie algebras can be computed numerically. We also prove a cohomological wall-crossing formula relating semistable Hall modules for different stabilities.
