Title: Quantum Tunneling from the Charged Non-Rotating BTZ Black Hole with GUP
Authors: Jafar Sadeghi and Vahid Reza Shajiee
Abstract: In the present paper, the quantum corrections to the temperature, entropy and specific heat capacity of the charged non-rotating BTZ black hole are studied by generalized uncertainty principle in tunneling formalism. It is shown that quantum corrected entropy would be of the form of predicted entropy in quantum gravity theories like string theory and loop quantum gravity. It is shown that the black hole, in presence of GUP, would be more thermodynamically stable than classical case. Finally, some discussion are presented about the black hole heat capacity.
