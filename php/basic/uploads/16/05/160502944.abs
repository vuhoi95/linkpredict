Title: Bell's Inequalities for Continuous-Variable Systems in Generic Squeezed  States
Authors: Jerome Martin and Vincent Vennin
Abstract: Bell's inequality for continuous-variable bipartite systems is studied. The inequality is expressed in terms of pseudo-spin operators and quantum expectation values are calculated for generic two-mode squeezed states characterized by a squeezing parameter $r$ and a squeezing angle $\varphi$. Allowing for generic values of the squeezing angle is especially relevant when $\varphi$ is not under experimental control, such as in cosmic inflation, where small quantum fluctuations in the early Universe are responsible for structures formation. Compared to previous studies restricted to $\varphi=0$ and to a fixed orientation of the pseudo-spin operators, allowing for $\varphi\neq 0$ and optimizing the angular configuration leads to a completely new and rich phenomenology. Two dual schemes of approximation are designed that allow for comprehensive exploration of the squeezing parameters space. In particular, it is found that Bell's inequality can be violated when the squeezing parameter $r$ is large enough, $r\gtrsim 1.12$, and the squeezing angle $\varphi$ is small enough, $\varphi\lesssim 0.34\,e^{-r}$.
