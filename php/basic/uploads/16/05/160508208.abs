Title: Implications of N=5, 6 superconformal symmetry in three spacetime  dimensions
Authors: Sergei M. Kuzenko and Igor B. Samsonov
Abstract: For general N=5 and N=6 superconformal field theories in three dimensions, we compute the three-point correlation functions of the supercurrent multiplets. In each case, N=5 and N=6, the functional form of this correlator is uniquely fixed modulo an overall coefficient which is related, by superconformal Ward identities, to the parameter in the two-point function of the supercurrent. The structure of the correlation functions obtained is consistent with the property that every N=5 superconformal field theory, considered as a special N=4 theory, is invariant under the mirror map.
