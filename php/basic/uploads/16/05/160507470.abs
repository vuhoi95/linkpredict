Title: Twisted superspace: Non-renormalization and fermionic symmetries in  certain (heterotic string inspired) non-supersymmetric field theories
Authors: Stefan Groot Nibbelink and Erik Parr
Abstract: Inspired by the tachyon-free non-supersymmetric heterotic SO(16)xSO(16) string we consider a special class of non-supersymmetric field theories: Those that can be obtained from supersymmetric field theories by supersymmetry breaking twists. We argue that such theories, like their supersymmetric counter parts, may still possess some fermionic symmetries as left-overs of the super gauge transformations and have special one-loop non-renormalization properties due to holomorphicity. In addition, we extend the supergraph techniques to these theories to calculate some explicit supersymmetry-breaking corrections.
