Title: Non-perturbative BRST quantization of Euclidean Yang-Mills theories in  Curci-Ferrari gauges
Authors: A. D. Pereira and R. F. Sobreiro and S. P. Sorella
Abstract: In this paper we address the issue of the non-perturbative quantization of Euclidean Yang-Mills theories in the Curci-Ferrari gauge. In particular, we construct a Refined Gribov-Zwanziger action for this gauge which takes into account the presence of gauge copies as well as the dynamical formation of dimension two condensates. This action enjoys a non-perturbative BRST symmetry recently proposed in \cite{Capri:2015ixa}. Finally, we give attention to the gluon propagator in different space-time dimensions.
