Title: Charged scalar waves from the RN/CFT correspondence
Authors: Xing-Hua Wu and Ran Li
Abstract: We examine new tests for (non-)extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om/Conformal field theory correspondences (RN/CFT) in this paper. The decay rate of the charged scalar wave sourced by an orbiting star around the black hole is computed and is compared with the decay rate computed in the corresponding CFT. We find that precise matches are achieved.
