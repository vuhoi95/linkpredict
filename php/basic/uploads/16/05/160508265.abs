Title: The Effect of the Infrared Phase of the Discrete BFKL Pomeron on  Transverse Momentum Diffusion
Authors: Douglas A. Ross and Agustin Sabio Vera
Abstract: Imposing infrared boundary conditions on the BFKL equation with running coupling transforms the complex momentum w-plane cut present in the gluon Green function into an infinite series of positive Regge poles. In addition, a cut on the negative w line remains. We consider a Hermitian kernel at leading order with running coupling and construct the gluon Green function performing the w integration away from the real axis. We find a strong dependence of the asymptotic intercepts and collinear behaviour on the non-perturbative choice of the boundary conditions, in the form of an infrared phase. This is particularly manifest in the asymmetric infrared/ultraviolet structure of the associated diffusion in transverse momentum. We find that random walks into the infrared region are largely reduced in this approach.
