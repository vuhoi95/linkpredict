Title: Black hole Skyrmion in a generalized Skyrme model
Authors: Sven Bjarke Gudnason and Muneto Nitta and Nobuyuki Sawado
Abstract: We study a Skyrme-like model with the Skyrme term and a sixth-order derivative term as higher-order terms, coupled to gravity and we construct Schwarzschild black hole Skyrme hair. We find, surprisingly, that the sixth-order derivative term alone cannot stabilize the black hole hair solutions; the Skyrme term with a large enough coefficient is a necessity.
