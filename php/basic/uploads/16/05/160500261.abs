Title: Dynamics of Warm Chaplygin Gas Inflationary Models With Quartic  Potential
Authors: Abdul Jawad and Sadaf Butt and Shamaila Rani
Abstract: Warm inflationary universe models in the context of generalized chaplygin gas, modified chaplygin gas, generalized cosmic chaplygin gas are being studied. The dissipative coefficient of the form $\Gamma\propto T$, weak and strong dissipative regimes are being considered. We use quartic potential $\frac{\lambda_{*}\phi^{4}}{4}$, which is ruled out by current data in cold inflation but in our models it is analyzed that it is in agreement with the WMAP$9$ and latest Planck data. In these scenarios, the power spectrum, spectral index, and tensor to scalar ratio are being examined under the slow roll approximation. We show the dependence of tensor scalar ratio $r$ on spectral index $n_{s}$ and observe that the range of tensor scalar ratio is $r<0.05$ in generalized chaplygin gas, $r<0.15$ in modified chaplygin gas, and $r<0.12$ in generalized cosmic chaplygin gas models. Our results are in agreement with recent observational data like WMAP$9$ and latest Planck data.
