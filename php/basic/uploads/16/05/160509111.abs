Title: Isospin Invariance and the Vacuum Polarization Energy of Cosmic Strings
Authors: H. Weigel and M. Quandt and N. Graham
Abstract: We corroborate the previously applied spectral approach to compute the vacuum polarization energy of string configurations in models similar to the standard model of particle physics. The central observation underlying this corroboration is the existence of a particular global isospin transformation of the string configuration. Under this transformation the single particle energies of the quantum fluctuations are invariant, while the inevitable implementation of regularization and renormalization requires operations that are not invariant. We verify numerically that all such variances eventually cancel, and that the vacuum polarization energy obtained in the spectral approach is indeed gauge invariant.
