Title: Free fermions, W-algebras and isomonodromic deformations
Authors: P. Gavrylenko and A. Marshakov
Abstract: We consider the theory of multicomponent free massless fermions in two dimensions and use it for construction of representations of W-algebras at integer Virasoro central charges. We define the vertex operators in this theory in terms of solutions of the corresponding isomonodromy problem. We use this construction to get some new insights on tau-functions of the multicomponent Toda type hierarchies for the class of solutions, given by the isomonodromy vertex operators and get useful representation for the tau-function of isomonodromic deformations.
