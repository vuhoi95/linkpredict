Title: The holographic dual of a Riemann problem in a large number of  dimensions
Authors: Christopher P. Herzog and Michael Spillane and Amos Yarom
Abstract: We study properties of a non equilibrium steady state generated when two heat baths are initially in contact with one another. The dynamics of the system we study are governed by holographic duality in a large number of dimensions. We discuss the "phase diagram" associated with the steady state; the dual, dynamical, black hole description of this problem; and its relation to the fluid/gravity correspondence.
