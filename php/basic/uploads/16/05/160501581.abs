Title: Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics and Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Stefan Hollands and Roberto Longo
Abstract: We present a model independent, operator algebraic approach to non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics within the framework of two-dimensional Conformal Field Theory. Two infinite reservoirs in equilibrium at their own temperatures and chemical potentials are put in contact through a defect line, possibly by inserting a probe. As time evolves, the composite system then approaches a non-equilibrium steady state that we describe. In particular, we re-obtain recent formulas of Bernard and Doyon.
