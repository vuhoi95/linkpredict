Title: Primordial fluctuations from inflation in dRGT bimetric theory of  gravity
Authors: Yuki Sakakihara and Takahiro Tanaka
Abstract: We investigate primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations in de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) bimetric gravity. We evaluate the power-spectra in the leading order in slow roll. Taking into account the decay of massive graviton, we find that the action up to the second order reduces to the Einstein theory with a non-minimally coupled scalar field, which is simplified to a minimally coupled model by conformal transformation. We also find that the tensor to scalar ratio for large field inflation with power law potential is larger than the general relativity counterpart for any choice of parameters in dRGT bimetric gravity. In addition, we confirm that the usual consistency relation holds and we have a steeper spectrum for gravitational waves.
