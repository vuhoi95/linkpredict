Title: Quasi-integrability in deformed sine-Gordon models and infinite towers  of conserved charges
Authors: Harold Blas and Hector Flores Callisaya
Abstract: We have studied the space-reflection symmetries of some soliton solutions of deformed sine-Gordon models in the context of the quasi-integrability concept. Considering a dual pair of anomalous Lax representations of the deformed model we compute analytically and numerically an infinite number of alternating conserved and asymptotically conserved charges through a modification of the usual techniques of integrable field theories. The charges associated to two-solitons with a definite parity under space-reflection symmetry, i.e. kink-kink (odd parity) and kink-antikink (even parity) scatterings with equal and opposite velocities, split into two infinite towers of conserved and asymptotically conserved charges. For two-solitons without definite parity under space-reflection symmetry (kink-kink and kink-antikink scatterings with unequal and opposite velocities) our numerical results show the existence of the asymptotically conserved charges only. However, we show that in the center-of-mass reference frame of the two solitons the parity symmetries and their associated set of exactly conserved charges can be restored. Moreover, the positive parity breather-like (kink-antikink bound state) solution exhibits a tower of exactly conserved charges and a subset of charges which are periodic in time. We back up our results with extensive numerical simulations which also demonstrate the existence of long lived breather-like states in these models. The time evolution has been simulated by the 4th order Runge-Kutta method supplied with non-reflecting boundary conditions.
