Title: Sub-subleading soft gravitons: New symmetries of quantum gravity?
Authors: Miguel Campiglia and Alok Laddha
Abstract: Due to seminal works of Weinberg, Cachazo and Strominger we know that tree level quantum gravity amplitudes satisfy three factorization constraints. Building on previous works which relate two of these constraints to symmetries of quantum gravity at null infinity, we present rather strong evidence that the third constraint is also equivalent to a new set of symmetries of (perturbative) quantum gravity. Our analysis implies that the symmetry group of quantum gravity may be even richer than the BMS group (or infinite dimensional extension thereof) previously considered.
