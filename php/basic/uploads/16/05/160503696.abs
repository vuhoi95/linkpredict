Title: Classical dynamics of the Bianchi IX model: spacelike and timelike  singularities
Authors: S. L. Parnovsky and W. Piechocki
Abstract: We present the comparison of the dynamics of the vacuum Bianchi IX model near the space-like and time-like singularities. In both cases there exist oscillatory type solutions with diverging asymptotically curvature invariants. The dynamics of the time-like singularity case includes additionally the singular solutions with diverging volume density, but vanishing curvature invariants. Our numerical results are consistent with qualitative analytical considerations underlying finding the generic singular solutions to general relativity.
