Title: Comments on Asymptotic Symmetries and the Sub-leading Soft Photon  Theorem
Authors: Eduardo Conde and Pujian Mao
Abstract: It has long been known that the soft factor appearing in the soft photon theorem contains a leading and a sub-leading piece (in the inverse frequency of the photon). It has been recently shown that the leading soft factor can be understood as the Ward identity of a symmetry at null infinity, namely certain residual (large) gauge transformations of the gauge theory. In this note we argue that the sub-leading soft factor follows from the same symmetry. In particular, expanding the associated charge in inverse powers of the radial coordinate, the (sub-)leading charge yields the (sub-)leading soft factor.
