Title: Compressed Teleportation
Authors: Arthur Jaffe and Zhengwei Liu and Alex Wozniakowski
Abstract: In a previous paper we introduced holographic software for quantum networks, inspired by work on planar para algebras. This software suggests the definition of a compressed transformation. Here we utilize the software to find a CT protocol to teleport compressed transformations. This protocol serves multiple parties with multiple persons.
