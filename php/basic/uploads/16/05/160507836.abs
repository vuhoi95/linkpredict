Title: Phase structure of the $O(2)$ ghost model with higher-order gradient  term
Authors: Z. PÃ©li and S. Nagy and K. Sailer
Abstract: The phase structure and the infrared behaviour of the Euclidean 3-dimensional $O(2)$ symmetric ghost scalar field model with higher-order derivative term has been investigated in Wegner and Houghton's renormalization group framework. The symmetric phase in which no ghost condensation occurs and the phase with restored symmetry but with a transient presence of a ghost condensate have been identified. Finiteness of the correlation length at the phase boundary hints to a phase transition of first order. The results are compared with those for the ordinary $O(2)$ symmetric scalar field model.
