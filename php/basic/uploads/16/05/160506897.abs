Title: Baryogenesis in false vacuum
Authors: Yuta Hamada and Masatoshi Yamada
Abstract: The null result in the LHC may indicate that the standard model is not drastically modified up to very high scale such as the GUT/string scale. Having this in the mind, we suggest a novel leptogenesis scenario realized in the false vacuum of the Higgs field. If the Higgs field develops the large vacuum expectation value in the early universe, the lepton number violating process is enhanced, which we use for baryogenesis. To demonstrate the scenario, several models are discussed. For example, we show that the observed baryon asymmetry is successfully generated in the standard model with a second Higgs doublet and a singlet scalar.
