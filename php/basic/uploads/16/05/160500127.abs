Title: Holographic Software for Quantum Networks
Authors: Arthur Jaffe and Zhengwei Liu and Alex Wozniakowski
Abstract: We introduce a new diagrammatic approach to quantum information, called holographic software. Our software captures both algebraic and topological aspects of quantum networks. It yields a bi-directional dictionary to translate between a topological approach and an algebraic approach. Using our software, we give a topological simulation for quantum networks. The string Fourier transform (SFT) is our basic tool to transform product states into states with maximal entanglement entropy. We obtain a diagrammatic interpretation of the phase space, of measurements, and of local transformations, including single-qudit Pauli matrices and their Jordan-Wigner transformations. We use our software to discover interesting new protocols for multipartite communication. In summary, we build a bridge linking the theory of planar para algebras with quantum information.
