Title: P - V Criticality of Logarithmic Corrected Dyonic Charged AdS Black Hole
Authors: J. Sadeghi and B. Pourhassan and M. Rostami
Abstract: In this paper, we consider dyonic charged AdS black hole which is holographic dual of a van der Waals fluid. We use logarithmic corrected entropy and study thermodynamics of the black hole and show that holographic picture is still valid. Critical behaviors and stability also discussed. Logarithmic corrections arises due to thermal fluctuations which are important when size of black hole be small. So, thermal fluctuations interpreted as quantum effect. It means that we can see quantum effect of a black hole which is a gravitational system.
