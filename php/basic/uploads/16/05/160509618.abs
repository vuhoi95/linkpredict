Title: Extrinsic curvature in 2-dimensional Causal Dynamical Triangulation
Authors: Lisa Glaser and Thomas P. Sotiriou and Silke Weinfurtner
Abstract: Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT) is a non-perturbative quantisation of general relativity. Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity on the other hand modifies general relativity to allow for perturbative quan- tisation. Past work has given rise to the speculation that Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity might correspond to the continuum limit of CDT. In this paper we add another piece to this puzzle by applying the CDT quantisation prescription directly to Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity in 2 dimensions. We derive the continuum Hamiltonian and we show that it matches exactly the Hamiltonian one derives from canonically quantising the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz action. Unlike the standard CDT case, here the intro- duction of a foliated lattice does not impose further restriction on the configuration space and, as a result, lattice quantisation does not leave any imprint on continuum physics as expected.
