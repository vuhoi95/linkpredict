Title: Membrane Matrix models and non-perturbative checks of gauge/gravity  duality
Authors: Denjoe O'Connor and Veselin G. Filev
Abstract: We compare the bosonic and maximally supersymmetric membrane models. We find that in Hoppe regulated form the bosonic membrane is well approximated by massive Gaussian quantum matrix models. In contrast the similarly regulated supersymmetric membrane, which is equivalent to the BFSS model, has a gravity dual description. We sketch recent progress in checking gauge/gravity duality in this context.
