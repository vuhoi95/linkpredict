Title: From Fock's Transformation to de Sitter Space
Authors: T. Foughali and A. Bouda
Abstract: As in Deformed Special Relativity, we showed recently that the Fock coordinate transformation can be derived from a new deformed Poisson brackets. This approach allowed us to establish the corresponding momentum transformation which keeps invariant the four dimensional contraction $p_{\mu} x^{\mu} $. From the resulting deformed algebra, we construct in this paper the corresponding first Casimir. After first quantization, we show by using the Klein-Gordon equation that the spacetime of the Fock transformation is the de Sitter one. As we will see, the invariant length representing the universe radius in the spacetime of Fock's transformation is exactly the radius of the embedded hypersurface representing the de Sitter spacetime.
