Abstract: We study various types of classical non-linear wave solutions with mass scale parameters in a pure SU(2) quantum chromodynamics. It has been shown that there are two gauge non-equivalent solutions for non-linear plane waves with a mass parameter. One of them corresponds to embedding \lambda \phi^4 theory into the SU(2) Yang-Mills theory, another represents essentially Yang-Mills type solution. We describe a wide class of stationary and non-stationary wave solutions among which kink like solitons and non-linear wave packet solutions have been found. A regular stationary monopole like solution with a finite energy density is proposed. The solution can be treated as a Wu-Yang monopole dressed in off-diagonal gluons. All non-linear wave solutions have common features: presence of a mass scale parameter, non-vanishing projection of the color magnetic field along the propagation direction and a total spin zero. Gauge invariant and Lorentz frame independent definitions of the gluon spin operator are considered.
