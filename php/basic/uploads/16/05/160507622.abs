Title: Kerr-Newman Black Holes with String Corrections
Authors: Anthony M. Charles and Finn Larsen
Abstract: We study $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity with higher-derivative corrections that preserve the $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry and show that Kerr-Newman black holes are solutions to these theories. Modifications of the black hole entropy due to the higher derivatives are universal and apply even in the BPS and Schwarzschild limits. Our solutions and their entropy are greatly simplified by supersymmetry of the theory even though the black holes generally do not preserve any of the supersymmetry.
