Title: On some properties of SU(3) Fusion Coefficients
Authors: Robert Coquereaux and Jean-Bernard Zuber
Abstract: Three aspects of the SU(3) fusion coefficients are revisited: the generating polynomials of fusion coefficients are written explicitly; some curious identities generalizing the classical Freudenthal-de Vries formula are derived; and the properties of the fusion coefficients under conjugation of one of the factors, previously analysed in the classical case, are extended to the affine algebra of su(3) at finite level.
