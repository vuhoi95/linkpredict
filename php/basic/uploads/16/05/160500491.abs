Abstract: Owing to the extreme smallness of any noncommutative scale that may exist in nature, both in the spatial and momentum sector of the quantum phase-space, a credible possibility of their detection lies in the present day gravitational wave detector set-ups, which effectively detects the relative length-scale variations ${\cal{O}}\left[10^{-23} \right]$. With this motivation, we have considered how a free particle and harmonic oscillator in a quantum domain will respond to linearly and circularly polarized gravitational waves if the given phase-space has a noncommutative structure. The results show resonance behaviour in the responses of both free particle and HO systems to GW with both kind of polarizations. We critically analyze all the responses, and their implications in possible detection of noncommutativity. We use the currently available upper-bound estimates on various noncommutative parameters to anticipate the relative size of various response terms. We also argue how the quantum harmonic oscillator system we considered here can be very relevant in context of the resonant bar detectors of GW which are already operational currently.
