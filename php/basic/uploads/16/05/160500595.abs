Abstract: We use the Iyer-Wald formalism to derive an extended first law of entanglement that includes variations in the cosmological constant, Newton's constant and --in the case of higher derivative theories-- all the additional couplings of the theory. In Einstein gravity, where the number of degrees of freedom $N^2$ of the dual field theory is a function of $\Lambda$ and $G$, our approach allows us to vary $N$ keeping the field theory scale fixed or to vary the field theory scale keeping $N$ fixed. We also derive an extended first law of entanglement for Gauss-Bonnet and Lovelock gravity.
