Title: Effect of an invariant energy scale on the thermodynamics of photon gas
Authors: Mir Mehedi Faruk and Md. Muktadir Rahman
Abstract: A particular framework for quantum gravity is the doubly special relativity (DSR) formalism that introduces a new observer independent scale (the Planck scale). We resort to the methods of statistical mechanics in this framework to determine how the deformed dispersion relation effects the thermodynamics of a photon gas. The ensuing modifications to the density of states, partition function, pressure, internal energy, entropy, free energy and specific heat are calculated. These results are compared with the outcome obtained in the Lorentz violating model of Camacho and Murcias (Gen.Relativ.Gravit.39: 1175-1183, 2007). The two types of models predict different results due to different spacetime structure near the Planck scale. The resulting modifications can be interpreted as a consequence of the deformed Lorentz symmetry present in the particular model we have considered.
