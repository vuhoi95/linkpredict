Title: Some applications and constructions of intertwining operators in LCFT
Authors: Drazen Adamovic and Antun Milas
Abstract: We discuss some applications of fusion rules and intertwining operators in the representation theory of cyclic orbifolds of the triplet vertex operator algebra. We prove that the classification of irreducible modules for the orbifold vertex algebra W(p)^{A_m} follows from a conjectural fusion rules formula for the singlet vertex algebra modules. In the p=2 case, we computed fusion rules for the irreducible singlet vertex algebra modules by using intertwining operators. This result implies the classification of irreducible modules for W(2)^{A_m}, conjectured previously in [4]. The main technical tool is a new deformed realization of the triplet and singlet vertex algebras, which is used to construct certain intertwining operators that can not be detected by using standard free field realizations.
