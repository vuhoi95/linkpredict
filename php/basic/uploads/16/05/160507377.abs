Title: Phase transition for black holes in dilatonic Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet  theory of gravitation
Authors: Sunly Khimphun and Bum-Hoon Lee and Wonwoo Lee
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic properties of a black hole and the Hawking-Page phase transition in the asymptotically anti--de Sitter spacetime in the dilatonic Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory of gravitation. We show how the higher-order curvature terms can influence both the thermodynamic properties and the phase transition. We evaluate both heat capacity and free energy difference to determine the local and global thermodynamic stabilities, respectively. We find that the phase transition occurs from the thermal anti--de Sitter to a small spherical black hole geometry and occurs to a hyperbolic black hole geometry in the (dilatonic) Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory of gravitation unlike those in Einstein's theory of gravitation.
