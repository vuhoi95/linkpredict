Abstract: Configurational entropy has been revealed as a reliable method for constraining some parameters of a given model [Phys. Rev. D \textbf{92} (2015) 126005, Eur. Phys. J. C \textbf{76} (2016) 100]. In this letter we calculate the configurational entropy in Gauss-Bonnet braneworld models. Our results restrict the range of acceptability of the Gauss-Bonnet scalar values. In this way, the information theoretical measure in Gauss-Bonnet scenarios opens a new window to probe situations where the additional parameters, responsible for the Gauss-Bonnet sector, are arbitrary. We also show that such an approach is very important in applications that include p and Dp-branes and various superstring-motivated theories.
