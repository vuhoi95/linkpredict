Title: On the Exact Interpolating Function in ABJ Theory
Authors: Andrea Cavagli√† and Nikolay Gromov and Fedor Levkovich-Maslyuk
Abstract: Based on the recent indications of integrability in the planar ABJ model, we conjecture an exact expression for the interpolating function h(\lambda_1,\lambda_2) in this theory. Our conjecture is based on the observation that the integrability structure of the ABJM theory given by its Quantum Spectral Curve is very rigid and does not allow for a simple consistent modification. Under this assumption, we revised the previous comparison of localization results and exact all loop integrability calculations done for the ABJM theory by one of the authors and Grigory Sizov, fixing h(\lambda_1,\lambda_2). We checked our conjecture against various weak coupling expansions, at strong coupling and also demonstrated its invariance under the Seiberg-like duality. This match also gives further support to the integrability of the model. If our conjecture is correct, it extends all the available integrability results in the ABJM model to the ABJ model.
