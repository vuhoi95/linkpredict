Title: Holographic Entanglement Entropy For a Large Class of States in 2D CFT
Authors: Bin Chen and Jie-qiang Wu
Abstract: In this paper, we study the entanglement entropy in a large class of states of two-dimensional conformal field theory in the the large central charge limit. This class of states includes the states created by the insertion of a finite number of local heavy operators. By using the monodromy analysis, we obtain the leading order entanglement entropy for the general state. We show that it is exactly captured by the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, by using the Wilsonian line prescription in the Chern-Simons formulation of the AdS$_3$ gravity.
