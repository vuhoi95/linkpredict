Title: Stringent theoretical and experimental bounds on graviton mass
Authors: Ahmed Farag Ali and Saurya Das
Abstract: We show from theoretical considerations, that if the graviton is massive, its mass is constrained to be about $10^{-32}~eV/c^2$. This estimate is consistent with those obtained from experiments, including the recent gravitational wave detection in advanced LIGO.
