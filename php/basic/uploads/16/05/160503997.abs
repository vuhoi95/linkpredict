Title: Toda Theory From Six Dimensions
Authors: Clay Cordova and Daniel L. Jafferis
Abstract: We describe a compactification of the six-dimensional (2,0) theory on a four-sphere which gives rise to a two-dimensional Toda theory at long distances. This construction realizes chiral Toda fields as edge modes trapped near the poles of the sphere. We relate our setup to compactifications of the (2,0) theory on the five and six-sphere. In this way, we explain a connection between half-BPS operators of the (2,0) theory and two-dimensional W-algebras, and derive an equality between their conformal anomalies. As we explain, all such relationships between the six-dimensional (2,0) theory and Toda field theory can be interpreted as statements about the edge modes of complex Chern-Simons on various three-manifolds with boundary.
