Title: A New Approach to Non-Abelian Hydrodynamics
Authors: Jose J. Fernandez-Melgarejo and Soo-Jong Rey and Piotr Sur√≥wka
Abstract: We present a new approach to describe hydrodynamics carrying non-Abelian macroscopic degrees of freedom. Based on the Kaluza-Klein compactification of a higher-dimensional neutral dissipative fluid on a group manifold, we obtain a d=4 colored dissipative fluid coupled to Yang-Mills gauge field. We calculate the transport coefficients of the new fluid, which show the non-Abelian character of the gauge group. In particular, we obtain group-valued terms in the gradient expansions and response quantities such as the conductivity matrix and the chemical potentials. While using SU(2) for simplicity, this approach is applicable to any gauge group. Resulting a robust description of non-Abelian hydrodynamics, we discuss some links between this system and quark-gluon plasma and fluid/gravity duality.
