Title: Classical and Quantum Nonlocal Supergravity
Authors: Stefano Giaccari and Leonardo Modesto
Abstract: We derive the N=1 supersymmetric extension for a class of weakly nonlocal four dimensional gravitational theories.The construction is explicitly done in the superspace and the tree-level perturbative unitarity is explicitly proved both in the superfield formalism and in field components. For the minimal nonlocal supergravity the spectrum is the same as in the local theory and in particular it is ghost-free. The supersymmetric extension of the super-renormalizable Starobinsky theory and of two alternative massive nonlocal supergravities are found as straightforward applications of the formalism. Power-counting arguments ensure super-renormalizability with milder requirement for the asymptotic behavior of form factors than in ordinary nonlocal gravity. The most noteworthy result, common to ordinary supergravity, is the absence of quantum corrections to the cosmological constant in any regularization procedure. We cannot exclude the usual one-loop quadratic divergences. However, local vertices in the superfields, not undergoing renormalization, can be introduced to cancel out such divergences. Therefore, quantum finiteness is certainly achieved in dimensional regularization and most likely also in the cut-off regularization scheme. We also discuss the n-point scattering amplitudes making use of a general field redefinition theorem implemented in the superspace. Finally, we show that all the exact solutions of the local supergravity in vacuum are solutions of the nonlocal one too. In particular, we have the usual Schwarzschild singularity. We infer that the weak nonlocality, even in the presence of minimal supersymmetry, is not sufficient to solve the spacetime singularities issue, although the theory is finite at quantum level.
