Title: Chaos in classical string dynamics in $\hatÎ³$ deformed $AdS_5  \times T^{1,1}$
Authors: Kamal L. Panigrahi and Manoranjan Samal
Abstract: We consider a circular string in $\hat{\gamma}$ deformed $AdS_5 \times T^{1,1}$ which is localized in the center of $AdS_5$ and winds around the two circles of deformed $T^{1,1}$. We observe chaos in the phase space of the circular string implying non-integrability of string dynamics. The chaotic behaviour in phase space is controlled by energy as well as the deforming parameter $\hat{\gamma}$. We further show that the point like object exhibits non-chaotic behaviour. Finally we calculate the Lyapunov exponent for both extended and point like object in support of our first result.
