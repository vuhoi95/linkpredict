Title: Topology and geometry cannot be measured by an operator measurement in  quantum gravity
Authors: David Berenstein and Alexandra Miller
Abstract: In the context of LLM geometries, we show that superpositions of classical coherent states of trivial topology can give rise to new classical limits where the topology of spacetime has changed. We argue that this phenomenon implies that neither the topology nor the geometry of spacetime can be the result of an operator measurement. We address how to reconcile these statements with the usual semiclassical analysis of low energy effective field theory for gravity.
