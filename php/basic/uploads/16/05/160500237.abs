Title: Stora's fine notion of divergent amplitudes
Authors: Joseph C. Várilly and José M. Gracia-Bondía
Abstract: Stora and coworkers refined the notion of divergent quantum amplitude, somewhat upsetting the standard power-counting recipe. This unexpectedly clears the way to new prototypes for free and interacting field theories of bosons of any mass and spin.
