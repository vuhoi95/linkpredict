Title: New Results on Charged Compact Boson Stars
Authors: Sanjeev Kumar and Usha Kulshreshtha and Daya Shankar Kulshreshtha
Abstract: In this work we present some new results which we have obtained in a study of the phase diagram of charged compact boson stars in the theory involving massive complex scalar fields coupled to the U(1) gauge field and gravity in a conical potential in the presence of a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ which we treat as a free parameter taking positive and negative values and thereby allowing us to study the theory in the de Sitter and Anti de Sitter spaces respectively. In our studies, we obtain four bifurcation points (possibility of more bifurcation points being not ruled out) in the de Sitter region. We present a detailed discussion of the various regions in our phase diagram with respect to four bifurcation points. Our theory is seen to have rich physics in a particular domain for positive values of $\Lambda$ which is consistent with the accelerated expansion of the universe.
