Title: Holographic Shear Viscosity in Hyperscaling Violating Theories without  Translational Invariance
Authors: Yi Ling and Zhuo-Yu Xian and Zhenhua Zhou
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density, $\eta/s$, in hyperscaling violating geometry with lattice structure. We show that the scaling relation with hyperscaling violation gives a strong constraint to the mass of graviton and usually leads to a power law of temperature, $\eta/s\sim T^\kappa$. We find the exponent $\kappa$ can be greater than two such that the new bound for viscosity raised in arXiv:1601.02757 is violated. Our above observation is testified by constructing specific solutions with UV completion in various holographic models. Finally, we compare the boundedness of $\kappa$ with the behavior of entanglement entropy and conjecture a relation between them.
