Title: Black lenses in string theory
Authors: Hari K. Kunduri and James Lucietti
Abstract: We present a new supersymmetric, asymptotically flat, black hole solution to five-dimensional U(1)^3-supergravity which is regular on and outside an event horizon of lens space topology L(2,1). The solution has seven independent parameters and uplifts to a family of 1/8-supersymmetric D1-D5-P black brane solutions to Type IIB supergravity. The decoupling limit is asymptotically AdS(3) x S^3 x T^4, with a near-horizon geometry that is a twisted product of the near-horizon geometry of the extremal BTZ black hole and L(2,1) x T^4, although it is not (locally) a product space in the bulk. We show that the decoupling limit of a special case of the black lens is related to that of a black ring by spectral flow, thereby supplying an account of its entropy. Analogous solutions of U(1)^N-supergravity are also presented.
