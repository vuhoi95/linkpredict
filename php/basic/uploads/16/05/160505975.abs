Title: Towards the fundamental spectrum of the Quantum Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Klaus Liegener and Thomas Thiemann
Abstract: In this work we focus on the quantum Einstein-Yang-Mills sector quantised by the methods of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). We point out the improved UV behaviour of the coupled system as compared to pure quantum Yang-Mills theory on a fixed, classical background spacetime as was considered in a seminal work by Kogut and Susskind. Furthermore, we develop a calculational scheme by which the fundamental spectrum of the quantum Yang-Mills Hamiltonian can be computed in principle and by which one can make contact to the Wilsonian renormalization group, possibly purely within the Hamiltonian framework. Finally, we comment on the relation of the fundamental spectrum to that of pure Yang-Mills theory on a (flat) classical spacetime.
