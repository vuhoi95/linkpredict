Title: A 1-parameter family of SO(3)-gauged maximal d=8 supergravities
Authors: Oscar Lasso Andino and Tomas Ortin
Abstract: We construct explicitly a 1-parameter family of SO$(3)$-gauged maximal $d=8$ supergravities that interpolates continuously between the theory constructed by Salam and Sezgin by Scherk-Schwarz compactification of $d=11$ supergravity and the theory constructed in Ref. cite{AlonsoAlberca:2000gh} by dimensional reduction of the so called "massive 11-dimensional supergravity" proposed by Meessen and Ort\'in earlier.
