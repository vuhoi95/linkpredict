Title: Gravitational Casimir effect at finite temperature
Authors: A. F. Santos and Faqir C. Khanna
Abstract: The energy-momentum tensor for the gravitoelectromagnetism (GEM) theory in the real-time finite temperature field theory formalism is presented. Expressions for the Casimir energy and pressure at zero and finite temperature are obtained. An analysis of the Casimir effect for the GEM field is developed.
