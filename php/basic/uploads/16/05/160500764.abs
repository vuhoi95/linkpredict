Title: Universal entropy relations: entropy formulae and entropy bound
Authors: Hang Liu and Xin-he Meng and Wei Xu and Bin Zhu
Abstract: We survey the applications of universal entropy relations in black holes with multi-horizons. In sharp distinction to conventional entropy product, the entropy relationship here not only improve our understanding of black hole entropy but was introduced as an elegant technique trick for handling various entropy bounds and sum. Despite the primarily technique role, entropy relations have provided considerable insight into several different types of gravity, including massive gravity, Einstein-Dilaton gravity and Horava-Lifshitz gravity. We present and discuss the results for each one.
