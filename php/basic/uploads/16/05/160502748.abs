Title: Weyl Consistency Conditions in Non-Relativistic Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Sridip Pal and Benjam√≠n Grinstein
Abstract: Weyl consistency conditions have been used in unitary relativistic quantum field theory to impose constraints on the renormalization group flow of certain quantities. We classify the Weyl anomalies and their renormalization scheme ambiguities for generic non-relativistic theories in 2+1 dimensions with anisotropic scaling exponent z=2; the extension to other values of z are discussed as well. We give the consistency conditions among these anomalies. As an application we find several candidates for a C-theorem. We comment on possible candidates for a $C$-theorem in higher dimensions.
