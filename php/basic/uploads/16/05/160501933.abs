Title: Conformal field theories from deformations of theories with $W_n$  symmetry
Authors: Juan Pablo Babaro and Gaston Giribet and Arash Ranjbar
Abstract: We construct a set of non-rational conformal field theories that consist of deformations of Toda field theory for sl(n). Besides conformal invariance, the theories still enjoy a remnant infinite-dimensional affine symmetry. The case n=3 is used to illustrate this phenomenon, together with further deformations that yield enhanced Kac-Moody symmetry algebras. For generic n we compute N-point correlation functions on the Riemann sphere and show that these can be expressed in terms of sl(n) Toda field theory correlation functions.
