Title: New Insights into Quantum Gravity from Gauge/gravity Duality
Authors: Netta Engelhardt and Gary T. Horowitz
Abstract: Using gauge/gravity duality, we deduce several nontrivial consequences of quantum gravity from simple properties of the dual field theory. These include: (1) a version of cosmic censorship, (2) restrictions on evolution through black hole singularities, and (3) the exclusion of certain cosmological bounces. In the classical limit, the latter implies a new singularity theorem.
