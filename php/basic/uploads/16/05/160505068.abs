Title: Interacting Ghost Dark Energy Model: Dynamical System Analysis
Authors: Hanif Golchin and Sara Jamali and Esmaeil Ebrahimi
Abstract: We study the impacts of interaction between dark matter and dark energy in the context of ghost dark energy model. Using the dynamical system analysis, we obtain the fixed points of the system for different types of interactions while the universe is filled with radiation, matter (including dark matter and luminous matter) and dark energy components. We consider the stability of the fixed points in details for different cases. In all cases there is an unstable matter dominated epoch and a stable late time dark energy dominated phase. However, we find that adding the linear interaction, the evolution of ghost dark energy model does not contain the radiation dominated epoch in the early times which is a necessary point in any cosmic model. This failure resolved when we add the non-linear interaction to the model. We also find an upper bound for the value of the coupling constant of the interaction between dark matter and dark energy as b < 0.57 . This bound is necessary to have a decelerating and unstable matter dominated phase.
