Title: 3d N=2 mirror symmetry, pq-webs and monopole superpotentials
Authors: Sergio Benvenuti and Sara Pasquetti
Abstract: D3 branes stretching between webs of (p,q) 5branes provide an interesting class of 3d N=2 theories. For generic pq-webs however the low energy field theory is not known. We use 3d mirror symmetry and Type IIB S-duality to construct Abelian gauge theories corresponding to D3 branes ending on both sides of a pq-web made of many coincident NS5's intersecting one D5. These theories contain chiral monopole operators in the superpotential and enjoy a non trivial pattern of global symmetry enhancements. In the special case of the pq-web with one D5 and one NS5, the 3d low energy SCFT admits three dual formulations. This triality can be applied locally inside bigger quiver gauge theories. We prove our statements using partial mirror symmetry `a la Kapustin-Strassler, showing the equality of the S^3_b partition functions and studying the quantum chiral rings.
