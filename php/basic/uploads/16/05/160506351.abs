Title: Two-loop six gluon all plus helicity amplitude
Authors: David C. Dunbar and Warren B. Perkins
Abstract: We present an analytic expression for the six-point all-plus helicity amplitude in QCD at two-loops. We compute the rational terms in a compact analytic form organised by their singularity structure.
