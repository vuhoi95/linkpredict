Title: Typicality in spin network states of quantum geometry
Authors: Fabio Anz√† and Goffredo Chirco
Abstract: In this work, we extend the so-called typicality approach, originally formulated in statistical mechanics contexts, to $SU(2)$-invariant spin-network states. Our results do not depend on the physical interpretation of the spin network; however, they are mainly motivated by the fact that spin-network states can describe states of quantum geometry, providing a gauge-invariant basis for the kinematical Hilbert space of several background-independent approaches to quantum gravity. The first result is, by itself, the existence of a regime in which we show the emergence of a typical state. We interpret this as the proof that in that regime there are certain (local) properties of quantum geometry which are "universal". Such a set of properties is heralded by the typical state, of which we give the explicit form. This is our second result. In the end, we study some interesting properties of the typical state, proving that the area law for the entropy of a surface must be satisfied at the local level, up to logarithmic corrections which we are able to bound.
