Title: Black holes in nonlinear electrodynamics: quasi-normal spectra and  parity splitting
Authors: Eliana Chaverra and Juan Carlos Degollado and Claudia Moreno and Olivier Sarbach
Abstract: We discuss the quasi-normal oscillations of black holes which are sourced by a nonlinear electrodynamic field. While previous studies have focused on the computation of quasi-normal frequencies for the wave or higher spin equation on a fixed background geometry described by such black holes, here we compute for the first time the quasi-normal frequencies for the coupled electromagnetic-gravitational linear perturbations. To this purpose, we consider a parametrized family of Lagrangians for the electromagnetic field which contains the Maxwell Lagrangian as a special case. In the Maxwell case, the unique spherically symmetric black hole solutions are described by the Reissner-Nordstr\"om family and in this case it is well-known that the quasi-normal spectra in the even- and odd-parity sectors are identical to each other. However, when moving away from the Maxwell case, we obtain deformed Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes, and we show that in this case there is a parity splitting in the quasi-normal mode spectra. A partial explanation for this phenomena is provided by considering the eikonal (high-frequency) limit.
