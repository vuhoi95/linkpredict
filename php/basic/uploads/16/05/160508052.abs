Title: Enhanced gauge symmetry in 6D F-theory models and tuned elliptic  Calabi-Yau threefolds
Authors: Samuel B. Johnson and Washington Taylor
Abstract: We systematically analyze the local combinations of gauge groups and matter that can arise in 6D F-theory models over a fixed base. We compare the low-energy constraints of anomaly cancellation to explicit F-theory constructions using Weierstrass and Tate forms, and identify some new local structures in the "swampland' of 6D supergravity and SCFT models that appear consistent from low-energy considerations but do not have known F-theory realizations. In particular, we classify and carry out a local analysis of all enhancements of the irreducible gauge and matter contributions from "non-Higgsable clusters," and on isolated curves and pairs of intersecting rational curves of arbitrary self-intersection. Such enhancements correspond physically to unHiggsings, and mathematically to tunings of the Weierstrass model of an elliptic CY threefold. We determine the shift in Hodge numbers of the elliptic threefold associated with each enhancement. We also consider local tunings on curves that have higher genus or intersect multiple other curves, codimension two tunings that give transitions in the F-theory matter content, tunings of abelian factors in the gauge group, and generalizations of the "$E_8$" rule to include tunings and curves of self-intersection zero. These tools can be combined into an algorithm that in principle enables a finite and systematic classification of all elliptic CY threefolds and corresponding 6D F-theory SUGRA models over a given compact base (modulo some technical caveats in various special circumstances), and are also relevant to the classification of 6D SCFT's. To illustrate the utility of these results, we identify some large example classes of known CY threefolds in the Kreuzer-Skarke database as Weierstrass models over complex surface bases with specific simple tunings, and we survey the range of tunings possible over one specific base.
