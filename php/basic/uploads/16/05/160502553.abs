Title: Relative Entropy, Mixed Gauge-Gravitational Anomaly and Causality
Authors: Arpan Bhattacharyya and Long Cheng and Ling-Yan Hung
Abstract: In this note we explored the holographic relative entropy in the presence of the 5d Chern-Simons term, which introduces a mixed gauge-gravity anomaly to the dual CFT. The theory trivially satisfies an entanglement first law. However, to quadratic order in perturbations of the stress tensor $T$ and current density $J$, there is a mixed contribution to the relative entropy bi-linear in $T$ and $J$, signalling a potential violation of the positivity of the relative entropy. Miraculously, the term vanishes up to linear order in a derivative expansion. This prompted a closer inspection on a different consistency check, that involves time-delay of a graviton propagating in a charged background, scattered via a coupling supplied by the Chern-Simons term. The analysis suggests that the time-delay can take either sign, potentially violating causality for any finite value of the CS coupling.
