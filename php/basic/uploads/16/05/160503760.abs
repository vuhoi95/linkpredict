Title: Twisted reality condition for spectral triple on two points
Authors: Ludwik Dabrowski and Andrzej Sitarz
Abstract: Lowest dimensional spectral triples with twisted reality condition over the function algebra on two points are discussed. The gauge perturbations (fluctuations), chiral gauge perturbations, conformal rescalings, and permutation of the two points are presented.
