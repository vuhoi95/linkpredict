Title: The Effect of Features on the Functional Form of the Scalar Power  Spectrum
Authors: D. J. Brooker and N. C. Tsamis and R. P. Woodard
Abstract: We study how the scalar power spectrum of single-scalar inflation depends functionally on models with features which have been proposed to explain anomalies in the data. We exploit a new formalism based on evolving the norm-squared of the scalar mode functions, rather than the mode functions themselves.
