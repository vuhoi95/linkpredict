Abstract: We use holography to study a $(1+1)$-dimensional Conformal Field Theory (CFT) coupled to an impurity. The CFT is an $SU(N)$ gauge theory at large $N$, with strong gauge interactions. The impurity is an $SU(N)$ spin. We trigger an impurity Renormalization Group (RG) flow via a Kondo coupling. The Kondo effect occurs only below the critical temperature of a large-$N$ mean-field transition. We show that at all temperatures $T$, spectral functions of certain bosonic operators exhibit a Fano resonance, which in the low-$T$ phase is a large-$N$ manifestation of the Kondo resonance. Such Fano resonances are characteristic features of RG flows between $(0+1)$-dimensional fixed points, and are thus distinct from those observed for example in quantum dots.
