Title: Relational Symplectic Groupoid Quantization for Constant Poisson  Structures
Authors: Alberto S. Cattaneo and Nima Moshayedi and Konstantin Wernli
Abstract: This note describes a quantization of the relational symplectic groupoid (RSG) for a constant Poisson structure using the BV-BFV formalism and shows how this induces the Moyal deformation quantization for the underlying Poisson manifold.
