Title: Critical points in Lovelock Black Holes
Authors: Antonia M. Frassino and Robert B. Mann and Fil Simovic
Abstract: We review some of the results obtained by introducing a thermodynamic pressure via the cosmological constant in a class of higher curvature theories known as Lovelock gravity. In particular, we focus on a specific relation between the higher-order Lovelock couplings that introduces a peculiar isolated critical point for hyperbolic black holes characterized by non-standard critical exponents.
