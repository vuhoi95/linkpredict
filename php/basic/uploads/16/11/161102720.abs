Title: A Proposal for measuring Anisotropic Shear Viscosity in Unitary Fermi  Gases
Authors: Rickmoy Samanta and Rishi Sharma and Sandip P. Trivedi
Abstract: We present a proposal to measure anisotropic shear viscosity in a strongly interacting, ultra-cold, unitary Fermi gas confined in a harmonic trap. We introduce anisotropy in this setup by strongly confining the gas in one of the directions with relatively weak confinement in the remaining directions. This system has a close resemblance to anisotropic strongly coupled field theories studied recently in the context of gauge-gravity duality. Computations in such theories (which have gravity duals) revealed that some of the viscosity components of the anisotropic shear viscosity tensor can be made much smaller than the entropy density, thus parametrically violating the bound proposed by Kovtun, Son and Starinets (KSS): $\frac {\eta} {s} \geq \frac{1}{4 \pi}$. A Boltzmann analysis performed in a system of weakly interacting particles in a linear potential also shows that components of the viscosity tensor can be reduced. Motivated by these exciting results, we propose two hydrodynamic modes in the unitary Fermi gas whose damping is governed by the component of shear viscosity expected to violate the KSS bound. One of these modes is the well known scissor mode. We estimate trap parameters for which the reduction in the shear viscosity is of order unity and find that the trap geometry, the damping timescales, and mode amplitudes are within the range of existing experimental setups on ultra-cold Fermi gases.
