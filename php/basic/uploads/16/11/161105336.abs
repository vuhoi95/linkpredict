Title: Constraining CPT-odd nonminimal interactions in the Electroweak sector
Authors: Victor E. Mouchrek-Santos and Manoel M. Ferreira Jr
Abstract: In this work, we propose two possibilities of CPT-odd and Lorentz-violating (LV) nonminimal couplings in the Electroweak sector. These terms are gauge-invariant and couple a fixed 4-vector to the physical fields of the theory. After determining the LV contributions to the electroweak currents, we reassess the evaluation of the decay rate for the vector mediators $W$ and $Z$. Using the experimental uncertainty in these decay rates, upper bounds of $1$ part in $10^{-15}$ (eV )$^{-1}$ and $10^{-14}$ (eV )$^{-1}$ are imposed on the magnitude of the proposed nonmimal interactions.
