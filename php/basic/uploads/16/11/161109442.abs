Title: Threshold corrections in heterotic flux compactifications
Authors: Carlo Angelantonj and Dan Israel and Matthieu Sarkis
Abstract: We compute the one-loop threshold corrections to the gauge and gravitational couplings for a large class of N=2 non-K\"ahler heterotic compactifications with three-form flux, consisting in principal two-torus bundles over K3 surfaces. We obtain the results as sums of BPS-states contributions, depending on the topological data of the bundle. We analyse also the worldsheet non-perturbative corrections coming from instantons wrapping the torus fiber, that are mapped under S-duality to D-instanton corrections in type I flux compactifications.
