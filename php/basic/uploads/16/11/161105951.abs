Title: Holographic QCD for H-dibaryon (uuddss)
Authors: Hideo Suganuma and Kohei Matsumoto
Abstract: The H-dibaryon (uuddss) is studied in holographic QCD for the first time. In holographic QCD, four-dimensional QCD, i.e., SU($N_c$) gauge theory with chiral quarks, can be formulated with $S^1$-compactified D4/D8/$\overline{\rm D8}$-brane system. In holographic QCD with large $N_c$, all the baryons appear as topological chiral solitons of Nambu-Goldstone bosons and (axial) vector mesons, and the H-dibaryon can be described as an SO(3)-type topological soliton with $B=2$. We derive the low-energy effective theory to describe the H-dibaryon in holographic QCD. The H-dibaryon mass is found to be twice of the $B=1$ hedgehog-baryon mass, $M_{\rm H} \simeq 2.00 M_{B=1}^{\rm HH}$, and is estimated about 1.7GeV, which is smaller than mass of two nucleons (flavor-octet baryons), in the chiral limit.
