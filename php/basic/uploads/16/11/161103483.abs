Title: A Study of confinement for $Q\bar{Q}$ potentials on D3, M2 & M5 branes
Authors: Edward Quijada and Henrique Boschi-Filho
Abstract: We study analytically and numerically the interaction potentials between a pair of quark an anti-quark on D3, M2 and M5 branes. These potentials are obtained using Maldacena's method involving Wilson loops and present confining and non-confining behaviours in different situations that we explore in this work.
