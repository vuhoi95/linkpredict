Title: Leading order multi-soft behaviors of tree amplitudes in NLSM
Authors: Yi-Jian Du and Hui Luo
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate multi-soft behaviors of tree amplitudes in nonlinear sigma model (NLSM). We prove that the leading behaviors of amplitudes with odd number of all adjacent soft pions are zero. We further propose and prove the leading behaviors of amplitudes with even number of all adjacent soft pions. The soft factors for this case are expressed in terms of products of the leading order Berends- Giele sub-currents in Cayley parametrization. Each sub-current in the expression contains at most one hard pion. We generalize our discussion to amplitudes containing arbitrary number of nonadjacent soft blocks: The leading behaviors of amplitudes where at least one soft block has odd number of adjacent soft pions are zero; The leading soft factors for amplitudes where all soft blocks containing even number of soft pions are given by products of soft factors for all blocks.
