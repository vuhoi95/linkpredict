Title: The fate of stringy AdS vacua and the WGC
Authors: Ulf Danielsson and Giuseppe Dibitetto
Abstract: The authors of arXiv:1610.01533 have recently proposed a stronger version of the weak gravity conjecture (WGC), based on which they concluded that all those non-supersymmetric AdS vacua that can be embedded within a constistent theory of quantum gravity necessarily develop instabilities. In this paper we further elaborate on this proposal by arguing that the aforementioned instabilities have a perturbative nature and arise from the crucial interplay between the closed and the open string sectors of the theory.
