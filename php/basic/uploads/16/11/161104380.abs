Title: QCD amplitudes with 2 initial spacelike legs via generalised BCFW  recursion
Authors: Andreas van Hameren and Krzysztof Kutak and Mirko Serino
Abstract: We complete the generalisation of the BCFW recursion relation to the off-shell case, allowing for the computation of tree-level scattering amplitudes for full High Energy Factorisation (HEF), i.e.\ with both incoming partons having a non-vanishing transverse momentum. We provide explicit results for color-ordered amplitudes with two off-shell legs in massless QCD up to 4 point, continuing the program begun in two previous papers. For the 4-fermion amplitudes, which are not BCFW-recursible, we perform a diagrammatic computation, so as to offer a complete set of expressions. We show the squared $2 \rightarrow 2$ matrix elements as function of the differences in rapidity and azimuthal angle of the final state particles, and explicitly show and discuss some plots.
