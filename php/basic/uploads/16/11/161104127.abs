Title: Construction of the moduli space of Spin (7)-instantons
Authors: Vicente Mu√±oz and Carlos S. Shahbazi
Abstract: We construct the moduli space of Spin(7)-instantons on a hermitian complex vector bundle over a closed 8-dimensional manifold endowed with a (possibly non-integrable) Spin(7)-structure. We find suitable perturbations that achieve regularity of the moduli space, so that it is smooth and of the expected dimension over the irreducible locus.
