Title: Effective long wavelength scalar dynamics in de Sitter
Authors: Ian Moss and Gerasimos Rigopoulos
Abstract: We discuss the effective infrared theory governing a light scalar's long wavelength dynamics in de Sitter spacetime. We show how the separation of scales around the physical curvature radius $k/a \sim H$ can be performed consistently with a window function and how short wavelengths can be integrated out in the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral formalism. At leading order, and for time scales $\Delta t \gg H^{-1}$, this results in the well-known Starobinsky stochastic evolution. Our approach allows for the computation of quantum UV corrections, generating an effective potential on which the stochastic dynamics takes place, as well as the description of dynamics on spatial and temporal scales comparable to $H^{-1}$ and above. We further elaborate on the use of a Wigner function to evaluate the non-perturbative expectation values of field correlators and the stress-energy tensor of $\phi$ within the stochastic formalism.
