Title: Meson masses and decay constants at large $N$
Authors: Margarita García Pérez and Antonio González-Arroyo and Masanori Okawa
Abstract: Meson masses and decay constants in the large $N$ limit of SU($N$) gauge theory are determined using the twisted Eguchi-Kawai reduced model. To this end, we make use of a recently defined smearing method valid on the one-point lattice. This procedure, in combination with a variational analysis, allows to obtain reliable values for these quantities.
