Title: Horizon Fluffs: In the Context of Generalized Minimal Massive Gravity
Authors: M. R. Setare and H. Adami
Abstract: We consider a metric which describes Ba$\tilde{\text{n}}$ados geometries and show that the considered metric is a solution of generalized minimal massive gravity (GMMG) model. We consider the Killing vector field which preserves the form of considered metric. Using the off-shell quasi-local approach we obtain the asymptotic conserved charges of given solution. Similar to the Einstein gravity in the presence of negative cosmological constant, for the GMMG model also, we show that the algebra among the asymptotic conserved charges is isomorphic to two copies of the Virasoro algebra. Eventually, we find relation between the algebra of the near horizon and the asymptotic conserved charges. This relation show that the main part of the horizon fluffs proposal of Refs.\cite{140,14} appear for generic black holes in the class of Ba$\tilde{\text{n}}$ados geometries in the context of GMMG model.
