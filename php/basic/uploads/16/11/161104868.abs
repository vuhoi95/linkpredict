Authors: Guido Festuccia and Jian Qiu and Jacob Winding and Maxim Zabzine
Abstract: We construct 4D $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories on an infinite family of 4D toric manifolds with the topology of connected sums of $S^2 \times S^2$. These theories are constructed through the dimensional reduction along a non-trivial $U(1)$-fiber of 5D theories on toric Sasaki-Einstein manifolds. We discuss the conditions under which such reductions can be carried out and give a partial classification result of the resulting 4D manifolds. We calculate the partition functions of these 4D theories and they involve both instanton and anti-instanton contributions, thus generalizing Pestun's famous result on $S^4$.
