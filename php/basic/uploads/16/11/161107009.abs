Title: Testing Quantum Black Holes with Gravitational Waves
Authors: Valentino F. Foit and Matthew Kleban
Abstract: We argue that near-future detections of gravity waves from merging black hole binaries will either confirm or conclusively rule out a long-standing proposal, originally due Bekenstein and Mukhanov, that the areas of black hole horizons are quantized in integer multiples of the Planck area times an O(1) constant \alpha. A single measurement of the "ring down" phase after a binary merger, if consistent with the predictions of classical general relativity, will rule out most or all (depending on the spin of the hole) of the extant proposals in the literature for the value of \alpha. A measurement of two such events for final black holes with substantially different spins will rule out the proposal for any \alpha.
