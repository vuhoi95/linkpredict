Title: Volume reduction through perturbative Wilson loops
Authors: Margarita Garcia Perez and Antonio Gonzalez-Arroyo and Masanori Okawa
Abstract: We derive the perturbative expansion of Wilson loops to order g^4 in a SU(N) lattice gauge theory with twisted boundary conditions. Our expressions show that the thermodynamic limit is attained at infinite N for any number of lattice sites and allow to quantify the deviations from volume independence at finite large N as a function of the twist.
