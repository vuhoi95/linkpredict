Title: Phase Plane Analysis of Metric-Scalar Torsion Model for Interacting Dark  Energy
Authors: Arshdeep Singh Bhatia and Sourav Sur
Abstract: We study the phase space dynamics of the non-minimally coupled Metric-Scalar-Torsion model in both Jordan and Einstein frames. We specifically check for the existence of critical points which yield stable solutions representing the current state of accelerated expansion of the universe fuelled by the Dark Energy. It is found that such solutions do indeed exist, subject to constraints on the free model parameter. In fact the evolution of the universe at these stable critical points exactly matches the evolution given by the cosmological solutions we found analytically in our previous work on the subject.
