Abstract: In this paper, we explore the quantum spacetimes that are potentially connected with the generalized uncertainty principles. By analyzing the gravity-induced quantum interference pattern and the Gedanken for weighting photon, we find that the generalized uncertainty principles inspire the effective Newton constant as same as our previous proposal. A characteristic momentum associated with the tidal effect is suggested, which incorporates the quantum effect with the geometric nature of gravity. When the simplest generalized uncertainty principle is considered, the minimal model of the regular black holes is reproduced by the effective Newton constant. The black hole's tunneling probability, accurate to the second order correction, is carefully analyzed. We find that the tunneling probability is regularized by the size of the black hole remnant. Moreover, the black hole remnant is the final state of a tunneling process that the probability is minimized. A theory of modified gravity is suggested, by substituting the effective Newton constant into the Hilbert-Einstein action.
