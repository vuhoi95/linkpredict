Title: Gauge fermions with flat bands and anomalous transport via chiral modes  from breaking gauge symmetry
Authors: Xi Luo and Yue Yu
Abstract: The dispersionless longitudinal photon in Maxwell theory is thought of as a redundant degree of freedom due to the gauge symmetry. We find that when there exist exactly flat bands with zero energy in a condensed matter system, the fermion field may locally transform as a gauge field and the system possesses a gauge symmetry. As the longitudinal photon, the redundant degrees of freedom from the flat bands must be gauged away from the physical states. As an example, we study spinless fermions on a generalized Lieb lattice in three dimensions. The flat band of the longitudinal fermion induces a gauge symmetry. An external magnetic field breaks this gauge symmetry and emerges a bunch of non-topologically chiral modes. Combining these emergent chiral modes with the chiral anomaly mode which is of an opposite chirality, rich anomalous electric transport phenomena exhibit and are expected to be observed in Pd$_3$Bi$_2$S$_2$ and Ag$_3$Se$_2$Au.
