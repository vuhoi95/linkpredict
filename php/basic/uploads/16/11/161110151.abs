Title: Entropy spectrum of charged BTZ black holes in massive gravity's rainbow
Authors: Behzad Eslam Panah and Shahram Panahiyan
Abstract: Regarding the significant interests in massive gravity's rainbow and also BTZ black holes, we apply the formalism introduced by Jiang and Han in order to investigate the quantization of the entropy of black holes. We show that the entropy of BTZ black holes in massive gravity's rainbow is quantized with equally spaced spectra and it depends on the value of the parameters of this black hole such as; massive parameters, electrical charge, the cosmological constant and also rainbow functions.
