Title: Effective pion mass term and the trace anomaly
Authors: Maarten Golterman and Yigal Shamir
Abstract: Recently, we developed an effective theory of pions and a light dilatonic meson for gauge theories with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry that are close to the conformal window. The pion mass term in this effective theory depends on an exponent $y$. We derive the transformation properties under dilatations of the renormalized fermion mass, and use this to rederive $y=3-\gamma_m^*$, where $\gamma_m^*$ is fixed-point value of the mass anomalous dimension at the sill of the conformal window. This value for $y$ is consistent with the trace anomaly of the underlying near-conformal gauge theory.
