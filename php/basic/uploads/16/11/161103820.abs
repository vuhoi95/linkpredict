Title: Twist Two Operator Approach for Even Spin Glueball Masses and Pomeron  Regge Trajectory from the Hardwall Model
Authors: Diego M. Rodrigues and Eduardo Folco Capossoli and Henrique Boschi-Filho
Abstract: We compute the masses of even spin glueball states $ J^{PC} $, with $ P=C=+1 $, using a twist two operator from an AdS/QCD model known as the hardwall model, using Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Within this approach, we found that the glueball masses are comparable with those in literature. From these masses, we obtained the Pomeron Regge trajectories for both boundary conditions in agreement with experimental data available and other holographic models.
