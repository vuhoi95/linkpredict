Title: Some Developments in Gribov's Approach to QCD
Authors: Patrick Cooper and Daniel Zwanziger
Abstract: We review several developments in the formulation of QCD provided by the GZ action. These include the GZ-action at finite temperature, the relation of the horizon condition and the Kugo-Ojima confinement criterion, the relation of the horizon condition and the dual-Meisssner effect, the alternative derivation of the GZ action provided by the Maggiore-Schaden shift, and the spontaneous breaking of BRST symmetry. We conclude with a proposal for the definition of physical states in the presence of BRST breaking.
