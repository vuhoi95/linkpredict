Title: Spiked Instantons from Intersecting D-branes
Authors: Nikita Nekrasov and Naveen S. Prabhakar
Abstract: The moduli space of spiked instantons that arises in the context of the BPS/CFT correspondence is realised as the moduli space of classical vacua, i.e. low-energy open string field configurations, of a certain stack of intersecting D1-branes and D5-branes in Type IIB string theory. The presence of a constant B-field induces an interesting dynamics involving the tachyon condensation.
