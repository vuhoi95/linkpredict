Title: Weiss oscillations and particle-hole symmetry at the half-filled Landau  level
Authors: Alfred K. C. Cheung and S. Raghu and Michael Mulligan
Abstract: Particle-hole symmetry in the lowest Landau level of the two-dimensional electron gas requires the electrical Hall conductivity to equal $\pm e^2/2h$ at half-filling. We study the consequences of weakly broken particle-hole symmetry for magnetoresistance oscillations about half-filling in the presence of an applied periodic one-dimensional electrostatic potential. At fixed electron density, the oscillation minima are asymmetrically biased towards higher magnetic fields, while at fixed magnetic field, the oscillations occur symmetrically as the electron density is varied about half-filling. We find an approximate "sum rule" obeyed for all pairs of oscillation minima that can be tested in experiment. We discuss the implications of our results and approximations for the description of the half-filled Landau level.
