Title: de Sitter as a Resonance
Authors: Jonathan Maltz and Leonard Susskind
Abstract: A quantum mechanical formulation of de Sitter cosmological spacetimes still eludes string theory. In this paper we conjecture a potentially rigorous framework in which the status of de Sitter space is the same as that of a resonance in a scattering process. We conjecture that transition amplitudes between certain states with asymptotically supersymmetric flat vacua contain resonant poles characteristic meta-stable intermediate states. A calculation employing constrained instantons illustrates this idea.
