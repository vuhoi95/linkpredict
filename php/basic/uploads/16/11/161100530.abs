Authors: Abdelmalek Boumali and Nadjette Messai
Abstract: In this paper, the problem of a two-dimensional Duffin-Petiau-Kemmer (DKP) oscillator in the presence of a coulomb potential in the cosmic string background is solved. The eigensolutions of the problem in question have been found, and the influence of the cosmic string space-time on the eigenvalues has been analyzed.
