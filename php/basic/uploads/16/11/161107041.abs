Title: A mild source for the Wu-Yang magnetic monopole
Authors: C. P. Constantinidis and L. A. Ferreira and G. Luchini
Abstract: We establish that the Wu-Yang monopole needs the introduction of a magnetic point source at the origin in order for it to be a solution of the integral equations for the Yang-Mills theory. That result is corroborated by the analysis of the differential Yang-Mills equations using distribution theory. The subtlety lies on the fact that with the non-vanishing magnetic point source required by the Yang-Mills integral equations, the Wu-Yang monopole configuration does not violate, in the sense of distribution theory, the differential Bianchi identity.
