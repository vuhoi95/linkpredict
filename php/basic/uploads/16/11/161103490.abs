Title: Mesons from (non) Abelian T-dual backgrounds
Authors: Georgios Itsios and Carlos Nunez and Dimitrios Zoakos
Abstract: In this work we study mesonic excitations in a Quantum Field Theory dual to the non Abelian T-dual of $AdS_5\times S^5$, using a D6 brane probe on the Sfetsos-Thompson background. Before and after the duality, we observe interesting differences between the spectra and interpret them. The spectrum of masses and the interactions among mesonic excitations teach valuable lessons about the character of non-Abelian T-duality and its implications for Holography. The case of Abelian T-duality is also studied.
