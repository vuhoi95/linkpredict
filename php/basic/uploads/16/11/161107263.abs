Title: A numerical study of non-perturbative corrections to the Chiral  Separation Effect in quenched finite-density QCD
Authors: M. Puhr and P. V. Buividovich
Abstract: We study the Chiral Separation Effect (CSE) in quenched finite-density QCD using a recently developed numerical method which allows, for the first time, to address the transport properties of exactly chiral lattice fermions at finite chemical potential. For topologically trivial gauge field configurations we find that the axial current depends linearly on the external magnetic field and chemical potential, with a slope being consistent with the free fermion result. However, for configurations with nontrivial topology in the confinement regime the axial current is strongly suppressed due to contributions of topological modes of the Dirac operator. Together with an analytic demonstration of vanishing CSE in topologically nontrivial background of constant chromo-electric and chromo-magnetic fields, this suggests that non-perturbative corrections to CSE might have topological origin.
