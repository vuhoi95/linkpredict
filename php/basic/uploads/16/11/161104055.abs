Title: A Calculus for Conformal Hypersurfaces and new higher Willmore energy  functionals
Authors: A. Rod Gover and Andrew Waldron
Abstract: The invariant theory for conformal hypersurfaces is studied by treating these as the conformal infinity of a conformally compact manifold: For a given conformal hypersurface embedding, a distinguished ambient metric is found (within its conformal class) by solving a singular version of the Yamabe problem. Using existence results for asymptotic solutions to this problem, we develop the details of how to proliferate conformal hypersurface invariants. In addition we show how to compute the the solution's asymptotics. We also develop a calculus of conformal hypersurface invariant differential operators and in particular, describe how to compute extrinsically coupled analogues of conformal Laplacian powers. Our methods also enable the study of integrated conformal hypersurface invariants and their functional variations. As a main application we develop new higher dimensional analogues of the Willmore energy for embedded surfaces. This complements recent progress on the existence and construction of such functionals.
