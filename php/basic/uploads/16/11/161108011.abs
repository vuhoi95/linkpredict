Title: Entropic destruction of a rotating heavy quarkonium
Authors: Zi-qiang Zhang and Chong Ma and De-fu Hou and Gang Chen
Abstract: Using the AdS/CFT duality, we study the destruction of a rotating heavy quarkonium due to the entropice force in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory and a confining YM theory. It is shown that in both theories increasing the angular velocity leads to decreasing the entropic force. This result implies that the rotating quarkonium dissociates harder than the static case.
