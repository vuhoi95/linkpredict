Title: Black hole mining in the RST model
Authors: Rohitvarma Basavaraju and David A. Lowe
Abstract: We consider the possibility of mining black holes in the 1+1-dimensional dilaton gravity model of Russo, Susskind and Thorlacius. The model correctly incorporates Hawking radiation and back-reaction in a semiclassical expansion in 1/N, where N is the number of matter species. It is shown that the lifetime of a perturbed black hole is independent of the addition of any extra apparatus when realized by an arbitrary positive energy matter source. We conclude that mining does not occur in the RST model and comment on the implications of this for the black hole information paradox.
