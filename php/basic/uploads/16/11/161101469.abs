Title: GUP parameter from quantum corrections to the Newtonian potential
Authors: Fabio Scardigli and Gaetano Lambiase and Elias Vagenas
Abstract: We propose a technique to compute the deformation parameter of the generalized uncertainty principle by using the leading quantum corrections to the Newtonian potential. The calculation gives, to first order, an unambiguous numerical result. The physical meaning of this value is discussed, and compared with analogous previous results, as well as with known bounds on the generalized uncertainty principle deformation parameter.
