Title: Holographic Entanglement Entropy for Gravitational Anomaly in Four  Dimensions
Authors: Tibra Ali and S. Shajidul Haque and Jeff Murugan
Abstract: We compute the holographic entanglement entropy for the pure gravitational anomaly in 3+1 dimensions. Using the perturbative method developed for computing entanglement entropy for quantum field theories, we also compute the parity odd contribution to the entanglement entropy of the dual field theory that comes from a background gravitational Chern-Simons term. We find that, in leading order in the perturbation of the background geometry, the two contributions match except for a logarithmic divergent term on the field theory side. We interpret this extra contribution as encoding our ignorance of the source which creates the perturbation of the geometry.
