Abstract: We study off-shell rigid limits for the kinetic and scalar-potential terms os a single N=2 hypermultiplet. In the kinetic term, these rigid limits establish relations between four-dimensional quaternion-Kahler and hyper-Kahler target spaces with symmetry. The scalar potential is obtained by gauging the graviphoton along an isometry of the quaternion-Kahler space. The rigid limits unveil two distinct cases. A rigid N=2 theory on Minkowski or on AdS_4 spacetime, depending on whether the isometry is translational or rotational respectively. We apply these results to the quaternion-Kahler space with Heisenberg x U(1) isometry, which describes the universal hypermultiplet at type-II string one-loop.
