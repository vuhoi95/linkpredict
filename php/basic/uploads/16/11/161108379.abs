Title: Bulk viscous corrections to screening and damping in QCD at high  temperatures
Authors: Qianqian Du and Adrian Dumitru and Yun Guo and Michael Strickland
Abstract: Non-equilibrium corrections to the distribution functions of quarks and gluons in a hot and dense QCD medium modify the "hard thermal loops" (HTL). The HTLs determine the retarded, advanced, and symmetric (time-ordered) propagators for gluons with soft momenta as well as the Debye screening and Landau damping mass scales. We compute such corrections to a thermal as well as to a non-thermal fixed point.The screening and damping mass scales are sensitive to the bulk pressure and hence to (pseudo-) critical dynamical scaling of the bulk viscosity in the vicinity of a second-order critical point. This could be reflected in the properties of quarkonium bound states in the deconfined phase and in the dynamics of soft gluon fields.
