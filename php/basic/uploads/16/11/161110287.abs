Title: The Area-Angular Momentum-Charge Inequality for Black Holes With  Positive Cosmological Constant
Authors: Edward T. Bryden and Marcus A. Khuri
Abstract: We establish the conjectured area-angular momentum-charge inequality for stable apparent horizons in the presence of a positive cosmological constant, and show that it is saturated precisely for extreme Kerr-Newman-de Sitter horizons. As with previous inequalities of this type, the proof is reduced to minimizing an `area functional' related to a harmonic map energy; in this case maps are from the 2-sphere to the complex hyperbolic plane. The proof here is simplified compared to previous results for less embellished inequalities, due to the observation that the functional is convex along geodesic deformations in the target.
