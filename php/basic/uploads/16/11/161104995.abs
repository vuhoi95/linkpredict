Abstract: In recent years, Planck-scale modifications to particles' dispersion relation have been deeply studied for the possibility to formulate some phenomenology of Planckian effects in astrophysical and cosmological frameworks. There are some indications [arXiv:gr-qc/0611024] that Finsler geometry can provide some generalization of Riemannian geometry which may allow to account for non-trivial (Planckian) structure of relativistic particles' configuration space. We investigate the possibility to formalize Planck-scale deformations to relativistic models in curved spacetime, within the framework of Finsler geometry. We take into account the general strategy of analysis of modifications of dispersion relations in curved spacetimes proposed in [arXiv:1507.02056], generalizing to the de Sitter case the results obtained in [arXiv:1407.8143], for deformed relativistic particle kinematics in flat spacetime using Finsler formalism.
