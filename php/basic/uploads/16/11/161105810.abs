Title: Geometrical origin of the energy-momentum dispersion relation
Authors: Apimook Watcharangkool and Mairi Sakellariadou
Abstract: We investigate a link between the energy-momentum dispersion relation and the spectral distance in the context of a Lorentzian almost-commutative spectral geometry, defined by the product of Minkowski spacetime and an internal discrete noncommutative space. Using the causal structure, the almost-commutative manifold can be identified with a pair of four-dimensional Minkowski spacetimes embedded in a five-dimensional Minkowski geometry. Considering fermions travelling within the light cone of the ambient five-dimensional spacetime, we then derive the energy-momentum dispersion relation.
