Authors: J. Fernando G. Barbero and Juan Margalef-Bentabol and Eduardo J. S. Villase√±or
Abstract: We discuss the unitarity of the quantum evolution between arbitrary Cauchy surfaces of a 1+1 dimensional free scalar field defined on a bounded spatial region and subject to several types of boundary conditions including Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin.
