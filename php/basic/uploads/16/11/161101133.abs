Title: Defects and boundary RG flows in $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}_d$
Authors: Melanie Becker and Yaniel Cabrera and Daniel Robbins
Abstract: We show that topological defects in the language of Landau-Ginzburg models carry information about the RG flow between the non-compact orbifolds $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}_d$. We show that such defects correctly implement the bulk-induced RG flow on the boundary.
