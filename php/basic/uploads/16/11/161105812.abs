Title: Generalized Inönü-Wigner Contraction as $S$-Expansion with Infinite  Semigroup and Ideal Subtraction
Authors: D. M. Peñafiel and L. Ravera
Abstract: According to the literature, the $S$-expansion procedure involving a finite semigroup can reproduce a standard In\"on\"u-Wigner contraction. In the present paper, we propose a new prescription for $S$-expansion, involving an infinite abelian semigroup $S_E^{(\infty)}$, with subsequent subtraction of a suitable infinite ideal. Our approach is a generalization of the finite $S$-expansion procedure, and it allows to reproduce a generalized In\"on\"u-Wigner contraction via infinite $S$-expansion between two different algebras, extending the results presented in the literature. We can then write the invariant tensors of the target algebras in terms of those of the starting ones. We also give some interesting examples of application.
