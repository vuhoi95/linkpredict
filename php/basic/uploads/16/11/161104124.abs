Title: Extended soft-wall model for the QCD phase diagram
Authors: Rico ZÃ¶llner and Falk Wunderlich and Burkhard Kampfer
Abstract: The soft-wall model, emerging as bottom-up holographic scenario anchored in the AdS/CFT correspondence, displays the disappearance of normalisable modes referring to vector mesons at a temperature $T_{\dis}$ depending on the chemical potential $\mu$, $T_{\dis}(\mu)$. We explore options for making $T_{\dis}(\mu)$ consistent with the freeze-out curve $T_{\rm f.o.}(\mu)$ from relativistic heavy-ion collisions and the cross-over curve $T_{\rm c}(\mu)$ from QCD at small values of $\mu$.
