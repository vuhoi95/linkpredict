Title: $ε$-Expansion in Critical $φ^3$-Theory on Real Projective  Space from Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Chika Hasegawa and Yu Nakayama
Abstract: We use a compatibility between the conformal symmetry and the equations of motion to solve the one-point function in the critical $\phi^3$-theory (a.k.a the critical Lee-Yang model) on the $d = 6 - \epsilon$ dimensional real projective space to the first non-trivial order in the $\epsilon$-expansion. It reproduces the conventional perturbation theory and agrees with the numerical conformal bootstrap result.
