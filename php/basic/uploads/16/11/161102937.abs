Abstract: Regarding the significant interests in thermodynamics of black objects, we examine charged BTZ black holes. We consider massive gravity context with an energy dependent spacetime to enrich the results. In addition, we consider all the constants as energy dependant ones. We investigate thermodynamic properties of the solutions by calculating the heat capacity and free energy. We also analyze thermal stability and study the possibility of Hawking-Page phase transition. At last, we study geometrical thermodynamics of these black holes.
