Title: Holographic Complexity and Two Identities of Action Growth
Authors: Hyat Huang and Xing-Hui Feng and H. Lu
Abstract: The recently proposed complexity-action conjecture allows one to calculate how fast one can produce a quantum state from a reference state in terms of the on-shell action of the dual AdS black hole at the Wheeler-DeWitt patch. We show that the action growth rate is given by the difference of the generalized enthalpy between the two corresponding horizons. The proof relies on the second identity that the surface-term contribution on a horizon is given by the product of the associated temperature and entropy.
