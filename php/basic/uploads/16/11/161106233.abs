Title: Greybody factors for a nonminimally coupled scalar field in BTZ  black-hole background
Authors: Grigoris Panotopoulos and Angel Rincon
Abstract: In the present work we study the greybody factors for a nonminimally scalar field in BTZ black-hole background. We find analytical expressions for the reflection coefficient, the absorption cross-section, and the decay rate, and we show in figures what the role of the angular-momentum and the coupling is. Our results show that in the zero angular-momentum case the greybody factor in the low energy regime tends to a finite constant that does not always coincide with the area of the horizon of the black-hole. There is, however, a special case in which this is true.
