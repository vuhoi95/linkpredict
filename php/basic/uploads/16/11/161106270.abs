Title: Weak Gravity Conjecture and Extremal Black Holes
Authors: William Cottrell and Gary Shiu and Pablo Soler
Abstract: Motivated by the desire to improve our understanding of the Weak Gravity Conjecture, we compute the one-loop correction of charged particles to the geometry and entropy of extremal black holes in 4d. Contrary to expectations, we find that loops of massive charged particles can radically alter the classical black hole geometry and that fermion loops provide evidence for the necessity of the `magnetic' WGC cutoff. The corrections are reduced when supersymmetry is present, and disappear in ${\cal N}=4$ supergravity. We further provide some speculative arguments that in a theory with only sub-extremal particles, classical Reisner-Nordstrom black holes actually possess an infinite microcanonical entropy, though only a finite amount is visible to an external observer.
