Title: ER= EPR and Non-Perturbative Action Integrals for Quantum Gravity
Authors: L. A Alasfar and S. Alsaleh
Abstract: In this paper, we summarise a conjuncture for constructing and calculating path integrals (in non perturbative fashion ) by summing over homotopy classes of paths in a multiply-connected spacetime. The topology of the spacetime is defined by Einstein-Rosen bridges (ERB) forming from the entanglement of Wheeler's quantum foam described by S.W Hawking paper 'Virtual Blackholes' (Phys.Rev. D53 (1996) 3099-3107). Because these 'bubbles' are entangled, they are connected by Plankian ERB's by the ER=EPR conjecture of L. Susskind Hence the spacetime will possess a large first Betti number $ B_1$. For any compact 2-surface in the spacetime, the topology ( in particular the homotopy ) of that surface is not trivial, due to the large number of Plankian ERB's that define homotopy though this surface. The quantisation of spacetime with this topology - along with the proper choice of the 2-surfaces- is conjectured to allow a non perturbative path integrals of quantum gravity theory over the spacetime manifold. The task is rather formidable, in this letter only hand-waving formulation is discussed.
