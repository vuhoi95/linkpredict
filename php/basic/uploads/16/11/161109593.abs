Title: Spin Chains and Gustafson's Integrals
Authors: S. E. Derkachov and A. N. Manashov
Abstract: The Gustafson's integrals are the multidimensional generalization of the classical Mellin--Barnes integrals. We show that some of these integrals arise from relations between matrix elements in the Sklyanin's representation of Separated Variables in the spin chain models. We also present several new integrals.
