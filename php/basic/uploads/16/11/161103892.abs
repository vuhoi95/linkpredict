Title: Equations of motion for charged particles in strong laser fields
Authors: Hartmut Ruhl and Christian Herzing
Abstract: Starting from the Dirac equation coupled to a classical radiation field a set of equations of motion for charged quasi-particles in the classical limit for slowly varying radiation and matter fields is derived. The radiation reaction term derived in the paper is the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac term.
