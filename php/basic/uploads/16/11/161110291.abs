Title: Ubiquity of non-geometry in heterotic compactifications
Authors: Iñaki García-Etxebarria and Dieter Lust and Stefano Massai and Christoph Mayrhofer
Abstract: We study the effect of quantum corrections on heterotic compactifications on elliptic fibrations away from the stable degeneration limit, elaborating on a recent observation by Malmendier and Morrison. We show that already for the simplest non-trivial elliptic fibration the effect is quite dramatic: the $I_1$ degeneration with trivial gauge background dynamically splits into two T-fects with monodromy around each T-fect being (conjugate to) T-duality along one of the legs of the $T^2$. This implies that almost every elliptic heterotic compactification becomes a non-geometric T-fold away from the stable degeneration limit. We also point out a subtlety due to this non-geometric splitting at finite fiber size. It arises when determining, via heterotic/F-theory duality, the SCFTs associated to a small number of pointlike instantons probing heterotic ADE singularities. Along the way we resolve various puzzles in the literature.
