Title: CFT Duals for Ultra-Spinning Gauged Supergravity Black Holes
Authors: S. M. Noorbakhsh and M. Ghominejad
Abstract: Recently a new class of asymptotically AdS ultra-spinning black holes has been constructed with non-compact horizon of finite area [1], in which the asymptotic rotation is effectively boosted to the speed of light. We employ this technique to the $4$-dimensional $U(1)^4$ and $5$-dimensional $U(1)^3$ gauged supergravity black holes. The obtained new exact black hole solutions for both cases possess a non-compact horizon; their topologies are sphere with two punctures. We then demonstrate that the ultra-spinning limit commutes with the extremality condition as well as the near horizon limit for both black holes. We also show that the near horizon extremal geometries of the resulting ultra-spinning gauged supergravity black holes lead to the well-known result which contains an AdS$_2$ throat. We then obtain the $[(d-1)/2]$ central charges of the dual CFTs. By assuming the Cardy formula, we show that despite the non-compactness of the horizon, microscopic entropy of the dual CFT is precisely equivalent to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
