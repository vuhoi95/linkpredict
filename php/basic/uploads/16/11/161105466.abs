Title: Sphalerons in composite and non-standard Higgs models
Authors: Michael Spannowsky and Carlos Tamarit
Abstract: After the discovery of the Higgs boson and the rather precise measurement of all electroweak boson's masses the local structure of the electroweak symmetry breaking potential is already quite well established. However, despite being a key ingredient to a fundamental understanding of the underlying mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking, the global structure of the electroweak potential remains entirely unknown. The existence of sphalerons, unstable solutions of the classical action of motion that are interpolating between topologically distinct vacua, is a direct consequence of the Standard Model's $\mathrm{SU}(2)_L$ gauge group. Nevertheless, the sphaleron energy depends on the shape of the Higgs potential away from the minimum and can therefore be a litmus test for its global structure. Focusing on two scenarios, the minimal composite Higgs model $\mathrm{SO}(5)/\mathrm{SO}(4)$ or an elementary Higgs with a deformed electroweak potential, we calculate the change of the sphaleron energy compared to the Standard Model prediction. We find that the sphaleron energy would have to be measured to $\mathcal{O}(10)\%$ accuracy to exclude sizeable global deviations from the Standard Model Higgs potential. We further find that because of the periodicity of the scalar potential in composite Higgs models a second sphaleron branch with larger energy arises.
