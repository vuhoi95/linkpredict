Title: Emergent symmetry in a thermal pure state path integral
Authors: Shin-ichi Sasa and Sho Sugiura and Yuki Yokokura
Abstract: We study a thermally isolated quantum many-body system with an external control represented by a time-dependent parameter. By formulating a path integral in terms of thermal pure states, we derive an effective action for trajectories in a thermodynamic state space, where the entropy appears with its conjugate variable. In particular, when operations are quasi-static, the symmetry for the uniform translation of the conjugate variable emerges in the path integral. This leads to the entropy as a Noether invariant.
