Title: UV dimensional reduction to two from group valued momenta
Authors: Michele Arzano and Francisco Nettel
Abstract: We describe a new model of deformed relativistic kinematics based on the group manifold $U(1) \times SU(2)$ as a four-momentum space. We discuss the action of the Lorentz group on such space and and illustrate the deformed composition law for the group-valued momenta. Due to the geometric structure of the group, the deformed kinematics is governed by {\it two} energy scales $\lambda$ and $\kappa$. A relevant feature of the model is that it exhibits a running spectral dimension $d_s$ with the characteristic short distance reduction to $d_s =2$ found in most quantum gravity scenarios.
