Title: On timelike supersymmetric solutions of gauged minimal 5-dimensional  supergravity
Authors: Samuele Chimento and Tomas Ortin
Abstract: We analyze the timelike supersymmetric solutions of minimal gauged 5-dimensional supergravity for the case in which the K\"ahler base manifold admits a holomorphic isometry and depends on two real functions satisfying a simple second-order differential equation. Using this general form of the base space, the equations satisfied by the building blocks of the solutions become of, at most, fourth degree and can be solved by simple polynomic ansatzs. In this way we construct two 3-parameter families of solutions that contain almost all the timelike supersymmetric solutions of this theory with one angular momentum known so far and a few more: the (singular) supersymmetric Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS solutions, the three exact supersymmetric solutions describing the three near-horizon geometries found by Gutowski and Reall, three 1-parameter asymptotically-AdS$_{5}$ black-hole solutions with those three near-horizon geometries (Gutowski and Reall's black hole being one of them), three generalizations of the G\"odel universe and a few potentially homogenous solutions. A key r\^ole in finding these solutions is played by our ability to write AdS$_{5}$'s K\"ahler base space ($\overline{\mathbb{CP}}^{2}$ or SU$(1,2)/$U$(2)$) is three different, yet simple, forms associated to three different isometries. Furthermore, our ansatz for the K\"ahler metric also allows us to study the dimensional compactification of the theory and its solutions in a systematic way.
