Title: 4d $\cN$=2 theories with disconnected gauge groups
Authors: Philip C. Argyres and Mario Martone
Abstract: In this paper we present a beautifully consistent web of evidence for the existence of interacting 4d rank-1 $\cN=2$ SCFTs obtained from gauging discrete subgroups of global symmetries of other existing 4d rank-1 $\cN=2$ SCFTs. The global symmetries that can be gauged involve a non-trivial combination of discrete subgroups of the $U(1)_R$, low-energy EM duality group $SL(2,\Z)$, and the outer automorphism group of the flavor symmetry algebra, Out($F$). The theories that we construct are remarkable in many ways: (i) two of them have exceptional $F_4$ and $G_2$ flavor groups; (ii) they substantially complete the picture of the landscape of rank-1 $\cN=2$ SCFTs as they realize all but one of the remaining consistent rank-1 Seiberg-Witten geometries that we previously constructed but were not associated to known SCFTs; and (iii) some of them have enlarged $\cN=3$ SUSY, and have not been previously constructed. They are also examples of SCFTs which violate the Shapere-Tachikawa relation between the conformal central charges and the scaling dimension of the Coulomb branch vev. We propose a modification of the formulas computing these central charges from the topologically twisted Coulomb branch partition function which correctly compute them for discretely gauged theories.
