Title: Integrability conditions of quasi-Newtonian cosmologies in modified  gravity
Authors: Amare Abebe and Peter K. S. Dunsby and Deon Solomons
Abstract: We investigate the integrability conditions of a class of shear-free perfect-fluid cosmological models within the framework of anisotropic fluid sources, applying our results to f(R) dark energy models. Generalising earlier general relativistic results for time-like geodesics, we extend the potential and acceleration terms of the quasi-Newtonian formulation of integrable dust cosmological models about a linearized Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker background and derive the equations that describe their dynamical evolutions. We show that in general, models with an anisotropic fluid source are not consistent, but because of the particular form the anisotropic stress takes in f(R) gravity, the general integrability conditions, in this case, are satisfied.
