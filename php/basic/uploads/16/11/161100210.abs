Abstract: The possibility to construct an inflationary universe scenario for the finite-scale gauged Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model is investigated. This model can be described by the Higgs-Yukawa type interaction model with the corresponding compositeness scale. Therefore, the one-loop Higgs-Yukawa effective potential is used with the compositeness condition for the study of inflationary dynamics. We evaluate the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background for the model with a finite compositeness scale in the slow-roll approximation. We find the remarkable dependence on the gauge group and the number of fermion flavors. It is also proved that the model has similar behavior with the $\phi^{4n}$ chaotic inflation and the Starobinsky model at the flat and steep limits, respectively. It is demonstrated that realistic inflation consistent with Planck data is possible for a range of theory parameters.
