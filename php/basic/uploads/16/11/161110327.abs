Title: Low Energy Supergravity Revisited (I)
Authors: Gilbert Moultaka and Michel Rausch de Traubenberg and Damien Tant
Abstract: General forms of the K\"ahler and superpotenials that lead to consistent low energy broken Supersymmetry originating from $N=1$ Supergravity have been classified and used for model building since more than three decades. We point out the incompleteness of this classification. Focusing in this paper mainly on the case of minimal K\"ahler potential, we adopt a rigorous approach that retrieves on the one hand the known forms, and demonstrate on the other hand the existence of a whole set of new forms for the superpotential of which we give a complete classification. The latter forms involve a new type of chiral superfields having the unusual property of belonging neither to the hidden sector nor to the conventional observable sector. We argue how new possibilities for model building can arise, comparing the obtained forms with the conventional ones, and discuss the gravity mediation of supersymmetry breaking and the vacuum structure in the presence of the new type of chiral superfields. In the simplest case, we characterize the masses and couplings of the scalar components to the hidden and observable sectors and discuss briefly the physical role they could play.
