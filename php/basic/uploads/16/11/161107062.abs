Title: Space and time dimensions of algebras with applications to Lorentzian  noncommutative geometry and the standard model
Authors: Nadir Bizi and Christian Brouder and Fabien Besnard
Abstract: An analogy with real Clifford algebras on even-dimensional vector spaces suggests to assign a space dimension and a time dimension (modulo 8) to an algebra (represented over a complex Hilbert space) containing two self-adjoint involutions and an anti-unitary operator with specific commutation relations. It is shown that this assignment is compatible with the tensor product, in the sense that a tensor product of such algebras corresponds to the addition of the space and time dimensions. This could provide an interpretation of the presence of such algebras in PT-symmetric Hamiltonians or the description of topological matter. This construction is used to build the tensor product of Lorentzian (and more generally pseudo-Riemannian) spectral triples, defined over a Krein space. The application to the standard model of particles suggests the identity of the time and space dimensions of the total (manifold+finite algebra) spectral triple. It also suggests the emergence of the pseudo-orthogonal group SO(4,6) in a grand unified theory.
