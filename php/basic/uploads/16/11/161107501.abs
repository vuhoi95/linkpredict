Title: Stable Dyonic Thin-shell Wormholes in String Theory
Authors: Ali Övgün and Kimet Jusufi
Abstract: In this paper we construct a four dimensional, spherically symmetric, dyonic thin shell wormhole (DTSW) with electric charge $Q$, magnetic charge $P$, and dilaton charge $\phi_{0}$, in the context of Einstein Maxwell dilaton theory (EMD). We have applyied Darmois Israel formalism and the cut and paste method by joining together two identical spacetime solutions. We carry out the TSW stability analyses by using a linear barotropic gas (LBG), chaplygin gas (CG), and logarithmic gas (LogG) for the exotic matter. It is shown that by choosing suitable parameter values as well as equation of state parameter, we obtain a stable DTSW solution. In particular we argue that electric charge, magnetic charge, and dilaton charge increases the stability domain of the wormhole.
