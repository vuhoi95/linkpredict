Title: Multi-centered ${\mathcal N}=2$ BPS black holes: a double copy  description
Authors: Gabriel Cardoso and Silvia Nagy and Suresh Nampuri
Abstract: We present the on-shell double copy dictionary for linearised ${\mathcal N}=2$ supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of vector multiplets in four dimensions. Subsequently, we use it to construct a double copy description of multi-centered BPS black hole solutions in these theories in the weak-field approximation.
