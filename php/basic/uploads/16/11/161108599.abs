Title: On Form Factors and Correlation Functions in Twistor Space
Authors: Laura Koster and Vladimir Mitev and Matthias Staudacher and Matthias Wilhelm
Abstract: In this paper, we continue our study of form factors and correlation functions of gauge-invariant local composite operators in the twistor-space formulation of N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. Using the vertices for these operators obtained in our recent papers arXiv:1603.04471 and arXiv:1604.00012, we show how to calculate the twistor-space diagrams for general N^kMHV form factors via the inverse soft limit, in analogy to the amplitude case. For general operators without $\dot\alpha$ indices, we then reexpress the NMHV form factors from the position-twistor calculation in terms of momentum twistors, deriving and expanding on a relation between the two twistor formalisms previously observed in the case of amplitudes. Furthermore, we discuss the calculation of generalized form factors and correlation functions as well as the extension to loop level, in particular providing an argument promised in arXiv:1410.6310.
