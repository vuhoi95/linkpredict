Title: Instability of asymptotically anti de Sitter black holes under Robin  conditions at the timelike boundary
Authors: Bernardo Araneda and Gustavo Dotti
Abstract: The static region outside the event horizon of an asymptotically anti de Sitter black hole has a conformal timelike boundary $\mathscr{I}$, the evolution from initial data of linear fields satisfying hyperbolic equations is a well posed problem only after imposing boundary conditions at $\mathscr{I}$. Boundary conditions preserving the action of the background isometry group on the solution space are limited to the homogeneous Dirichlet, Neumann or Robin types. We study, scalar and Maxwell fields and gravitational perturbations on asymptotically AdS black holes arising in Einstein and Lovelock theories. A decomposition in modes transforms the field equations into a set of wave equations with time independent potentials for auxiliary fields in the $x<0$ half of 1+1 Minkowski spacetime. We study systematically these equations for the case of potentials not diverging at the boundary and prove that there is always an instability if Robin boundary conditions with large $\gamma$ (the quotient between the derivative and the function at the boundary) are allowed. We show that Robin conditions on the auxiliary fields arise naturally both in classical gravity and in the AdS/CFT context. The mechanisms that trigger the Robin instabilities are explained, and it is shown that energy flux from $\mathscr{I}$ is not a sufficient condition for instability. We also analyze the supersymmetric type of duality exchanging odd and even modes in four dimensional Schwarzschild anti de Sitter black holes and prove that this symmetry is broken except when a combination of Dirichlet conditions in the even sector and a particular Robin condition in the odd sector is enforced, or viceversa, although only the first of these two choices leads to a stable dynamics.
