Title: From Scalar Field Theories to Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics
Authors: D. Bazeia and F. S. Bemfica
Abstract: In this work we report a new result that appears when one investigates the route that starts from a scalar field theory and ends on a supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The subject has been studied before in several distinct ways and here we unveil an interesting novelty, showing that the same scalar field model may describe distinct quantum mechanical problems.
