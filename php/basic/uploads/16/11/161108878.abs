Abstract: We show how to unlock the hidden information about gravity in one's choice of matter dynamics. Restricting attention to canonically quantizable matter field equations, but therefore being able to admit any tensorial background geometry, one is left with very little choice for the dynamics of the geometry. Indeed, the physical requirement that the common canonical evolution of matter and geometry can start and end on shared Cauchy surfaces imposes consistency conditions so strong that the Lagrangian for the geometry arises as the solution of a particular system of linear partial differential equations. Employing a suitable associated bundle to encode the canonical configuration degrees of freedom of the geometry, this system can be set up without additional constraints and with coefficient functions that indeed only depend on the causal structure of the chosen matter dynamics. Through these equations, the Lagrangian for the geometry is thus determined by the stipulated matter field dynamics, up to typically only finitely many constants of integration. This result complements the body of theoretical results on viable gravity theories by injecting a highly concentrated dose of matter physics into their construction.
