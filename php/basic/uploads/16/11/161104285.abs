Title: Deconfinement and chiral transition in AdS/QCD wall models supplemented  with a magnetic field
Authors: David Dudal and Diego Rocha Granado and Thomas G. Mertens
Abstract: We discuss the phenomenon of (inverse) magnetic catalysis for both the deconfinement and chiral transition. We discriminate between the hard and soft wall model, which we suitably generalize to include a magnetic field. Our findings show a critical deconfinement temperature going down, in contrast with the chiral restoration temperature growing with increasing magnetic field. This is at odds with contemporary lattice data, so the quest for a holographic QCD model capable of capturing inverse magnetic catalysis in the chiral sector remains open.
