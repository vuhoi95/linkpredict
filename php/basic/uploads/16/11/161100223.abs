Abstract: Heterotic supergravity with (1+3)-dimensional domain wall configurations and (warped) internal, six dimensional, almost-K\"{a}hler manifolds $\ ^6\mathbf{X} $ are studied. Considering on ten dimensional spacetime, nonholonomic distributions with conventional double fibrations, 2+2+...=2+2+3+3, and associated $SU(3)$ structures on internal space, we generalize for real, internal, almost symplectic gravitational structures the constructions with gravitational and gauge instantons of tanh-kink type. They include the first $\alpha ^{\prime }$ corrections to the heterotic supergravity action, parameterized in a form to imply nonholonomic deformations of the Yang-Mills sector and corresponding Bianchi identities. We show how it is possible to construct a variety of solutions, depending on the type of nonholonomic distributions and deformations of 'prime' instanton configurations characterized by two real supercharges. This corresponds to $\mathcal{N}=1/2$ supersymmetric, nonholonomic manifolds from the four dimensional point of view. Our method provides a unified description of embedding nonholonomically deformed tanh-kink-type instantons into half-BPS solutions of heterotic supergravity. This allows us to elaborate new geometric methods of constructing exact solutions of motion equations, with first order $\alpha ^{\prime }$ corrections to the heterotic supergravity. Such a formalism is applied for general and/or warped almost-K\"{a}hler configurations, which allows us to generate nontrivial (1+3)-d domain walls. This formalism is utilized in our associated publication \cite{partner} in order to construct and study generic off-diagonal nonholonomic deformations of the Kerr metric, encoding contributions from heterotic supergravity.
