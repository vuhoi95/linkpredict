Title: Discrete anomalies in supergravity and consistency of string backgrounds
Authors: Ruben Minasian and Soumya Sasmal and Raffaele Savelli
Abstract: We examine SL(2, Z) anomalies in ten and eight-dimensional supergravities, the induced local counterterms and their realization in string theory. Composite connections play an important role in the cancellation mechanism. At the same time their global properties lead to novel non-trivial consistency constraints on compactifications.
