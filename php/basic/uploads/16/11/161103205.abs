Title: Generalized thermalization for integrable system under quantum quench
Authors: Sushruth Muralidharan and Kinjalk Lochan and S. Shankaranarayanan
Abstract: We investigate equilibration and generalized thermalization of quantum Harmonic chain --- an integrable system which in the thermodynamic limit mimics a free scalar field --- under global quantum quench. The quench action we consider is connecting two disjoint harmonic chains of different sizes and the system jumps between two integrable settings. We verify the validity of the Generalized Gibbs Ensemble description for this system and also identify equilibration between the subsystems as in classical systems. Using Bogoliubov transformations, we show that the eigenstates of the system prior to the quench evolve towards the Gibbs Generalized Ensemble description. Further, through the phase space properties of a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble and the strength of stimulated emission, we identify the necessary criterion on the initial states for the thermalization at late times, which is satisfied by the system in the thermodynamic limit.
