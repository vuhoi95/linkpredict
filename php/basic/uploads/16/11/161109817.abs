Title: Renormalised AdS$_5$ Mass for Even Spin Glueball and Pomeron Regge  Trajectory from a Modified Holographic softwall model
Authors: Eduardo Folco Capossoli and Henrique Boschi-Filho
Abstract: In this work, adopting a $5-$dimensional mass renormalisation within a modified holographic softwall model, we calculate analytically the masses of the scalar glueball with its radial excitations and of higher even glueball spin states, with $P=C=+1$. Using this approach we achieved a unified treatment for both scalar and high even spin glueballs. Furthermore, we also obtain the Regge trajectory associated with the pomeron compatible with other approaches.
