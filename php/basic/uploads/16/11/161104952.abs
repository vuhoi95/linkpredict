Title: Mass generation from a non-perturbative correction: Massive NS-field and  graviton in $(3+1)$-dimensions
Authors: Supriya Kar and R. Nitish
Abstract: We show that the massless form fields, in $(4+1)$-dimensional non-perturbation theory of emergent gravity, become massive in a perturbative phase without Higgs mechanism. In particular an axionic scalar sourced by a non-perturbative dynamical correction is absorbed by the form fields to describe a massive NS field theory on an emergent gravitational pair of $(3{\bar 3})$-brane. Arguably the novel idea of Higgs mechanism is naturally invoked in an emergent gravity underlying a ${\rm CFT}_6$. Analysis reveals "gravito-weak" and "electro-weak" phases respectively on a vacuum pair in $(4+1)$ and $(3+1)$-dimensions. It is argued that the massive NS field quanta may govern an emergent graviton on a gravitational $3$-brane.
