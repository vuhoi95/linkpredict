Title: Asymmetric 6-vertex model and classical Ruijsenaars-Schneider system of  particles
Authors: A. Liashyk and D. Rudneva and A. Zabrodin and A. Zotov
Abstract: We discuss the correspondence between models solved by Bethe ansatz and classical integrable systems of Calogero type. We illustrate the correspondence by the simplest example of the inhomogeneous asymmetric 6-vertex model parametrized by trigonometric (hyperbolic) functions.
