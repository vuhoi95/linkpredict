Abstract: The cross section for neutrino helicity spin-flip obtained from a new f(R, T) model of gravitation with dynamic torsion field introduced by one of the authors in [1], is phenomenologically analyzed. To this end, due to the logarithmical energy dependence of the cross section, the relation with the axion decay constant fa (Peccei-Quinn parameter) is used. Consequently the link with the phenomenological energy/mass window is found from the astrophysical and high energy viewpoints. The highest helicity spin-flip cross-sectional values presented in this work coincide with a recent estimation on the axion mass computed in [2] in the framework of finite temperature extended lattice QCD and under cosmological considerations.
