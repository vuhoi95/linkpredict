Title: Meissner effect and a stringlike interaction
Authors: Chandrasekhar Chatterjee and Ishita Dutta Choudhury and Amitabha Lahiri
Abstract: We find that a recently proposed interaction involving the vorticity current of electrons, which radiatively induces a photon mass in 3+1 dimensions in the low-energy effective theory, corresponds to confining strings (linear potential) between electrons.
