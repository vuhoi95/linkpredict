Title: The Fate of the Higgs Vacuum
Authors: Ruth Gregory and Ian G. Moss
Abstract: This talk reviews our recent work showing how tiny black holes can act as nucleation sites for the decay of the metastable Higgs vacuum. We start by discussing the formation of thin wall bubbles of true vacuum inside a false vacuum, and show how adding a black hole lowers the action of the Euclidean tunneling solution, thus strongly enhancing the probability of vacuum decay. We then review numerical results for the Higgs vacuum showing that the decay rate is even higher for these "thick wall" bubbles. The results imply either tiny black holes are not a component of our universe, or BSM corrections to the Higgs potential must stabilise our vacuum.
