Title: Unified picture of non-geometric fluxes and T-duality in double field  theory via graded symplectic manifolds
Authors: Marc Andre Heller and Noriaki Ikeda and Satoshi Watamura
Abstract: We give a systematic derivation of the local expressions of the NS H-flux, geometric F- as well as non-geometric Q- and R-fluxes in terms of bivector beta- and two-form B-potentials including vielbeins. They are obtained using a supergeometric method on QP-manifolds by twist of the standard Courant algebroid on the generalized tangent space without flux. Bianchi identities of the fluxes are easily deduced. We extend the discussion to the case of the double space and present a formulation of T-duality in terms of canonical transformations between graded symplectic manifolds. Finally, the construction is compared to the formerly introduced Poisson Courant algebroid, a Courant algebroid on a Poisson manifold, as a model for R-flux.
