Title: Marginal and non-commutative deformations via non-abelian T-duality
Authors: Ben Hoare and Daniel C. Thompson
Abstract: In this short article we develop recent proposals to relate Yang-Baxter sigma-models and non-abelian T-duality. We demonstrate explicitly that the holographic space-times associated to both (multi-parameter)-$\beta$-deformations and non-commutative deformations of ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills gauge theory including the RR fluxes can be obtained via the machinery of non-abelian T-duality in Type II supergravity.
