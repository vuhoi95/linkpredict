Title: NSVZ-like scheme for the photino mass in softly broken ${\cal N}=1$ SQED  regularized by higher derivatives
Authors: I. V. Nartsev and K. V. Stepanyantz
Abstract: In the case of using the higher derivative regularization we construct the subtraction scheme which gives the NSVZ-like relation for the anomalous dimension of the photino mass in softly broken ${\cal N}=1$ SQED with $N_f$ flavors in all loops. The corresponding renormalization prescription is determined by simple boundary conditions imposed on the renormalization constants. It allows fixing an arbitrariness of choosing finite counterterms in every order of the perturbation theory in such a way that the renormalization group functions defined in terms of the renormalized coupling constant satisfy the NSVZ-like relation.
