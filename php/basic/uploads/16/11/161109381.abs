Title: Conductivities from attractors
Authors: Johanna Erdmenger and Daniel Fernandez and Prieslei Goulart and Piotr Witkowski
Abstract: In the context of applications of the AdS/CFT correspondence to condensed matter physics, we compute conductivities for field theory duals of dyonic planar black holes in 3+1-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theories at zero temperature. We combine the near-horizon data obtained via Sen's entropy function formalism with known expressions for conductivities. In this way we express the conductivities in terms of the extremal black hole charges. We apply our approach to three different examples for dilaton theories for which the background geometry is not known explicitly. For a constant scalar potential, the thermal conductivity explicitly scales as $\alpha_{xy}\sim N^{3/2}$, as expected.
