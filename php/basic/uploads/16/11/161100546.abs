Title: Holographic RÃ©nyi entropy for two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}$=(2,2)  superconformal field theory
Authors: Zhibin Li and Jia-ju Zhang
Abstract: We investigate the holographic R\'enyi entropy for two-dimensional $\mathcal N=(2,2)$ superconformal field theory (SCFT), which is dual to $\mathcal N=2$ supergravity in AdS$_3$ background. In SCFT we have the stress tensor, current, and their supersymmetric partners, and in supergravity we have the graviton, vector field, and two gravitinos. We get the R\'enyi mutual information of two short intervals on complex plane in expansion by the cross ratio $x$ to order $x^4$, and R\'enyi entropy of one interval on torus in expansion by $q=\exp(-2\pi\beta/L)$, with $\beta$ being the inverse temperature and $L$ being the spatial period, to order $q^2$. We calculate in both the supergravity and SCFT sides, and find matches of the results.
