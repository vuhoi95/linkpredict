Title: Solitons and spin transport in graphene boundary
Authors: Kumar Abhinav and Vivek M Vyas and Prasanta K Panigrahi
Abstract: It is shown that in (2+1)-dimensional condensed matter systems, induced gravitational Chern-Simons (CS) action can play a crucial role for coherent spin transport in a finite geometry, provided zero-curvature condition is satisfied on the boundary. The role of the resultant KdV solitons is explicated. The fact that KdV solitons can pass through each other without interference, represent 'resistanceless' spin transport.
