Title: Chiral Thermodynamics in a finite box
Authors: Ana Juričić and Bernd-Jochen Schaefer
Abstract: Finite-volume modifications of the two-flavor chiral phase diagram are investigated within an effective quark-meson model in various mean-field approximations. The role of vacuum fluctuations and boundary conditions, their influence on higher cumulants and signatures of a possible pseudo-critical endpoint are amplified with smaller volumes.
