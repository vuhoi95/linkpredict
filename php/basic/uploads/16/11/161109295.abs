Authors: Mahdi Atashi and Kazem Bitaghsir Fadafan and Ghadir Jafari
Abstract: We study holographic isotropization of an anisotropic homogeneous non-Abelian strongly coupled plasma in the presence of Gauss-Bonnet corrections. It was verified before that one can linearize Einstein's equations around the final black hole background and simplify the complicated setup. Using this approach, we study the expectation value of the boundary stress tensor. Although we consider small values of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant, it is found that considering the Gauss-Bonnet coupling leads to increasing of the thermalization time, significantly. By including higher order corrections, we extend the results to study the effect of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling on the entropy production on the event horizon.
