Title: Discreteness of Point Charge in Nonlinear Electrodynamics
Authors: A. I. Breev and A. E. Shabad
Abstract: We consider two point charges in electrostatic interaction between them within the framework of a nonlinear model, associated with QED, that provides finiteness of their field energy. We argue that if the two charges are equal to each other the repulsion force between them disappears when they are infinitely close to each other, but remains as usual infinite if their values are different. This implies that within any system to which such a model may be applicable the point charge is fractional, it may only be $2^n$-fold of a certain fundamental charge, n=0,1,2... We find the common field of the two charges in a dipole approximation, where the separation between them is much smaller than the observation distance.
