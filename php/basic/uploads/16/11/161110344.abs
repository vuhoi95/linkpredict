Abstract: We study possible smooth deformations of Generalized Free Conformal Field Theories in arbitrary dimensions by exploiting the singularity structure of the conformal blocks dictated by the null states. We derive in this way, at the first non trivial order in the $\epsilon$-expansion, the anomalous dimensions of an infinite class of scalar local operators, without using the equations of motion. In the cases where other computational methods apply, the results agree.
