Title: Bounds on Large Extra Dimensions from the Generalized Uncertainty  Principle
Authors: Marco Cavaglia and Benjamin Harms and Shaoqi Hou
Abstract: The Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) implies the existence of a physical minimum length scale $l_m$. In this scenario, black holes must have a radius larger than $l_m$. They are hotter and evaporate faster than in standard Hawking thermodynamics. We study the effects of the GUP on black hole production and decay at the LHC in models with large extra dimensions. Lower bounds on the fundamental Planck scale and the minimum black hole mass at formation are determined from black hole production cross section limits by the CMS Collaboration. The existence of a minimum length generally decreases the lower bounds on the fundamental Planck scale obtained in the absence of a minimum length.
