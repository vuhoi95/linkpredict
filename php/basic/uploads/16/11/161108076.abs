Title: Lie algebra lattices and strings on T-folds
Authors: Yuji Satoh and Yuji Sugawara
Abstract: We study the world-sheet conformal field theories for T-folds systematically based on the Lie algebra lattices representing the momenta of strings. The fixed point condition required for the T-duality twist restricts the possible Lie algebras. When the T-duality acts as a simple chiral reflection, one is left with the four cases, $A_1, D_{2r}, E_7, E_8$, among the simple simply-laced algebras. From the corresponding Englert-Neveu lattices, we construct the modular invariant partition functions for the T-fold CFTs in bosonic string theory. Similar construction is possible also by using Euclidean even self-dual lattices. We then apply our formulation to the T-folds in the $E_8 \times E_8$ heterotic string theory. Incorporating non-trivial phases for the T-duality twist, we obtain, as simple examples, a class of modular invariant partition functions parametrized by three integers. Our construction includes the cases which are not reduced to the free fermion construction.
