Title: "Charged" phonons in an external field: a QED analog with Bose-Einstein  condensates
Authors: Shay Leizerovitch and Benni Reznik
Abstract: We propose a method for using ultracold atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, to form an analog model of a relativistic massive field that carries "charge" and interacts with an external non-dynamical gauge field. Such a "scalar QED" analog model, may be useful for simulating certain of QFT involving charged particles. In particular, the Schwinger pair-creation of "charged" phonons in a constant external field, and vacuum instability.
