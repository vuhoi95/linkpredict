Title: A Unified Hidden-Sector-Electroweak Model, Paraphotons and the X-Boson
Authors: M. J. Neves and J. A. HelayÃ«l-Neto
Abstract: Our contribution sets out to investigate a gauge model based on an $SU_{L}(2) \times U_{R}(1)_{J} \times U(1)_{K}$-symmetry group whose main goal is to accommodate, in the distinct phases the Higgs sector sets up according to different symmetry-breaking patterns, the para-photon of the dark matter sector, a heavy scalar whose mass is upper-bounded by $830 \, \mbox{GeV}$ and the recently discussed $17 \, \mbox{MeV}$ X-boson. As a result, there also emerge in the spectrum an extra massive charged fermion along with an additional neutral Higgs; their masses are fixed according to the particular way the symmetry breakings take place. In all situations contemplated here, we are committed with the $246 \, \mbox{GeV}$ electroweak breaking scale.
