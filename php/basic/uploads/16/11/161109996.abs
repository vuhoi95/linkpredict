Title: Holographic conductivity of 1+1 dimensional systems in soft wall model
Authors: Neha Bhatnagar and Sanjay Siwach
Abstract: We study the optical conductivity of 1+1 dimensional systems using soft wall model in the bottom up approach of AdS/CFT (anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory) duality. We find the numerical results for optical conductivity and investigate the system using holographic model in the probe limit. The dependence of conductivity on chemical potential is also investigated. Further, we extend the soft wall model as a `no-wall' model by eliminating the dilaton background and study the response of the system in a simplified approach.
