Title: Casimir effect for Elko spinor field
Authors: S. H. Pereira and J. M. Hoff da Silva and Rubia dos Santos
Abstract: The Casimir effect for the Elko spinor field in $3+1$ dimension is obtained using Dirichlet boundary conditions. It is shown the existence of a repulsive force four times greater than the case of the scalar field. The precise reason for such differences are highlighted and interpreted, as well as the right parallel of the Casimir effect due to scalar and fermionic fields.
