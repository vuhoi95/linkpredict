Title: Partial time-reversal transformation and entanglement negativity in  fermionic systems
Authors: Hassan Shapourian and Ken Shiozaki and Shinsei Ryu
Abstract: We propose a definition of partial transpose for a fermionic density matrix based on time-reversal transformation in the Grassmannian coherent state representation of fermions. Using this definition, we present a path-integral picture and develop methods to compute the entanglement negativity associated with the partial time-reversal. For noninteracting fermions, we derive an exact formula for the entanglement negativity which can be straightforwardly computed for any lattice models. We benchmark our method against two examples: Majorana chain and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, where we also provide analytical expressions for the negativity in the fixed-point limits of topological phases as well as at the criticality. The results at the criticality match with previous conformal field theory calculations. Our definition of partial transpose is intrinsically fermionic and goes beyond previous definitions by capturing not only the singlet bonds but also the Majorana bonds between two subsystems. Finally, we uncover the first concrete microscopic calculation of the entanglement negativity in the random singlet phase of disordered spin chains.
