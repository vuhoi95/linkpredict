Title: Dark Radiation from Infra-gravitons
Authors: A P Balachandran and Babar Qureshi
Abstract: In QED and QCD [1, 2], infrared photons and gluons accumulate at infinity and cause breakdown of Lorentz and color invariance and other physical effects. These results are generalized here to quantum gravity regarded as an SL(2; C) gauge theory and the shift of the ADM energy density and mass from infrared spin connection (the spin cloud) is discussed.
