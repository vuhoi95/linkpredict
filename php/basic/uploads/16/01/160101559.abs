Title: The continuum limit of $a_{N-1}^{(2)}$ spin chains
Authors: Eric Vernier and Jesper Lykke Jacobsen and Hubert Saleur
Abstract: Building on our previous work for $a_2^{(2)}$ and $a_3^{(2)}$ we explore systematically the continuum limit of gapless $a_{N-1}^{(2)}$ vertex models and spin chains. We find the existence of three possible regimes. Regimes I and II for $a_{2n-1}^{(2)}$ are related with $a_{2n-1}^{(2)}$ Toda, and described by $n$ compact bosons. Regime I for $a_{2n}^{(2)}$ is related with $a_{2n}^{(2)}$ Toda and involves $n$ compact bosons, while regime II is related instead with $B^{(1)}(0,n)$ super Toda, and involves in addition a single Majorana fermion. The most interesting is regime III, where {\sl non-compact} degrees of freedom appear, generalising the emergence of the Euclidean black hole CFT in the $a_{2}^{(2)}$ case. For $a_{2n}^{(2)}$ we find a continuum limit made of $n$ compact and $n$ non-compact bosons, while for $a_{2n-1}^{(2)}$ we find $n$ compact and $n-1$ non-compact bosons. We also find deep relations between $a_{N-1}^{(2)}$ in regime III and the gauged WZW models $SO(N)/SO(N-1)$.
