Title: The String BCJ Relations Revisited and Extended Recurrence relations of  Nonrelativistic String Scattering Amplitudes
Authors: Sheng-Hong Lai and Jen-Chi Lee and Yi Yang
Abstract: We review and extend high energy string BCJ relations in both the fixed angle and Regge regimes. We then give an explicit proof of four point string BCJ relations for all energy. This calculation provides an alternative proof of the one based on monodromy of integration in string amplitude calculation. In addition, we calculate both s-t and t-u channel nonrelativistic low energy string scattering amplitudes of three tachyons and one leading trojectory string state at arbitrary mass levels. We discover that the mass and spin dependent nonrelativistic string BCJ relations can be expressed in terms of Gauss hypergeometry functions. As an application, for each fixed mass level N, we derive extended recurrence relations among nonrelativistic low energy string scattering amplitudes of string states with different spins and different channels.
