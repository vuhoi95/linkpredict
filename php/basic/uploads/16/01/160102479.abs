Title: Cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory of a quiver with potential and  quantum enveloping algebras
Authors: Ben Davison and Sven Meinhardt
Abstract: This paper is focused on the cohomological aspects of Donaldson--Thomas theory for Jacobi algebras, and the associated cohomological Hall algebra, introduced by Kontsevich and Soibelman. We prove the Hodge-theoretic categorification of the integrality conjecture and the wall crossing formula, and furthermore realise the isomorphism in both these theorems as Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt isomorphisms for the associated cohomological Hall algebra. Along the way, we study the representation theory of the cohomological Hall algebra, and prove that the modules provided by the vanishing cycle cohomology of framed moduli spaces are cyclic modules, which recover the cohomological Hall algebra as a module over itself, in the limit obtained by letting the framing dimension vector become large. This Representation-theoretic study leads naturally to a perverse filtration cohomological Hall algebras, preserved by the multiplication and comultiplication, providing explicit degenerations to universal enveloping algebras.
