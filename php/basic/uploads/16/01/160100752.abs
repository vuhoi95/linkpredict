Title: A note on instanton operators, instanton particles, and supersymmetry
Authors: Oren Bergman and Diego Rodriguez-Gomez
Abstract: We clarify certain aspects of instanton operators in five-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories. In particular, we show how, in the pointlike limit, they become supersymmetric and provide the natural bridge with the instantonic states contributing to the index as well as with the zero mode counting leading to broken current multiplets.
