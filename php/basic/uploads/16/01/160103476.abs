Title: Towards Bootstrapping QED$_3$
Authors: Shai M. Chester and Silviu S. Pufu
Abstract: We initiate the conformal bootstrap study of Quantum Electrodynamics in $2+1$ space-time dimensions (QED$_{3}$) with $N$ flavors of charged fermions by focusing on the 4-point function of four monopole operators with the lowest unit of topological charge. We obtain upper bounds on the scaling dimension of the doubly-charged monopole operator, with and without assuming other gaps in the operator spectrum. Intriguingly, we find a (gap-dependent) kink in these bounds that comes reasonably close to the large $N$ extrapolation of the scaling dimensions of the singly-charged and doubly-charged monopole operators down to $N=4$ and $N=6$.
