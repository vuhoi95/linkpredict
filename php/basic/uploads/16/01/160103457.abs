Title: On the soft limit of tree-level string amplitudes
Authors: Massimo Bianchi and Andrea L. Guerrieri
Abstract: We study the soft behavior of string scattering amplitudes at three level with massless and massive external insertions, relying on different techniques to compute 4-points amplitudes respectively with open or closed strings.
