Authors: Alexander Krutov and Roman Polezhaev and Vadim Troitsky
Abstract: Calculations of form factor for the radiative decays $V\rightarrow P\gamma^{*}$ process are performed in the framework of an instant form of relativistic quantum mechanics. The electromagnetic current operator for this decay is constructed. The transition form factor is obtained in the so called relativistic modified impulse approximation (MIA). The current operator satisfies the conditions of Lorentz-covariance and current conservation in MIA. The results of the calculations are compared with the analogous results in the light-front dynamics and in the model of vector meson dominance
