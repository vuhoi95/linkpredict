Abstract: We construct the non-linear realisation of the semi-direct product of E11 and its vector representation in eleven dimensions and find the dynamical equations it predicts at low levels. These equations are completely determined by the non-linear realisation and when restricted to contain only the usual fields of supergravity and the usual space-time we find precisely the equations of motion of eleven dimensional supergravity. This paper extends the results announced in arXiv:1512.01644 and in particular it contains the contributions to the equations of motion that involve derivatives with respect to the level one generalised coordinates.
