Title: New aspects of quantization of Jackiw-Pi model: field-antifield  formalism and noncommutativity
Authors: Vahid Nikoofard and Everton M. C. Abreu
Abstract: The so-called Jackiw-Pi (JP) model for massive vector fields is a three dimensional, gauge invariant and parity preserving model which was discussed in several contexts. In this paper we have discussed its quantum aspects through the introduction of Planck scale objects, i.e., via noncommutativity and the well known BV quantization. Namely, we have constructed the JP noncommutative spacetime version and we have provided the BV quantization of the commutative JP model and we have discussed its features. The noncommutativity has introduced interesting new objects in JP's Planck scale framework.
