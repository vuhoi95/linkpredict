Title: Fluid/Gravity Correspondence with Scalar Field and Electromagnetic Field
Authors: Chia-Jui Chou and Xiaoning Wu and Yi Yang and Pei-Hung Yuan
Abstract: We consider fluid/gravity correspondence in a general rotating black hole background with scalar and electromagnetic fields. Using the method of Petrov-like boundary condition, we show that the scalar and the electromagnetic fields contribute external forces to the dual Navier-Stokes equation and the rotation of black hole induces the Coriolis force.
