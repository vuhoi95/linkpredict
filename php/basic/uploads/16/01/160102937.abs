Title: Superheavy Light Quarks and the Strong P, T Problem
Authors: Frank Wilczek and Guy Moore
Abstract: New superstrong forces, analogous to QCD but featuring a larger mass scale, should they exist, would offer new possibilities for addressing the strong P, T, problem. One can implement the "massless quark" solution in a phenomenologically acceptable way, by using a massless quark that is always confined within superheavy particles, and is therefore effectively superheavy: a cryptoquark. Assuming confinement and chiral symmetry breaking from the superstrong dynamics, we find a new mechanism to generate an axion field without introducing new fundamental scalar fields.
