Title: A Dynamical model for non-geometric quantum black holes
Authors: Euro Spallucci and Anais Smailagic
Abstract: It has been recently proposed that quantum black holes can be described as N-graviton Bose-Einstein condensates. In this picture the quantum properties of BHs "... can be understood in terms of the single number N". However, so far, the dynamical origin of the occupational number N has not been specified. This description is alternative to the usual one, where black holes are believed to be well described geometrically even at the quantum level. In this paper we pursue the former point of view and develop a non-geometrical dynamical model of quantum black holes (BHs). In our model the occupational number N is proportional to the principal quantum number n of a Planckian harmonic oscillator. The so-called "classicalization" corresponds to the large-n limit, where the Schwarzschild horizon is recovered.
