Title: Timelike BKL singularities and chaos in AdS/CFT
Authors: Edgar Shaghoulian and Huajia Wang
Abstract: We study the nature of a family of curvature singularities which are precisely the timelike cousins of the spacelike singularities studied by Belinski, Khalatnikov, and Lifshitz (BKL). We show that the approach to the singularity can be modeled by a billiard ball problem on hyperbolic space, just as in the case of BKL. For pure gravity, generic chaotic behavior is retained in (3+1) dimensions, and we provide evidence that it disappears in higher dimensions. We speculate that such singularities, if occurring in AdS/CFT and of the chaotic variety, may be interpreted as (transient) chaotic renormalization group flows which exhibit features reminiscent of chaotic duality cascades.
