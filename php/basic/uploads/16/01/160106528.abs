Abstract: Lie symmetries are discussed for the Wheeler-De Witt equation in Bianchi Class A cosmologies. In particular, we consider General Relativity, minimally coupled scalar field gravity and Hybrid Gravity as paradigmatic examples of the approach. Several invariant solutions are determined and classified according to the form of the scalar field potential. The approach gives rise to a suitable method to select classical solutions and it is based on the first principle of the existence of symmetries.
