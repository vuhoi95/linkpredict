Title: Gauging nonrelativistic field theories using the coset construction
Authors: Georgios K. Karananas and Alexander Monin
Abstract: We discuss how nonrelativistic spacetime symmetries can be gauged in the context of the coset construction. We consider theories invariant under the centrally extended Galilei algebra as well as the Lifshitz one, and we investigate under what conditions they can be supplemented by scale transformations. We also clarify the role of torsion in these theories.
