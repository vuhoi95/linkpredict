Title: A path-integral approach to the problem of time
Authors: M. M. Amaral and Martin Bojowald
Abstract: Quantum transition amplitudes are formulated for a model system with local internal time, using path integrals. The amplitudes are shown to be more regular near a turning point of internal time than could be expected based on existing canonical treatments. In particular, a successful transition through a turning point is provided in the model system, together with a new definition of such a transition in general terms. Some of the results rely on a fruitful relation between the problem of time and general Gribov problems.
