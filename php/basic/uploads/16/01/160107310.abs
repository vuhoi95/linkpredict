Title: Hawking evaporation cascade in presence of back reaction effect
Authors: Avik Paul and Bibhas Ranjan Majhi
Abstract: We study the cascade of Hawking emission spectrum from the event horizon in presence of back reaction in a black hole background. The framework, adopted here, is that given in [arXiv:1506.03975] and the spacetime is the modified Schwarzschild one. The analysis shows that it is possible to decrease the sparsity with the decrease in black hole mass. Moreover, at some particular value of mass one has a continuous radiation cascade. This result is completely new and quite different from the usual one. An estimation of the mass for continuous one is also found. We see that the value is of the Plank mass order. In this process it is observed that under a physical background, below a particular value of the mass the Hawking radiation must stop and we have a remnant. This was absent in the earlier analysis.
