Title: Pomeron and Odderon Regge Trajectories from a Dynamical Holographic  Model
Authors: Eduardo Folco Capossoli and Danning Li and Henrique Boschi-Filho
Abstract: In this work we use gauge/string dualities and a dynamical model that takes into account dynamical corrections to the metric of the anti de Sitter space due to a quadratic dilaton field and calculate the masses of even and odd spin glueball states with $P=C=+1$, and $P=C=-1$, respectively. Then we construct the corresponding Regge trajectories which are associated with the pomeron for even states with $P=C=+1$, and with the odderon for odd states with $P=C=-1$. We compare our results with those coming from experimental data as well as other models.
