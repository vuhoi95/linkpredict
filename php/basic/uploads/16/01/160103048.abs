Title: Time-Dependent BPS Skyrmions
Authors: Theodora Ioannidou and Arpad Lukacs
Abstract: An extended version of the BPS Skyrme model that admits time-dependent solutions is discussed. Initially, by introducing a power law at the original potential term of the BPS Skyrme model the existence, stability and structure of the corresponding solutions is investigated. Then, the frequencies and half-lifes of the radial oscillations of the constructed time-dependent solutions are determined.
