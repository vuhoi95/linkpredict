Title: Non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm effect with the time-dependent gauge fields
Authors: Seyed Ali Hosseini Mansoori and Behrouz Mirza
Abstract: We investigate the non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect for time-dependent gauge fields. We prove that the non-Abelian AB phase shift related to time-dependent gauge fields, in which the electric and magnetic fields are written in the adjoint representation of $SU(N)$ generators, vanishes up to the first order expansion of the phase factor. Therefore, the flux quantization in a superconductor ring does not appear in the time-dependent Abelian or non-Abelian AB effect.
