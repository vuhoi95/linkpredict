Title: Moduli spaces of AdS_5 vacua in N=2 supergravity
Authors: Jan Louis and Constantin Muranaka
Abstract: We determine the conditions for maximally supersymmetric AdS_5 vacua of five-dimensional gauged N=2 supergravity coupled to vector-, tensor- and hypermultiplets charged under an arbitrary gauge group. In particular, we show that the unbroken gauge group of the AdS_5 vacua has to contain an U(1)_R-factor. Moreover we prove that the scalar deformations which preserve all supercharges form a Kahler submanifold of the ambient quaternionic Kahler manifold spanned by the scalars in the hypermultiplets.
