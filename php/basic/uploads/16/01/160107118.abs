Abstract: In this paper, we investigate localization of a bulk massless q-form field on codimension-one brane by using a new Kaluza-Klein (KK) decomposition, for which there are two types of KK modes for the bulk q-form field, the q-form and (q-1)-form modes. The first modes may be massive or massless while the second ones are all masselss. These two types fo KK modes satisfy twy Schrodinger-like equations. For a five-dimensional brane model with a finite dimension, the spectrum of a bulk 3-form field on the brane consists of some massive bound 3-form KK modes as well as some massless bound 2-form ones with different configuration along the extra dimension. These 2-form modes are different form those obtained from a bulk 2-form field. For a five-dimensional degenerated Bloch brane model with an infinite extra dimension, some massive 3-form resonant KK modes and corresponding massless 2-form resonant ones are obtained for a bulk 3-form field.
