Title: Quasi-Local Conserved Charges of Spin-3 Topologically Massive Gravity
Authors: M. R. Setare and H. Adami
Abstract: In this paper we obtain conserved charges of spin-3 topologically massive gravity by using a quasi-local formalism. We find a general formula to calculate conserved charge of the spin-3 topologically massive gravity which corresponds to a Killing vector field $\xi$. We show that this general formula reduces to the previous one for the ordinary spin-3 gravity presented in \cite{31} when we take into account only transformation under diffeomorphism, without considering generalized Lorentz gauge transformation (i.e. $\lambda _{\xi} =0$), and by taking $\frac{1}{\mu}\rightarrow 0$. Then we obtain a general formula for the entropy of black hole solutions of the spin-3 topologically massive gravity. Finally we apply our formalism to calculate energy, angular momentum and entropy of a special black hole solution and we find that obtained results are consistent with previous results in the limiting cases. Moreover our result for energy, angular momentum and entropy are consistent with the first law of black hole mechanics.
