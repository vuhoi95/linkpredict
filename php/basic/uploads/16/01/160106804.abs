Title: N=4 super-Yang-Mills in LHC superspace. Part II: Non-chiral correlation  functions of the stress-tensor multiplet
Authors: Dmitry Chicherin and Emery Sokatchev
Abstract: We study the multipoint super-correlation functions of the full non-chiral stress-tensor multiplet in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory in the Born approximation. We derive effective supergraph Feynman rules for them. Surprisingly, the Feynman rules for the non-chiral correlators differ only slightly from those for the chiral correlators. We rely on the formulation of the theory in Lorentz harmonic chiral (LHC) superspace elaborated in the twin paper \cite{PartI}. In this approach only the chiral half of the supersymmetry is manifest. The other half is realized by nonlinear and nonlocal transformations of the LHC superfields. However, at Born level only the simple linear part of the transformations is relevant. It corresponds to effectively working in the self-dual sector of the theory. Our method is also applicable to a wider class of supermultiplets like all the half-BPS operators and the Konishi multiplet.
