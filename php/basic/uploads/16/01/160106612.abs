Title: Form Factor and Boundary Contribution of Amplitude
Authors: Rijun Huang and Qingjun Jin and Bo Feng
Abstract: The boundary contribution of an amplitude in the BCFW recursion relation can be considered as a form factor involving boundary operator and unshifted particles. At the tree-level, we show that by suitable construction of Lagrangian, one can relate the leading order term of boundary operators to some composite operators of N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory, then the computation of form factors is translated to the computation of amplitudes. We compute the form factors of these composite operators through the computation of corresponding double trace amplitudes.
