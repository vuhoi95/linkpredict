Authors: Igor A. Batalin and Klaus Bering and Peter M. Lavrov
Abstract: Finite BRST-BV transformations are studied systematically within the W-X formulation of the standard and the Sp(2)-extended field-antifield formalism. The finite BRST-BV transformations are introduced by formulating a new version of the Lie equations. The corresponding finite change of the gauge-fixing master action X and the corresponding Ward identity are derived.
