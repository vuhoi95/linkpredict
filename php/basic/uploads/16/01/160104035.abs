Title: Analytical study of holographic superconductor in Born-Infeld  electrodynamics with backreaction
Authors: A. Sheykhi and F. Shaker
Abstract: We generalize the analytical investigation on the properties of $s$-wave holographic superconductors in the presence of Born-Infeld nonlinear electrodynamics by taking the backreaction into account. We find that in the presence of nonlinear gauge field, one can still employ the analytical method when the backreaction is turned on. Our calculation is based on the Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem, which is a variational method. For the system under consideration, we obtain the relation between the critical temperature and the charge density. We find that both backreaction and Born-Infeld parameters decrease the critical temperature of the superconductor and make the condensation harder. At the ned of paper, we calculate the critical exponent associated with the condensation near the critical temperature and find that it has the universal value $1/2$ of the mean field theory.
