Abstract: We report on a completely analytical calculation of the field anomalous dimension $\gamma_{\varphi}$ and the critical exponent $\eta$ for the $O(n)$-symmetric $\varphi^4$ model at the record six loop level. We successfully compare our result for $\gamma_{\varphi}$ with $n=1$ with the predictions based on the method of the Borel resummation combined with a conformal mapping. Predictions for seven loop contribution to the field anomalous dimensions are given.
