Title: Reggeon-gluon vertices with Ward identities
Authors: M. A. Braun and M. I. Vyazovsky
Abstract: Ward identities for reggeons are studied in the framework of effective action approach to the QCD in Regge kinematics. It is shown that they require introduction of new contributions not present in the reggeon diagrams initially. Application to vertices RR$\to$RP and RR$\to$RRP are considered and diagrams which have to be added to the QCD ones are found.
