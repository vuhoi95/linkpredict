Title: Algebraic Bethe ansatz for the Temperley-Lieb spin-1 chain
Authors: Rafael I. Nepomechie and Rodrigo A. Pimenta
Abstract: We use the algebraic Bethe ansatz to obtain the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the spin-1 Temperley-Lieb open quantum chain with "free" boundary conditions. We exploit the associated reflection algebra in order to prove the off-shell equation satisfied by the Bethe vectors.
