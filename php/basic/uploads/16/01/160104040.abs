Title: Hawking Radiation of Mass Generating Particles From Dyonic Reissner  Nordström Black Hole
Authors: I. Sakalli and A. Övgün
Abstract: The Hawking radiation is considered as a quantum tunneling process, which can be studied in the framework of the Hamilton-Jacobi method. In this study, we present the wave equation for a mass generating massive and charged scalar particle (boson). In sequel, we analyze the quantum tunneling of these bosons from a generic 4-dimensional spherically symmetric black hole. We apply the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism to derive the radial integral solution for the classically forbidden action which leads to the tunneling probability. To support our arguments, we take the dyonic Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole as a test background. Comparing the tunneling probability obtained with the Boltzmann formula, we succeed to read the standard Hawking temperature of the dyonic Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole.
