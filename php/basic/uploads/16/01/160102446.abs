Title: Series Solutions of PT-Symmetric Schr√∂dinger Equations
Authors: Chris Ford and Bichang Xia
Abstract: We consider series solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation for the Bender-Boettcher potentials V(x)=-(ix)^N with integer N. A simple truncation is introduced which provides accurate results regarding the ground state and first few excited states for any N. This is illustrated with explicit computations of energy levels, node structure and expectation values for some integer N.
