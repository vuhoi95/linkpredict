Title: Photo-production of a 750 GeV di-photon resonance mediated by  Kaluza-Klein leptons in the loop
Authors: Steven Abel and Valentin V. Khoze
Abstract: We consider the phenomenology of a 750 GeV resonance X which can be produced at the LHC by only photon fusion and subsequently decay into di-photons. We propose that the spin-zero state X is coupled to a heavy lepton that lives in the bulk of a higher-dimensional theory and interacts only with the photons of the Standard Model. We compute the di-photon rate in these models with two and more compact extra dimensions and demonstrate that they allow for a compelling explanation of the di-photon excess recently observed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. The central role in our approach is played by the summation over the Kaluza-Klein modes of the new leptons, thus providing a significant enhancement of the $X\to \gamma\gamma$ loops for the production and decay subprocesses. It is expected that the jet activity accompanying these purely electromagnetic (at the partonic level) processes is numerically suppressed by factors such as $\alpha_{em}^2 C_{q\bar{q}}/C_{\gamma\gamma}\sim 10^{-3}$.
