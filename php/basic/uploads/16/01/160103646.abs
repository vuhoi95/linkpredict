Title: A walk on sunset boulevard
Authors: Luise Adams and Christian Bogner and Stefan Weinzierl
Abstract: A walk on sunset boulevard can teach us about transcendental functions associated to Feynman diagrams. On this guided tour we will see multiple polylogarithms, differential equations and elliptic curves. A highlight of the tour will be the generalisation of the polylogarithms to the elliptic setting and the all-order solution for the sunset integral in the equal mass case.
