Title: Bulk gauge and matter fields in nested warping: II. Symmetry Breaking  and phenomenological consequences
Authors: Mathew Thomas Arun and Debajyoti Choudhury
Abstract: Generalizing the Randall-Sundrum scenario to higher dimensions with nested warpings has been shown to avoid the constraints besetting the former. In the first paper of this series [JHEP 1509 (2015) 202], the Standard Model gauge and fermion fields were extended into such a six-dimensional bulk and the construction was shown to have several interesting and welcome features. In this paper, we discuss the electroweak symmetry breaking, presenting a novel Higgs localization mechanism that leads to interesting phenomenology in the Higgs sector. Localizing the Higgs modifies the $Z_{\mu}$ and $W_{\mu}$ boson wavefunctions, which leads to tree level changes in the oblique parameters. Using these as well as the correction to low-energy four-Fermi operators, we derive the constraints on our model and also discuss the gauge coupling evolution therein. Amusingly, the model can naturally incorporate a Higgs resonance in the 700--800 GeV range.
