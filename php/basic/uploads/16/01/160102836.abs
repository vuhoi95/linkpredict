Title: Exceptional versus superPoincar√© algebra as the defining symmetry of  maximal supergravity
Authors: Sudarshan Ananth and Lars Brink and Sucheta Majumdar
Abstract: We describe how one may use either the superPoincar\'e algebra or the exceptional algebra to construct maximal supergravity theories in the light-cone formalism. The d=4 construction shows both symmetries albeit in a non-linearly realized manner. In d=11, we find that we have to choose which of these two symmetries to use, in constructing the theory. In order to understand the other "unused" symmetry, one has to perform a highly non-trivial field redefinition. We argue that this shows that one cannot trust counterterm arguments that do not take the full symmetry of the theory into account. Finally we discuss possible consequences for Superstring theory and M-theory.
