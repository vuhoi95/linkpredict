Title: AdS/CFT prescription for angle-deficit space and winding geodesics
Authors: Irina Ya. Aref'eva and Mikhail A. Khramtsov
Abstract: We present the holographic computation of the boundary two-point correlator using the GKPW prescription for a scalar field in the AdS$_3$ space with a conical defect. Generally speaking, a conical defect breaks conformal invariance in the dual theory, however we calculate the classical Green functions for a scalar field in the bulk with conical defect and use them to compute the two-point correlator in the boundary theory. We compare the obtained general expression with previous studies based on the geodesic approximation. They are in good agreement for short correlators, and main discrepancy comes in the region of long correlations. Meanwhile, in case of $\mathbb{Z}_r$-orbifold, the GKPW result coincides with the one obtained via geodesic images prescription and with the general result for the boundary theory, which is conformal in this special case.
