Title: Can Time-Dependent Zeta Correlators be Swept under the Rug?
Authors: Sibel Boran and E. O. Kahya
Abstract: We discuss quantum gravitational loop effects to observable quantities such as curvature power spectrum and primordial non-gaussianity of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. We first review the previously shown case where one gets a time dependence for zeta-zeta correlator due to loop corrections. Then we investigate the effect of these loop corrections to primordial non-gaussianity of CMB. We conclude that with a single scalar inflaton one gets a huge value for non-gaussianity which exceeds the observed value by at least 30 orders of magnitude. Finally we discuss the consequences of this result for scalar driven inflationary models.
