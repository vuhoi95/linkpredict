Title: Dynamical instabilities and quasi-normal modes, a spectral analysis with  applications to black-hole physics
Authors: Antonin Coutant and Florent Michel and Renaud Parentani
Abstract: Black hole dynamical instabilities have been mostly studied in specific models. We here study the general properties of the complex-frequency modes responsible for such instabilities, guided by the example of a charged scalar field in an electrostatic potential. We show that these modes are square integrable, have a vanishing conserved norm, and appear in mode doublets or quartets. We also study how they appear in the spectrum and how their complex frequencies subsequently evolve when varying some external parameter. When working on an infinite domain, they appear from the reservoir of quasi-normal modes obeying outgoing boundary conditions. This is illustrated by generalizing, in a non-positive definite Krein space, a solvable model (Friedrichs model) which originally describes the appearance of a resonance when coupling an isolated system to a mode continuum. In a finite spatial domain instead, they arise from the fusion of two real frequency modes with opposite norms, through a process that closely resembles avoided crossing.
