Abstract: We exploit the AdS/CFT correspondence to investigate thermalization in an N=2 strongly coupled gauge theory including massless fundamental matter (quark). More precisely, we consider the response of a zero temperature state of the gauge theory under variation of an external electric field leading to a time-dependent current. The holographic dual of the above set-up is given by introducing a time-dependent electric field on the probe D7-brane embedded in an AdS_5 X S^5 background. In the dual gravity theory, due to a time-dependent electric field an apparent horizon forms on the brane which, according to AdS/CFT dictionary, is the counterpart of the thermalization process in the gauge theory. We classify different functions for time-dependent electric field and study their effect on the apparent horizon formation. In the case of pulse functions where the electric field varies from zero to zero, apart from non-equilibrium phase, we observe that two apparent horizons form on the brane. On the gauge theory side, it means that the state of the gauge theory experiences two different temperatures during the time evolution.
