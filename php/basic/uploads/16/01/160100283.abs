Title: Complete cosmic scenario in the Randall-Sundrum braneworld from the  dynamical systems perspective
Authors: Jibitesh Dutta and H. Zonunmawia
Abstract: The paper deals with dynamical system analysis of a coupled scalar field in the Randall-Sundrum(RS)2 brane world. The late time attractor describes the final state of the cosmic evolution. In RS2 based phantom model there is no late-time attractor and consequently there is uncertainty in cosmic evolution. In this paper, we have shown that it is possible to get late-time attractor when gravity is coupled to scalar field. Finally, in order to predict the final evolution of the universe, we have also studied classical stability of the model. It is found that there are late time attractors which are both locally as well as classically stable and so our model can realise the late time cosmic acceleration.
