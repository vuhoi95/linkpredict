Abstract: The existence of the ergoregion of the Kerr space-time has not been confirmed observationally yet. We show that the confirmation would be possible by observing the quasinormal mode in gravitational waves. As an example, using the recent population synthesis results of Pop III binary black holes, we find that the peak of the final merger mass ($M_f$) is about $50~\rm M_{\odot}$, while the fraction of the final spin $q_f = a_f/M_f > 0.7$ needed for the confirmation of a part of ergoregion is $\sim 77\%$. To confirm the frequency of the quasinormal mode, ${\rm SNR} > 35$ is needed. The standard model of Pop III population synthesis tells us that the event rate for the confirmation of more than $50\%$ of the ergoregion by the second generation gravitational wave detectors is $\sim 2.3$ ${\rm events\ yr^{-1}\ (SFR_p/(10^{-2.5}\ M_\odot yr^{-1}\ Mpc^{-3}))} \cdot (\rm [f_b/(1+f_b)]/0.33)$ where ${\rm SFR_p}$ and ${\rm f_b}$ are the peak value of the Pop III star formation rate and the fraction of binaries, respectively.
