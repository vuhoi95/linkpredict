Title: Width of the flux tube in compact U(1) gauge theory in three dimensions
Authors: Michele Caselle and Marco Panero and Davide Vadacchino
Abstract: We study the squared width and the profile of flux tubes in compact U(1) lattice gauge theory in three spacetime dimensions. The results obtained from numerical calculations in the dual formulation of this confining theory are compared with predictions from an effective bosonic-string model and from the dual-superconductor model: it is found that the former fails at describing the quantitative features of the flux tube, while the latter is in good agreement with Monte Carlo data. The analytical interpretation of these results (in the light of the semi-classical analysis by Polyakov) is pointed out, and a comparison with non-Abelian gauge theories in four spacetime dimensions is discussed.
