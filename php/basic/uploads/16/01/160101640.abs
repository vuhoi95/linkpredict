Abstract: We report on the first joint analysis of observational signatures from the electroweak baryogenesis in both gravitational wave (GW) detectors and particle colliders. With an effective extension of the Higgs sector in terms of the dimension-6 operators, we derive a strong first-order phase transition in associated with a sizable CP violation to realize a successful electroweak baryogenesis. We calculate the GW spectrum resulting from the bubble nucleation, plasma transportation, and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence of this process that occurred after the big bang, and find that it yields GW signals testable in Evolved Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, Deci-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory and Big Bang Observer. We further identify collider signals from the same mechanism that are observable at the planning Circular Electron Positron Collider. Our analysis bridges astrophysics/cosmology with particle physics by providing significant motivation for searches for GW event peaking at the $(10^{-4}, 1)$ Hz range, which are associated with signals at colliders, and highlights the possibility of an interdisciplinary observational window into baryogenesis. The technique applied in analyzing early universe phase transitions may enlighten the study of phase transitions in applied science.
