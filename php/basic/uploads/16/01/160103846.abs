Title: Orthosymplectic Chern-Simons Matrix Model and Chirality Projection
Authors: Sanefumi Moriyama and Takao Suyama
Abstract: Recently it was found that the density matrix for a certain orthosymplectic Chern-Simons theory matches with that for the ABJM theory with the odd chiral projection. We prove this fact for a general case with the inclusion of fractional branes. We also identify the first few diagonal Gopakumar-Vafa invariants for the grand potential constructed from the chirally projected density matrix.
