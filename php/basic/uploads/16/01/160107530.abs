Abstract: Recently, it has been observed that in a T-duality invariant world-volume theory in flat spacetime, all orders of gauge field strength and all orders of the D-brane velocity appear in two specific matrices. Using these two matrices, we construct the world-volume couplings of two massless NSNS states at order $\alpha'^2$ and all orders of the velocity and the gauge field strength, by requiring them to be invariant under the linear T-duality. The standard extension $F\rightarrow F+P[B]$, then produces all orders of the pull-back of B-field into the action. We compare the resulting couplings for zero velocity and gauge field strength, with the $\alpha'^2$ terms of the disk-level S-matrix element of two massless NSNS vertex operators in the presence of a constant background B-field. We have found an exact agreement.
