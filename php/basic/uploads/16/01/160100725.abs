Title: A Proposal On Culling & Filtering A Coxeter Group For 4D, N = 1  Spacetime SUSY Representations
Authors: D. E. A. Gates and S. James Gates Jr
Abstract: We review the mathematical tools required to cull and filter representations of the Coxeter Group $BC_4$ into providing bases for the construction of minimal off-shell representations of the 4D, $ {\cal N}$ = 1 spacetime supersymmetry algebra. Of necessity this includes a description of the mathematical mechanism by which four dimensional Lorentz symmetry appears as an emergent symmetry in the context of one dimensional adinkras with four colors described by the Coxeter Group $BC_4$.
