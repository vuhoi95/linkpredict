Authors: Adil Belhaj and Zakariae Benslimane and Moulay Brahim Sedra and Antonio Segui
Abstract: Using M-theory compactification, we develop a three factor separation for the scalar submanifold of N=2 seven dimensional supergravity associated with 2-cycles of the K3 surface. Concretely, we give an interplay between the three scalar submanifold factors and the extremal black holes obtained from M2-branes wrapping such 2-cycles. Then, we show that the corresponding black hole charges are linked to one, two and four qubit systems.
