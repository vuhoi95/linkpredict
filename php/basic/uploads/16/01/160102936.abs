Title: Understanding strongly coupling magnetism from holographic duality
Authors: Rong-Gen Cai and Run-Qiu Yang
Abstract: The unusual magnetic materials are significant in both science and technology. However, because of the strongly correlated effects, it is difficult to understand their novel properties from theoretical aspects. Holographic duality offers a new approach to understanding such systems from gravity side. This paper will give a brief review of our recent works on the applications of holographic duality in understanding unusual magnetic materials. Some quantitative compare between holographic results and experimental data will be shown and some predictions from holographic duality models will be discussed.
