Title: Note on Stability and Holographic Renyi Entropy in New Hyperbolic AdS  Black Holes
Authors: Zhen Fang and Song He and Danning Li
Abstract: We construct a series of new hyperbolic black hole solutions in Einstein-Dilaton system and we apply holographic approach to investigate the spherical Renyi entropy in various deformations. Especially, we introduce various powers in the scalar potential for massive and massless scalar cases. These scalar potentials correspond to deformation of dual CFTs. We make use of a systematic way to generate numerical hyperbolic AdS black hole solutions. Based on these solutions, we study the temperature dependent condensation of dual operator of massive and massless scalar respectively. These condensations show that there might be phase transitions in deformed CFTs. We also compare free energy between hyperbolic black hole solutions and hyperbolic AdS-SW black hole to judge phase transitions. In order to confirm the existence of phase transitions, we turn on linear in-homogenous perturbation to test stability of these hyperbolic AdS black holes. In this paper, we show how potential parameters affect the stability of hyperbolic black holes in several specific examples. For generic value of potential parameters, it needs further study to see how the transition happens. Finally, we comment on these instabilities associated with spherical Renyi entropy in dual deformed CFTs.
