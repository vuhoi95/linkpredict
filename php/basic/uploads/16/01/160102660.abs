Title: Three-Point Disc Amplitudes in the RNS Formalism
Authors: Katrin Becker and Melanie Becker and Daniel Robbins and Ning Su
Abstract: We calculate all tree level string theory vacuum to Dp-brane disc amplitudes involving an arbitrary RR-state and two NS-NS vertex operators. This computation was earlier performed by K. Becker, Guo, and Robbins for the simplest case of a RR-state of type C_{p-3}. Here we use the aid of a computer to calculate all possible three-point amplitudes involving a RR-vertex operator of type C_{p+1+2k}.
