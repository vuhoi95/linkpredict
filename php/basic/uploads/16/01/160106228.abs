Title: Probing the Primordial Universe using Massive Fields
Authors: Xingang Chen and Mohammad Hossein Namjoo and Yi Wang
Abstract: Inflation models are numerous. It is extremely difficult, if possible at all, to identify the actual underlying inflation model of our primordial universe. Thus, for the purpose of proving/falsifying inflation and using inflation to probe new physics, model independent approaches are crucial. Massive fields play a uniquely important role in those missions. This short review is based on a talk by one of the authors (YW) in the 2nd LeCosPA Symposium.
