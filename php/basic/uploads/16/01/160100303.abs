Title: Entanglement thermodynamics for charged black holes
Authors: Pankaj Chaturvedi and Vinay Malvimat and Gautam Sengupta
Abstract: The holographic quantum entanglement entropy for an infinite strip region of the boundary for the field theory dual to charged black holes in ${\cal A}dS_{3+1}$ is investigated. In this framework we elucidate the low and high temperature behavior of the entanglement entropy pertaining to various limits of the black hole charge. In the low temperature regime we establish a first law of entanglement thermodynamics for the boundary field theory.
