Title: The $DKP$ equation in the Woods-Saxon potential well: Bound states
Authors: Boutheina Boutabia-Ch√©raitia and Abdenacer Makhlouf
Abstract: We solve the Duffin-Kemmer-P\'{e}tiau equation in the presence of a spatially one-dimensional symmetric potential well. We compute the scattering state solutions and we derive conditions for transmission resonances. The bound solutions are derived by a graphic study and the appearance of the antiparticle bound state is discussed.
