Title: Pulsar Acceleration Shifts from nearby Supernova Explosion
Authors: Darsh Kodwani and Ue-Li Pen and I-Sheng Yang
Abstract: We show that when a supernova explodes, a nearby pulsar signal goes through a very specific change. The observed period first changes smoothly, then is followed by a sudden change in the time derivative. A stable millisecond pulsar can allow us to measure such an effect. This may improve our measurement of the total energy released in neutrinos and also the orientation of the supernova-pulsar system.
