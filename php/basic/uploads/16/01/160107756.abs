Title: Irregular Vertex Operators for Irregular Conformal Blocks
Authors: Dimitri Polyakov and Chaiho Rim
Abstract: We construct the free field representation of irregular vertex operators of arbitrary rank which generates simultaneous eigenstates of positive modes of Virasoro and W symmetry generators. The irregular vertex operators turn out to be the exponentials of combinations of derivatives of Liouville or Toda fields, creating irregular coherent states. We compute examples of correlation functions of these operators and study their operator algebra.
