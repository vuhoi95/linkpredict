Title: Family of dilatons and metrics for AdS/QCD models
Authors: Alfredo Vega and Paulina Cabrera
Abstract: We explore some possibilities for obtaining useful metrics and dilatons for AdS/QCD models. As a guideline, we consider dilatons and/or metrics that on the one hand reproduce the mesonic spectrum, and that on the other hand allow us a correct implementation of chiral symmetry breaking in AdS/QCD models. We discuss two procedures: one is based on supersymmetric quantum mechanics techniques and the other considers the interpolation between some limits on dilatons and/or metrics.
