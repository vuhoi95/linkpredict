Title: Quantum walks, deformed relativity, and Hopf algebra symmetries
Authors: Alessandro Bisio and Giacomo Mauro D'Ariano and Paolo Perinotti
Abstract: We show how the Weyl quantum walk derived from principles in Ref. [1], enjoying a nonlinear Lorentz symmetry of dynamics, allows one to introduce Hopf algebras for position and momentum of the emerging particle. We focus on two special models of Hopf algebras--the usual Poincar\'e and the k-Poincar\'e algebras.
