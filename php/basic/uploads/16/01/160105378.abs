Title: Deformation quantization and superconformal symmetry in three dimensions
Authors: Christopher Beem and Wolfger Peelaers and Leonardo Rastelli
Abstract: We investigate the structure of certain protected operator algebras that arise in three-dimensional N=4 superconformal field theories. We find that these algebras can be understood as a quantization of (either of) the half-BPS chiral ring(s). An important feature of this quantization is that it has a preferred basis in which the structure constants of the quantum algebra are equal to the OPE coefficients of the underlying superconformal theory. We identify several nontrivial conditions that the quantum algebra must satisfy in this basis. We consider examples of theories for which the moduli space of vacua is either the minimal nilpotent orbit of a simple Lie algebra or a Kleinian singularity. For minimal nilpotent orbits, the quantum algebras (and their preferred bases) can be uniquely determined. These algebras are related to higher spin algebras. For Kleinian singularities the algebras can be characterized abstractly - they are spherical subalgebras of symplectic reflection algebras - but the preferred basis is not easily determined. We find evidence in these examples that for a given choice of quantum algebra (defined up to a certain gauge equivalence), there is at most one choice of canonical basis. We conjecture that this is the case for general N=4 SCFTs.
