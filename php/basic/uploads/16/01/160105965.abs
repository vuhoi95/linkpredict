Title: Chaplygin Gas Ho≈ôava-Lifshitz Quantum Cosmology
Authors: Hossein Ardehali and Pouria Pedram
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Chaplygin gas Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz quantum cosmology. Using Schutz formalism and Arnowitt-Deser-Misner decomposition, we obtain the corresponding Schr\"{o}dinger-Wheeler-DeWitt equation. We obtain exact classical and quantum mechanical solutions and construct wave packets to study the time evolution of the expectation value of the scale factor for two cases. We show that unlike classical solutions and upon choosing appropriate initial conditions, the expectation value of the scale factor never tends to the singular point which exhibits the singularity-free behavior of the solutions in the quantum domain.
