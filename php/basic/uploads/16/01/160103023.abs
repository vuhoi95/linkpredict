Title: Mirror symmetry & supersymmetry on SU(4)-structure backgrounds
Authors: Ruben Minasian and DaniÃ«l Prins
Abstract: We revisit the backgrounds of type IIB on manifolds with $SU(4)$-structure and discuss two sets of solutions arising from internal geometries that are complex and symplectic respectively. Both can be realized in terms of generalized complex geometry. We identify a map which relates the complex and symplectic supersymmetric systems. In the semi-flat torus bundle setting this map corresponds to T-duality and suggest a way of extending the mirror transform to non-K\"ahler geometries.
