Title: The Subtleties of the Wigner Function Formulation of the Chiral Magnetic  Effect
Authors: Yan Wu and Defu Hou and Hai-cang Ren
Abstract: We assess the applicability of the Wigner function formulation for the chiral Magnetic Effect and noted some issues regarding the conservation and the consistency of the electric current in the presence of an inhomogeneous and transient axial chemical potential. The problems are rooted in the ultraviolet divergence of the underlying field theory associated with the axial anomaly.
