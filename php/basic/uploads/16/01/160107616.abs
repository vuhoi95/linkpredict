Title: Precursor problem and holographic mutual information
Authors: Ning Bao and Isaac H. Kim
Abstract: The recent proposal of Almheiri et al.http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7041, together with the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, implies the entanglement wedge hypothesis for certain choices of boundary subregions. This fact is derived in the pure AdS space. A similar conclusion holds in the presence of quantum corrections, but in a more restricted domain of applicability. We also comment on http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05416 and some similarities and differences with this work
