Title: Conformal variations and quantum fluctuations in discrete gravity
Authors: Annalisa Marzuoli and Dario Merzi
Abstract: After an overview of variational principles for discrete gravity, and on the basis of the approach to conformal transformations in a simplicial PL setting proposed by Luo and Glickenstein, we present at a heuristic level an improved scheme for addressing the gravitational (Euclidean) path integral and geometrodynamics.
