Title: Towards a four-loop form factor
Authors: Rutger Boels and Bernd A. Kniehl and Gang Yang
Abstract: The four-loop, two-point form factor contains the first non-planar correction to the lightlike cusp anomalous dimension. This anomalous dimension is a universal function which appears in many applications. Its planar part in N = 4 SYM is known, in principle, exactly from AdS/CFT and integrability while its non-planar part has been conjectured to vanish. The integrand of the form factor of the stress-tensor multiplet in N = 4 SYM including the non-planar part was obtained in previous work. We parametrise the difficulty of integrating this integrand. We have obtained a basis of master integrals for all integrals in the four-loop, two-point class in two ways. First, we computed an IBP reduction of the integrand of the N = 4 form factor using massive computer algebra (Reduze). Second, we computed a list of master integrals based on methods of the Mint package, suitably extended using Macaulay2 / Singular. The master integrals obtained in both ways are consistent with some minor exceptions. The second method indicates that the master integrals apply beyond N = 4 SYM, in particular to QCD. The numerical integration of several of the master integrals will be reported and remaining obstacles will be outlined
