Title: Black Hole Based Quantum Computing in Labs and in the Sky
Authors: Gia Dvali and Mischa Panchenko
Abstract: Analyzing some well established facts, we give a model-independent parameterization of black hole quantum computing in terms of a set of macro and micro quantities and their relations. These include the relations between the extraordinarily-small energy gap of black hole qubits and important time-scales of information-processing, such as, scrambling time and Page's time. We then show, confirming and extending previous results, that other systems of nature with identical quantum informatics features are attractive Bose-Einstein systems at the critical point of quantum phase transition. Here we establish a complete isomorphy between the quantum computational properties of these two systems. In particular, we show that the quantum hair of a critical condensate is strikingly similar to the quantum hair of a black hole. Irrespectively whether one takes the similarity between the two systems as a remarkable coincidence or as a sign of a deeper underlying connection, the following is evident. Black holes are not unique in their way of quantum information processing and we can manufacture black hole based quantum computers in labs by taking advantage of quantum criticality.
