Title: Stability of Differentially Rotating Disks in $f(T)$ Theory
Authors: Shoulong Li and Hao Wei
Abstract: To explain the accelerated expansion of our universe, many dark energy models and modified gravity theories have been proposed so far. It is argued in the literature that they are difficult to be distinguished on the cosmological scales. Therefore, it is well motivated to consider the relevant astrophysical phenomena on (or below) the galactic scales. In this work, we study the stability of self-gravitating differentially rotating galactic disks in $f(T)$ theory, and obtain the local stability criteria in $f(T)$ theory, which are valid for all $f(T)$ theories satisfying $f(T=0)=0$ and $f_T (T=0)\not=0$, if the adiabatic approximation and the weak field limit are considered. The information of the function $f(T)$ is mainly encoded in the parameter $\alpha\equiv 1/f_T(T=0)$. We find that the local stability criteria in $f(T)$ theory are quite different from the ones in Newtonian gravity, general relativity, and other modified gravity theories such as $f(R)$ theory. We consider that this might be a possible hint to distinguish $f(T)$ theory from general relativity and other modified gravity theories on (or below) the galactic scales.
