Title: Traces of Lorentz symmetry breaking in a Hydrogen atom at ground state
Authors: Luiz Henrique de Campos Borges and Fabricio Augusto Barone Rangel
Abstract: Some traces of a specific Lorentz symmetry breaking scenario in the ground state of the Hydrogen atom are investigated. It is used standard Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation theory in order to obtain the corrections to the the ground state energy and wave function. It is shown that an induced four-pole moment arises, due to the Lorentz symmetry breaking. The model considered is the one studied in reference Eur. Phys. J. C {\bf 74}, 2937 (2014), where the Lorentz symmetry is broken in the electromagnetic sector.
