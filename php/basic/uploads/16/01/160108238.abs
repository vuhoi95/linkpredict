Title: On Elliptic Algebras and Large-n Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
Authors: Peter Koroteev and Antonio Sciarappa
Abstract: In this note we further develop the duality between supersymmetric gauge theories in various dimensions and elliptic integrable systems such as Ruijsenaars-Schneider model and periodic intermediate long wave hydrodynamics. These models arise in instanton counting problems and are described by certain elliptic algebras. We discuss the correspondence between the two types of models by employing the large-n limit of the dual gauge theory. In particular we provide non-Abelian generalization of our previous result on the intermediate long wave model.
