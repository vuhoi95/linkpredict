Authors: Davood Momeni and Seyed Ali Hosseini Mansoori and Ratbay Myrzakulov
Abstract: Following a methodology similar to \cite{Alishahiha:2015rta}, we derive a holographic complexity for two dimensional holographic superconductors (gauge/string superconductors) with backreactions. Applying a perturbation method proposed by Kanno in Ref. \cite{kanno}, we study behaviors of the complexity for a dual quantum system near critical points. We show that when a system moves from the normal phase ($T>T_c$) to the superconductor phase ($T<T_c$), the holographic complexity will be divergent.
