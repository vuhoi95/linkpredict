Title: A Near Horizon Stress Tensor for Blackfold
Authors: J. Sadeghi and Z. amoozad
Abstract: In literature, it is nicely proved that Einstein's field equations could be written near a horizon as a thermodynamical equation for the 4 dimensional spherically symmetric static and stationary spacetimes and also axisymmetric cases. In addition, for few types of higher dimensional black branes this thermodynamical equation has been derived. We determine the stress energy tensor for another interesting higher dimensional black branes which are known as blackfolds. Computations are done for two cases of charged and neutral blackfols. The method used is the near horizon expansion of the metrics of neutral and charged blackfolds. Using some rules and conditions, thermodynamic quantities of blackfolds have been calculated. Results surprisingly show that temperature, entropy, pressure and energy density are proportional to $n$ and $\Omega_{n+1}$. Although temperatures (and entropies) differ from each other, the obtained stress energy tensor is the same for neutral and charged blackfolds. It proves that local distribution of energy is the same for the effective theory of charged and neutral blackfolds. In addition, charged and neutral blackfolds can be regarded as a perfect fluid and requiring the general covariance for the intrinsic fluctuations, the hydrodynamic Euler equation will be reproduced.
