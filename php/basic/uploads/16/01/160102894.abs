Title: Vacuum degeneracy = Multiplicity of fundamental scales
Authors: Ivan Arraut and Kaddour Chelabi
Abstract: The presence of Nambu-Goldstone bosons introduce a natural degeneracy inside the vacuum solutions of the non-linear formulations of massive gravity. When the gravitational effects are taken into account, and the observers are located at any distance with respect to the source, this degeneracy corresponds to a multiplicity (flow) of the fundamental scales of the theory. The different values of the fundamental scales are connected each other through the broken generators of the theory.
