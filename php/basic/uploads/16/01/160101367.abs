Abstract: Viable non-perturbative methods for lattice quantum field theories on curved manifolds are difficult. By adapting features from the traditional finite element methods (FEM) and Regge Calculus, a new simplicial lattice Quantum Finite Element (QFE) Lagrangian is constructed for fields on a smooth Riemann manifold. To reach the continuum limit additional counter terms must be constructed to cancel the ultraviolet distortions. This is tested by the comparison of phi 4-th theory at the Wilson-Fisher fixed point with the exact Ising (c =1/2) CFT on a 2D Riemann sphere. The Dirac equation is also constructed on a simplicial lattice approximation to a Riemann manifold by introducing a lattice vierbein and spin connection on each link. Convergence of the QFE Dirac equation is tested against the exact solution for the 2D Riemann sphere. Future directions and applications to Conformal Field Theories are suggested.
