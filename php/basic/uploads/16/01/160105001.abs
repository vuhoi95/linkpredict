Title: The para-HK/QK correspondence
Authors: Malte Dyckmanns and Owen Vaughan
Abstract: We generalise the hyper-Kahler/quaternionic Kahler (HK/QK) correspondence to include para-geometries, and present a new concise proof that the target manifold of the HK/QK correspondence is quaternionic Kahler. As an application, we construct one-parameter deformations of the temporal and Euclidean supergravity c-map metrics and show that they are para-quaternionic Kahler.
