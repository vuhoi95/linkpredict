Title: D1 string dynamics in curved backgrounds with fluxes
Authors: Aritra Banerjee and Sagar Biswas and Rashmi R. Nayak
Abstract: We study various rotating and oscillating D-string configurations in some general backgrounds with fluxes. In particular, we look for solutions to the equations of motion of various rigidly rotating D-strings in $AdS_3$ background with mixed flux, and in the intersecting D-brane geometries. We find out relations among various conserved charges corresponding to the breathing and rotating D-string configurations.
