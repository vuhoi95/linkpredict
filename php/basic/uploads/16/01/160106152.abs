Title: A question mark on the equivalence of Einstein and Jordan frames
Authors: Narayan Banerjee and Barun Majumder
Abstract: With an explicit example, we show that Jordan frame and the conformally transformed Einstein frames clearly lead to different physics for a non-minimally coupled theory of gravity, namely Brans-Dicke theory, at least at the quantum level. The example taken up is the spatially flat Friedmann cosmology in Brans-Dicke theory.
