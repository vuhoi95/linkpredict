Title: Pauli-Lubanski, Supertwistors, and the Superspinning Particle
Authors: Alex S. Arvanitakis and Luca Mezincescu and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: We present a novel construction of the super-Pauli-Lubanski pseudo-vector for the ${\cal N}=1$ super-Poincar\'e algebra of four-dimensional spacetime. Our construction arises naturally in a supertwistor formulation of superparticle dynamics, and relies on the observation that "all superparticles are BPS", we show how the latter follows from unitarity. We illustrate our results with a simple classical action for a "superspinning particle" of superspin 1/2.
