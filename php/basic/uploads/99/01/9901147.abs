Title: Near-Horizon Virasoro Symmetry and the Entropy of de Sitter Space in Any  Dimension
Authors: Feng-Li Lin and Yong-Shi Wu
Abstract: De Sitter spacetime is known to have a cosmological horizon that enjoys thermodynamic-like properties similar to those of a black hole horizon. In this note we show that a universal argument can be given for the entropy of de Sitter spacetime in arbitrary dimensions, by generalizing a recent near horizon symmetry plus conformal field theory argument of Carlip for black hole entropy. The implications of this argument are also discussed.
