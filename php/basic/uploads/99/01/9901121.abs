Title: Three-point Green function of the stress-energy tensor in the AdS/CFT  correspondence
Authors: G. Arutyunov and S. Frolov
Abstract: We compute the 3-point function of the stress-energy tensor in the d-dimensional CFT from the AdS_{d+1} gravity. For d=4 the coefficients of the three linearly independent conformally covariant forms entering the 3-point function are exactly the same as given by the free field computations in the ${\cal N}=4$ SYM just as expected from the known renormalization theorems. For d=3 and d=6 our results give the value of the corresponding 3-point function in the theories of strongly coupled ${\cal N}=8$ superconformal scalar and (2,0) tensor multiplets respectively.
