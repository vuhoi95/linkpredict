Title: The D1-D5 Brane System in Type I String Theory
Authors: Yaron Oz and Donam Youm
Abstract: We construct the supergravity solution for the intersecting D1-D5 brane system in Type I String Theory. The solution encodes the dependence on all the electric charges of the SO(32) gauge group. We discuss the near horizon geometry of the solution and a proposed dual (0,4) superconformal field theory.
