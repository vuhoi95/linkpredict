Title: Metric preheating and limitations of linearized gravity

Abstract: Recently it has become clear that the resonant amplification of quantum field fluctuations at preheating must be accompanied by resonant amplification of scalar metric perturbations, since the two are united by Einstein's equations. Furthermore, this "metric preheating" enhances particle production and leads to gravitational rescattering effects even at linear order. In multi-field models with strong preheating (q \gg 1), metric perturbations are driven nonlinear, with the strongest amplification typically on super-Hubble scales (k \to 0). This amplification is causal, being due to the super- Hubble coherence of the inflaton condensate, and is accompanied by resonant growth of entropy perturbations. The amplification invalidates the use of the linearized Einstein field equations, irrespective of the amount of fine-tuning of the initial conditions. This has serious implications at all scales - from the large-angle cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies to primordial black holes. We investigate the (q,k) parameter space in a two-field model, and introduce the time to nonlinearity, t_{nl}, as the timescale for the breakdown of the linearized Einstein equations. Backreaction effects are expected to shut down the linear resonances, but cannot remove the existing amplification, which threatens the viability of strong preheating when confronted with the CMB. We discuss ways to escape the above conclusions, including secondary phases of inflation and preheating solely to fermions. Finally we rank known classes of inflation from strongest (chaotic and strongly coupled hybrid inflation) to weakest (hidden sector, warm inflation) in terms of the distortion of the primordial spectrum due to these resonances in preheating.
