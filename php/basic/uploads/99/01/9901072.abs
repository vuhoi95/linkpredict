Title: Moyal Nahm Equations
Authors: Linda Baker and David Fairlie
Abstract: Various aspects of the Nahm equations in 3 and 7 dimensions are investigated. The residues of the variables at simple poles in the 7-dimensional case form an algebra. A large class of matrix representations of this algebra is constructed. The large $N$ limit of these equations is taken by replacing the commutators by Moyal Brackets, and a set of non trivial solutions in a generalised form of Wigner distribution functions is obtained.
