Title: On zigzag-invariant strings
Authors: Ian Kogan and Oleg Soloviev
Abstract: We propose a world-sheet realization of the zigzag-invariant strings as a perturbed WZNW model at large negative level. We argue that the gravitational dressing produces additional fixed points of the dressed renormalization beta function. One of these new critical points can be interpreted as a zigzag-invariant string model.
