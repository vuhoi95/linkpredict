Title: Boundary Effects in the Magnetic Catalysis of Chiral Symmetry Breaking
Authors: E. J. Ferrer and V. P. Gusynin and V. de la Incera
Abstract: The catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking by an applied constant magnetic field and in the presence of boundaries along third axis is investigated in the four-dimensional Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. It is shown that in case of periodic boundary conditions for fermions the magnetic field breaks the chiral symmetry, generating a dynamical mass even at the weakest attractive interaction between fermions. For antiperiodic boundary conditions the effect of the finite third dimension is to counteract the chiral symmetry breaking.
