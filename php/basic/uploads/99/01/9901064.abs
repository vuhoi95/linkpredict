Title: Supersymmetrization of generalized Freedman-Townsend models
Authors: Friedemann Brandt and Ulrich Theis
Abstract: We review briefly generalized Freedman-Townsend models found recently by Henneaux and Knaepen, and provide supersymmetric versions of such models in four dimensions which couple 2-form gauge potentials and ordinary gauge fields in a gauge invariant and supersymmetric manner. The latter models have the unusual feature that, in a WZ gauge, the supersymmetry transformations do not commute with all the gauge transformations.
