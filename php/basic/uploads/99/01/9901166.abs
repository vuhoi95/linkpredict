Title: Solutions of WDVV equations in Seiberg-Witten theory from root systems
Authors: Rodolfo Martini and Peter K. H. Gragert
Abstract: We present a complete proof that solutions of the WDVV equations in Seiberg-Witten theory may be constructed from root systems. A generalization to weight systems is proposed.
