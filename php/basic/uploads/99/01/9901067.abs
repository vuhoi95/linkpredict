Title: N=2 Massive superparticle: the Minimality Principle and the k-symmetry
Authors: D. V. Uvarov and A. A. Zheltuklhin
Abstract: The electromagnetic interaction of massive superparticles with N=2 extended Maxwell supermultiplet is studied. It is proved that the minimal coupling breaks the k-symmetry. A non-minimal k-symmetric action is built and it is established that the k-symmetry uniquely fixes the value of the superparticle's anomalous magnetic moment
