Title: Multi-soliton Solution of the Integrable Coupled Nonlinear Schrodinger  Equation of Manakov Type
Authors: Freddy P. Zen and Hendry I. Elim
Abstract: The general multi-soliton solution of the integrable coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLS) of Manakov type is investigated by using Zakharov-Shabat (ZS) scheme. We get the bright and dark multi-soliton solution using inverse scattering method of ZS scheme. Elastic and inelastic collision of N-solitons solution of the equation are also discussed.
