Title: A Note on Anomalies in the AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: Ofer Aharony and Jacek Pawelczyk and Stefan Theisen and Shimon Yankielowicz
Abstract: We test the AdS/CFT correspondence in the case of a d=4 N=2 SCFT by comparing chiral anomalies which are of order N in the 't Hooft large N limit. These include corrections of order 1/N to the conformal anomaly, thus testing the correspondence beyond the extreme large N limit. The field theory anomalies are reproduced by terms in the 7-brane effective action in the bulk.
