Title: Conformal Symmetry in Matrix Model beyond the Eikonal Approximation
Authors: Hiroyuki Hata and Sanefumi Moriyama
Abstract: Recently, it was shown by Jevicki, Kazama and Yoneya (JKY) that the Super-Yang-Mills theories (SYM) in $D\leq 4$ can reproduce the conformal symmetry of the near-horizon geometry of the D-brane solutions. However, the eikonal approximation they used is not sufficient for analyzing the conformal symmetry in SYM. We carry out the 1-loop calculation beyond the eikonal approximation for D=1 SYM (i.e., Matrix model) to confirm the claim of JKY.
