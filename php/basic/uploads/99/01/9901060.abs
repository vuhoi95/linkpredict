Title: BPS solutions of a D5-brane worldvolume in a D3-brane background from  superalgebras
Authors: Ben Craps and Joaquim Gomis and David Mateos and Antoine Van Proeyen
Abstract: The BPS method is used to find BPS solutions of the worldvolume theory of a D5-brane in the near horizon geometry of a D3-brane. The BPS bound is interpreted in terms of the `maximally extended' D5 worldvolume supersymmetry algebra in the corresponding curved background, which is OSp(1|16). This algebra is an extension of the worldvolume superalgebra OSp(4^*|4). The analysis is generalized to the non-near horizon case.
