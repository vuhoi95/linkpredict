Title: Decay of protons and neutrons induced by acceleration
Authors: George E. A. Matsas and Daniel A. T. Vanzella
Abstract: We investigate the decay of accelerated protons and neutrons. Calculations are carried out in the inertial and coaccelerated frames. Particle interpretation of these processes are quite different in each frame but the decay rates are verified to agree in both cases. For sake of simplicity our calculations are performed in a two-dimensional spacetime since our conclusions are not conceptually affected by this.
