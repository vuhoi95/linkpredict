Title: Chiral Symmetry in Supersymmetric Three Dimensional Quantum  Electrodynamics
Authors: M. L. Walker and C. J. Burden
Abstract: We describe the investigation of spontaneous mass-generation and chiral symmetry breaking in supersymmetric QED3 using numerical solutions of the Dyson-Schwinger equation together with the CJT effective action and supersymmetric Ward identities. We find that, within the quenched bare approximation, the chirally symmetric solution is favoured.
