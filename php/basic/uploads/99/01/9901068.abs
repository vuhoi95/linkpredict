Title: Parity and CT realization in QCD
Authors: Vicente Azcoiti and Angelo Galante
Abstract: We show that an essential assumption in the Vafa and Witten's theorem on P and CT realization in vector-like theories, the existence of a free energy density in Euclidean space in the presence of any external hermitian symmetry breaking source, does not apply if the symmetry is spontaneously broken. The assumption that the free energy density is well defined requires the previous assumption that the symmetry is realized in the vacuum. Even if Vafa and Witten's conjecture is plausible, actually a theorem is still lacking.
