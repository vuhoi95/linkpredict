Title: Radiatively Induced Lorentz and CPT Violation in Electrodynamics
Authors: Roman Jackiw and Alan Kostelecky
Abstract: In a nonperturbative formulation, radiative corrections arising from Lorentz and CPT violation in the fermion sector induce a definite and nonzero Chern-Simons addition to the electromagnetic action. If instead a perturbative formulation is used, an infinite class of theories characterized by the value of the Chern-Simons coefficient emerges at the quantum level.
