Title: New N=1 Superconformal Field Theories and their Supergravity Description
Authors: Andreas Karch and Dieter Lust and Andre Miemiec
Abstract: In this note we construct a new class of superconformal field theories as mass deformed N=4 super Yang-Mills theories. We will argue that these theories correspond to the fixed points which were recently found by Khavaev, Pilch and Warner studying the deformations of the dual IIB string theory on AdS_5\times S^5.
