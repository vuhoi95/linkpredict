Title: Non-BPS States in Heterotic - Type IIA Duality
Authors: O. Bergman and M. R. Gaberdiel
Abstract: The relation between some perturbative non-BPS states of the heterotic theory on T^4 and non-perturbative non-BPS states of the orbifold limit of type IIA on K3 is exhibited. The relevant states include a non-BPS D-string, and a non-BPS bound state of BPS D-particles (`D-molecule'). The domains of stability of these states in the two theories are determined and compared.
