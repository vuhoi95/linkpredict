Title: Inhomogeneous Einstein-Rosen String Cosmology
Authors: Dominic Clancy and Alexander Feinstein and James E. Lidsey and Reza Tavakol
Abstract: Families of anisotropic and inhomogeneous string cosmologies containing non-trivial dilaton and axion fields are derived by applying the global symmetries of the string effective action to a generalized Einstein-Rosen metric. The models exhibit a two-dimensional group of Abelian isometries. In particular, two classes of exact solutions are found that represent inhomogeneous generalizations of the Bianchi type VI_h cosmology. The asymptotic behaviour of the solutions is investigated and further applications are briefly discussed.
