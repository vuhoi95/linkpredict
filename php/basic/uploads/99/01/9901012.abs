Title: Black Holes, Shock Waves, and Causality in the AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: Gary T. Horowitz and N. Itzhaki
Abstract: We find the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor in the CFT corresponding to a moving black hole in AdS. Boosting the black hole to the speed of light, keeping the total energy fixed, yields a gravitational shock wave in AdS. The analogous procedure on the field theory side leads to ``light cone'' states, i.e., states with energy-momentum tensor localized on the light cone. The correspondence between the gravitational shock wave and these light cone states provides a useful tool for testing causality. We show, in several examples, how the CFT reproduces the causal relations in AdS.
