Title: Worldsheet Fluctuations and the Heavy Quark Potential in the AdS/CFT  Approach
Authors: J. Greensite and P. Olesen
Abstract: We consider contributions to the heavy quark potential, in the AdS/CFT approach to SU(N) gauge theory, which arise from first order fluctuations of the associated worldsheet in anti-deSitter space. The gaussian fluctuations occur around a classical worldsheet configuration resembling an infinite square well, with the bottom of the well lying at the AdS horizon. The eigenvalues of the corresponding Laplacian operators can be shown numerically to be very close to those in flat space. We find that two of the transverse world sheet fields become massive, which may have implications for the existence of a L{\"u}scher term in the heavy quark potential. It is also suggested that these massive degrees of freedom may relate to extrinsic curvature in an effective D=4 string theory.
