Title: Spherical gauge fields
Authors: Bugra Borasoy and Dean Lee
Abstract: We introduce the spherical field formalism for free gauge fields. We discuss the structure of the spherical Hamiltonian for both general covariant gauge and radial gauge and point out several new features not present in the scalar field case. We then use the evolution equations to compute gauge-field and field-strength correlators.
