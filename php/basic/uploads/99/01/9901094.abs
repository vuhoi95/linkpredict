Title: Supersolutions
Authors: Pierre Deligne and Daniel S. Freed
Abstract: We develop classical globally supersymmetric theories. As much as possible, we treat various dimensions and various amounts of supersymmetry in a uniform manner. We discuss theories both in components and in superspace. Throughout we emphasize geometric aspects. The beginning chapters give a general discussion about supersymmetric field theories; then we move on to detailed computations of lagrangians, etc. in specific theories. An appendix details our sign conventions. This text will appear in a two-volume work "Quantum Fields and Strings: A Course for Mathematicians" to be published soon by the American Mathematical Society.
