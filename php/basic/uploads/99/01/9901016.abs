Title: Algebraic Realization of Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics for Cyclic  Shape Invariant Potentials
Authors: C. Quesne and N. Vansteenkiste
Abstract: We study in detail the spectrum of the bosonic oscillator Hamiltonian associated with the $C_3$-extended oscillator algebra \algthree, where $C_3$ denotes a cyclic group of order three, and classify the various types of spectra in terms of the algebra parameters $\alpha_0, \alpha_1$. In such a classification, we identify those spectra having an infinite number of periodically spaced levels, similar to those of cyclic shape invariant potentials of period three. We prove that the hierarchy of supersymmetric Hamiltonians and supercharges, corresponding to the latter, can be realized in terms of some appropriately chosen \algthree algebras, and of Pauli spin matrices. Extension to period-$\lambda$ spectra in terms of $C_{\lambda}$-extended oscillator algebras is outlined.
