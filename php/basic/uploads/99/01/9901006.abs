Title: Scalar radiation emitted from a source rotating around a black hole
Authors: Luis C. B. Crispino and Atsushi Higuchi and George E. A. Matsas
Abstract: We analyze the scalar radiation emitted from a source rotating around a Schwarzschild black hole using the framework of quantum field theory at the tree level. We show that for relativistic circular orbits the emitted power is about 20% to 30% smaller than what would be obtained in Minkowski spacetime. We also show that most of the emitted energy escapes to infinity. Our formalism can readily be adapted to investigate similar processes.
