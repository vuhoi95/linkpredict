Title: Singleton physics
Authors: Moshe Flato and Christian Fronsdal and Daniel Sternheimer
Abstract: We review the developments in the past twenty years (which are based on our deformation philosophy of physical theories) dealing with elementary particles composed of singletons in anti De Sitter space-time. The study starts with the kinematical aspects (especially for massless particles) and extends to the beginning of a field theory of composite elementary particles and its relations with conformal field theory (including very recent developments).
