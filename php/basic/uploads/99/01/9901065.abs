Title: Possible Physical Manifestation of the Weyl Non-Abelian Gauge Field
Authors: B. M. Barbashov and A. B. Pestov
Abstract: On the basis of the Weyl equations of congruent transference, we consider a possible influence of the Weyl non-Abelian gauge field defining the transference on the precession of a gyroscope. Plane-wave solutions to the equations of the non-Abelian gauge field are derived.
