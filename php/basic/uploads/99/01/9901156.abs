Title: Infrared behavior of graviton-graviton scattering
Authors: J. F. Donoghue and T. Torma
Abstract: The quantum effective theory of general relativity, independent of the eventual full theory at high energy, expresses graviton-graviton scattering at one loop order O(E^4) with only one parameter, Newton's constant. Dunbar and Norridge have calculated the one loop amplitude using string based techniques. We complete the calculation by showing that the 1/(d-4) divergence which remains in their result comes from the infrared sector and that the cross section is finite and model independent when the usual bremsstrahlung diagrams are included.
