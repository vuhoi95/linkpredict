Title: New Numerical Methods for Iterative or Perturbative Solution of Quantum  Field Theory
Authors: Stephen C. Hahn and G. S. Guralnik
Abstract: A new computational idea for continuum quantum field theories is outlined. This approach is based on the lattice source Galerkin methods developed by Garcia, Guralnik and Lawson. The method has many promising features including treating fermions on a relatively symmetric footing with bosons. As a spinoff of the technology developed for ``exact'' solutions, the numerical methods used have a special case application to perturbation theory. We are in the process of developing an entirely numerical approach to evaluating graphs to high perturbative order.
