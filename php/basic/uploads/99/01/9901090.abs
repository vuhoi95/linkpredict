Title: Decomposition of nonlocal light-cone operators into harmonic operators  of definite twist
Authors: B. Geyer and M. Lazar and D. Robaschik
Abstract: Bilocal light-ray operators which are Lorentz scalars, vectors or antisymmetric tensors, and which appear in various hard scattering QCD processes, are decomposed into operators of definite twist. These operators are harmonic tensor functions and their Taylor expansion consists of (traceless) local light-cone operators with span irreducible representations of the Lorentz group with definite spin j and common geometric twist (= dimension - spin). Some applications concerning the nonforward matrix elements of these operators and the generalization fo conformal light-cone operators of definite twist is considered. The group theoretical background of the method has been made clear.
