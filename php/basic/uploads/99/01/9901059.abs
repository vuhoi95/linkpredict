Title: Phases of the Brans-Dicke Cosmology with Matter
Authors: Chanyong Park and Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: We study the cosmology of the Brans-Dicke theory with perfect fluid type matter. In our previous work, we found exact solutions for any Brans-Dicke parameter $\omega$ and for general parameter $\gamma$ of equation of state. In this paper we further study the cosmology of these solutions by analyzing them according to their asymptotic behaviors. The cosmology is classified into 19 phases according to the values of $\gamma$ and $\omega$. The effect of the cosmological constant to the Brans-Dicke theory is a particular case of our model. We give plot of time evolution of the scale factor by numerical investigations. We also give a comparison of the solutions for the theories with and without matter.
