Title: Holomorphic Vector Bundles and Non-Perturbative Vacua in M-Theory
Authors: Ron Donagi and Andre Lukas and Burt A. Ovrut and Daniel Waldram
Abstract: We review the spectral cover formalism for constructing both U(n) and SU(n) holomorphic vector bundles on elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau three-folds which admit a section. We discuss the allowed bases of these three-folds and show that physical constraints eliminate Enriques surfaces from consideration. Relevant properties of the remaining del Pezzo and Hirzebruch surfaces are presented. Restricting the structure group to SU(n), we derive, in detail, a set of rules for the construction of three-family particle physics theories with phenomenologically relevant gauge groups. We show that anomaly cancellation generically requires the existence of non-perturbative vacua containing five-branes. We illustrate these ideas by constructing four explicit three-family non-perturbative vacua.
