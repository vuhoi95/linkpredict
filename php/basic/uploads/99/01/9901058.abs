Title: Equivariant and Bott-type Seiberg-Witten Floer Homology: Part I
Authors: Guofang Wang and Rugang Ye
Abstract: We construct Bott-type and equivariant Seiberg-Witten Floer homology and cohomology for 3-manifolds, in particular rational homology spheres, and prove their diffeomorphism invariance. This paper is a revised version of math.DG/9701010. Some typos are removed.
