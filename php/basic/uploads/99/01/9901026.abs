Title: Possible quantum instability of primordial black holes
Authors: E. Elizalde and S. Nojiri and S. D. Odintsov
Abstract: Evidence for the possible existence of a quantum process opposite to the famous Hawking radiation (evaporation) of black holes is presented. This new phenomenon could be very relevant in the case of exotic multiple horizon Nariai black holes and in the context of common grand unified theories. This is clearly manifested in the case of the SO(10) GUT, that is here investigated in detail. The remarkable result is obtained, that anti-evaporation can occur there only in the SUSY version of the theory. It is thus concluded that the existence of primordial black holes in the present Universe might be considered as an evidence for supersymmetry.
