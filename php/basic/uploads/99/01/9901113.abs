Title: On rigid string instantons in four dimensions
Authors: B. G. Konopelchenko and G. Landolfi
Abstract: Generalized Weierstrass formulae for surfaces in four-dimensional space $\Bbb{R}^{4}$ are used to study (anti)self-dual rigid string configurations. It is shown that such configurations are given by superminimal immersions into $\Bbb{R}^{4}$. Explicit formulae for generic (anti)instantons are presented. Particular classes of surfaces are also analyzed.
