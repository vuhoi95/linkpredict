Title: Predicting the critical density of topological defects in O(N) scalar  field theories
Authors: Nuno D. Antunes and Luis M. A. Bettencourt and Andrew Yates
Abstract: O(N) symmetric $\lambda \phi^4$ field theories describe many critical phenomena in the laboratory and in the early Universe. Given N and $D\leq 3$, the dimension of space, these models exhibit topological defect classical solutions that in some cases fully determine their critical behavior. For N=2, D=3 it has been observed that the defect density is seemingly a universal quantity at T_c. We prove this conjecture and show how to predict its value based on the universal critical exponents of the field theory. Analogously, for general N and D we predict the universal critical densities of domain walls and monopoles, for which no detailed thermodynamic study exists. This procedure can also be inverted, producing an algorithm for generating typical defect networks at criticality, in contrast to the canonical procedure, which applies only in the unphysical limit of infinite temperature.
