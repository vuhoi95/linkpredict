Title: Supersymmetry algebra and BPS states of super Yang-Mills theories on  noncommutative tori
Authors: A. Konechny and A. Schwarz
Abstract: We consider 10-dimensional super Yang-Mills theory with topological terms compactified on a noncommutative torus. We calculate supersymmetry algebra and derive BPS energy spectra from it. The cases of d-dimensional tori with d=2,3,4 are considered in full detail. SO(d,d|Z)-invariance of the BPS spectrum and relation of new results to the previous work in this direction are discussed.
