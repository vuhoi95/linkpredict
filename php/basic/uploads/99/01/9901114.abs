Title: Definition of Magnetic Monopole Numbers for SU(N) Lattice Gauge-Higgs  Models
Authors: S. Hollands and M. Mueller-Preussker
Abstract: A geometric definition for a magnetic charge of Abelian monopoles in SU(N) lattice gauge theories with Higgs fields is presented. The corresponding local monopole number defined for almost all field configurations does not require gauge fixing and is stable against small perturbations. Its topological content is that of a 3-cochain. A detailed prescription for calculating the local monopole number is worked out. Our method generalizes a magnetic charge definition previously invented by Phillips and Stone for SU(2).
