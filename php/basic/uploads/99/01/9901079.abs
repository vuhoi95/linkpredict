Title: A New Renormalization Group for Hamiltonian Field Theory
Authors: Robert J. Perry and Sergio Szpigel
Abstract: The Schrodinger equation with a two-dimensional delta-function potential is a simple example of an asymptotically free theory that undergoes dimensional transmutation. Renormalization requires the introduction of a mass scale, which can be lowered perturbatively until an infrared cutoff produced by non-perturbative effects such as bound state formation is encountered. We outline the effective field theory and similarity renormalization group techniques for producing renormalized cutoff hamiltonians, and illustrate the control of logarithmic and inverse-power-law errors both techniques provide.
