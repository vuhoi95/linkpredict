Title: The Quantization of Free EM Fields: An Alternative Approach to solve the  Vacuum Catastrophe
Authors: H. Razmi and A. H. Abbassi
Abstract: It is shown that the canonical quantum field theory of radiation based on the field theoretical generalization of a recently proposed [1] commutation relation between position and momentum operators of massless particles leads to zero vacuum energy. This may be considered as a step toward the solution of the cosmological constant problem at least for the electromagnetic (EM) field's contribution.
