Title: Instanton Action for Type II Hypermultiplets
Authors: Katrin Becker and Melanie Becker
Abstract: We analyze the hypermultiplet moduli space describing the universal sector of type IIA theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold. The classical moduli space is described in terms of the coset $SU(2,1)/U(2)$. The flux quantization condition of the antisymmetric tensor field of M-theory implies discrete identifications for the scalar fields describing this four- dimensional quaternionic geometry. Non-perturbative corrections of the classical theory are described in terms of a membrane- fivebrane instanton action which we construct herein.
