Title: Comparison of quantum field perturbation theory for the light front with  the theory in lorentz coordinates
Authors: S. A. Paston and V. A. Franke
Abstract: The relationship between the perturbation theory in light-front coordinates and Lorentz-covariant perturbation theory is investigated. A method for finding the difference between separate terms of the corresponding series without their explicit evaluation is proposed. A procedure of constructing additional counter-terms to the canonical Hamiltonian that compensate this difference at any finite order is proposed. For the Yukawa model, the light-front Hamiltonian with all of these counter-terms is obtained in a closed form. Possible application of this approach to gauge theories is discussed.
