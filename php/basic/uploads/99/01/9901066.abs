Title: Black Holes and Super Black Holes as Chern Simons Theories in 2+1  Dimensions
Authors: Sharmanthie Fernando and Freydoon Mansouri
Abstract: We study anti-de Sitter black holes in 2+1 dimensions in terms of Chern Simons gauge theory of the anti-de Sitter group coupled to a Source. Taking the source to be an anti-de Sitter state specified by its Casimir invariants, we show how all the relevant features of the black hole are accounted for. Enlarging the gauge symmetry to super AdS group, we obtain a supermultiplet of AdS black holes. We give explicit expressions for the masses and the angular momenta of the members of the multiplet.
