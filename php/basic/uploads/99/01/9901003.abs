Title: Wave Function of a Brane-like Universe
Authors: Aharon Davidson and David Karasik and Yoav Lederer
Abstract: Within the mini-superspace model, brane-like cosmology means performing the variation with respect to the embedding (Minkowski) time $\tau$ before fixing the cosmic (Einstein) time $t$. The departure from Einstein limit is parameterized by the 'energy' conjugate to $\tau$, and characterized by a classically disconnected Embryonic epoch. In contrast with canonical quantum gravity, the wave-function of the brane-like Universe is (i) $\tau$-dependent, and (ii) vanishes at the Big Bang. Hartle-Hawking and Linde proposals dictate discrete 'energy' levels, whereas Vilenkin proposal resembles $\alpha$-particle disintegration.
