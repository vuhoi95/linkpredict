Abstract: We consider a category of finite crystals of a quantum affine algebra whose objects are not necessarily perfect, and set of paths, semi-infinite tensor product of an object of this category with a certain boundary condition. It is shown that the set of paths is isomorphic to a direct sum of infinitely many, in general, crystals of integrable highest weight modules. We present examples from C_n^{(1)} and A_{n-1}^{(1)}, in which the direct sum becomes a tensor product as suggested from the Bethe Ansatz.
