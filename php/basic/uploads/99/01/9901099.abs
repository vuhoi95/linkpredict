Title: Critical and off-critical studies of the Baxter-Wu model with general  toroidal boundary conditions
Authors: F. C. Alcaraz and J. C. Xavier
Abstract: The operator content of the Baxter-Wu model with general toroidal boundary conditions is calculated analytically and numerically. These calculations were done by relating the partition function of the model with the generating function of a site-colouring problem in a hexagonal lattice. Extending the original Bethe-ansatz solution of the related colouring problem we are able to calculate the eigenspectra of both models by solving the associated Bethe-ansatz equations. We have also calculated, by exploring the conformal invariance at the critical point, the mass ratios of the underlying massive theory governing the Baxter-Wu model in the vicinity of its critical point.
