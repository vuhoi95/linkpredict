Title: Non-standard matrix formats of Lie superalgebras
Authors: F. Delduc and F. Gieres and S. Gourmelen and S. Theisen
Abstract: The standard format of matrices belonging to Lie superalgebras consists of partitioning the matrices into even and odd blocks. In this paper, we study other possible matrix formats and in particular the so-called diagonal format which naturally occurs in various applications, e.g. in superconformal field theory, superintegrable models, for super W-algebras and quantum supergroups.
