Title: General structure of the graviton self-energy
Authors: F. T. Brandt and J. Frenkel
Abstract: The graviton self-energy at finite temperature depends on fourteen structure functions. We show that, in the absence of tadpoles, the gauge invariance of the effective action imposes three non-linear relations among these functions. The consequences of such constraints, which must be satisfied by the thermal graviton self-energy to all orders, are explicitly verified in general linear gauges to one loop order.
