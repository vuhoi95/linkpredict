Title: The Operator Spectrum of the Six-dimensional (1,0) Theory
Authors: Eric G. Gimon and Costin Popescu
Abstract: We study the large N operator spectrum of the (1,0) superconformal chiral six-dimensional theory with E_8 global symmetry. This spectrum is dual to the Kaluza-Klein spectrum of supergravity on AdS_7 X S^4/Z_2 with a ten-dimensional E_8 theory at its singular locus. We identify those operators in short multiplets of OSp(6,2|2), whose dimensions are exact for any N. We also discuss more general issues concerning AdS/CFT duality on orbifold supergravity backgrounds.
