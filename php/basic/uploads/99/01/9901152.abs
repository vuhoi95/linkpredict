Title: Eleven-dimensional massless superparticles and matrix theory spin-orbit  couplings revisited
Authors: Seungjoon Hyun and Youngjai Kiem and Hyeonjoon Shin
Abstract: The classical probe dynamics of the eleven-dimensional massless superparticles in the background geometry produced by N source M-momenta is investigated in the framework of N-sector DLCQ supergravity. We expand the probe action up to the two fermion terms and find that the fermionic contributions are the spin-orbit couplings, which precisely agree with the matrix theory calculations. We comment on the lack of non-perturbative corrections in the one-loop matrix quantum mechanics effective action and its compatibility with the supergravity analysis.
