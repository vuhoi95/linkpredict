Title: Operatorial quantization of Born-Infeld Skyrmions
Authors: Jorge Ananias Neto and Emanuel R. de Oliveira and Wilson Oliveira
Abstract: The SU(2) collective coordinates quantization of the Born-Infeld Skyrmions Lagrangean is performed. The obtainment of the classical Hamiltonian from this special Lagrangean is made by using an approximate way: it is derived from the expansion of this non-polynomial Lagrangean up to second-order variable in the collective coordinates, using for this some causality arguments. Because this system presents constraints, we use the Dirac Hamiltonian method and the Faddeev-Jackiw Lagrangean approach to quantize this model.
