Title: Anomalies and Analytic Torsion on Hyperbolic Manifolds
Authors: A. A. Bytsenko and A. E. Goncalves and M. Simoes and F. L. Williams
Abstract: The global additive and multiplicative properties of the Laplacian on j-forms and related zeta functions are analyzed. The explicit form of zeta functions on a product of closed oriented hyperbolic manifolds \Gamma\backslash{\Bbb H}^d and of the multiplicative anomaly are derived. We also calculate in an explicit form the analytic torsion associated with a connected sum of such manifolds.
