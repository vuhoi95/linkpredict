Title: The D8-Brane Tied up: String and Brane Solutions in Massive Type IIA  Supergravity
Authors: Bert Janssen and Patrick Meessen and Tomas Ortin
Abstract: We present two new solutions of Romans' massive type IIA supergravity characterized by the two non-trivial massive potentials of Romans' theory: the NSNS 2-form and the RR 7-form. They can be interpreted respectively as the intersection of a fundamental string and a D8-brane over a D0-brane and the intersection of a D6-brane with a D8-brane over a NSNS5-brane. The D8-brane manifests itself through the mass parameter and in the massless limit one recovers the standard fundamental string and D6-brane solutions. Although these solutions do not have the usual form for BPS bound states at threshold and each of them involves 3 objects, both of them preserve 1/4 of the supersymmetries.
