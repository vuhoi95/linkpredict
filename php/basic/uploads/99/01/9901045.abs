Title: The O(dd) Story of Massive Supergravity
Authors: Nemanja Kaloper and Robert C. Myers
Abstract: The low energy effective action describing the standard Kaluza-Klein reduction of heterotic string theory on a d-torus possesses a manifest O(d,d+16) symmetry. We consider generalized Scherk-Schwarz reductions of the heterotic string to construct massive gauged supergravities. We show that the resulting action can still be written in a manifestly O(d,d+16) invariant form, however, the U-duality transformations also act on the mass parameters. The latter play the dual role of defining the scalar potential and the nonabelian structure constants. We conjecture that just as for the standard reduction, a subgroup of this symmetry corresponds to an exact duality symmetry of the heterotic string theory.
