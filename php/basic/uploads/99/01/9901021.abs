Title: Conformal Anomaly Of Submanifold Observables In AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: C. Robin Graham and Edward Witten
Abstract: We analyze the conformal invariance of submanifold observables associated with $k$-branes in the AdS/CFT correspondence. For odd $k$, the resulting observables are conformally invariant, and for even $k$, they transform with a conformal anomaly that is given by a local expression which we analyze in detail for $k=2$
