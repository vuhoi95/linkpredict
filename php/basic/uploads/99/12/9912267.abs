Title: On the relation between Euclidean and Lorentzian 2D quantum gravity
Authors: J. Ambjorn and J. Correia and C. Kristjansen and R. Loll
Abstract: Starting from 2D Euclidean quantum gravity, we show that one recovers 2D Lorentzian quantum gravity by removing all baby universes. Using a peeling procedure to decompose the discrete, triangulated geometries along a one-dimensional path, we explicitly associate with each Euclidean space-time a (generalized) Lorentzian space-time. This motivates a map between the parameter spaces of the two theories, under which their propagators get identified. In two dimensions, Lorentzian quantum gravity can therefore be viewed as a ``renormalized'' version of Euclidean quantum gravity.
