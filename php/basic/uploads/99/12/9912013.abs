Title: Surface counterterms and boundary stress-energy tensors for  asymptotically non-anti-de Sitter spaces
Authors: Rong-Gen Cai and Nobuyoshi Ohta
Abstract: For spaces which are not asymptotically anti-de Sitter where the asymptotic behavior is deformed by replacing the cosmological constant by a dilaton scalar potential, we show that it is possible to have well-defined boundary stress-energy tensors and finite Euclidean actions by adding appropriate surface counterterms. We illustrate the method by the examples of domain-wall black holes in gauged supergravities, three-dimensional dilaton black holes and topological dilaton black holes in four dimensions. We calculate the boundary stress-energy tensor and Euclidean action of these black configurations and discuss their thermodynamics. We find new features of topological black hole thermodynamics.
