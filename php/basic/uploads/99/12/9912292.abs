Title: 1/4 PBGS and Superparticle Actions
Authors: F. Delduc and E. Ivanov and S. Krivonos
Abstract: We construct the worldline superfield massive superparticle actions which preserve 1/4 portion of the underlying higher-dimensional supersymmetry. We consider the cases of N=4/N=1 and N=8/N=2 partial breaking. In the first case we present the corresponding Green-Schwarz type target superspace action with one kappa supersymmetry. In the second case we find out two possibilities, one of which is a direct generalization of the N=4/N=1 case, while another is essentially different.
