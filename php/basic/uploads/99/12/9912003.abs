Abstract: The local Sugawara constructions of the "small" N=4 SCA in terms of supercurrents of N=2 extensions of the affinization of the sl(2|1) and sl(3) algebras are investigated. The associated super mKdV type hierarchies induced by N=4 SKdV ones are defined. In the sl(3) case the existence of two inequivalent Sugawara constructions is found. The long one involves all the affine sl(3)-valued currents, while the "short" one deals only with those from the subalgebra sl(2)\oplus u(1). As a consequence, the sl(3)-valued affine superfields carry two inequivalent mKdV type super hierarchies induced by the correspondence between "small" N=4 SCA and N=4 SKdV hierarchy. However, only the first hierarchy posseses genuine global N=4 supersymmetry. We discuss peculiarities of the realization of this N=4 supersymmetry on the affine supercurrents.
