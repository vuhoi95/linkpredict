Title: The non-Abelian dual Meissner effect as color-alignment in SU(2) lattice  gauge theory
Authors: Kurt Langfeld and Alexandra Schafke
Abstract: A new gauge (m-gauge) condition is proposed by means of a generalization of the Maximal Abelian gauge (MAG). The new gauge admits a space time dependent embedding of the residual U(1) into the SU(2) gauge group. This embedding is characterized by a color vector $\vec{m}(x)$. It turns out that this vector only depends of gauge invariant parts of the link configurations. Our numerical results show color ferromagnetic correlations of the $\vec{m}(x)$ field in space-time. The correlation length scales towards the continuum limit. For comparison with the MAG, we introduce a class of gauges which smoothly interpolates between the MAG and the m-gauge. For a wide range of the gauge parameter, the vacuum decomposes into regions of aligned vectors $\vec{m}$. The ''neutral particle problem'' of MAG is addressed in the context of the new gauge class.
