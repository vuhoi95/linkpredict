Title: Electroweak Symmetry Breaking and Extra Dimensions
Authors: Hsin-Chia Cheng and Bogdan A. Dobrescu and Christopher T. Hill
Abstract: Electroweak symmetry can be naturally broken by observed quark and gauge fields in various extra-dimensional configurations. No new {\it fundamental} fields are required below the quantum gravitational scale ($\sim$ 10 - 100 TeV). We examine schemes in which the QCD gauge group alone, in compact extra dimensions, forms a composite Higgs doublet out of (t,b)_L and a linear combination of the Kaluza-Klein modes of t_R. The effective theory at low energies is the Standard Model. The top-quark mass is controlled by the number of active t_R Kaluza-Klein modes below the string scale, and is in agreement with experiment.
