Title: Space-Time Foam From Non-Commutative Instantons
Authors: Harry W. Braden and Nikita A. Nekrasov
Abstract: We show that a U(1) instanton on non-commutative R^4 corresponds to a supersymmetric non-singular U(1) gauge field on a commutative Kahler manifold X which is a blowup of C^2 at a finite number of points. For instanton charge k the manifold X can be viewed as a space-time foam. A direct connection with integrable systems of Calogero-Moser type is established. We also make some comments on the non-abelian case.
