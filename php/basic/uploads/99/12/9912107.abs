Title: M Theory on the Stiefel manifold and 3d Conformal Field Theories
Authors: A. Ceresole and G. Dall'Agata and R. D'Auria and S. Ferrara
Abstract: We compute the mass and multiplet spectrum of M theory compactified on the product of AdS(4) spacetime by the Stiefel manifold V(5,2)=SO(5)/SO(3), and we use this information to deduce via the AdS/CFT map the primary operator content of the boundary N=2 conformal field theory. We make an attempt for a candidate supersymmetric gauge theory that, at strong coupling, should be related to parallel M2-branes on the singular point of the non-compact Calabi-Yau four-fold $\sum_{a=1}^5 z_a^2 = 0$, describing the cone on V(5,2).
