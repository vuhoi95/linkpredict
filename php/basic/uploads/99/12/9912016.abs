Title: Ward identities and the vanishing theorem for loop amplitudes of the  closed N=2 string
Authors: Klaus Junemann and Olaf Lechtenfeld
Abstract: The existence of a ground ring of ghost number zero operators in the chiral BRST cohomology of the N=2 string is used to derive an infinite set of Ward identities for the closed-string scattering amplitudes at arbitrary genus. These identities are sufficient to rederive the well known vanishing theorem for loop amplitudes with more than three external legs.
