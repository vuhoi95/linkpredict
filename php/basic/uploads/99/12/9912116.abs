Abstract: The condensation of a dual-vector field is investigated in the dual Monopole Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with dual Dirac strings. The condensate of a dual-vector field is calculated as a functional of a shape of a dual Dirac string. The obtained result is compared with the gluon condensate calculated in a QCD sum rules approach and on lattice.
