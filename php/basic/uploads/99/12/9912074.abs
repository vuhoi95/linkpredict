Title: Evidence for Nonvanishing Cosmological Constant in NonSusy Superstring  Models
Authors: Roberto Iengo and Chuan-Jie Zhu
Abstract: We reanalyse the computation of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ at two loops in recently proposed Superstring models without massless gravitini, both in the theta-function based formalism and by a detailed computation in the more explicit hyperelliptic description of the underlying genus two Riemann surface. $\Lambda$ is expressed as the integral over the surface moduli of an amplitude which is zero if susy is not completely broken, but we find it to be nonvanishing in the susy breaking models which can be given an explicitly workable fermionic formulation. Thus unfortunately the issue of getting realistic and perturbatively viable models from Superstring Theory remains open.
