Title: Four-Point Amplitude from Open Superstring Field Theory
Authors: Nathan Berkovits and Carlos Tello Echevarria
Abstract: An open superstring field theory action has been proposed which does not suffer from contact term divergences. In this paper, we compute the on-shell four-point tree amplitude from this action using the Giddings map. After including contributions from the quartic term in the action, the resulting amplitude agrees with the first-quantized prescription.
