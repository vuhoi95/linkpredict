Title: Regularized Casimir energy for an infinite dielectric cylinder subject  to light-velocity conservation
Authors: Israel Klich and August Romeo
Abstract: The Casimir energy of a dilute dielectric cylinder, with the same light-velocity as in its surrounding medium, is evaluated exactly to first order in $\xi^2$ and numerically to higher orders in $\xi^2$. The first part is carried out using addition formulas for Bessel functions, and no Debye expansions are required.
