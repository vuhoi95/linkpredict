Abstract: We suggest a procedure for calculating correlation functions of the local densities of states (DOS) at the plateau transitions in the Integer Quantum Hall effect (IQHE). We argue that their correlation functions are appropriately described in terms of the SL($2,{\Bbb C}$)/SU(2) WZNW model (at the usual Ka{\v c}--Moody point and with the level $6 \leq k \leq 8$). In this model we have identified the operators corresponding to the local DOS, and derived the partial differential equation determining their correlation functions. The OPEs for powers of the local DOS obtained from this equation are in agreement with available results.
