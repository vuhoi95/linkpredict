Title: Calogero-Moser systems and Hitchin systems
Authors: J. C. Hurtubise and E. Markman
Abstract: We exhibit the elliptic Calogero-Moser system as a Hitchin system of G-principal Higgs pairs. The group G, though naturally associated to any root system, is not semi-simple. We then interpret the Lax pairs with spectral parameter of [dP1] and [BSC1] in terms of equivariant embeddings of the Hitchin system of G into that of GL(N).
