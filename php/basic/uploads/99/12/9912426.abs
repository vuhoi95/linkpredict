Title: CPT, dissipation, and all that
Authors: F. Benatti and R. Floreanini
Abstract: A phenomenological paradigm for the study of CPT-violating effects in the neutral kaon system is presented. Besides the familiar direct and indirect breakings, it encodes possible phenomena leading to irreversibility and dissipation, that could originate from quantum effects at Planck's scale. These new effects can be experimentally probed with great accuracy, in particular at phi-factories.
