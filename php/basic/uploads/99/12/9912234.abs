Title: The SU(2) Skyrme model and anomaly
Authors: Everton M. C. Abreu and Jorge Ananias Neto and Wilson Oliveira
Abstract: The SU(2) Skyrme model,expanding in the collective coordinates variables, gives rise to second-class constraints. Recently this system was embedded in a more general Abelian gauge theory using the BFFT Hamiltonian method. In this work we quantize this gauge theory computing the Noether current anomaly using for this two different methods: an operatorial Dirac first class formalism and the non-local BV quantization coupled with the Fujikawa regularization procedure.
