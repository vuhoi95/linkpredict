Title: A composite bosons minimal basis for the pairing Hamiltonian
Authors: M. B. Barbaro and A. Molinari and F. Palumbo and M. R. Quaglia
Abstract: The pairing interaction among identical nucleons in a single-particle level is treated in the hamiltonian formalism using even Grassmann variables. A minimal (irreducible) basis having a remarkable symmetry property is set up using composite, commuting variables with a finite index of nilpotency. Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of given energy, seniority and zero third component of the angular momentum of the pairing hamiltonian are then found. The eigenvectors, which cannot be cast solely in terms of composite bosons with angular momentum zero and two, are expanded in the minimal basis with coefficients analytically expressed in terms of a generalized hypergeometric function.
