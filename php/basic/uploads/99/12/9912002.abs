Title: On the Uniqueness of Black Hole Attractors
Authors: Martijn Wijnholt and Slava Zhukov
Abstract: We examine the attractor mechanism for extremal black holes in the context of five dimensional N = 2 supergravity and show that attractor points are unique in the extended vector multiplet moduli space. Implications for black hole entropy are discussed.
