Title: Puncture of gravitating domain walls
Authors: Andrew Chamblin and Douglas M. Eardley
Abstract: We investigate the semi-classical instability of vacuum domain walls to processes where the domain walls decay by the formation of closed string loop boundaries on their worldvolumes. Intuitively, a wall which is initially spherical may `pop', so that a hole corresponding to a string boundary component on the wall, may form. We find instantons, and calculate the rates, for such processes. We show that after puncture, the hole grows exponentially at the same rate that the wall expands. It follows that the wall is never completely thermalized by a single expanding hole; at arbitrarily late times there is still a large, thin shell of matter which may drive an exponential expansion of the universe. We also study the situation where the wall is subjected to multiple punctures. We find that in order to completely annihilate the wall by this process, at least four string loops must be nucleated. We argue that this process may be relevant in certain brane-world scenarios, where the universe itself is a domain wall.
