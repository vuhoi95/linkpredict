Title: Three-Dimensional Extremal Black Holes and the Maldacena Duality
Authors: Naoto Yokoi and Toshio Nakatsu
Abstract: We discuss the microscopic states of the extremal BTZ black holes. Degeneracy of the primary states corresponding to the extremal BTZ black holes in the boundary N=(4,4) SCFT is obtained by utilizing the elliptic genus and the unitary representation theory of N=4 SCA. The degeneracy is consistent with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
