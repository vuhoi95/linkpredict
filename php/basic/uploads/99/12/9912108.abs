Title: Gauge and gravitational anomalies in D=4 N=1 orientifolds
Authors: Claudio A. Scrucca and Marco Serone
Abstract: The cancellation of U(1)-gauge and U(1)-gravitational anomalies in certain D=4 N=1 Type IIB orientifolds is analyzed in detail, from a string theory point of view. We verify the proposal that these anomalies are cancelled by a Green-Schwarz mechanism involving only twisted Ramond-Ramond fields. By factorizing one-loop partition functions, we also get the anomalous couplings of D-branes, O-planes and orbifold fixed-points to these twisted fields. Twisted sectors with fixed-planes participate to the inflow mechanism in a peculiar way.
