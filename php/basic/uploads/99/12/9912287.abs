Title: A twisted conformal field theory description of the Quantum Hall Effect
Authors: G. Cristofano and G. Maiella and V. Marotta
Abstract: We construct an effective conformal field theory by using a procedure which induces twisted boundary conditions for the fundamental scalar fields. That allows to describe a quantum Hall fluid at Jain hierarchical filling, nu=m/(2pm+1), in terms of one charged scalar field and m-1 neutral ones. Then the resulting algebra of the chiral primary fields is U(1)xW_m. Finally the ground state wave functions are given as correlators of appropriate composite fields (a-electrons).
