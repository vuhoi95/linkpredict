Title: Relativistic particle interaction with a weak electromagnetic field
Authors: L. F. Blazhyjevskii and A. Y. Marko
Abstract: Schrodinger equation with two-component wave function which describes a relativistic spin 1/2 particle in a weak electromagnetic field is obtained. In the same approximation Schrodinger equation with traditional norm condition and one-component wave function for a spinless particle is obtained as well. To construct it Foldy-Wouthuysen procedure with the electron charge value as the small parameter is used.
