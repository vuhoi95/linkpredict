Title: Instantons and scattering in N=4 SYM in 4D
Authors: G. Bonelli and L. Bonora and S. Terna and A. Tomasiello
Abstract: We study classical solutions (ic-instantons) in N=4 SYM in 4D which, in the strong coupling limit, correspond to complex two-dimensional manifolds. Asymptotically in time the latter have boundaries represented by compact real three-manifolds. Therefore they lend themselves to an interpretation in terms of 3-brane scattering. We suggest that these solutions may represent scattering of D3-branes of type IIB theory in 10D. In particular we show that the world-volume theory on complex two-dimensional manifolds is the correct one for D3-branes.
