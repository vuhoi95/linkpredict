Title: Supersymmetric 4D Orientifolds of Type IIA with D6-branes at Angles
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Lars Goerlich and Boris Kors
Abstract: We study a certain class of four-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric orientifolds for which the world-sheet parity transformation is combined with a complex conjugation in the compact directions. We investigate in detail the orientifolds of the Z_3, Z_4, Z_6 and Z_6' toroidal orbifolds finding solutions to the tadpole cancellation conditions for all models. Generically, all the massless spectra turn out to be non-chiral.
