Title: Target-Space Duality in Heterotic and Type I Effective Lagrangians
Authors: Zygmunt Lalak and St√©phane Lavignac and Hans Peter Nilles
Abstract: We study the implications of target-space duality symmetries for low-energy effective actions of various four-dimensional string theories. In the heterotic case such symmetries can be incorporated in simple orbifold examples. At present a similar statement cannot be made about the simplest type IIB orientifolds due to an obstruction at the level of gravitational anomalies. This fact confirms previous doubts concerning a conjectured heterotic-type IIB orientifold duality and shows that target-space symmetries can be a powerful tool in studying relations between various string theories at the level of the effective low-energy action. Contraints on effective Lagrangians from these symmetries are discussed in detail. In particular, we consider ways of extending T-duality to include additional corrections to the Kaehler potential in heterotic string models with N=2 subsectors.
