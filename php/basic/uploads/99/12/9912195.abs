Title: Finite Temperature Effective Action in Monopole Background
Authors: Gerald Dunne and Joshua Feinberg
Abstract: We compute the CP-odd part of the finite temperature effective action for massive Dirac fermions in the presence of a Dirac monopole. We confirm that the induced charge is temperature dependent, and in the effective action we find an infinite series of CP-violating terms that generalize the familiar zero temperature $F\tilde{F}$ term. These results are analogous to recent results concerning finite temperature induced Chern-Simons terms.
