Title: Effective Sublattice Magnetization and Neel Temperature in Quantum  Antiferromagnets
Authors: Eduardo C. Marino and Marcello B. Silva Neto
Abstract: We present an analytic expression for the finite temperature effective sublattice magnetization which would be detected by inelastic neutron scattering experiments performed on a two-dimensional square-lattice quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnets with short range N\'eel order. Our expression, which has no adjustable parameters, is able to reproduce both the qualitative behaviour of the phase diagram $M(T)xT$ and the experimental values of the N\'eel temperature $T_{N}$ for either doped YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6.15}$ and stoichiometric La$_{2}$CuO$_{4}$ compounds. Finally, we remark that by incorporating frustration and 3D effects as perturbations is sufficient to explain the deviation of the experimental data from our theoretical curves.
