Title: (p + 1)-Dimensional Noncommutative Yang-Mills and D($p - 2$) Branes
Authors: J. X. Lu and S. Roy
Abstract: We consider systems of non-threshold bound states (D(p$-$2), Dp), for $2\le p \le 6$, in type II string theories. Each of them can be viewed as Dp branes with a nonzero (rank two) Neveu-Schwarz $B$ field. We study the noncommutative effects in the gravity dual descriptions of noncommutative gauge theories for these systems in the limit where the brane worldvolume theories decouple from gravity. We find that the noncommutative effects are actually due to the presence of infinitely many D(p$-$2) branes in the (D(p$-$2), Dp) system which play the dominant role over the Dp branes in the large $B$-field limit. Our study indicates that Dp branes with a constant $B$-field represents dynamically the system of infinitely many D(p$-$2) branes without $B$-field in the decoupling limit. This implies an equivalence between the noncommutative Yang-Mills in $(p + 1)$-dimensions and an ordinary Yang-Mills with gauge group $U (\infty)$ in $(p - 1)$-dimensions. We provide a physical explanation for the new scale which measures the noncommutativity.
