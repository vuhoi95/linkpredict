Title: A New Odderon Solution in Perturbative QCD
Authors: J. Bartels and L. N. Lipatov and G. P. Vacca
Abstract: We present and discuss a new bound state solution of the three gluon system in perturbative QCD. It carries the quantum numbers of the odderon, has intercept at one and couples to the impact factor $\gamma^* \to \eta_c$.
