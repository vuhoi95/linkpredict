Title: The OSp(1|4) Superparticle and Exotic BPS States
Authors: Igor Bandos and Jerzy Lukierski and Dmitri Sorokin
Abstract: We discuss the dynamics of a superparticle in a superspace whose isometry is generated by the superalgebra OSp(1|4) or its central-charge contraction. Extra coordinates of the superspace associated with tensorial central charges are shown to describe spin degrees of freedom of the superparticle, so quantum states form an infinite tower of (half)-integer helicities. A peculiar feature of the model is that it admits BPS states which preserve 3/4 of target-space supersymmetries.
