Title: Cyclic Coset Orbifolds
Authors: J. Evslin and M. B. Halpern and J. E. Wang
Abstract: We apply the new orbifold duality transformations to discuss the special case of cyclic coset orbifolds in further detail. We focus in particular on the case of the interacting cyclic coset orbifolds, whose untwisted sectors are Z_\lambda(permutation)-invariant g/h coset constructions which are not \lambda copies of coset constructions. Because \lambda copies are not involved, the action of Z_\lambda(permutation) in the interacting cyclic coset orbifolds can be quite intricate. The stress tensors and ground state conformal weights of all the sectors of a large class of these orbifolds are given explicitly and special emphasis is placed on the twisted h subalgebras which are generated by the twisted (0,0) operators of these orbifolds. We also discuss the systematics of twisted (0,0) operators in general coset orbifolds.
