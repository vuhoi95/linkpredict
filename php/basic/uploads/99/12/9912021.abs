Title: On the classical R-matrix of the degenerate Calogero-Moser models
Authors: L. Feher and B. G. Pusztai
Abstract: The most general momentum independent dynamical r-matrices are described for the standard Lax representation of the degenerate Calogero-Moser models based on $gl_n$ and those r-matrices whose dynamical dependence can be gauged away are selected. In the rational case, a non-dynamical r-matrix resulting from gauge transformation is given explicitly as an antisymmetric solution of the classical Yang-Baxter equation that belongs to the Frobenius subalgebra of $gl_n$ consisting of the matrices with vanishing last row.
