Title: The cosmological gravitating $Ïƒ$ model: solitons and black holes
Authors: G. Clement and A. Fabbri
Abstract: We derive and analyze exact static solutions to the gravitating O(3) $\sigma$ model with cosmological constant in (2+1) dimensions. Both signs of the gravitational and cosmological constants are considered. Our solutions include geodesically complete spacetimes, and two classes of black holes.
