Title: Correlation functions and boundary conditions in RCFT and  three-dimensional topology
Authors: Giovanni Felder and Jürg Fröhlich and Jürgen Fuchs and Christoph Schweigert
Abstract: We give a general construction of correlation functions in rational conformal field theory on a possibly non-orientable surface with boundary in terms of 3-dimensional topological quantum field theory. The construction applies to any modular category. It is proved that these correlation functions obey modular and factorization rules. Structure constants are calculated and expressed in terms of the data of the modular category.
