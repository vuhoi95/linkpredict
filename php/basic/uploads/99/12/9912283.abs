Title: A Heavy Fermion Can Create a Soliton: A 1+1 Dimensional Example
Authors: E. Farhi and N. Graham and R. L. Jaffe and H. Weigel
Abstract: We show that quantum effects can stabilize a soliton in a model with no soliton at the classical level. The model has a scalar field chirally coupled to a fermion in 1+1 dimensions. We use a formalism that allows us to calculate the exact one loop fermion contribution to the effective energy for a spatially varying scalar background. This energy includes the contribution from counterterms fixed in the perturbative sector of the theory. The resulting energy is therefore finite and unambiguous. A variational search then yields a fermion number one configuration whose energy is below that of a single free fermion.
