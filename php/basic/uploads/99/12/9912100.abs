Title: Closed String Brane-Like States, Brane Bound States and Noncommutative  Branes
Authors: D. Polyakov and M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari
Abstract: We study the mass and different RR charge distributions of the BPS (p,p-2)-brane bound states in the closed string brane-like $\sigma$-model. We show that such brane bound states can be realized by introducing a constant B field in the closed string theory. In addition we show that the worldvolume coordinates of these brane bound states turn out to be noncommutative.
