Title: Rotation of D-brane and Non-commutative Geometry
Authors: Pei Wang and Ruihong Yue
Abstract: Our motivation is to find the relationship between the commutator of coordinates and uncertainty relation involving only the coordinates. The boundary condition with constant background field is connected with the rotation of D-brane at general angle. And the mode expansions of D-brane we found is more reasonable than those appeared in literature. The partition functions and scattering amplitudes are also discussed.
