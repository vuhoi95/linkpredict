Title: W-algebras from symplectomorphisms
Authors: G. Bandelloni and S. Lazzarini
Abstract: It is shown how $W$-algebras emerge from very peculiar canonical transformations with respect to the canonical symplectic structure on a compact Riemann surface. The action of smooth diffeomorphisms of the cotangent bundle on suitable generating functions is written in the BRS framework while a $W$-symmetry is exhibited. Subsequently, the complex structure of the symmetry spaces is studied and the related BRS properties are discussed. The specific example of the so-called $W_3$-algebra is treated in relation to some other different approaches.
