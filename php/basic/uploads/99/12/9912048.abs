Title: Symplectic Cuts and Projection Quantization
Authors: Martin Bojowald and Thomas Strobl
Abstract: The recently proposed projection quantization, which is a method to quantize particular subspaces of systems with known quantum theory, is shown to yield a genuine quantization in several cases. This may be inferred from exact results established within symplectic cutting.
