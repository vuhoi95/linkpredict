Title: Compactification of M(atrix) theory on noncommutative toroidal orbifolds
Authors: A. Konechny and A. Schwarz
Abstract: It was shown by A. Connes, M. Douglas and A. Schwarz that noncommutative tori arise naturally in consideration of toroidal compactifications of M(atrix) theory. A similar analysis of toroidal Z_{2} orbifolds leads to the algebra B_{\theta} that can be defined as a crossed product of noncommutative torus and the group Z_{2}. Our paper is devoted to the study of projective modules over B_{\theta} (Z_{2}-equivariant projective modules over a noncommutative torus). We analyze the Morita equivalence (duality) for B_{\theta} algebras working out the two-dimensional case in detail.
