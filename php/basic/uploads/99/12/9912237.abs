Title: Chiral Hybrid Bag Model with the Boson Field inside the Bag
Authors: I. Cherednikov and S. Fedorov and M. Khalili and K. Sveshnikov
Abstract: The three-phase version of the hybrid chiral bag model, containing the phase of asymptotic freedom, the hadronization phase as well as the intermediate phase of constituent quarks, is proposed. For this model the self-consistent solution, which takes into account the fermion vacuum polarization effects, is found in (1+1) D. Within this solution the total energy of the bag, including the one-loop contribution from the Dirac's sea, is studied as the function of the bag geometry under condition of nonvanishing boson condensate density in the interior region. The existence and uniqueness of the ground state bag configuration, which minimizes the total energy and contains all the three phases, are shown.
