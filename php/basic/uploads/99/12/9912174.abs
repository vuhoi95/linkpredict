Title: $Î›$-symmetry and background independence of noncommutative gauge  theory on $\mathbb R^n$
Authors: Maximilian Kreuzer and Jian-Ge Zhou
Abstract: Background independence of noncommutative Yang-Mills theory on $\mathbb R^n$ is discussed. The quantity $\theta \hat F \theta - \theta$ is found to be background dependent at subleading order, and it becomes background independent only when the ordinary gauge field strength $F$ is constant. It is shown that, at small values of $B$, the noncommutative Dirac-Born-Infeld action possesses $\Lambda$-symmetry at least to subleading order in $\theta$ if $F$ damps fast enough at infinity.
