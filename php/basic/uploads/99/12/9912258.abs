Title: IIB Matrix Model with D1-D5 Backgrounds
Authors: Yusuke Kimura and Yoshihisa Kitazawa
Abstract: We consider IIB matrix model with D1-D5-brane backgrounds. Using the fact that noncommutative gauge theory on the D-branes can be obtained as twisted reduced model in IIB matrix model, we study two-dimensional gauge theory on D1-branes and D5-branes. Especially the spectrum of the zero modes in the off-diagonal parts is examined. We also consider the description of D1-branes as local excitations of gauge theory on D5-branes. Relation to supergravity solution is also discussed.
