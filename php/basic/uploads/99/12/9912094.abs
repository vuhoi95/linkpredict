Title: Coherent states for a particle on a sphere
Authors: K. Kowalski and J. Rembielinski
Abstract: The coherent states for a particle on a sphere are introduced. These states are labelled by points of the classical phase space, that is the position on the sphere and the angular momentum of a particle. As with the coherent states for a particle on a circle discussed in Kowalski K {\em et al} 1996 {\em J. Phys. A} {\bf 29} 4149, we deal with a deformation of the classical phase space related with quantum fluctuations. The expectation values of the position and the angular momentum in the coherent states are regarded as the best possible approximation of the classical phase space. The correctness of the introduced coherent states is illustrated by an example of the rotator.
