Title: Bianchi Type I Cosmology in N=2, D=5 Supergravity
Authors: Chiang-Mei Chen and T. Harko and M. K. Mak
Abstract: The dynamics and evolution of Bianchi type I space-times is considered in the framework of the four-dimensional truncation of a reduced theory obtained from the N=2,D=5 supergravity. The general solution of the gravitational field equations can be represented in an exact parametric form. All solutions have a singular behavior at the initial/final moment, except when the space-time geometry reduces to the isotropic flat case. Generically the obtained cosmological models describe an anisotropic, expanding or collapsing, singular Universe with a non-inflationary evolution for all times.
