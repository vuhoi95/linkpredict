Title: Symmetry-deforming interactions of chiral p-forms
Authors: Xavier Bekaert and Marc Henneaux and Alexander Sevrin
Abstract: No-go theorems on gauge-symmetry-deforming interactions of chiral p-forms are reviewed. We consider the explicit case of p=4, D=10 and show that the only symmetry-deforming consistent vertex for a system of one chiral 4-form and two 2-forms is the one that occurs in the type II B supergravity Lagrangian.
