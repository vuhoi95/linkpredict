Abstract: In these lectures we review the properties of a boosted and rotated boundary state and of a boundary state with an abelian gauge field deriving from it the Dirac-Born-Infeld action and a newly constructed class of classical solutions. We also review the construction of the boundary state for the stable non-BPS state of type I theory corresponding to the perturbative state present at the first excited level of the SO(32) heterotic string and transforming according to the spinor representation of SO(32) (Lectures presented at the YITP Workshop on ``Developments in Superstring and M-theory'', Kyoto, Japan, October 1999).
