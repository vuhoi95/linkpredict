Title: Induced Lorentz and PCT Symmetry Breaking in an External Electromagnetic  Field
Authors: M. B. Hott and J. L. Tomazelli
Abstract: In this work we derive the Lorentz-PCT-violating effective action for a fermion in a constant and uniform electromagnetic field using the Fock-Schwinger proper time method and extract the exact value of the coefficient of the nonperturbatively induced Chern-Simons term.
