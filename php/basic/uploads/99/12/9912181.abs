Title: Duality in Heterotic Vacua With Four Supercharges
Authors: Michael Haack and Jan Louis
Abstract: We study heterotic vacua with four supercharges in three and four space-time dimensions and their duals obtained as M/F-theory compactified on Calabi-Yau fourfolds. We focus on their respective moduli spaces and derive the Kahler potential for heterotic vacua obtained as circle compactifications of four-dimensional N=1 heterotic theories. The Kahler potential of the dual theory is computed by compactifying 11-dimensional supergravity on Calabi-Yau fourfolds. The duality between these theories is checked for K3-fibred fourfolds and an appropriate F-theory limit is discussed.
