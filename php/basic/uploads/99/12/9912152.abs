Title: RR Flux on Calabi-Yau and Partial Supersymmetry Breaking
Authors: T. R. Taylor and C. Vafa
Abstract: We show how turning on Flux for RR (and NS-NS) field strengths on non-compact Calabi-Yau 3-folds can serve as a way to partially break supersymmetry from N=2 to N=1 by mass deformation. The freezing of the moduli of Calabi-Yau in the presence of the flux is the familiar phenomenon of freezing of fields in supersymmetric theories upon mass deformations.
