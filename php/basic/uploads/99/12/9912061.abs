Authors: A. Nersessian and R. Manvelyan and H. J. W. Mueller-Kirsten
Abstract: We consider a (2+1)-dimensional mechanical system with the Lagrangian linear in the torsion of a light-like curve. We give Hamiltonian formulation of this system and show that its mass and spin spectra are defined by one-dimensional nonrelativistic mechanics with a cubic potential. Consequently, this system possesses the properties typical of resonance-like particles.
