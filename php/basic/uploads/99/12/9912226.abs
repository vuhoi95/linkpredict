Title: Brane Rotating Symmetries and the Fivebrane Equations of Motion
Authors: O. Baerwald and P. West
Abstract: We show that the fully covariant equations of motion for the M-theory fivebrane can be interpreted as charge conservation equations. The associated charges induce `shift'-symmetries of the scalar, spinor and gauge-fields of the fivebrane, so allowing an interpretation of all these fields as Goldstone fields. We also find that the fivebrane possesses a new symmetry that is part of the GL(32) automorphism group of the eleven dimensional supersymmetry algebra.
