Title: Non-renormalization of next-to-extremal correlators in N=4 SYM and the  AdS/CFT correspondence
Authors: J. Erdmenger and M. Perez-Victoria
Abstract: We show that next-to-extremal correlators of chiral primary operators in N=4 SYM theory do not receive quantum corrections to first order in perturbation theory. Furthermore we consider next-to-extremal correlators within AdS supergravity. Here the exchange diagrams contributing to these correlators yield results of the same free-field form as obtained within field theory. This suggests that quantum corrections vanish at strong coupling as well.
