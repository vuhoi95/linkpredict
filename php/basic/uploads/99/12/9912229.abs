Title: A New Mechanism of Spontaneous SUSY Breaking
Authors: M. Sakamoto and M. Tachibana and K. Takenaga
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. The existence of extra dimensions with nontrivial topology plays an important role. We investigate new features resulted from the mechanism in two simple supersymmetric Z_2 and U(1) models. One of remarkable features is that there exists a phase in which the translational invariance for the compactified directions is broken spontaneously, accompanying the breakdown of the supersymmetry. The mass spectrum of the models appeared in reduced dimensions is a full of variety, reflecting the highly nontrivial vacuum structure of the models. The Nambu-Goldstone bosons (fermions) associated with breakdown of symmetries are found in the mass spectrum. Our mechanism also yields quite different vacuum structures if models have different global symmetries.
