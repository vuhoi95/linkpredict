Title: Bags, junctions, and networks of BPS and non-BPS defects
Authors: D. Bazeia and F. A. Brito
Abstract: We investigate several models of coupled scalar fields that present discrete Z_2, Z_2 x Z_2, Z_3 and other symmetries. These models support topological domain wall solutions of the BPS and non-BPS type. The BPS solutions are stable, but the stability of the non-BPS solutions may depend on the parameters that specify the models. The BPS and non-BPS states give rise to bags, and also to three-junctions that may allow the presence of networks of topological defects. In particular, we show that the non-BPS defects of a specific model that engenders the Z_3 symmetry give rise to a stable regular hexagonal network of domain walls.
