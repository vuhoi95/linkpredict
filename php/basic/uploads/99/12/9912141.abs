Title: The sl_2 loop algebra symmetry of the six-vertex model at roots of unity
Authors: Tetsuo Deguchi and Klaus Fabricius and Barry M. McCoy
Abstract: We demonstrate that the six vertex model (XXZ spin chain) with $\Delta=(q+q^{-1})/2$ and $q^{2N}=1$ has an invariance under the loop algebra of $sl_2$ which produces a special set of degenerate eigenvalues. For $\Delta=0$ we compute the multiplicity of the degeneracies using Jordan Wigner techniques
