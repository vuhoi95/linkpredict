Title: Reparametrization Invariance and the Schr√∂dinger Equation
Authors: V. I. Tkach and A. Pashnev and J. J. Rosales
Abstract: In the present work we consider a time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation for systems invariant under the reparametrization of time. We develop the two-stage procedure of construction such systems from a given initial ones, which is not invariant under the time reparametrization. One of the first-class constraints of the systems in such description becomes the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The procedure is applicable in the supersymmetric theories as well. The $n=2$ supersymmetric quantum mechanics is coupled to world-line supergravity, and the local supersymmetric action is constructed leading to the square root representation of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation.
