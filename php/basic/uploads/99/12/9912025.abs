Title: Effect of Aharonov-Bohm Phase on Spin Tunneling
Authors: ChangSoo Park and D. K. Park
Abstract: The role of Aharonov-Bohm effect in quantum tunneling is examined when a potential is defined on the $S^1$ and has $N$-fold symmetry. We show that the low-lying energy levels split from the $N$-fold degenerate ground state oscillate as a function of the Aharonov-Bohm phase, from which general degeneracy conditions depending on the magnetic flux is obtained. We apply these results to the spin tunneling in a spin system with $N$-fold rotational symmetry around a hard axis.
