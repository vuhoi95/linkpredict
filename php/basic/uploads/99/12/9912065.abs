Title: Supersymmetric M5-branes with H-field
Authors: D. Lust and A. Miemiec
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the form of calibrated M5-branes in the presence of a nonvanishing 3-form field H. We discuss the influence of the H-field on the deformation of supersymmetric n-cycles (in particular SLAG submanifolds in R^n). In addition we argue for a construction which relates calibrated M5-branes of different curved dimensions to each other.
