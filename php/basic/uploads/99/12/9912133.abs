Abstract: We give a unified analysis of four-dimensional elliptic models with N=2 supersymmetry and a simple gauge group, and their relation to M-theory. Explicit calculations of the Seiberg-Witten curves and the resulting one-instanton prepotential are presented. The remarkable regularities that emerge are emphasized. In addition, we calculate the prepotential in the Coulomb phase of the (asymptotically-free) Sp(2N) gauge theory with N_f fundamental hypermultiplets of arbitrary mass.
