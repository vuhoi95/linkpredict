Title: Maximal overlap and sensitivity of a VIRGO pair to graviton backgrounds
Authors: D. Babusci and M. Giovannini
Abstract: The sensitivity of a pair of VIRGO interferometers to gravitational waves backgrounds of cosmological origin is analyzed for the cases of maximal and minimal overlap of the two detectors. The improvements in the detectability prospects of scale-invariant and non-scale-invariant logarithmic energy spectra of relic gravitons are discussed.
