Title: On the Chiral WZNW Phase Space, Exchange r-Matrices and Poisson-Lie  Groupoids
Authors: J. Balog and L. Feher and L. Palla
Abstract: This is a review of recent work on the chiral extensions of the WZNW phase space describing both the extensions based on fields with generic monodromy as well as those using Bloch waves with diagonal monodromy. The symplectic form on the extended phase space is inverted in both cases and the chiral WZNW fields are found to satisfy quadratic Poisson bracket relations characterized by monodromy dependent exchange r-matrices. Explicit expressions for the exchange r-matrices in terms of the arbitrary monodromy dependent 2-form appearing in the chiral WZNW symplectic form are given. The exchange r-matrices in the general case are shown to satisfy a new dynamical generalization of the classical modified Yang-Baxter (YB) equation and Poisson-Lie (PL) groupoids are constructed that encode this equation analogously as PL groups encode the classical YB equation. For an arbitrary simple Lie group $G$, exchange r-matrices are exhibited that are in one-to-one correspondence with the possible PL structures on $G$ and admit them as PL symmetries.
