Title: CMB Anisotropy in Compact Hyperbolic Universes II: COBE Maps and Limits
Authors: J. Richard Bond and Dmitry Pogosyan and Tarun Souradeep
Abstract: We calculate the CMB anisotropy in compact hyperbolic universe models using the regularized method of images described in paper-I, including the 'line-of-sight `integrated Sachs-Wolfe' effect, as well as the last-scattering surface terms. We calculate the Bayesian probabilities for a selection of models by confronting our theoretical pixel-pixel temperature correlation functions with the COBE-DMR data. Our results demonstrate that strong constraints on compactness arise: if the universe is small compared to the `horizon' size, correlations appear in the maps that are irreconcilable with the observations. This conclusion is qualitatively insensitive to the matter content of the universe, in particular, the presence of a cosmological constant. If the universe is of comparable size to the 'horizon', the likelihood function is very dependent upon orientation of the manifold wrt the sky. While most orientations may be strongly ruled out, it sometimes happens that for a specific orientation the predicted correlation patterns are preferred over those for the conventional infinite models. The full Bayesian analysis we use is the most complete statistical test that can be done on the COBE maps, taking into account all possible signals and their variances in the theoretical skies, in particular the high degree of anisotropic correlation that can exist. We show that standard visual measures for comparing theoretical predictions with the data such as the isotropized power spectrum $C_\ell$ are not so useful in small compact spaces because of enhanced cosmic variance associated with the breakdown of statistical isotropy.
