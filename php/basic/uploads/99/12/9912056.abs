Title: Reparametrization Invariance of Perturbatively Defined Path Integrals.  II. Integrating Products of Distributions
Authors: H. Kleinert and A. Chervyakov
Abstract: We show how to perform integrals over products of distributions in coordinate space such as to reproduce the results of momentum space Feynman integrals in dimensional regularization. This ensures the invariance of path integrals under coordinate transformations. The integrals are uniquely defined by expressing the propagators in 1- epsilon dimensions in terms of modified Bessel functions.
