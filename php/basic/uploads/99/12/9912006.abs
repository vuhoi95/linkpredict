Title: Particle dynamics on hyperboloid and unitary representation of SO(1,N)  group
Authors: George Jorjadze and Wlodzimierz Piechocki
Abstract: We analyze particle dynamics on $N$ dimensional one-sheet hyperboloid embedded in $N+1$ dimensional Minkowski space. The dynamical integrals constructed by $SO_\uparrow (1,N)$ symmetry of spacetime are used for the gauge-invariant Hamiltonian reduction. The physical phase-space parametrizes the set of all classical trajectories on the hyperboloid. In quantum case the operator ordering problem for the symmetry generators is solved by transformation to asymptotic variables. Canonical quantization leads to unitary irreducible representation of $SO_\uparrow (1,N)$ group on Hilbert space $L^2(S^{N-1})$.
