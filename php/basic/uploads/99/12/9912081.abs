Title: Anisotropic 'hairs' in string cosmology
Authors: Kerstin E. Kunze and Ruth Durrer
Abstract: In this letter we investigate whether the isotropy problem is naturally solved in inflationary cosmologies inspired by string theory, so called pre-big-bang cosmologies. We find that, in contrast to what happens in the more common 'potential inflation' models, initial anisotropies do not decay during pre-big-bang inflation.
