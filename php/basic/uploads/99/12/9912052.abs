Abstract: The near extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black holes in arbitrary dimensions ca be modeled by the Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) theory. The asymptotic Virasoro symmetry of the corresponding JT model exactly reproduces, via Cardy's formula, the deviation of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the Reissner-Nordstrom black holes from extremality. We also comment how can we extend this approach to investigate the evaporation process.
