Title: Dimensional renormalization of Yukawa theories wia Wilsonian methods
Authors: M. Pernici and M. Raciti and F. Riva
Abstract: In the 't Hooft-Veltman dimensional regularization scheme it is necessary to introduce finite counterterms to satisfy chiral Ward identities. It is a non-trivial task to evaluate these counterterms even at two loops. We suggest the use of Wilsonian exact renormalization group techniques to reduce the computation of these counterterms to simple master integrals. We illustrate this method by a detailed study of a generic Yukawa model with massless fermions at two loops.
