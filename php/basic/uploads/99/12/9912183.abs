Title: Scalar field theory limits of bosonic string amplitudes
Authors: Alberto Frizzo and Lorenzo Magnea and Rodolfo Russo
Abstract: We describe in detail the techniques needed to compute scattering amplitudes for colored scalars from the infinite tension limit of bosonic string theory, up to two loops. These techniques apply both to cubic and quartic interactions, and to planar as well as non-planar diagrams. The resulting field theories are naturally defined in the space-time dimension in which they are renormalizable. With a careful analysis of string moduli space in the Schottky representation we determine the region of integration for the moduli, which plays a crucial role in the derivation of the correct combinatorial and color factors for all diagrams.
