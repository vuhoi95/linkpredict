Title: Conformal Anomaly from d5 Gauged Supergravity and c-function Away from  Conformity
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov and Sachiko Ogushi
Abstract: Using AdS/CFT correspondence we found the conformal anomaly from d3 and d5 gauged supergravity with single scalar (dilaton) and the arbitrary scalar potential on AdS-like scalar-gravitational background. Such dilatonic gravity action describes the special RG flows in extended gauged SG when scalars lie in one-dimensional submanifold of complete scalars space. This dilaton-dependent conformal anomaly corresponds to dual non-conformal (gauge) QFT (which is classically conformally invariant) with account of radiative corrections. Equations of motion in d5 gauged supergravity put some restrictions to the dilatonic potential on the conformal boundary. Using these restrictions we propose the candidate c-functions away from exact conformity. These c-functions are positively defined and monotonic, expressed in terms of dilatonic potential and have the fixed points in asymptotically AdS region.
