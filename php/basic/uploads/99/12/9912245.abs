Title: Analytical results for string propagation near a Kaluza-Klein black hole
Authors: H. K. Jassal and A. Mukherjee
Abstract: This brief report presents analytical solutions to the equations of motion of a null string. The background spacetime is a magnetically charged Kaluza-Klein black hole. The string coordinates are expanded with the world-sheet velocity of light as an expansion parameter. It is shown that the zeroth order solutions can be expressed in terms of elementary functions in an appropriate large distance approximation. In addition, a class of exact solutions corresponding to the Pollard-Gross-Perry-Sorkin monopole case is also obtained.
