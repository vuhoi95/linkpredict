Title: Bloch electrons in electric and magnetic fields
Authors: Alejandro Kunold and Manuel Torres
Abstract: We investigate Bloch electrons in two dimensions subject to constant electric and magnetic fields. The model that results from our pursuit is governed by a finite difference equation with a quasienergy spectrum that interpolates between a butterfly-like structure and a Stark ladder structure. These findings ensued from the use of electric and magnetic translation operators.
