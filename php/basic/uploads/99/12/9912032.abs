Title: Quantum Annihilation of Anti- de Sitter Universe
Authors: Iver Brevik and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: We discuss the role of conformal matter quantum effects (using large $N$ anomaly induced effective action) to creation-annihilation of an Anti-de Sitter Universe. The arbitrary GUT with conformally invariant content of fields is considered. On a purely gravitational (supersymmetric) AdS background, the quantum effects act against an (already existing) AdS Universe. The annihilation of such a Universe occurs, what is common for any conformal matter theory. On a dilaton-gravitational background, where there is dilatonic contribution to the induced effective action, the quantum creation of an AdS Universe is possible assuming fine-tuning of the dilaton.
