Title: Real forms of the complex twisted N=2 supersymmetric Toda chain  hierarchy in real N=1 and twisted N=2 superspaces
Authors: Olaf Lechtenfeld and Alexander Sorin
Abstract: Three nonequivalent real forms of the complex twisted N=2 supersymmetric Toda chain hierarchy (solv-int/9907021) in real N=1 superspace are presented. It is demonstrated that they possess a global twisted N=2 supersymmetry. We discuss a new superfield basis in which the supersymmetry transformations are local. Furthermore, a representation of this hierarchy is given in terms of two twisted chiral N=2 superfields. The relations to the s-Toda hierarchy by H. Aratyn, E. Nissimov and S. Pacheva (solv-int/9801021) as well as to the modified and derivative NLS hierarchies are established.
