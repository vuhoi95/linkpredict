Title: Small object limit of Casimir effect and the sign of the Casimir force
Authors: O. Kenneth and S. Nussinov
Abstract: We show a simple way of deriving the Casimir Polder interaction, present some general arguments on the finiteness and sign of mutual Casimir interactions and finally we derive a simple expression for Casimir radiation from small accelerated objects.
