Title: A Probe Particle in Kerr-Newman-deSitter Cosmos
Authors: Tetsuya Shiromizu and Uchida Gen
Abstract: We consider the force acting on a spinning charged test particle (probe particle) with the mass m and the charge q in slow rotating the Kerr-Newman-deSitter(KNdS) black hole with the mass M and the charge Q. We consider the case which the spin vector of the probe particle is parallel to the angular momentum vector of the KNdS space-time. We take account of the gravitational spin-spin interaction under the slow rotating limit of the KNdS space-time. When Q=M and q=m, we show that the force balance holds including the spin-spin interaction and the motion is approximately same as that of a particle in the deSitter space-time. This force cancellation suggests the possibility of the existence of an exact solution of spinning multi-KNdS black hole.
