Title: Zero Modes and Conformal Anomaly in Liouville Vortices
Authors: G. Nardelli and M. Peloso
Abstract: The partition function of a two dimensional Abelian gauge model reproducing magnetic vortices is discussed in the harmonic approximation. Classical solutions exhibit conformal invariance, that is broken by statistical fluctuations, apart from an exceptional case. The corresponding ``anomaly'' has been evaluated. Zero modes of the thermal fluctuation operator have been carefully discussed.
