Title: A solution to the zero-hamiltonian problem in 2-D gravity
Authors: C. P. Constantinidis and F. P. Devecchi and D. F. Marchioro
Abstract: The zero-hamiltonian problem, present in reparametrization invariant systems, is solved for the 2-D induced gravity model. Working with methods developed by Henneaux et al. we find systematically the reduced phase-space physics, generated by an {\it effective} hamiltonian obtained after complete gauge fixing.
