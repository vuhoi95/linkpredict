Title: Commuting Hamiltonians from Seiberg-Witten Theta-Functions
Authors: A. Mironov and A. Morozov
Abstract: Elementary MAPLE calculations are used to support the claim of hep-th/9906240 that the ratios of theta-functions, associated with the Seiberg-Witten complex curves, provide Poisson-commuting Hamiltonians which describe the dual of the original Seiberg-Witten integrable system.
