Title: Ground State of the Quantum Symmetric Finite Size XXZ Spin Chain with  Anisotropy Parameter $Î”= {1/2}$
Authors: V. Fridkin and Yu. Stroganov and D. Zagier
Abstract: We find an analytic solution of the Bethe Ansatz equations (BAE) for the special case of a finite XXZ spin chain with free boundary conditions and with a complex surface field which provides for $U_q(sl(2))$ symmetry of the Hamiltonian. More precisely, we find one nontrivial solution, corresponding to the ground state of the system with anisotropy parameter $\Delta = {1/2}$ corresponding to $q^3 = -1$.
