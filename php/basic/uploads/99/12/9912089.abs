Title: Integrable structures in classical off-shell 10D supersymmetric  Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Jean-Loup Gervais and Henning Samtleben
Abstract: The superspace flatness conditions which are equivalent to the field equations of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in ten dimensions have not been useful so far to derive non trivial classical solutions. Recently, modified flatness conditions were proposed, which are explicitly integrable (hep-th/9811108), and are based on the breaking of symmetry SO(9,1) -> SO(2,1)xSO(7). In this article, we investigate their physical content. To this end, group-algebraic methods are developed which allow to derive the set of physical fields and their equations of motion from the superfield expansion of the supercurl, systematically. A set of integrable superspace constraints is identified which drastically reduces the field content of the unconstrained superfield but leaves the spectrum including the original Yang-Mills vector field completely off-shell. A weaker set of constraints gives rise to additional fields obeying first order differential equations. Geometrically, the SO(7) covariant superspace constraints descend from a truncation of Witten's original linear system to particular one-parameter families of light-like rays.
