Title: Branes in Super-AdS Backgrounds and Superconformal Theories
Authors: Paolo Pasti and Dmitri Sorokin and Mario Tonin
Abstract: We demonstrate how actions for interacting superconformal field theories in (p+1)-dimensions arise as a result of gauge fixing worldvolume diffeomorphisms and fermionic kappa-symmetry in actions for super-p-branes propagating in superbackgrounds of AdS(p+2)xS(D-p-2) geometry. The method of nonlinear realizations and coset spaces is used for getting an explicit form of supervielbeins and superconnections of the AdSxS superbackgrounds, which are required for the construction of the superconformal theories. Subtleties of consistent gauge fixing worldvolume symmetries of the branes are discussed.
