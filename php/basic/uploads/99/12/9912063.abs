Title: Quantum Radiation from Black Holes and Naked Singularities in Spherical  Dust Collapse
Authors: T. P. Singh and Cenalo Vaz
Abstract: A sufficiently massive collapsing star will end its life as a spacetime singularity. The nature of the Hawking radiation emitted during collapse depends critically on whether the star's boundary conditions are such as would lead to the eventual formation of a black hole or, alternatively, to the formation of a naked singularity. This latter possibility is not excluded by the singularity theorems. We discuss the nature of the Hawking radiation emitted in each case. We justify the use of Bogoliubov transforms in the presence of a Cauchy horizon and show that if spacetime is assumed to terminate at the Cauchy horizon, the resulting spectrum is thermal, but with a temperature different from the Hawking temperature.
