Title: Thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equation from fusion hierarchy of osp(1|2)  integrable spin chain
Authors: Kazumitsu Sakai and Zengo Tsuboi
Abstract: The thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) and the excited state TBA equations for an integrable spin chain related to the Lie superalgebra osp(1|2) are proposed by the quantum transfer matrix (QTM) method. We introduce the fusion hierarchy of the QTM and derive the functional relations among them (T-system) and their certain combinations (Y-system). Their analytical property leads to the non-linear integral equations which describe the free energy and the correlation length at any finite temperatures. With regard to the free energy, they coincide with the TBA equation (math-ph/9911010, Mod. Phys. Lett. A, 14, 2427 (1999)) based on the string hypothesis.
