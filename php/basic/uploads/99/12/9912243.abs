Title: Off-shell structure of the string sigma model
Authors: Alan Kostelecky and Malcolm Perry and Robertus Potting
Abstract: The off-shell structure of the string sigma model is investigated. In the open bosonic string, nonperturbative effects are shown to depend crucially on the regularization scheme. A scheme retaining the notion of string width reproduces the structure of Witten's string field theory and the associated unconventional gauge transformations.
