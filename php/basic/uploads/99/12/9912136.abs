Title: Gauge Invariant Variational Approach with Fermions: the Schwinger Model
Authors: William E. Brown and Juan P. Garrahan and Ian I. Kogan and Alex Kovner
Abstract: We extend the gauge invariant variational approach of Phys. Rev. D52 (1995) 3719, hep-th/9408081, to theories with fermions. As the simplest example we consider the massless Schwinger model in 1+1 dimensions. We show that in this solvable model the simple variational calculation gives exact results.
