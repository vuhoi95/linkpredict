Abstract: We study conformal field theory correlation functions relevant for string diagrams with open strings that stretch between several parallel branes of different dimensions. In the framework of conformal field theory, they involve boundary condition changing twist fields which intertwine between Neumann and Dirichlet conditions. A Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-like differential equation for correlators of such boundary twist fields and ordinary string vertex operators is derived, and explicit integral formulas for its solutions are provided.
