Title: Complete Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics of Magnetic Monopoles in N=4  SYM Theory
Authors: Dongsu Bak and Kimyeong Lee and Piljin Yi
Abstract: We find the most general low energy dynamics of 1/2 BPS monopoles in the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories (SYM) when all six adjoint Higgs expectation values are turned on. When only one Higgs is turned on, the Lagrangian is purely kinetic. When all six are turned on, however, this moduli space dynamics is augmented by five independent potential terms, each in the form of half the squared norm of a Killing vector field on the moduli space. A generic stationary configuration of the monopoles can be interpreted as stable non BPS dyons, previously found as non-planar string webs connecting D3-branes. The supersymmetric extension is also found explicitly, and gives the complete quantum mechanics of monopoles in N=4 SYM theory. We explore its supersymmetry algebra.
