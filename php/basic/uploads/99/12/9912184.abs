Title: Brane Transmutation in Supergravity
Authors: Andres Gomberoff and Donald Marolf
Abstract: We study a family of BPS solutions of type IIA supergravity that can be interpreted as describing the `transmutation' of a Neveu-Schwarz five-brane into a D4-brane in the presence of a D6-brane. The D4-brane, which terminates on the D6-brane, can be equally well interpreted as a `pure multipole' configuration of NS5-brane wrapped tightly around the D6-brane. Such a transmutation is a "near-core" version (i.e., near the D6-brane) of the brane-creation that can occur when two branes pass through each other, as in the Hanany-Witten construction. The work below highlights certain charge non-conservation features of type IIA supergravity.
