Title: Manifest Supersymmetry in Non-Commutative Geometry
Authors: Chong-Sun Chu and Frederic Zamora
Abstract: We consider the open superstring ending on a D-brane in the presence of a constant NS-NS B field, using the Green-Schwarz formalism. Quantizing in the light-cone gauge, we find that the anti-commutation relations for the fermionic variables of superspace remain unmodified. We also derive the unbroken supersymmetry algebra living on the D-brane. This establishes how the Moyal product is extended in a superspace formulation of non-commutative field theories. The superfield formulation of non-commutative supersymmetric field theories is briefly considered.
