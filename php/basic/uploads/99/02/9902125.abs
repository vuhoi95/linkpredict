Title: On running couplings in gauge theories from type-IIB supergravity
Authors: A. Kehagias and K. Sfetsos
Abstract: We construct an explicit solution of type-IIB supergravity describing the strong coupling regime of a non-supersymmetric gauge theory. The latter has a running coupling with an ultraviolet stable fixed point corresponding to the N=4 SU(N) super-Yang-Mills theory at large N. The running coupling has a power law behaviour, argued to be universal, that is consistent with holography. Around the critical point, our solution defines an asymptotic expansion for the gauge coupling beta-function. We also calculate the first correction to the Coulombic quark-antiquark potential.
