Title: High Temperature Limit of the N= 2 Matrix Model
Authors: Subrata Bal and B. Sathiapalan
Abstract: The high temperature limit of a system of two D-0 branes is investigated. The partition function can be expressed as a power series in $\beta$ (inverse temperature). The leading term in the high temperature expression of the partition function and effective potential is calculated exactly. Physical quantities like the mean square separation can also be exactly determined in the high temperature limit.
