Title: Aspects of the M5-Brane
Authors: E. Sezgin and P. Sundell
Abstract: The kappa symmetry of an open M2-brane ending on an M5-brane requires geometrical constraints on the embedding of the system in target superspace. These constraints lead to the M5-brane equations of motion, which we review both in superspace and in component (i.e. in Green-Schwarz) formalism. We also describe the embedding of the chiral M5-brane theory in a non-chiral theory where the equations of motion follow from an action that involves a non-chiral 2-form potential, upon the imposition of a non-linear self-duality condition. In this formulation, we find a simplified form of the second order field equation for the worldvolume 2-form potential, and we derive the nonlinear holomorphicity condition on the partition function of the chiral M5-brane.
