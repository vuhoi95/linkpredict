Title: The BPS Spectra of Gauge Theories in Two and Four Dimensions
Authors: N. Dorey and T. J. Hollowood and D. Tong
Abstract: We study N=(2,2) supersymmetric abelian gauge theories in two dimensions. The exact BPS spectrum of these models is shown to coincide with the spectrum of massive hypermultiplets of certain N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions. A special case of these results involves a surprising connection between four-dimensional N=2 SQCD with N colours and N_{f}>N flavours at the root of the baryonic Higgs branch and the supersymmetric CP^{2N-N_{f}-1} sigma-model in two dimensions. This correspondence implies a new prediction for the strong-coupling spectrum of the four-dimensional theory.
