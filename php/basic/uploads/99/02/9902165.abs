Title: Lattice Chern-Simons Gravity via Ponzano-Regge Model
Authors: N. Kawamoto and H. B. Nielsen and N. Sato
Abstract: We propose a lattice version of Chern-Simons gravity and show that the partition function coincides with Ponzano-Regge model and the action leads to the Chern-Simons gravity in the continuum limit. The action is explicitly constructed by lattice dreibein and spin connection and is shown to be invariant under lattice local Lorentz transformation and gauge diffeomorphism. The action includes the constraint which can be interpreted as a gauge fixing condition of the lattice gauge diffeomorphism.
