Abstract: We begin by presenting the superparticle action in the background of N=2, D=4 supergravity coupled to n vector multiplets interacting via an arbitrary special Kahler geometry. Our construction is based on implementing kappa-supersymmetry. In particular, our result can be interpreted as the source term for N=2 BPS black holes with a finite horizon area. When the vector multiplets can be associated to the complex structure moduli of a Calabi-Yau manifold, then our 0-brane action can be derived by wrapping 3-branes around 3-cycles of the 3-fold. Our result can be extended to the case of higher supersymmetry; we explicitly construct the kappa supersymmetric action for a superparticle moving in an arbitrary N=8 supergravity background with 1/2, 1/4 or 1/8 residual supersymmetry.
