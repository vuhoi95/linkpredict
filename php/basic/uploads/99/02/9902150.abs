Title: Free Field Approach to the Dilute A_L Models
Authors: Y. Hara and M. Jimbo and H. Konno and S. Odake and J. Shiraishi
Abstract: We construct a free field realization of vertex operators of the dilute A_L models along with the Felder complex. For L=3, we also study an E_8 structure in terms of the deformed Virasoro currents.
