Title: Solutions to the reflection equation and integrable systems for N=2 SQCD  with classical groups
Authors: A. Gorsky and A. Mironov
Abstract: Integrable systems underlying the Seiberg-Witten solutions for the N=2 SQCD with gauge groups SO(n) and Sp(n) are proposed. They are described by the inhomogeneous XXX spin chain with specific boundary conditions given by reflection matrices. We attribute reflection matrices to orientifold planes in the brane construction and briefly discuss its possible deformations.
