Title: AdS_3/CFT_2 Correspondence and Space-Time N=3 Superconformal Algebra
Authors: S. Yamaguchi and Y. Ishimoto and K. Sugiyama
Abstract: We study a Wess-Zumino-Witten model with target space AdS_3 x (S^3 x S^3 x S^1)/Z_2. This allows us to construct space-time N=3 superconformal theories. By combining left-, and right-moving parts through a GSO and a Z_2 projections, a new asymmetric (N,\bar{N})=(3,1) model is obtained. It has an extra gauge (affine) SU(2) symmetry in the target space of the type IIA string. An associated configuration is realized as slantwise intersecting M5-M2 branes with a Z_2-fixed plane in the M-theory viewpoint.
