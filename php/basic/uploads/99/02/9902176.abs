Title: Witten's Cubic Vertex in the Comma Theory (I)
Authors: A. Abdurrahman and J. Bordes
Abstract: In is shown explicitly that the Witten's interaction 3-vertex is a solution to the comma overlap equations; hence establishing the equivalence between the conventional and the "comma" formulation of interacting string theory at the level of vertices.
