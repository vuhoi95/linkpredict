Title: Quantum field theory of electrodynamic phenomena that requires no  regularization
Authors: Marijan Ribaric and Luka Sustersic
Abstract: We put forward an example of local, covariant Lagrangians where the Feynman rules result in diagrams of QED but with regularized propagators. Following 't Hooft and Veltman, these diagrams may be taken to define a quantum field theory of electrodynamic phenomena that requires no regularization and is realistic, because: (i) The corresponding Green's functions are causal. (ii) Its S-matrix is unitary. (iii) The theory does not imply the existence of particles with wrong metric and/or wrong statistics. (iv) It contains the experimental predictions of QED. No such Lagrangians were known before
