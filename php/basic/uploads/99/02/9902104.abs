Title: Quantizing field theories in noncommutative geometry and the  correspondence between anti de Sitter space and conformal field theory
Authors: K. Kaviani and A. M. Ghezelbash
Abstract: By using the approach of non-commutative geometry, we study spinors and scalars on the two layers AdS$_{d+1}$ space. We have found that in the boundary of two layers AdS$_{d+1}$ space, by using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we have a logarithmic conformal field theory. This observation propose a way to get the quantum field theory in the context of non-commutative geometry.
