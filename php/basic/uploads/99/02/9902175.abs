Title: Group Approach to Quantization of Yang-Mills Theories: A Cohomological  Origin of Mass
Authors: M. Calixto and V. Aldaya
Abstract: New clues for the best understanding of the nature of the symmetry-breaking mechanism are revealed in this paper. A revision of the standard gauge transformation properties of Yang-Mills fields, according to a group approach to quantization scheme, enables the gauge group coordinates to acquire dynamical content outside the null mass shell. The corresponding extra (internal) field degrees of freedom are transferred to the vector potentials to conform massive vector bosons.
