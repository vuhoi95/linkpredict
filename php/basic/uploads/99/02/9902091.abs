Abstract: It is shown using both conventional and algebraic approach to quantum field theory that it is impossible to perform quantization on Unruh modes in Minkowski spacetime. Such quantization implies setting boundary condition for the quantum field operator which changes topological properties and symmetry group of spacetime and leads to field theory in two disconnected left and right Rindler spacetimes. It means that "Unruh effect" does not exist.
