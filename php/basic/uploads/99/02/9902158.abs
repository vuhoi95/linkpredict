Title: Tachyon Condensation and Graviton Production in Matrix Theory
Authors: H. Awata and S. Hirano and Y. Hyakutake
Abstract: We study a membrane -- anti-membrane system in Matrix theory. It in fact exhibits the tachyon instability. By suitably representing this configuration, we obtain a (2+1)-dimensional U(2) gauge theory with a 't Hooft's twisted boundary condition. We identify the tachyon field with a certain off-diagonal element of the gauge fields in this model. Taking into account the boundary conditions carefully, we can find vortex solutions which saturate the Bogomol'nyi-type bound and manifest the tachyon condensation. We show that they can be interpreted as gravitons in Matrix theory.
