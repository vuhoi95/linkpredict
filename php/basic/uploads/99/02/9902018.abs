Title: Instantons Versus Supersymmetry: Fifteen Years Later
Authors: Mikhail Shifman and Arkady Vainshtein
Abstract: An introduction to the instanton formalism in supersymmetric gauge theories is given. We explain how the instanton calculations, in conjunction with analyticity in chiral parameters and other general properties following from supersymmetry, allow one to establish exact results in the weak and strong coupling regimes. Some key applications are reviewed, the main emphasis is put on the mechanisms of the dynamical breaking of supersymmetry.
