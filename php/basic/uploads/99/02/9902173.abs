Title: Cosmic Holography
Authors: Dongsu Bak and Soo-Jong Rey
Abstract: A new version of holographic principle for cosmology is proposed, which dictates that particle entropy within `cosmological apparent horizon' should not exceed gravitational entropy associated with the apparent horizon. It is shown that, in the Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology, the open Universe as well as a restricted class of flat cases are compatible with the principle, whereas closed Universe is not. It is also found that inflationary Universe after the big-bang is incompatible with the cosmic holography.
