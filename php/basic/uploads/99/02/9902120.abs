Title: D0-branes in Gepner models and N=2 black holes
Authors: Michael Gutperle and Yuji Satoh
Abstract: In this paper D-brane boundary states constructed in Gepner models are used to analyze some aspects of the dynamics of D0-branes in Calabi-Yau compactifications of type II theories to four dimensions. It is shown that the boundary states correspond to BPS objects carrying dyonic charges. By analyzing the couplings to closed string fields a correspondence between the D0-branes and extremal charged black holes in N=2 supergravity is found.
