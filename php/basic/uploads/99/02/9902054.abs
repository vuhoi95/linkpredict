Title: Quantum Generation of the non-Abelian SU(N) Gauge Fields
Authors: P. I. Fomin and T. Yu. Kuzmenko
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a generation mechanism of the non-Abelian gauge fields in the SU(N) gauge theory. It is shown that the SU(N) gauge fields ensuring the local invariance of the theory are generated at the quantum level only due to nonsmoothness of the scalar phases of the fundamental spinor fields. The expression for the gauge fields are obtained in terms of the nonsmooth scalar phases.
