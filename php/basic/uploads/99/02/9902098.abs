Title: Conformal Field Theory of AdS Background with Ramond-Ramond Flux
Authors: N. Berkovits and C. Vafa and E. Witten
Abstract: We review a formalism of superstring quantization with manifest six-dimensional spacetime supersymmetry, and apply it to AdS_3 x S^3 backgrounds with Ramond-Ramond flux. The resulting description is a conformal field theory based on a sigma model whose target space is a certain supergroup SU'(2|2).
