Title: Berry phase for oscillating neutrinos
Authors: Massimo Blasone and Peter A. Henning and Giuseppe Vitiello
Abstract: We show the presence of a topological (Berry) phase in the time evolution of a mixed state. For the case of mixed neutrinos, the Berry phase is a function of the mixing angle only.
