Title: A Note on the Superstring BRST Operator
Authors: J. N. Acosta and N. Berkovits and O. Chandia
Abstract: We write the BRST operator of the N=1 superstring as $Q= e^{-R} (\oint dz \gamma^2 b)e^R$ where $\gamma$ and $b$ are super-reparameterization ghosts. This provides a trivial proof that $Q$ is nilpotent.
