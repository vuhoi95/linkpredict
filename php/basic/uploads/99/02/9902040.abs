Title: Maximum Mass of Boson Star Formed by Self-Interacting Scalar Fields
Authors: Jeongwon Ho and Sungjoon Kim and Bum-Hoon Lee
Abstract: We make analytic derivation for maximum masses of stable boson stars formed by scalar fields with any higher order self-interactions and show that those are equivalent to numerical results. It is shown that the contribution of the higher order self-interaction terms to the maximum mass decreases as $(m/M_p)^2$ power.
