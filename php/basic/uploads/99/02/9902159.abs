Abstract: Lienard-Wiechert potentials of the relativistic spinning particle with anomalous magnetic moment in pseudoclassical theory are constructed. General expressions for the Lienard-Wiechert potentials are used for investigation of some specific cases of the motion of the spinning particle. In particular the spin dependence of the intensity of the synchrotron radiation of the transversely polarized particle performing uniform circular motion is considered. When the movement of the particle in external homogeneous magnetic field the obtained formulae coincide with those known from quantum theory of radiation. The dependence of the polarization of the synchrotron radiation on the spin of the particle is investigated.
