Abstract: We construct the gauge field and graviton propagators in Euclidean AdS(d+1) space-time by two different methods. In the first method the gauge invariant Maxwell or linearized Ricci operator is applied directly to bitensor ansatze for the propagators which reflect their gauge structure. This leads to a rapid determination of the physical part of the propagators in terms of elementary functions. The second method is a more traditional approach using covariant gauge fixing which leads to a solution for both physical and gauge parts of the propagators. The gauge invariant parts agree in both methods.
