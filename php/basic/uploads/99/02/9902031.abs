Title: High-energy scattering in gauge theories and integrable spin chains
Authors: D. R. Karakhanyan and R. Kirschner
Abstract: In the leading log approximation and at large $N_C$ the interaction of two fermionic and one gluonic reggeons is described by an integrable system corresponding to an open spin chain.
