Title: On Group Averaging for SO(n,1)
Authors: Andres Gomberoff and Donald Marolf
Abstract: The technique known as group averaging provides powerful machinery for the study of constrained systems. However, it is likely to be well defined only in a limited set of cases. Here, we investigate the possibility of using a `renormalized' group averaging in certain models. The results of our study may indicate a general connection between superselection sectors and the rate of divergence of the group averaging integral.
