Title: Brane Transfer Operations and T-Duality of Non-BPS States
Authors: Oren Bergman and Eric G. Gimon and Petr Horava
Abstract: Using the relation between D-brane charges and K-theory, we study non-BPS D-branes and their behavior under T-duality. We point out that in general compactifications, D-brane charges are classified by relative K-theory groups. T-duality is found to act as a symmetry between the relative K-theory groups in Type II and Type I/IA theories. We also study Type \tilde\IA theory (which contains an O8^- plane and an O8^+ plane), using K-theory and T-duality to identify its stable D-branes. Comparison with string theory constructions reveals two interesting effects. One of them involves the transfer of branes between O-planes, while in the other, a D-brane charge which seems conserved near one O-plane in fact decays due to the presence of another type of O-plane.
