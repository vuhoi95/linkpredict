Title: On D-branes in Type 0 String Theory
Authors: Marco Billo' and Ben Craps and Frederik Roose
Abstract: Using boundary states we derive the presence of (chiral) fermions on the intersection of type 0 D-branes. The corresponding anomalous couplings on the branes are then computed. Furthermore, we discuss systems of branes sitting at $A_n$ singularities. In particular, the massless spectrum on the branes is derived, and a boundary state description is given.
