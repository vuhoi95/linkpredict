Title: Kaluza-Klein Monopole and 5-brane Effective Actions
Authors: Eduardo Eyras and Yolanda Lozano
Abstract: We review the construction of the Kaluza-Klein monopole of the Type IIA theory in the most general case of a massive background, as well as its relation via T-duality with the Type IIB NS-5-brane. This last effective action is shown to be related by S-duality to the D5-brane effective action.
