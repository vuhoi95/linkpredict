Title: On Mirror Symmetry in Three Dimensional Abelian Gauge Theories
Authors: Anton Kapustin and Matthew J. Strassler
Abstract: We present an identity relating the partition function of N=4 supersymmetric QED to that of its dual under mirror symmetry. The identity is a generalized Fourier transform. Many known properties of abelian theories can be derived from this formula, including the mirror transforms for more general gauge and matter content. We show that N=3 Chern-Simons QED and N=4 QED with BF-type couplings are conformal field theories with exactly marginal couplings. Mirror symmetry acts on these theories as strong-weak coupling duality. After identifying the mirror of the gauge coupling (sometimes called the ``magnetic coupling'') we construct a theory which is exactly mirror -- at all scales -- to N=4 SQED. We also study vortex-creation operators in the large $N_f$ limit.
