Title: Absorption cross section and Hawking radiation in two-dimensional AdS  black hole
Authors: Won Tae Kim and John J. Oh and Jung Hee Park
Abstract: We calculate the absorption coefficient of scalar field on the background of the two-dimensional AdS black hole, which is of relevance to Hawking radiation. For the massless scalar field, we find that there does not exist any massless radiation.
