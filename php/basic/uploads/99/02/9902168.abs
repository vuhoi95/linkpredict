Title: Conformal N=0 d=4 Gauge Theories from AdS/CFT Superstring Duality?
Authors: Paul H. Frampton and William F. Shively
Abstract: Non-supersymmetric d=4 gauge theories which arise from superstring duality on a manifold $AdS_5 \times S_5/Z_p$ are cataloged for a range $2 \leq p \leq 41$. A number have vanishing two-loop gauge \beta-function, a necessary but not sufficient condition to be a conformal field theory.
