Title: Chern-Simons Theories in the AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: Pablo Minces and Victor O. Rivelles
Abstract: We consider the AdS/CFT correspondence for theories with a Chern-Simons term in three dimensions. We find the two-point functions of the boundary conformal field theories for the Proca-Chern-Simons theory and the Self-Dual model. We also discuss particular limits where we find the two-point function of the boundary conformal field theory for the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory. In particular our results are consistent with the equivalence between the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory and the Self-Dual model.
