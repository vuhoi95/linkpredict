Title: Towards a Nonperturbative Covariant Regularization in 4D Quantum Field  Theory
Authors: H. Grosse and A. Strohmaier
Abstract: We give a noncommutative version of the complex projective space CP^2 and show that scalar QFT on this space is free of UV divergencies. The tools necessary to investigate Quantum fields on this fuzzy CP^2 are developed and possibilities to introduce spinors and Dirac operators are discussed.
