Title: On the normalization of Killing vectors and energy conservation in  two-dimensional gravity
Authors: J. Cruz and A. Fabbri and J. Navarro-Salas
Abstract: We explicitly show that, in the context of a recently proposed 2D dilaton gravity theory, energy conservation requires the ``natural'' Killing vector to have, asymptotically, an unusual normalization. The Hawking temperature $T_H$ is then calculated according to this prescription.
