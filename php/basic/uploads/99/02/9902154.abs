Abstract: The abelian Chern-Simons theory is perturbed by introducing local gauge-invariant interaction terms depending on the curvature. The computation of the correlation function of two Wilson lines for two smooth closed nonintersecting curves is reported up to four loops and is shown to be unaffected by radiative corrections. This result ensures the stability of the linking number of the two curves with respect to the local perturbations which may be added to the Chern-Simons action.
