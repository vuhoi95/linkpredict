Title: 6D black string as a model of the AdS/CFT correspondence
Authors: Y. S. Myung and N. J. Kim and H. W. Lee
Abstract: We discuss the entropy for the extremal BTZ black hole and the extremal EBTZ black hole. The EBTZ black hole means the BTZ black hole embedded in a five-dimensional(5D) black hole. The six-dimensional(6D) black string with traveling waves is introduced as a concrete model for realizing the AdS/CFT correspondence. The traveling waves carry the momentum distribution $p(u)$ which plays an important role in counting the entropy and establishing the correspondence. It turns out that the EBTZ black hole is consistent with the AdS/CFT correspondence.
