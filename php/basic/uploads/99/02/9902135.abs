Title: Charged Vacuum Condensate Near a Superconducting Cosmic String
Authors: J. R. S. Nascimento and Inyong Cho and Alexander Vilenkin
Abstract: A charged superconductiong cosmic string produces an extremely large electric field in its vicinity. This leads to vacuum instability and to the formation of a charged vacuum condensate which screens the electric charge of the string. We analyze the structure of this condensate using the Thomas-Fermi method.
