Title: Conservative Currents of Boundary Charges in $AdS_{2+1}$ Gravity
Authors: Sze-Shiang Feng and Bin Wang and Xin-He Meng
Abstract: The boundary charges which constitute the Virasoro algebra in 2+1 dimensional anti-de Sitter gravity are derived by way of Noether theorem and diffeomorphic invariance. It shows that the boundary charges under discussion recently exhaust all the independent nontrivial charges available. Therefore, the state counting via the Virasoro algebra is complete.
