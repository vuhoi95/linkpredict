Title: Borel Summation of the Derivative Expansion and Effective Actions
Authors: Gerald V. Dunne and Theodore M. Hall
Abstract: We give an explicit demonstration that the derivative expansion of the QED effective action is a divergent but Borel summable asymptotic series, for a particular inhomogeneous background magnetic field. A duality transformation B\to iE gives a non-Borel-summable perturbative series for a time dependent background electric field, and Borel dispersion relations yield the non-perturbative imaginary part of the effective action, which determines the pair production probability. Resummations of leading Borel approximations exponentiate to give perturbative corrections to the exponents in the non-perturbative pair production rates. Comparison with a WKB analysis suggests that these divergence properties are general features of derivative expansions and effective actions.
