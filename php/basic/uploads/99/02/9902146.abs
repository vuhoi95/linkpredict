Title: Universal amplitude ratios in the 2D four state Potts model
Authors: Michele Caselle and Roberto Tateo and Stefano Vinti
Abstract: We present a Monte Carlo study of various universal amplitude ratios of the two dimensional q=4 Potts model. We simulated the model close to criticality in both phases taking care to keep the systematic errors, due to finite size effects and logarithmic corrections in the scaling functions, under control. Our results are compatible with those recently obtained using the form-factors approach and with the existing low temperature series for the model.
