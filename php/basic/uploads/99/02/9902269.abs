Title: Ground State and Excitations of Spin Chain with Orbital Degeneracy
Authors: You-Quan Li and Micheal Ma and Da-Ning Shi and Fu-Chun Zhang
Abstract: The one dimensional Heisenberg model in the presence of orbital degeneracy is studied at the SU(4) symmetric viewpoint by means of Bethe ansatz. Following Sutherland's previous work on an equivalent model, we discuss the ground state and the low-lying excitations more extensively in connection to the spin systems with orbital degeneracy. We show explicitly that the ground state is a SU(4) singlet. We study the degeneracies of the elementary excitations and the spectra of the generalized magnons consisting of these excitations. We also discuss the complex 2-strings in the context of the Bethe ansatz solutions.
