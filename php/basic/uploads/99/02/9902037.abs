Title: Local D=4 Field Theory on $κ$--Deformed Minkowski Space
Authors: P. Kosiński and J. Lukierski and P. Maślanka
Abstract: We describe the local D=4 field theory on $\kappa$--deformed Minkowski space as nonlocal relativistic field theory on standard Minkowski space--time. For simplicity the case of $\kappa$-deformed scalar field $\phi$ with the interaction $\lambda \phi^{4}$ is considered, and the $\kappa$--deformed interaction vertex is described. It appears that fundamental mass parameter $\kappa$ plays a role of regularizing imaginary Pauli--Villars mass in $\kappa$--deformed propagator.
