Title: Mass and Decay Spectra of the Piecewise Uniform String
Authors: I. Brevik and A. A. Bytsenko and A. E. Goncalves
Abstract: Mass and decay spectra are calculated for quantum massive excitations of a piecewise uniform bosonic string. The physical meaning of the critical temperatures characterizing the radiation in the decay of a massive microstate in string theory is discussed.
