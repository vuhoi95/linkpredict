Title: AdS Calibrations
Authors: G. Papadopoulos and J. Gutowski
Abstract: We present a new bound for the worldvolume actions of branes with a Wess-Zumino term. For this we introduce a generalization of calibrations for which the calibration form is not closed. We then apply our construction to find the M-5-brane worldvolume solitons in an AdS background that saturate this bound. We show that these worldvolume solitons are supersymmetric and that they satisfy differential equations which generalize those of standard calibrations.
