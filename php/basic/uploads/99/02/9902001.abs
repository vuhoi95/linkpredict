Title: Spontaneous polarization of the Kondo problem associated with the  higher-spin six-vertex model
Authors: N. Fukushima and T. Kojima
Abstract: We study the multi-channel Kondo model associated with an integrable higher-spin analogue of the anti-ferroelectric six-vertex model, which is constructed by inserting spin 1/2 to spin 1 lines: $... C^3 \otimes C^3 \otimes C^2 \otimes C^3 \otimes C^3 ... $. We formulate the problem in terms of representation theory of quantum affine algebra $U_q(hat{sl}_2)$. We derive an exact formula for the spontaneous staggered polarization for our model, which corresponds to Baxter`s formula for the six-vertex model.
