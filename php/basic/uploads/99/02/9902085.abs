Title: The Complex of Solutions of the Nested Bethe Ansatz. The A_2 Spin Chain
Authors: G. P. Pronko and Yu. G. Stroganov
Abstract: The full set of polynomial solutions of the nested Bethe Ansatz is constructed for the case of A_2 rational spin chain. The structure and properties of these associated solutions are more various then in the case of usual XXX (A_1) spin chain but their role is similar.
