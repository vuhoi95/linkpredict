Title: Quark spectra, topology and random matrix theory
Authors: Robert G. Edwards and Urs M. Heller and Joe Kiskis and Rajamani Narayanan
Abstract: Quark spectra in QCD are linked to fundamental properties of the theory including the identification of pions as the Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry. The lattice Overlap-Dirac operator provides a nonperturbative, ultraviolet-regularized description of quarks with the correct chiral symmetry. Properties of the spectrum of this operator and their relation to random matrix theory are studied here. In particular, the predictions from chiral random matrix theory in topologically non-trivial gauge field sectors are tested for the first time.
