Title: P-brane Black Holes and Post-Newtonian Approximation
Authors: S. Cotsakis and V. D. Ivashchuk and V. N. Melnikov
Abstract: We analyze p-brane black hole solutions with `block-orthogonal' intersection rules. The post-Newtonian parameters beta and gamma corresponding to 4-dimensional section of the metric are calculated. A family of solutions with gamma=1 is singled out. Some examples of solutions (e.g. in D=11 supergravity) are considered.
