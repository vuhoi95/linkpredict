Title: Complete positivity and neutron interferometry
Authors: F. Benatti and R. Floreanini
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of neutron beams in interferometry experiments using quantum dynamical semigroups. We show that these experiments could provide stringent limits on the non-standard, dissipative terms appearing in the extended evolution equations.
