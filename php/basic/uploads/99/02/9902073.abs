Title: Gauge theory origins of supergravity causal structure
Authors: Daniel Kabat and Gilad Lifschytz
Abstract: We discuss the gauge theory mechanisms which are responsible for the causal structure of the dual supergravity. For D-brane probes we show that the light cone structure and Killing horizons of supergravity emerge dynamically. They are associated with the appearance of new light degrees of freedom in the gauge theory, which we explicitly identify. This provides a picture of physics at the horizon of a black hole as seen by a D-brane probe.
