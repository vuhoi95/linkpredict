Title: Scale Invariance of Dirac Condition $g_e g_m = 1$ in Type 0 String  Approach to Gauge Theory
Authors: Ian I. Kogan and Gloria Luzon
Abstract: In this letter we shall discuss a description of non-supersymmetric four-dimensional Yang-Mills theory based on Type 0 strings recently proposed by Klebanov and Tseytlin. The three brane near-horizon geometry allows one to study the UV behaviour of the gauge theory. Following Minahan and Klebanov and Tseytlin we shall discuss how the gravity solution reproduces logarithmic renormalization of coupling constant $g_e$ extracted from quark-antiquark potential and then show that effective coupling constant $g_m$ describing monopole-antimonopole interactions is of zero-charge type and Dirac condition $g_e g_m = 1$ is scale invariant in logarithmic approximation.
