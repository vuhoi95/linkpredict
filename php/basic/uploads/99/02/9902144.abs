Title: Renormalization group for the internal space
Authors: Jean Alexandre and Janos Polonyi
Abstract: The renormalization group method is a successive integration over the fluctuations which are ordered according to their length scale, a parameter in the external space. A different procedure is described, where the fluctuations are treated in a successive manner, as well, but their order is given by an internal space parameter, their amplitude. The differential version of the renormalization group equation is given which is the functional generalization of the Callan-Symanzik equation in one special case and resums the loop expansion in another one.
