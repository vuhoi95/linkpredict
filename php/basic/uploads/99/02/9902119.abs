Title: Comments on Brane Configurations with Semi-infinite D4 Branes
Authors: Kyungho Oh and Radu Tatar
Abstract: We consider four dimensional supersymmetric gauge field theories from brane configurations with the matter content given by semi-infinite D4 branes ending on both sides of NS branes. In M theory configuration, we discuss the splitting of the M5 brane into infinite cylindrical M5 branes (which decouple) and transversal M5 brane. The splitting condition appears naturally from the consistency of the different projections of the Seiberg-Witten curve.
