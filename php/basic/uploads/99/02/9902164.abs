Title: osp(1,2)-covariant Lagrangian quantization of irreducible massive gauge  theories with generic background configurations
Authors: Bodo Geyer and Dietmar MÃ¼lsch
Abstract: In the framework of osp(1,2)-symmetric quantization of irreducible massive gauge theories the background field method is studied for the simplest case of a linear splitting of the gauge field into a background configuration and the quantum fluctuations. The symmetries of that approach - including three types of background-dependent gauge transformations - are expressed by Ward identities. From these identities together with the equations of motion of the auxiliary field the background dependence of the vertex functions and of the Greens functions is determined. It is proven that the introduction of a background field does not change the ultraviolet asymptotics of the theory.
