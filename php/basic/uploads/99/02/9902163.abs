Title: Exact effective action for N=1 supersymmetric theories
Authors: P. Pronin and K. Stepanyantz
Abstract: We investigate nonperturbative effects in N=1 supersymmetric theories and propose a new expression for the effective action, which correctly reproduces quantum anomalies and agrees with the transformation law of instanton measure. Actually the result is a nonperturbative extension of Veneziano-Yankielowitch effective Lagrangian. The possibility of integrating out the gluino condensate is discussed.
