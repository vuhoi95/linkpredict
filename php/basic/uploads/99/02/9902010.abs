Title: Lax Pair Formulation and Multi-soliton Solution of the Integrable Vector  Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation
Authors: Freddy P. Zen and Hendry I. Elim
Abstract: The integrable vector nonlinear Schrodinger (vector NLS) equation is investigated by using Zakharov-Shabat (ZS) scheme. We get a Lax pair formulation of the vector NLS model. Multi-soliton solution of the equation is also derived by using inverse scattering method of ZS scheme. We also find that there is an elastic and inelastic collision of the bright and dark multi-solitons of the system.
