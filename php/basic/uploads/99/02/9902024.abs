Title: Fluid Dynamical Profiles and Constants of Motion from d-Branes
Authors: R. Jackiw and A. P. Polychronakos
Abstract: Various fluid mechanical systems enjoy a hidden, higher-dimensional dynamical Poincare symmetry, which arises owing to their descent from a Nambu-Goto action. Also, for the same reason, there are equivalence transformations between different models. These interconnections are discussed in our paper.
