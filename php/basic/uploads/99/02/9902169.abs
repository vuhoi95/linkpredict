Title: Comments on D-Instantons in c<1 Strings
Authors: Masafumi Fukuma and Shigeaki Yahikozawa
Abstract: We suggest that the boundary cosmological constant \zeta in c<1 unitary string theory be regarded as the one-dimensional complex coordinate of the target space on which the boundaries of world-sheets can live. From this viewpoint we explicitly construct analogues of D-instantons which satisfy Polchinski's ``combinatorics of boundaries.'' We further show that our operator formalism developed in the preceding articles is powerful in evaluating D-instanton effects, and also demonstrate for simple cases that these effects exactly coincide with the stringy nonperturbative effects found in the exact solutions of string equations.
