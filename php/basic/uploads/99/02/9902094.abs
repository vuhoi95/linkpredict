Title: A topological invariant of RG flows in 2D integrable quantum field  theories
Authors: R. Caracciolo and F. Gliozzi and R. Tateo
Abstract: We construct a topological invariant of the renormalization group trajectories of a large class of 2D quantum integrable models, described by the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz approach. A geometrical description of this invariant in terms of triangulations of three-dimensional manifolds is proposed and associated dilogarithm identities are proven.
