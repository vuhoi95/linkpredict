Abstract: Using a high-statistics lattice simulation of the Ising limit of $(\lambda \Phi^4)_4$ theory, we have measured the susceptibility and propagator in the broken phase. We confirm our earlier finding of a discrepancy between the field re-scaling implied by the propagator data and that implied by the susceptibility. The discrepancy becomes {\it worse} as one goes closer to the continuum limit; thus, it cannot be explained by residual perturbative effects. The data are consistent with an unconventional description of symmetry breaking and ``triviality'' in which the re-scaling factor for the finite-momentum fluctuations tends to unity, but the re-scaling factor for the condensate becomes larger and larger as one approaches the continuum limit. In the Standard Model this changes the interpretation of the Fermi-constant scale and its relation to the Higgs mass.
