Title: On the Quantization of the GS String on $AdS_5 \times S^5$
Authors: Arvind Rajaraman and Moshe Rozali
Abstract: We discuss the quantization of the Green-Schwarz string action on $AdS_5 \times S^5$. We construct consistent, globally well-defined, gauge fixing choices for kappa symmetry and worldsheet diffeomorphism invariance. We then proceed to quantize the theory in a perturbation series in the inverse radius of curvature, in a background field expansion. We discuss vertex operators and correlation functions, and demonstrate agreement with supergravity results in the appropriate limit.
