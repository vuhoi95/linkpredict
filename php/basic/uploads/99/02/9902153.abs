Title: Correlation Functions of Operators and Wilson Surfaces in the d=6, (0,2)  Theory in the Large N Limit
Authors: Richard Corrado and Bogdan Florea and Robert McNees
Abstract: We compute the two and three-point correlation functions of chiral primary operators in the large N limit of the (0,2), d=6 superconformal theory. We also consider the operator product expansion of Wilson surfaces in the (0,2) theory and compute the OPE coefficients of the chiral primary operators at large N from the correlation functions of surfaces.
