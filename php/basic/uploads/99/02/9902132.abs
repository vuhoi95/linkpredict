Title: Symmetry breaking boundaries I. General theory
Authors: J. Fuchs and C. Schweigert
Abstract: We study conformally invariant boundary conditions that break part of the bulk symmetries. A general theory is developped for those boundary conditions for which the preserved subalgebra is the fixed algebra under an abelian orbifold group. We explicitly construct the boundary states and reflection coefficients as well as the annulus amplitudes. Integrality of the annulus coefficients is proven in full generality.
