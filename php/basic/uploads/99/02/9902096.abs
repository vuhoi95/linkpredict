Title: Generally Covariant Conservative Energy-Momentum for Gravitational  Anyons
Authors: Sze-Shiang Feng and Yi-Shi Duan
Abstract: We obtain a generally covariant conservation law of energy-momentum for gravitational anyons by the general displacement transform. The energy-momentum currents have also superpotentials and are therefore identically conserved. It is shown that for Deser's solution and Clement's solution, the energy vanishes. The reasonableness of the definition of energy-momentum may be confirmed by the solution for pure Einstein gravity which is a limit of vanishing Chern-Simons coulping of gravitational anyons.
