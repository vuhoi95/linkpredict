Title: Finite Temperature Correlation Functions in Integrable QFT
Authors: A. Leclair and G. Mussardo
Abstract: Finite temperature correlation functions in integrable quantum field theories are formulated only in terms of the usual, temperature-independent form factors, and certain thermodynamic filling fractions which are determined from the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. Explicit expressions are given for the one and two-point functions.
