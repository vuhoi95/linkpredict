Title: Light-cone formulation and spin spectrum of non-critical fermionic  string
Authors: Marcin Daszkiewicz and Zbigniew Hasiewicz and Zbigniew Jaskolski
Abstract: A free fermionic string quantum model is constructed directly in the light-cone variables in the range of dimensions $1<d<10$. It is shown that after the GSO projection this model is equivalent to the fermionic massive string and to the non-critical Rammond-Neveu-Schwarz string. The spin spectrum of the model is analysed. For $d=4$ the character generating functions is obtained and the particle content of first few levels is numerically calculated.
