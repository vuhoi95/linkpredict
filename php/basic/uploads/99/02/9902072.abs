Title: Comment on "Self-Isospectral Periodic Potentials and Supersymmetric  Quantum Mechanics"
Authors: Uday Sukhatme and Avinash Khare
Abstract: We show that the formalism of supersymmetric quantum mechanics applied to the solvable elliptic function potentials $V(x) = mj(j+1){sn}^2(x,m)$ produces new exactly solvable one-dimensional periodic potentials.
