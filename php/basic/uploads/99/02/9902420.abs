Title: Baryogenesis Below The Electroweak Scale
Authors: Lawrence M. Krauss and Mark Trodden
Abstract: We propose a new alternative for baryogenesis which resolves a number of the problems associated with GUT and electroweak scenarios, and which may allow baryogenesis even in modest extensions of the standard model. If the universe never reheats above the electroweak scale following inflation, GUT baryon production does not occur and at the same time thermal sphalerons, gravitinos and monopoles are not produced in abundance. Nevertheless, non-thermal production of sphaleron configurations via preheating could generate the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe.
