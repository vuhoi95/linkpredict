Authors: E. Gabrielli and A. Gonzalez-Arroyo and C. Pena
Abstract: We study N=1 supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills theory on the lattice at strong coupling. Our method is based on the hopping parameter expansion in terms of random walks, resummed for any value of the Wilson parameter r in the small hopping parameter region. Results are given for the mesonic (2-gluino) and fermionic (3-gluino) propagators and spectrum.
