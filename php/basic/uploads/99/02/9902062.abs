Title: Vortex-like Structures in the Skyrme-Einstein Chiral Model
Authors: Yu. P. Rybakov and A. M. Tarabay and I. G. Chugunov
Abstract: A regular method is suggested for constructing vortex-like solutions with cylindrical symmetry in the Skyrme-Einstein chiral model. The method is based on the expansion of metric and field functions in power series with respect to the two small parameters entering the model. The length mass density of the vortex is estimated.
