Title: Retarded thermal Greens functions and forward scattering amplitudes at  two loops
Authors: F. T. Brandt and Ashok Das and J. Frenkel
Abstract: In this paper, we extend our earlier one loop analysis to two loops and give a simple diagrammatic description for the retarded Greens functions at finite temperature, in terms of forward scattering amplitudes of on-shell thermal particles. We present a simple discussion, which can be easily generalized to any field theory, of the temperature dependent parts of the retarded two and three point functions in scalar field theory and QED. As an application of our result at two loops, we show how the infrared singularities in the thermal part of the retarded photon self-energy, cancel in QED_2 in the limit of vanishing electron mass.
