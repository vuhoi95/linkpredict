Title: $PSL(n|n)$ Sigma Model as a Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Michael Bershadsky and Slava Zhukov and Arkady Vaintrob
Abstract: We discuss the sigma model on the $PSL(n|n)$ supergroup manifold. We demonstrate that this theory is exactly conformal. The chiral algebra of this model is given by some extension of the Virasoro algebra, similar to the $W$ algebra of Zamolodchikov. We also show that all group invariant correlation functions are coupling constant independent and can be computed in the free theory. The non invariant correlation functions are highly nontrivial and coupling dependent. At the end we compare two and three-point correlation functions of the $PSL(1,1|2)$ sigma model with the correlation functions in the boundary theory of $AdS_3 \times S^3$ and find a qualitative agreement.
