Title: Low-Scale Closed Strings and their Duals
Authors: I. Antoniadis and B. Pioline
Abstract: We study large dimensions and low string scale in four-dimensional compactifications of type II theories of closed strings at weak coupling. We find that the fundamental string scale, together with all compact dimensions, can be at the TeV, while the smallness of the string coupling accounts for the weakness of gravitational interactions. This is in contrast to the situation recently studied in type I theories, where the string scale can be lowered only at the expense of introducing large transverse dimensions felt by gravity only. As a result, in these type II strings, there are no strong gravity effects at the TeV, and the main experimental signature is the production of Kaluza-Klein excitations with gauge interactions. In the context of type IIB theories, we find a new possibility providing a first instance of large non-transverse dimensions at weak coupling: two of the internal dimensions seen by gauge interactions can be at the TeV, with the string scale and all other dimensions at intermediate energies of the order of $10^{11}$ GeV, where gravity becomes also strong. Finally, using duality, we provide a perturbative description for the generic case of large dimensions in the heterotic string. In particular, we show that the two type II theories above describe the cases of one and two heterotic large dimensions. A new M-theory derivation of heterotic-type II duality is instrumental for this discussion.
