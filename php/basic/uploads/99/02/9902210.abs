Title: Localized intersections of M5-branes and four-dimensional superconformal  field theories
Authors: Ansar Fayyazuddin and Douglas J. Smith
Abstract: We write supersymmetry preserving conditions for infinite M5-branes intersecting on a (3+1)-dimensional space. In contrast to previously known solutions, these intersections are completely localized. We solve the equations for a particular class of configurations which in the near-horizon decoupling limit are dual to N_f = 2N_c Seiberg-Witten superconformal field theories with gauge group SU(N) and generalisations to SU(N)^n. We also discuss the relationship to D3-branes in the presence of an A_k singularity.
