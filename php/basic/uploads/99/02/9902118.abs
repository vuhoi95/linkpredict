Title: Marginal Deformations from Branes
Authors: Joshua Erlich and Amihay Hanany and Asad Naqvi
Abstract: We study brane configurations for four dimensional N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories with quartic superpotentials which flow in the infrared to manifolds of interacting superconformal fixed points. We enumerate finite N=2 theories, from which a large class of marginal N=1 theories descend. We give the brane descriptions of these theories in Type IIA and Type IIB string theory. The Type IIB descriptions are in terms of D3 branes in orientifold and generalized conifold backgrounds. We calculate the Weyl and Euler anomalies in these theories, and find that they are equal in elliptic models and unequal in a large class of finite N=2 and marginal N=1 non-elliptic theories.
