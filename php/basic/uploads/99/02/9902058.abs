Title: Spin systems, spin coherent states and quasi-exactly solvable models
Authors: V. V. Ulyanov and O. B. Zaslavskii
Abstract: Spin coherent states play a crucial role in defining QESM (quasi-exactly solvable models) establishing a strict correspondence between energy spectra of spin systems and low-lying quantum states for a particle moving in a potential field of a certain form. Spin coherent states are also used for finding the Wigner-Kirkwood expansion and quantum corrections to energy quantization rules. The closed equation which governs dynamics of a quantum system is obtained in the spin coherent representation directly for observable quantities.
