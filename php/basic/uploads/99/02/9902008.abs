Title: Local conserved charges in principal chiral models
Authors: J. M. Evans and M. Hassan and N. J. MacKay and A. J. Mountain
Abstract: Local conserved charges in principal chiral models in 1+1 dimensions are investigated. There is a classically conserved local charge for each totally symmetric invariant tensor of the underlying group. These local charges are shown to be in involution with the non-local Yangian charges. The Poisson bracket algebra of the local charges is then studied. For each classical algebra, an infinite set of local charges with spins equal to the exponents modulo the Coxeter number is constructed, and it is shown that these commute with one another. Brief comments are made on the evidence for, and implications of, survival of these charges in the quantum theory.
