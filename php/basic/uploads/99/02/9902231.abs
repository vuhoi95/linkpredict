Title: Dynamics of Fermions and Inhomogeneous Bose Fields on a Real-Time  Lattice
Authors: Gert Aarts and Jan Smit
Abstract: The dynamics of the 1+1 abelian Higgs model with fermions is studied in the large N_f approximation, on a real-time lattice. The Bose fields obey effective classical equations of motion which include the fermion back reaction. The dynamics of the quantized fermion field is treated with a mode function expansion. Numerical results are shown for renormalizability, nonequilibrium dynamics and the anomalous charge, and Pauli blocking.
