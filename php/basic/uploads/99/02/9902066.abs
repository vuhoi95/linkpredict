Abstract: The escape rates of the biaxial single domain spin particles with and without an applied magnetic field are investigated. Using the strict potential field description of spin systems developed by Ulyanov and Zaslavskii we obtain new effective Hamiltonians which are considered to be in exact spin-coordinate correspondence unlike the well studied effective Hamiltonians with the approximate correspondence. The sharp first-order transition is found in both cases. The phase diagram of the transitions depending on the anisotropy constant and the external field is also given.
