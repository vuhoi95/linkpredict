Title: Modular Invariants and Generalized Halphen Systems
Authors: J. Harnad and J. McKay
Abstract: Generalized Halphen systems are solved in terms of functions that uniformize genus zero Riemann surfaces, with automorphism groups that are commensurable with the modular group. Rational maps relating these functions imply subgroup relations between their automorphism groups and symmetrization relations between the associated differential systems.
