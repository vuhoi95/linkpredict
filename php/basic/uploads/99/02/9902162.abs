Title: On the Beta Function in Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
Authors: G. Carlino and K. Konishi and N. Maggiore and N. Magnoli
Abstract: We re-examine perturbative and nonperturbative aspects of the beta function in N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories, make comments on the recent literature on the subject and discuss the exactness of several known results such as the NSVZ beta function.
