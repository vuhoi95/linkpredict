Title: Free Fermions at Finite Temperature: An Application of the  Non-Commutative Algebra
Authors: S. M. de Souza and O. Rojas Santos and M. T. Thomaz
Abstract: Charret et. al. applied the properties of the Grassmann generators to develop a new method to calculate the coefficients of the high temperature expansion of the grand canonical partition function of self-interacting fermionic models in any d-dimensions (d>=1). The method explores the anti-commuting nature of fermionic fields and avoids the calculation of the fermionic path integral. We apply this new method to the relativistic free Dirac fermions and recover the known results in the literature.
