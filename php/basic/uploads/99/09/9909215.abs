Title: Supergravity and Large N Noncommutative Field Theories
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha and Yaron Oz and M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari
Abstract: We consider systems of Dp branes in the presence of a nonzero B field. We study the corresponding supergravity solutions in the limit where the branes worldvolume theories decouple from gravity. These provide dual descriptions of large N noncommutative field theories. We analyse the phase structure of the theories and the validity of the different description. We provide evidence that in the presence of a nonzero B field the worldvolume theory of D6 branes decouples from gravity. We analyse the systems of M5 branes and NS5 branes in the presence of a nonzero C field and nonzero RR fields, respectively. Finally, we study the Wilson loops (surfaces) using the dual descriptions.
