Title: Five-dimensional N=4, SU(2) X U(1) Gauged Supergravity from Type IIB
Authors: H. Lu and C. N. Pope and T. A. Tran
Abstract: We construct the complete and explicit non-linear Kaluza-Klein ansatz for deriving the bosonic sector of N=4 SU(2)\times U(1) gauged five-dimensional supergravity from the reduction of type IIB supergravity on S^5. This provides the first complete example of such an S^5 reduction that includes non-abelian gauge fields, and it allows any bosonic solution of the five-dimensional N=4 gauged theory to be embedded in D=10.
