Title: Consistent canonical quantization of general relativity in the space of  Vassiliev knot invariants
Authors: C. Di Bartolo and R. Gambini and J. Griego and J. Pullin
Abstract: We present a quantization of the Hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraint of canonical quantum gravity in the spin network representation. The novelty consists in considering a space of wavefunctions based on the Vassiliev knot invariants. The constraints are finite, well defined, and reproduce at the level of quantum commutators the Poisson algebra of constraints of the classical theory. A similar construction can be carried out in 2+1 dimensions leading to the correct quantum theory.
