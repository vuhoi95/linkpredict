Title: Consistent Perturbative Light Front Formulation of Yang-Mills Theories
Authors: M. Morara and R. Soldati and G. McCartor
Abstract: It is shown how to obtain the consistent light front form quantization of a non-Abelian pure Yang-Mills theory (gluondynamics) in the framework of the standard perturbative approach. After a short review of the previous attempts in the light cone gauge $A_-=0$, it is explained how the difficulties can be overcome after turning to the anti light cone gauge $A_+=0$. In particular, the generating functional of the renormalized Green's functions turns out to be the same as in the conventional instant form approach, leading to the Mandelstam-Leibbrandt prescription for the free gluon propagator.
