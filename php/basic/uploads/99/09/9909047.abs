Title: The Supergravity Dual of N=1 Super Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: L. Girardello and M. Petrini and M. Porrati and A. Zaffaroni
Abstract: We find an exact, N=1 supersymmetric kink solution of 5d gauged supergravity. We associate this solution with the RG flow from N=4 super Yang-Mills theory, deformed by a relevant operator, to pure N=1 super Yang-Mills in the IR. We test this identification by computing various QFT quantities using the supergravity dual: the tension of electric and magnetic strings and the gaugino condensate. As demanded by our identification, our kink solution is a true deformation of N=4, that exhibits confinement of quarks, magnetic screening, and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking.
