Title: Remarks on Topological SUSY in sixdimensional TQFTs
Authors: H. Ita and K. Landsteiner and T. Pisar and J. Rant and M. Schweda
Abstract: We establish the existence of the topological vector supersymmetry in the six dimensional topological field theory for two-form fields introduced by Baulieu and West. We investigate the relation of these symmetries to the twist operation for the (2,0) supersymmetry and comment on their resemblance to the analogous symmetries in topological Yang-Mills theory.
