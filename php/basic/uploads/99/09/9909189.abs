Title: Hopf instantons in Chern-Simons theory
Authors: C. Adam and B. Muratori and C. Nash
Abstract: We study an Abelian Chern-Simons and Fermion system in three dimensions. In the presence of a fixed prescribed background magnetic field we find an infinite number of fully three-dimensional solutions. These solutions are related to Hopf maps and are, therefore, labelled by the Hopf index. Further we discuss the interpretation of the background field.
