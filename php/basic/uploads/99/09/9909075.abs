Title: Nonabelian Monopoles from Matrices: Seeds of the Spacetime Structure
Authors: B. Chen and H. Itoyama and H. Kihara
Abstract: We study the expectation value of (the product) of the one-particle projector (s) in the reduced matrix model and matrix quantum mechanics in general. This quantity is given by the nonabelian Berry phase: we discuss the relevance of this with regard to the spacetime structure. The case of the USp matrix model is examined from this respect. Generalizing our previous work, we carry out the complete computation of this quantity which takes into account both the nature of the degeneracy of the fermions and the presence of the space time points belonging to the antisymmetric representation. We find the singularities as those of the SU(2) Yang monopole connection as well as the pointlike singularities in 9+1 dimensions coming from its SU(8) generalization. The former type of singularities, which extend to four of the directions lying in the antisymmetric representations, may be regarded as seeds of our four dimensional spacetime structure and is not shared by the IIB matrix model. From a mathematical viewpoint, these connections can be generalizable to arbitrary odd space dimensions due to the nontrivial nature of the eigenbundle and the Clifford module structure.
