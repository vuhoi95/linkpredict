Title: Interacting strings on AdS_3
Authors: Gastón Giribet and Carmen Núñez
Abstract: We consider string theory on AdS_3 in terms of the Wakimoto free field representation. The scattering amplitudes for N unitary tachyons are analysed in the factorization limit and the poles corresponding to the mass-shell conditions for physical states are extracted. The vertex operators for excited levels are obtained from the residues and their properties are examined. Negative norm states are found at the second mass level.
