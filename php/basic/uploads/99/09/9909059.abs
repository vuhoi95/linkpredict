Title: Closed Strings Interacting with Noncommutative D-branes
Authors: Seungjoon Hyun and Youngjai Kiem and Sangmin Lee and Chang-Yeong Lee
Abstract: Closed string dynamics in the presence of noncommutative Dp-branes is investigated. In particular, we compute bulk closed string two-point scattering amplitudes; the bulk space-time geometries encoded in the amplitudes are shown to be consistent with the recently proposed background space-time geometries dual to noncommutative Yang-Mills theories. Three-point closed string absorption/emission amplitudes are obtained to show some features of noncommutative Dp-branes, such as modified pole structures and exponential phase factors linearly proportional to the external closed string momentum.
