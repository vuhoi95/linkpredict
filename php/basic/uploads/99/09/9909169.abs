Title: Spins and charges in Grassmann space and Kahler spinors in space of  differential forms
Authors: Norma Mankoc Borstnik and Holger Bech Nielsen
Abstract: One of us got spins and charges of not only scalars and vectors but also of spinors out of fields, which are antisymmetric tensor fields. Kahler got spins of spinors out of differential forms, which again are antisymmetric tensor fields. Using our simple Grassmann formulation of spins and charges of either spinors or vectors and comparing it to the Dirac-Kahler formulation of spinors, we generalize the Dirac-Kahler approach to vector internal degrees of freedom and to charges of either spinors or vectors and tenzors and point out how at all spinors can appear in both approaches.
