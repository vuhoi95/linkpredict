Title: Quantization and Scattering in the IIB SL(2,Z) Covariant Superstring
Authors: Gordon Chalmers and Koenraad Schalm
Abstract: We rewrite the SL(2,Z) covariant worldsheet action for the IIB string proposed by Townsend in a Polyakov form. In a flat background the formalism yields separate (p,q) sectors. In each one the action is that of the IIB string action with the string slope parameter \alp\pr replaced by its SL(2,Z) analogue \alp_{pq}\pr. SL(2,Z) invariant graviton scattering amplitudes are obtained from those of the fundamental (1,0) string by summing over the different sectors. The tree-level four-graviton amplitude in this formalism differs from a previously conjectured non-perturbative form; both yield the same expansion in order \alpha\pr^3.
