Authors: Sunggeun Lee and Chanyong Park and Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: We study the cosmology of the Brans-Dicke(BD) theory coupled to perfect fluid type matter. In our previous works, the case where matter is coming from the Ramond-Ramond sector of the string theory was studied. Here, we study the case where matter is coming from the NS-NS sector. Exact solutions are found and the cosmology is classified according to the values of $\gamma$, the parameter of the equation of state and $\omega$, Brans-Dicke parameter. We find taht, in string frame, there are solutions without singularity for some ranges of $\gamma$ and $\omega$. In Einstein frame, however, all solutions are singular.
