Title: Supercharges, Killing Spinors and Intersecting Gauge Five-branes
Authors: E. Lima and H. Lu and B. A. Ovrut and C. N. Pope
Abstract: We obtain new solutions where a string and a pp-wave lie in the common worldvolume directions of the non-standard intersection of two gauge 5-branes in the heterotic string. The two 5-branes are supported by independent SU(2) Yang-Mills instantons in their respective (non-overlapping) transverse spaces. We present a detailed study of the unbroken supersymmetry, focusing especially on a comparison between a direct construction of Killing spinors and a counting of zero eigenvalues in the annticommutator of supercharges. The results are in agreement with some previous arguments, to the effect that additional zero eigenvalues resulting from a ``fine-tuning'' between positive-energy and negative-energy contributions from different components in an intersection are spurious, and should not be taken as an indication of supersymmetry enhancements. These observations have a general applicability that goes beyond the specific example we study in this paper.
