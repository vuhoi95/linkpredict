Title: Conformal boundary conditions and three-dimensional topological field  theory
Authors: G. Felder and J. Fr"ohlich and J. Fuchs and C. Schweigert
Abstract: We present a general construction of all correlation functions of a two-dimensional rational conformal field theory, for an arbitrary number of bulk and boundary fields and arbitrary topologies. The correlators are expressed in terms of Wilson graphs in a certain three-manifold, the connecting manifold. The amplitudes constructed this way can be shown to be modular invariant and to obey the correct factorization rules.
