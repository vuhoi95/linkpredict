Title: Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau equation in Riemannian space-times
Authors: J. T. Lunardi and B. M. Pimentel and R. G. Teixeira
Abstract: In this work we analyze the generalization of Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau equation to the case of Riemannian space-times and show that the usual results for Klein-Gordon and Proca equations in Riemannian space-times can be fully recovered when one selects, respectively, the spin 0 and 1 sectors of Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau theory.
