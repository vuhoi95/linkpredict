Title: A Monopole-Antimonopole Solution of the SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs Model
Authors: B. Kleihaus and Jutta Kunz
Abstract: As shown by Taubes, in the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield limit the SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs model possesses smooth finite energy solutions, which do not satisfy the first order Bogomol'nyi equations. We construct numerically such a non-Bogomol'nyi solution, corresponding to a monopole-antimonopole pair, and extend the construction to finite Higgs potential.
