Title: Charges from Dressed Matter: Construction
Authors: Emili Bagan and Martin Lavelle and David McMullan
Abstract: There is a widespread belief in particle physics that there is no relativistic description of a charged particle. This is claimed to be due to persistent, long range interactions which distort the in and out going plane waves and generate infra-red divergences. In this paper we will show that this is not the case in QED. We construct locally gauge invariant charged fields which do create in and out Fock states. In a companion paper we demonstrate that the Green's functions of these fields have a good pole structure describing particle propagation.
