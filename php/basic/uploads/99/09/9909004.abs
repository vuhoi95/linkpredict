Title: Teleparallel Equivalent of the Kaluza-Klein Theory
Authors: V. C. de Andrade and L. C. T. Guillen and J. G. Pereira
Abstract: Relying upon the equivalence between a gauge theory for the translation group and general relativity, a teleparallel version of the original Kaluza-Klein theory is developed. In this model, only the internal space (fiber) turns out to be five dimensional, spacetime being kept always four dimensional. A five-dimensional translational gauge theory is obtained which unifies, in the sense of Kaluza-Klein theories, gravitational and electromagnetic interactions.
