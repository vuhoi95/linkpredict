Title: D-branes on Fourfolds with Discrete Torsion
Authors: Subir Mukhopadhyay and Koushik Ray
Abstract: We study D1-branes on the fourfold $\C^4/(\Z_2\times\Z_2\times\Z_2)$, in the presence of discrete torsion. Discrete torsion is incorporated in the gauge theory of the D1-branes by considering a projective representation of the finite group $\Z_2\times\Z_2\times\Z_2$. The corresponding orbifold is then deformed by perturbing the F-flatness condition of the gauge theory. The moduli space of the resulting gauge theory retains a stable singularity of codimension three.
