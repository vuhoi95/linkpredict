Title: Breaking Parity Symmetry Using Extra Dimensions
Authors: R. N. Mohapatra and A. PÃ©rez-Lorenzana
Abstract: We present a new way to break parity symmetry in left-right symmetric models using boundary conditions on the fields residing in the fifth dimension. We also discuss the connection between the limits on the size of extra dimensions and the scale of right handed symmetry breaking obtained from the analysis of neutrinoless double beta decay in the case where the righthanded gauge symmetry is in the bulk.
