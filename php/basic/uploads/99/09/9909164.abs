Title: More D-branes in the Nappi-Witten background
Authors: JM Figueroa-O'Farrill and S Stanciu
Abstract: We re-examine the problem of determining the possible D-branes in the Nappi-Witten background. In addition to the known branes, we find that there are also D-instantons, flat euclidean D-strings and curved D-membranes admitting parallel spinors, all of which can be interpreted as (twisted) conjugacy classes in the Nappi-Witten group.
