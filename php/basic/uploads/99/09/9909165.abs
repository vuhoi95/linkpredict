Title: Effective Couplings of Dynamical Nambu-Goldstone Bosons with Elementary  Fermions
Authors: T. Matsuki and M. Shiotani
Abstract: Assuming dynamical spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry for massless gauge theory without scalar fields, we find a method how to construct an effective action of the dynamical Nambu-Goldstone bosons and elemetary fermions by using auxiliary fields. Here dynamical particles are asssumed to be composed of elementary fermions. Various quantities including decay constants are calculated from this effective action.
