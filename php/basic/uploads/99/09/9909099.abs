Abstract: Numerical data for the SU(2) confining string in the maximal abelian projection are analysed. The distribution of the electric flux and monopole currents are perfectly described by the classical equations of motion for the dual Abelian Higgs model. The mass of the vector boson is equal to the mass of the monopole (Higgs particle) within numerical errors. The classical energy per unit length of the Abrikosov vortex reproduces 94% of the full non-Abelian string tension.
