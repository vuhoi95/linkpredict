Title: Topological gauge invariant variables in QCD
Authors: D. Blaschke and V. N. Pervushin and G. Roepke
Abstract: We suggest that proper variables for the description of non-Abelian theories are those gauge invariant ones which keep the invariance of the winding number functional with respect to topologically nontrivial (large) gauge transformations. We present a model for these variables using the zero mode of the Gauss law constraint and investigate their physical consequences for hadron spectrum and confinement on the level of the generating functional for two-color QCD.
