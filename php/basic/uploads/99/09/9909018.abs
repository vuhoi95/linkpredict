Title: Topological properties of QCD with two dynamical fermions
Authors: B. Alles and M. D'Elia and A. Di Giacomo
Abstract: We investigate the topological susceptibility of the QCD vacuum with two flavours of dynamical staggered fermions on the lattice both at zero and finite temperature. At zero temperature we study the dependence of the signal on the fermion mass and at finite temperature we analyze the behaviour across the phase transition.
