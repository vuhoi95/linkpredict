Title: Darboux Transformation for Supersymmetric KP Hierarchies
Authors: Q. P. Liu and Manuel Manas
Abstract: We construct Darboux transformations for the super-symmetric KP hierarchies of Manin--Radul and Jacobian types. We also consider the binary Darboux transformation for the hierarchies. The iterations of both type of Darboux transformations are briefly discussed.
