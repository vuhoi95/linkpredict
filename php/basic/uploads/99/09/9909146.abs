Title: Time Evolution of Spin Waves
Authors: M Moser and A Prets and W L Spitzer
Abstract: A rigorous derivation of macroscopic spin-wave equations is demonstrated. We introduce a macroscopic mean-field limit and derive the so-called Landau-Lifshitz equations for spin waves. We first discuss the ferromagnetic Heisenberg model at T=0 and finally extend our analysis to general spin hamiltonians for the same class of ferromagnetic ground states.
