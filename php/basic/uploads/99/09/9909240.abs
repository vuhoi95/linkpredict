Title: Monte Carlo Hamiltonian - From Statistical Physics to Quantum Theory
Authors: Xiang-Qian Luo and C. Huang and J. Jiang and H. Jirari and H. Kroger and K. Moriarty
Abstract: Monte Carlo techniques have been widely employed in statistical physics as well as in quantum theory in the Lagrangian formulation. However, in some areas of application to quantum theories computational progress has been slow. Here we present a recently developed approach: the Monte Carlo Hamiltonian method, designed to overcome the difficulties of the conventional approach.
