Title: Currents and Moduli in the (4,0) theory
Authors: Finn Larsen and Emil Martinec
Abstract: We consider black strings in five dimensions and their description as a (4,0) CFT. The CFT moduli space is described explicitly, including its subtle global structure. BPS conditions and global symmetries determine the spectrum of charged excitations, leading to an entropy formula for near-extreme black holes in four dimensions with arbitrary charge vector. In the BPS limit, this formula reduces to the quartic E(7,7) invariant. The prospects for a description of the (4,0) theory as a solvable CFT are explored.
