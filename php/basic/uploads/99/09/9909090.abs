Title: Quadrupole interaction of relativistic quantum particle with external  fields
Authors: A. A. Pomeransky and R. A. Sen'kov
Abstract: We consider the motion of a spinning relativistic particle with an arbitrary value of spin in external electromagnetic and gravitational fields, to first order in the external field. We use the noncovariant description of spin. An explicit expression is obtained for the interaction of second order in spin. The value of the quadrupole moment is found for which this interaction decreases when the energy grows.
