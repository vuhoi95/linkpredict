Title: Gravitational Stability and Renormalization-Group Flow
Authors: Kostas Skenderis and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: First-order `Bogomol'nyi' equations are found for dilaton domain walls of D-dimensional gravity with the general dilaton potential admitting a stable anti-de Sitter vacuum. Implications for renormalization group flow in the holographically dual field theory are discussed.
