Title: The symmetries of the Manton superconductivity model
Authors: M. Hassaïne and P. A. Horváthy
Abstract: The symmetries and conserved quantities of Manton's modified superconductivity model with non-relativistic Maxwell-Chern-Simons dynamics (also related to the Quantized Hall Effect) are obtained in the ``Kaluza-Klein type'' framework of Duval et al.
