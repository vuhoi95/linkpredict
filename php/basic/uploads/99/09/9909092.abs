Title: Null Strings and Membranes in Demianski-Newman Background
Authors: P. Bozhilov and B. Dimitrov
Abstract: We consider null bosonic p-branes moving in curved space-times. Some exact solutions of the classical equations of motion and of the constraints for the null string and the null membrane in Demianski-Newman background are found.
