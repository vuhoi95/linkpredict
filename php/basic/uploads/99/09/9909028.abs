Title: Orientifold Points in M Theory
Authors: A. Hanany and B. Kol and A. Rajaraman
Abstract: We identify the lift to M theory of the four types of orientifold points, and show that they involve a chiral fermion on an orbifold fixed circle. From this lift, we compute the number of normalizable ground states for the SO(N) and $Sp(N)$ supersymmetric quantum mechanics with sixteen supercharges. The results agree with known results obtained by the mass deformation method. The mass of the orientifold is identified with the Casimir energy.
