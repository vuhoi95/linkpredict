Title: New fermion mass textures from anomalous U(1) symmetries with baryon and  lepton number conservation
Authors: G. K. Leontaris and J. Rizos
Abstract: In this paper, we present solutions to the fermion mass hierarchy problem in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard theory augmented by an anomalous family-dependent U(1)_X symmetry. The latter is spontaneously broken by non-zero vevs of a pair of singlet fields whose magnitude is determined through the D- and F-flatness conditions of the superpotential. We derive the general solutions to the anomaly cancellation conditions and show that they allow numerous choices for the U(1)_X fermion charges which give several fermion mass textures in agreement with the observed fermion mass hierarchy and mixing. Solutions with U(1)_X fermion charge assignments are found which forbid or substantially suppress the dangerous baryon and lepton number violating operators and the lepton-higgs mixing coupling while a higgs mixing mass (\mu-term) can be fixed at the electroweak level. We give a general classification of the fermion mass textures with respect to the sum of the doublet-higgs U(1)_X-charges and show that suppression of dimension-five operators naturally occurs for various charge assignments. We work out cases which retain a quartic term providing the left-handed neutrinos with Majorana masses in the absence of right-handed neutrino components and consistent with the experimental bounds. Although there exist solutions which naturally combine all the above features with rather natural U(1)_X charges, the suppression of the \mu-term occurs for particular assignments.
