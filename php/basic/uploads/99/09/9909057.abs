Title: Modified initial state for perturbative QCD
Authors: Marcos Rigol and Alejandro Cabo
Abstract: A particular initial state for the construction of the perturbative expansion of QCD is investigated. It is formed as a coherent superposition of zero momentum gluon pairs and shows Lorentz as well as global SU(3) symmetries. It follows that the gluon and ghost propagators determined by it, coincides with the ones used in an alternative of the usual perturbation theory proposed in a previous work. Therefore, the ability of such a procedure of producing a finite gluon condensation parameter already in the first orders of perturbation theory is naturally explained. It also follows that this state satisfies the physicality condition of the BRST procedure in its Kugo and Ojima formulation. The BRST quantization is done for the value alpha=1 of the gauge parameter where the procedure is greatly simplified. Therefore, after assuming that the adiabatic connection of the interaction does not take out the state from the interacting physical space, the predictions of the perturbation expansion, at the value alpha=1, for the physical quantities should have meaning. The validity of this conclusion solves the gauge dependence indeterminacy remained in the proposed perturbation expansion.
