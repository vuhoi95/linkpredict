Abstract: The spin-1 Uimin-Lai-Sutherland (ULS) isotropic chain model is expressed in terms of fermions and the equivalence of the fermionic representation to the supersymmetric t-J model is established directly at the level of Hamiltonians.The spin-S ULS model is fermionized and the Hamiltonian of the corresponding generalisation of the t-J model is written down.
