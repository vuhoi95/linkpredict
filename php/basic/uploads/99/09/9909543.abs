Title: Interaction of Magnetic Monopoles and Domain Walls
Authors: Levon Pogosian and Tanmay Vachaspati
Abstract: We study the interaction of magnetic monopoles and domain walls in a model with SU(5)\times Z_2 symmetry by numerically evolving the field equations. We find that the monopoles unwind and dissipate their magnetic energy on collision with domain walls within which the full SU(5) symmetry is restored.
