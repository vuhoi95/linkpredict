Title: On the BFFT quantization of first order systems
Authors: Ricardo Amorim and Ronaldo Thibes
Abstract: By using the field-antifield formalism, we show that the method of Batalin, Fradkin, Fradkina and Tyutin to convert Hamiltonian systems submitted to second class constraints introduces compensating fields which do not belong to the BRST cohomology at ghost number one. This assures that the gauge symmetries which arise from the BFFT procedure are not obstructed at quantum level. An example where massive electrodynamics is coupled to chiral fermions is considered. We solve the quantum master equation for the model and show that the respective counterterm has a decisive role in extracting anomalous expectation values associated with the divergence of the Noether chiral current.
