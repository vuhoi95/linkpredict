Title: Geometry and N=2 Exceptional Gauge Theories
Authors: Jiro Hashiba and Seiji Terashima
Abstract: We find the Seiberg-Witten geometry for four dimensional N=2 supersymmetric E_6 gauge theories with massless fundamental hypermultiplets, by geometrically embedding them in type II string theories compactified on Calabi-Yau threefolds. The resulting geometry completely agrees with that of recent works, which are based on the technique of N=1 confining phase superpotentials. We also derive the Seiberg-Witten geometry for E_7 gauge theories with massive fundamental hypermultiplets.
