Title: Branched Polymers Re-Revisited
Authors: J. Ambjorn and B. Durhuus and T. Jonsson
Abstract: We point out some misconceptions in a recent paper by H. Aoki et al. [hep-th/9909060]. In particular, the claim that the two-point function of branched polymers behaves as 1/p^4 instead of 1/p^2 for large p is mistaken and in no way a precondition for the Hausdorff dimension of branched polymers having the well known value four.
