Title: Soliton Solutions of Integrable Hierarchies and Coulomb Plasmas
Authors: Igor Loutsenko and Vyacheslav Spiridonov
Abstract: Some direct relations between soliton solutions of integrable hierarchies and thermodynamical quantities of the Coulomb plasmas on the plane are revealed. We find that certain soliton solutions of the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) and B-type KP (BKP) hierarchies describe two-dimensional one or two component plasmas at special boundary conditions and fixed temperatures. It is shown that different reductions of integrable hierarchies describe one (two) component plasmas or dipole gases on one-dimensional submanifolds embedded in the two-dimensional space. We demonstrate application of the methods of soliton theory to statistical mechanics of such systems.
