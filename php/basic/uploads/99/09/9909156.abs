Title: Confining Properties of Abelian-Projected Theories and Field Strength  Correlators
Authors: Dmitri Antonov and Dietmar Ebert
Abstract: We review the string representations of Abelian-projected SU(2)- and SU(3)-gauge theories and their application to the evaluation of bilocal field strength correlators. The large distance asymptotic behaviours of the latter ones are shown to be in agreement with the Stochastic Vacuum Model of QCD and existing lattice data.
