Title: Logarithmic Operators Fold D branes into AdS_3
Authors: John Ellis and N. E. Mavromatos and Elizabeth Winstanley
Abstract: We use logarithmic conformal field theory techniques to describe recoil effects in the scattering of two Dirichlet branes in D dimensions. In the particular case that a D1 brane strikes a D3 brane perpendicularly, thereby folding it, we find that the recoil space-time is maximally symmetric, with AdS_3 x E_{D-3} geometry. We comment on the possible applications of this result to the study of transitions between different background metrics.
