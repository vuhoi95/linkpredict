Title: Comments on the Moduli Dynamics of 1/4 BPS Dyons
Authors: Dongsu Bak and Kimyeong Lee
Abstract: We rederive the nonrelativistic Lagrangian for the low energy dynamics of 1/4 BPS dyons by considering the time dependent fluctuations around classical 1/4 BPS configurations. The relevant fluctuations are the zero modes of the underlying 1/2 BPS monopoles.
