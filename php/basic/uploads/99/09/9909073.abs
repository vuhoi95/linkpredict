Title: Supersymmetric spin operators
Authors: P. Coleman and C. Pepin and A. M. Tsvelik
Abstract: We develop a supersymmetric representation of spin operators which unifies the Schwinger and Abrikosov representations of SU(N) spin operators, allowing a second-quantized treatment of representations of the SU(N) group with both symmetric and antisymmetric character. By applying this to the SU(N) Kondo model, we show that it is possible to develop a controlled treatment of both Magnetism and the Kondo effect within a single large N expansion.
