Title: Branched Polymer Revisited
Authors: Hajime Aoki and Satoshi Iso and Hikaru Kawai and Yoshihisa Kitazawa
Abstract: We show that correlation functions for branched polymers correspond to those for $\phi^3$ theory with a single mass insertion, not those for the $\phi^3$ theory themselves, as has been widely believed. In particular, the two-point function behaves as 1/p^4, not as 1/p^2. This behavior is consistent with the fact that the Hausdorff dimension of the branched polymer is four.
