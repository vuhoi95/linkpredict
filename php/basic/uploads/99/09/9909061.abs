Title: Statistical Entropy of BTZ Black Hole in Higher Curvature Gravity
Authors: Hiromi Saida and Jiro Soda
Abstract: For the BTZ black hole in the Einstein gravity, a statistical entropy has been calculated to be equal to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. In this paper, the statistical entropy of the BTZ black hole in the higher curvature gravity is calculated and shown to be equal to the one derived by using the Noether charge method. This suggests that the equivalence of the geometrical and statistical entropies of the black hole is retained in the general diffeomorphism invariant theories of gravity. A relation between the cosmic censorship conjecture and the unitarity of the conformal field theory on the boundary of AdS is also discussed.
