Title: Dyonic Non-Abelian Black Holes
Authors: Y. Brihaye and B. Hartmann and J. Kunz and N. Tell
Abstract: We study static spherically symmetric dyonic black holes in Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory. As for the magnetic non-abelian black holes, the domain of existence of the dyonic non-abelian black holes is limited with respect to the horizon radius and the dimensionless coupling constant $\alpha$, which is proportional to the ratio of vector meson mass and Planck mass. At a certain critical value of this coupling constant, $\hat \alpha$, the maximal horizon radius is attained. We derive analytically a relation between $\hat \alpha$ and the charge of the black hole solutions and confirm this relation numerically. Besides the fundamental dyonic non-abelian black holes, we study radially excited dyonic non-abelian black holes and globally regular gravitating dyons.
