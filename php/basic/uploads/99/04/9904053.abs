Title: Relativistic Partial Wave Analysis Using the Velocity Basis of the  Poincare Group
Authors: A. Bohm and H. Kaldass
Abstract: The velocity basis of the Poincare group is used in the direct product space of two irreducible unitary representations of the Poincare group. The velocity basis with total angular momentum j will be used for the definition of relativistic Gamow vectors.
