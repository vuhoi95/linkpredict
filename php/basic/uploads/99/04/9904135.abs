Title: Massive-Scalar Absorption by Extremal p-branes
Authors: M. Cvetic and H and Lu and J. F. Vazquez-Poritz
Abstract: We study the absorption probability of minimally-coupled massive scalars by extremal p-branes. In particular, we find that the massive scalar wave equation under the self-dual string background has the same form as the massless scalar wave equation under the dyonic string background. Thus it can be cast into the form of a modified Mathieu equation and solved exactly. Another example that we can solve exactly is that of the D=4 two-charge black hole with equal charges, for which we obtain the closed-form absorption probability. We also obtain the leading-order absorption probabilities for D3-, M2- and M5-branes.
