Title: K3-fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds I, the twist map
Authors: Bruce Hunt and Rolf Schimmrigk
Abstract: A construction of Calabi-Yaus as quotients of products of lower-dimensional spaces in the context of weighted hypersurfaces is discussed, including desingularisation. The construction leads to Calabi-Yaus which have a fiber structure, in particular one case has K3 surfaces as fibers. These Calabi-Yaus are of some interest in connection with Type II -heterotic string dualities in dimension 4. A section at the end of the paper summarises this for the non-expert mathematician.
