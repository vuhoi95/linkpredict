Title: Anomaly induced effective actions and Hawking radiation
Authors: Roberto Balbinot and Alessandro Fabbri and Ilya Shapiro
Abstract: The quantum stress tensor in the Unruh state for a conformal scalar propagating in a 4D Schwarzschild black hole spacetime is reconstructed in its leading behaviour at infinity and near the horizon by means of an effective action derived by functionally integrating the trace anomaly.
