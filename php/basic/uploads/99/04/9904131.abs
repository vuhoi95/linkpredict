Title: Brane Constructions, Fractional Branes and Anti-deSitter Domain Walls
Authors: Keshav Dasgupta and Sunil Mukhi
Abstract: Compactifications of type IIB string theory on AdS5 x X5, where X5 is an Einstein space, can have one-fourth or half maximal supersymmetry for certain choices of X5. Some of these theories admit exotic domain walls arising from 5-branes wrapping 2-cycles in X5. We explore the relationship among these domain walls, fractional branes and branes stretched on intervals. World-volume fluxes in the wrapped branes play an important role in the analysis. We draw some parallels between the AdS background with exotic domain walls and N=1 supersymmetric MQCD, and identify other extended objects on the AdS side in the dual brane construction. The process of brane creation is used to give an alternate derivation of the relationship between fractional branes and branes on intervals.
