Title: AdS/CFT dualities involving large 2d N=4 superconformal symmetry
Authors: Jan de Boer and Andrea Pasquinucci and Kostas Skenderis
Abstract: We study the duality between string theory on AdS_3 X S^3 X S^3 and two-dimensional conformal theories with large N=4 superconformal algebra A_gamma. We discuss configurations of intersecting branes which give rise to such near-horizon geometries. We compute the Kaluza-Klein spectrum and propose that the boundary superconformal theory can be described by a sigma model on a suitable symmetric product space with a particular choice of anti-symmetric two-form.
