Title: Non-threshold (F, Dp) bound states
Authors: J. X. Lu and Shibaji Roy
Abstract: In the previous paper [hep-th/9904112], we argued that there exist BPS bound states of Dp branes carrying certain units of quantized constant electric field for every $p$ (with $1 \le p \le 8$). Each of these bound states preserves one half of the spacetime supersymmetries. In this paper, we construct these bound state configurations explicitly for $2 \le p \le 7$ from Schwarz's $(m,n)$-string or (F, D1) bound state in type IIB string theory by T-dualities along the transverse directions. We calculate the charge per $(2\pi)^{p -1} \alpha'^{(p - 1)/2}$ of $(p -1)$-dimensional area for F-strings in (F, Dp) and the tension for each of these bound states. The results agree precisely with those obtained previously from the worldvolume study. We study the decoupling limit for the (F, D3) bound state and find that Maldacena's $AdS_5/CFT_4$ correspondence may hold true even with respect to thisbound state but now with an effective string coupling rather than the usual string coupling. This coupling is quantized and can be independent of the usual string coupling in certain limit.
