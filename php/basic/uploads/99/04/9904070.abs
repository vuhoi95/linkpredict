Title: Quantum Corrections to the Thermodynamics of Charged 2-D Black Holes
Authors: A. J. M. Medved and G. Kunstatter
Abstract: We consider one-loop quantum corrections to the thermodynamics of a black hole in generic 2-dimensional dilaton gravity. The classical action is the most general diffeomorphism invariant action in 1+1 space-time dimensions that contains a metric, dilaton, and Abelian gauge field, and having at most second derivatives of the fields. Quantum corrections are introduced by considering the effect of matter fields conformally coupled to the metric and non-minimally coupled to the dilaton. Back reaction of the matter fields (via non-vanishing trace conformal anomaly) leads to quantum corrections to the black hole geometry. Quantum corrections also lead to modifications in the gravitational action and hence in expressions for thermodynamic quantities. One-loop corrections to both geometry and thermodynamics (energy, entropy) are calculated for the generic dilaton theory. This formalism is applied to a charged black hole in spherically symmetric gravity and to a rotating BTZ black hole.
