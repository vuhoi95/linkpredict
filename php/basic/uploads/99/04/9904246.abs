Title: Testing nucleation theory in two dimensions
Authors: Alessandro Strumia and Nikolaos Tetradis
Abstract: We calculate bubble-nucleation rates for (2+1)-dimensional scalar theories at high temperature. Our approach is based on the notion of a real coarse-grained potential. The region of applicability of our method is determined through internal consistency criteria. We compare our results with data from lattice simulations. Good agreement is observed when the renormalized action of the simulated theory is known.
