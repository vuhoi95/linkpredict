Title: Mersenne Primes, Polygonal Anomalies and String Theory Classification
Authors: Paul H. Frampton and Thomas W. Kephart
Abstract: It is pointed out that the Mersenne primes $M_p=(2^p-1)$ and associated perfect numbers ${\cal M}_p=2^{p-1}M_p$ play a significant role in string theory; this observation may suggest a classification of consistent string theories.
