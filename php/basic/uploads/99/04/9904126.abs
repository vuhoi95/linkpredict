Title: Elliptic Genera and Applications to Mirror Symmetry
Authors: Lev A. Borisov and Anatoly Libgober
Abstract: The paper contains a proof that elliptic genus of a Calabi-Yau manifold is a Jacobi form, finds in which dimensions the elliptic genus is determined by the Hodge numbers and shows that elliptic genera of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface in a toric variety and its mirror coincide up to sign. The proof of the mirror property is based on the extension of elliptic genus to Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties with Gorenstein singularities.
