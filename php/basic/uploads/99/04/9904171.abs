Abstract: In this work we examine generalized Connes-Lott models on the two-sphere. The Hilbert space of the continuum spectral triple is taken as the space of sections of a twisted spinor bundle, allowing for nontrivial topological structure (magnetic monopoles). The finitely generated projective module over the full algebra is also taken as topologically non-trivial, which is possible over $S^2$. We also construct a real spectral triple enlarging this Hilbert space to include "particle" and "anti-particle" fields.
