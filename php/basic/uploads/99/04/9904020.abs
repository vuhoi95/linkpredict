Title: Solitons on the Supermembrane
Authors: E. Bergshoeff and P. K. Townsend
Abstract: Energy bounds are derived for planar and compactified M2-branes in a hyper-K\"ahler background. These bounds are saturated, respectively, by lump and Q-kink solitons, which are shown to preserve a half of the worldvolume supersymmetry. The Q-kinks have a dual IIB interpretation as strings that migrate between fivebranes.
