Title: Real Structures in Clifford Algebras and Majorana Conditions in Any  Space-time
Authors: M. A. De Andrade and F. Toppan
Abstract: Clifford algebras and Majorana conditions are analyzed in any spacetime. An index labeling inequivalent $\Gamma$-structures up to orthogonal conjugations is introduced. Inequivalent charge-operators in even-dimensions, invariant under Wick rotations, are considered. The hermiticity condition on free-spinors lagrangians is presented. The constraints put by the Majorana condition on the free-spinors dynamics are analyzed. Tables specifying which spacetimes admit lagrangians with non-vanishing kinetic, massive or pseudomassive terms (for both charge-operators in even dimensions) are given. The admissible free lagrangians for free Majorana-Weyl spinors are fully classified.
