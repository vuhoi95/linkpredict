Title: Non-Supersymmetric Type I Strings with Zero Vacuum Energy
Authors: C. Angelantonj and I. Antoniadis and K. Foerger
Abstract: We study open descendants of non-supersymmetric type IIB asymmetric (freely acting) orbifolds with zero cosmological constant. A generic feature of these models is that supersymmetry remains unbroken on the brane at all mass levels, while it is broken in the bulk in a way that preserves Fermi-Bose degeneracy in both the massless and massive (closed string) spectrum. This property remains valid in the heterotic dual of the type II model but only for the massless excitations. A possible application of these constructions concerns scenarios of low-energy supersymmetry breaking with large dimensions.
