Title: Perturbations in k-inflation
Authors: Jaume Garriga and V. F. Mukhanov
Abstract: We extend the theory of cosmological perturbations to the case when the ``matter'' Lagrangian is an arbitrary function of the scalar field and its first derivatives. In particular, this extension provides a unified description of known cases such as the usual scalar field and the hydrodynamical perfect fluid. In addition, it applies to the recently proposed k-inflation, which is driven by non-minimal kinetic terms in the Lagrangian. The spectrum of quantum fluctuations for slow-roll and power law k-inflation is calculated. We find, for instance, that the usual ``consistency relation'' between the tensor spectral index and the relative amplitude of scalar and tensor perturbations is modified. Thus, at least in principle, k-inflation is phenomenologically distinguishable from standard inflation.
