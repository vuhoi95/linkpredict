Title: Worldvolume Uncertainty Relations for D-Branes
Authors: Chong-Sun Chu and Pei-Ming Ho and Yeong-Chuan Kao
Abstract: By quantizing an open string ending on a D-brane in a nontrivial supergravity background, we argue that there is a new kind of uncertainty relation on a D-brane worldvolume. Furthermore, we fix the form of the uncertainty relations and their dependence on the string coupling constant by requiring them to be consistent with various string theory and M theory dualities. In this way we find a web of uncertainties of spacetime for all kinds of brane probes, including fundamental strings, D-branes of all dimensions as well as M theory membranes and fivebranes.
