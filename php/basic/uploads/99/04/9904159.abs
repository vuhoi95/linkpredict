Title: Pauli's Term and Fractional Spin
Authors: F. A. S. Nobre and C. A. S. Almeida
Abstract: In this work we consider an Abelian Chern-Simons-Higgs model coupled non-minimally to matter fields. This coupling is implemented by means of a Pauli-type coupling. We show that the Pauli term is sufficient to gives rise to fractional spin.
