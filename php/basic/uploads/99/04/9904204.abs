Title: Finiteness of 2D Topological BF-Theory with Matter Coupling
Authors: R. Leitgeb and M. Schweda and H. Zerrouki
Abstract: We study the ultraviolet and the infrared behavior of 2D topological BF-Theory coupled to vector and scalar fields. This model is equivalent to 2D gravity coupled to topological matter. Using techniques of the algebraic renormalization program we show that this model is anomaly free and ultraviolet as well as infrared finite at all orders of perturbation theory.
