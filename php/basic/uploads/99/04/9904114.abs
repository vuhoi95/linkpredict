Title: Stability of vector bundles from F-theory
Authors: P. Berglund and P. Mayr
Abstract: We use a recently proposed formulation of stable holomorphic vector bundles $V$ on elliptically fibered Calabi--Yau n-fold $Z_n$ in terms of toric geometry to describe stability conditions on $V$. Using the toric map $f: W_{n+1} \to (V,Z_n)$ that identifies dual pairs of F-theory/heterotic duality we show how stability can be related to the existence of holomorphic sections of a certain line bundle that is part of the toric construction.
