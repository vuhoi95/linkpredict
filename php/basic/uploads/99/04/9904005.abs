Title: Deviations from the Area Law for Supersymmetric Black Holes
Authors: Gabriel Lopes Cardoso and Bernard de Wit and Thomas Mohaupt
Abstract: We review modifications of the Bekenstein-Hawking area law for black hole entropy in the presence of higher-derivative interactions. In four-dimensional N=2 compactifications of string theory or M-theory these modifications are crucial for finding agreement between the macroscopic entropy obtained from supergravity and the microscopic entropy obtained by counting states in string or M-theory. Our discussion is based on the effective Wilsonian action, which in the context of N=2 supersymmetric theories is defined in terms of holomorphic quantities. At the end we briefly indicate how to incorporate non-holomorphic corrections.
