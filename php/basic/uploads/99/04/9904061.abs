Title: Discontinuous behavior of perturbative Yang-Mills theories in the limit  of dimensions D->2
Authors: A. Bassetto and R. Begliuomini and G. Nardelli
Abstract: We calculate in dimensions $D=2+\epsilon$ and in light-cone gauge (LCG) the perturbative ${\cal O}(g^4)$ contribution to a rectangular Wilson loop in the (t,x)-plane coming from diagrams with a self-energy correction in the vector propagator. In the limit $\epsilon \to 0$ the result is finite, in spite of the vanishing of the triple vector vertex in LCG, and provides the expected agreement with the analogous calculation in Feynman gauge.
