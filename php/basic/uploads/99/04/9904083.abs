Title: Conformal Invariance of the D-Particle Effective Action
Authors: Kiyoshi Hayasaka and Ryuichi Nakayama
Abstract: It is shown that the effective theory of D-particles has conformal symmetry with field-dependent parameters. This is a consequence of the supersymmetry. The string coupling constant is not transformed in contrast with the recent proposal of generalized conformal symmtery by Jevicki et al. This conformal symmetry can also be generalized to other Dp-brane systems.
