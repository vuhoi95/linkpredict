Title: Nonperturbative Vertices in Supersymmetric Quantum Electrodynamics
Authors: M. L. Walker and C. J. Burden
Abstract: We derive the complete set of supersymmetric Ward identities involving only two- and three- point proper vertices in supersymmetric QED. We also present the most general form of the proper vertices consistent with both the supersymmetric and U(1) gauge Ward identities. These vertices are the supersymmetric equivalent of the non supersymmetric Ball-Chiu vertices.
