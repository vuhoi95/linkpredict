Authors: B. Kleihaus and D. H. Tchrakian and F. Zimmerschied
Abstract: The Abelian Higgs model and the Georgi-Glashow model in 2 and 3 Euclidean dimensions respectively, support both finite size instantons and sphalerons. The instantons are the familiar Nielsen-Oleson vortices and the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole solutions respectively. We have constructed the sphaleron solutions and calculated the Chern-Simons charges N_cs for sphalerons of both models and have constructed two types of noncontractible loops between topologically distinct vacuua. In the 3 dimensional model, the sphaleron and the vacuua have zero magnetic and electric flux while the configurations on the loops have non vanishing magnetic flux.
