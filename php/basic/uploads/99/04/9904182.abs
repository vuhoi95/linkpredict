Abstract: We derive the power law decay, and asymptotic form, of SU(2) x Spin(d) invariant wave-functions which are zero-modes of all s_d=2(d-1) supercharges of reduced (d+1)-dimensional supersymmetric SU(2) Yang Mills theory, resp. of the SU(2)-matrix model related to supermembranes in d+2 dimensions.
