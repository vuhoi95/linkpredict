Title: Complete Classification of the String-like Solutions of the Gravitating  Abelian Higgs Model
Authors: M. Christensen and A. L. Larsen and Y. Verbin
Abstract: The static cylindrically symmetric solutions of the gravitating Abelian Higgs model form a two parameter family. In this paper we give a complete classification of the string-like solutions of this system. We show that the parameter plane is composed of two different regions with the following characteristics: One region contains the standard asymptotically conic cosmic string solutions together with a second kind of solutions with Melvin-like asymptotic behavior. The other region contains two types of solutions with bounded radial extension. The border between the two regions is the curve of maximal angular deficit of $2\pi$.
