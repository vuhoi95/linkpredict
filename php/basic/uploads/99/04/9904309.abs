Title: Generalized Assisted Inflation
Authors: E. J. Copeland and Anupam Mazumdar and N. J. Nunes
Abstract: We obtain a new class of exact cosmological solutions for multi-scalar fields with exponential potentials. We generalize the assisted inflation solutions previously obtained, and demonstrate how they are modified when there exist cross-couplings between the fields, such as occur in supergravity inspired cosmological models.
