Title: A remark on collisions of domain walls in a supersymmetric model
Authors: V. A. Gani and A. E. Kudryavtsev
Abstract: The process of collision of two parallel domain walls in a supersymmetric model is studied both in effective Lagrangian approximation and by numerical solving of the exact classical field problem. For small initial velocities we find that the walls interaction looks like elastic reflection with some delay. It is also shown that in such approximation internal parameter of the wall may be considered as a time-dependent dynamical variable.
