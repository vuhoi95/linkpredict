Title: Type IIB string theory on AdS_5 X T^{nn'}
Authors: Dileep P. Jatkar and S. Randjbar-Daemi
Abstract: We study \kk spectrum of type IIB string theory compactified on $AdS_5 \times T^{nn'}$ in the context of $AdS/CFT$ correspondence. We examine some of the modes of the complexified 2 form potential as an example and show that for the states at the bottom of the \kk tower the corresponding $d=4$ boundary field operators have rational conformal dimensions. The masses of some of the fermionic modes in the bottom of each tower as functions of the $R$ charge in the boundary conformal theory are also rational. Furthermore the modes in the bottom of the towers originating from $q$ forms on $T^{11}$ can be put in correspondence with the BRS cohomology classes of the $c=1$ non critical string theory with ghost number $q$. However, a more detailed investigation is called for, to clarify further the relation of this supergravity background with the $c=1$ strings.
