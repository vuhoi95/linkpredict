Title: A Regularization Scheme for the AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: W. Mueck and K. S. Viswanathan
Abstract: The prescription of the AdS/CFT correspondence is refined by using a regularization procedure, which makes is possible to calculate the divergent local terms in the CFT two-point function. We present the procedure for the example of the scalar field.
