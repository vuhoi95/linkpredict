Title: Theory of Low Temperature Electron Spin Resonance in Half-integer Spin  Antiferromagnetic Chains
Authors: Masaki Oshikawa and Ian Affleck
Abstract: A theory of low temperature (T) electron spin resonance (ESR) in half-integer spin antiferromagnetic chains is developed using field theory methods and avoiding previous approximations. It is compared to experiments on Cu benzoate. Power laws are predicted for the line-width broadening due to various types of anisotropy. At T -> 0, zero width absorption peaks occur in some cases. The second ESR peak in Cu benzoate, observed at T<.76K, is argued not to indicate Neel order as previously claimed, but to correspond to a sine-Gordon "breather" excitation.
