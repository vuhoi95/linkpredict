Title: QCD effective coupling constant and effective quark mass given in a  mass-dependent renormalization
Authors: Jun-Chen Su and Lian-You Shan and Ying-Hui Cao
Abstract: The QCD one-loop renormalization is restudied in a mass-dependent subtraction scheme in which the quark mass is not set to vanish and the renormalization point is chosen to be an arbitrary timelike momentum. The correctness of the subtraction is ensured by the Ward identities which are respected in all the processes of subtraction. By considering the mass effect, the effective coupling constant and the effective quark mass are given in improved expressions which are different from the previous results.
