Title: Topological tensor current of $\tilde{p}$-branes in the $Ï†$-mapping  theory
Authors: Yishi Duan and Libin Fu and Guan Jia
Abstract: We present a new general topological tensor current of $\tilde{p}$-branes by making use of the $\phi $-mapping theory. It is shown that the current is identically conserved and behave as $\delta (\vec{\phi}),$ and every isolated zero of the vector field $\vec{\phi}(x)$ corresponds to a `magnetic' $\tilde{p}$-brane. Using this topological current, the generalized Nambu action for multi $\tilde{p}$-branes is given, and the field strength $F$ corresponding to this topological tensor current is obtained. It is also shown that the `magnetic' charges carried by $\tilde{p}$-branes are topologically quantized and labeled by Hopf index and Brouwer degree, the winding number of the $\phi$-mapping.
