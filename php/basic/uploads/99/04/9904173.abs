Title: On dynamical mass generation in three dimensional supersymmetric U(1)  gauge field theory
Authors: A. Campbell-Smith and N. E. Mavromatos
Abstract: We investigate and contrast the non-perturbative infra red structure of N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric non-compact U(1) gauge field theory in three space-time dimensions with N matter flavours. We study the Dyson-Schwinger equations in a general gauge using superfield formalism; this ensures that supersymmetry is kept manifest, though leads to spurious infra red divergences which we have to avoid carefully. In the N=1 case the superfield formalism allows us to choose a vertex which satisfies the U(1) Ward identity exactly, and we find the expected critical behaviour in the wavefunction renormalization and strong evidence for the existence of a gauge independent dynamically generated mass, but with no evidence for a critical flavour number. We study the N=2 model by dimensional reduction from four dimensional N=1 electrodynamics, and we refine the old gauge dependence argument that there is no dynamical mass generation. We recognize that the refinement only holds after dimensional reduction.
