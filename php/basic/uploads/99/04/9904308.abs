Title: Quantum field theory for discrepancies II: 1/N corrections using  fermions
Authors: A. van Hameren and R. Kleiss and C. G. Papadopoulos
Abstract: We calculate the 1/N corrections to the probability distributions of quadratic discrepancies for sets of N random points. This is achieved by the introduction of fermionic variables. We give the diagrammatic expansion up to and including the second order in 1/N. For some discrepancies, we give the explicit expansion to first order.
