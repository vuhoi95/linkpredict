Title: General Virasoro Construction on Orbifold Affine Algebra
Authors: J. Evslin and M. B. Halpern and J. E. Wang
Abstract: We obtain the orbifold Virasoro master equation (OVME) at integer order lambda, which summarizes the general Virasoro construction on orbifold affine algebra. The OVME includes the Virasoro master equation when lambda=1 and contains large classes of stress tensors of twisted sectors of conventional orbifolds at higher lambda. The generic construction is like a twisted sector of an orbifold (with non-zero ground state conformal weight) but new constructions are obtained for which we have so far found no conventional orbifold interpretation.
