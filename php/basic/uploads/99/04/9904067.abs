Title: Spacetime metric from linear electrodynamics
Authors: Yuri N. Obukhov and Friedrich W. Hehl
Abstract: The Maxwell equations are formulated on an arbitrary (1+3)-dimensional manifold. Then, imposing a (constrained) linear constitutive relation between electromagnetic field $(E,B)$ and excitation $({\cal D},{\cal H})$, we derive the metric of spacetime therefrom.
