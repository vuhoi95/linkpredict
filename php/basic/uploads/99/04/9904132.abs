Authors: M. Chaichian and A. Demichev and P. Presnajder
Abstract: We study properties of a scalar quantum field theory on the two-dimensional noncommutative plane with $E_q(2)$ quantum symmetry. We start from the consideration of a firstly quantized quantum particle on the noncommutative plane. Then we define quantum fields depending on noncommutative coordinates and construct a field theoretical action using the $E_q(2)$-invariant measure on the noncommutative plane. With the help of the partial wave decomposition we show that this quantum field theory can be considered as a second quantization of the particle theory on the noncommutative plane and that this field theory has (contrary to the common belief) even more severe ultraviolet divergences than its counterpart on the usual commutative plane. Finally, we introduce the symmetry transformations of physical states on noncommutative spaces and discuss them in detail for the case of the $E_q(2)$ quantum group.
