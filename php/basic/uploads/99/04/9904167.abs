Abstract: By using the fact that Polychronakos-like models can be obtained through the `freezing limit' of related spin Calogero models, we calculate the exact spectrum as well as partition function of SU(m|n) supersymmetric Polychronakos (SP) model. It turns out that, similar to the non-supersymmetric case, the spectrum of SU(m|n) SP model is also equally spaced. However, the degeneracy factors of corresponding energy levels crucially depend on the values of bosonic degrees of freedom (m) and fermionic degrees of freedom (n). As a result, the partition functions of SP models are expressed through some novel q-polynomials. Finally, by interchanging the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom, we obtain a duality relation among the partition functions of SP models.
