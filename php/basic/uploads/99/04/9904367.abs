Title: On the muon anomalous magnetic moment in models with a superlight  gravitino
Authors: Andrea Brignole and Elena Perazzi and Fabio Zwirner
Abstract: We perform a general analysis of the contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment in models with a superlight gravitino. We discuss the interpretation and the phenomenological implications of the results. We find that present constraints on the model parameters are comparable and complementary to the ones coming from collider searches and from perturbative unitarity. However, the Brookhaven E821 experiment will probe large unexplored regions of parameter space.
