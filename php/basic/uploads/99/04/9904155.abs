Title: Puzzles on the Duality between Heterotic and Type IIA Strings
Authors: Mitsuko Abe and Masamichi Sato
Abstract: We discuss the possibility of the extension of the duality between the webs of heterotic string and the type IIA string to Calabi-Yau 3-folds with another K3 fiber by comparing the dual polyhedron of Calabi-Yau 3-folds given by Candelas, Perevalov and Rajesh.
