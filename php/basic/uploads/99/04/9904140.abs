Title: Two-Loop Calculations in phi^4 Light-Front Field Theory
Authors: F. Antonuccio and J. O. Andersen
Abstract: We perform a two-loop calculation in light-front phi^4 theory to determine the effective mass renormalization of the light-front Hamiltonian. The renormalization scheme adopted here is manifestly boost invariant, and yields results that are in perfect agreement with the explicitly covariant Feynman diagram approach.
