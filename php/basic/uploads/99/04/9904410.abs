Title: The Ubiquitous Inflaton in String-Inspired Models
Authors: Arjun Berera and Thomas W. Kephart
Abstract: A string theory based inflationary model is developed where the inflaton interacts with a multitude of massive string level states causing dissipation of vacuum energy. Inflation terminates in a warm Universe without the need for reheating.
