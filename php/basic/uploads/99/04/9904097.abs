Title: On the Energy Momentum Tensor of the M-Theory Fivebrane
Authors: O. Baerwald and N. D. Lambert and P. C. West
Abstract: We construct the energy momentum tensor for the bosonic fields of the covariant formulation of the M-theory fivebrane within that formalism. We then obtain the energy for various solitonic solutions of the fivebrane equations of motion.
