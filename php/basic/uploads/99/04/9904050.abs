Title: N=1 Theories, T-duality, and AdS/CFT correspondence
Authors: Martin Gremm and Anton Kapustin
Abstract: We construct an N=1 superconformal field theory using branes of type IIA string theory. The IIA construction is related via T-duality to a IIB configuration with 3-branes in a background generated by two intersecting O7-planes and 7-branes. The IIB background can be viewed as a local piece of an F-theory compactification previously studied by Sen in connection with the Gimon-Polchinski orientifold. We discuss the deformations of the IIA and IIB constructions and describe a new supersymmetric configuration with curving D6-branes. Starting from the IIB description we find the supergravity dual of the large N field theory and discuss the matching of operators and KK states. The matching of non-chiral primaries exhibits some interesting new features. We also discuss a relevant deformation of the field theory under which it flows to a line of strongly coupled N=1 fixed points in the infrared. For these fixed points we find a partial supergravity description.
