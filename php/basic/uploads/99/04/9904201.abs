Title: Electroweak symmetry breaking and s-spectrum in M-theory
Authors: Tatsuo Kobayashi and Jisuke Kubo and Hitoshi Shimabukuro
Abstract: We study soft SUSY breaking parameters in M-theory with and without 5-brane moduli fields. We investigate successful electroweak symmetry breaking and the positivity of stau mass squared. We study mass spectra in allowed regions.
