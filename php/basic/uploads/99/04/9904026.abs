Title: On Gravity and the Uncertainty Principle
Authors: Ronald J. Adler and David I. Santiago
Abstract: Heisenberg showed in the early days of quantum theory that the uncertainty principle follows as a direct consequence of the quantization of electromagnetic radiation in the form of photons. As we show here the gravitational interaction of the photon and the particle being observed modifies the uncertainty principle with an additional term. From the modified or gravitational uncertainty principle it follows that there is an absolute minimum uncertainty in the position of any particle, of order of the Planck length. A modified uncertainty relation of this form is a standard result of superstring theory, but the derivation given here is based on simpler and rather general considerations with either Newtonian gravitational theory or general relativity theory.
