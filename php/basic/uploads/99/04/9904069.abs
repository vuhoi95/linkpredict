Title: Tachyon-free Orientifolds of Type 0B Strings in Various Dimensions
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Anamaria Font and Dieter Lust
Abstract: We construct non-tachyonic, non-supersymmetric orientifolds of Type 0B strings in ten, six and four space-time dimensions. Typically, these models have unitary gauge groups with charged massless fermionic and bosonic matter fields. However, generically there remains an uncancelled dilaton tadpole.
