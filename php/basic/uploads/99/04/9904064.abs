Title: Tunnelling series in terms of perturbation theory for quantum spin  systems
Authors: V. V. Ulyanov and O. B. Zaslavskii
Abstract: Considered is quantum tunnelling in anisotropic spin systems in a magnetic field perpendicular to the anisotropy axis. In the domain of small field the problem of calculating tunnelling splitting of energy levels is reduced to constructing the perturbatio n series with degeneracy, the order of degeneracy being proportional to a spin value. Partial summation of this series taking into account ''dangerous terms'' with small denominators is performed and the value of tunnelling splitting is calculated with allowance for the first correction with respect to a magnetic field.
