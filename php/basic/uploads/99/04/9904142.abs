Title: Comments on the IIA NS5-brane
Authors: Shiraz Minwalla and Nathan Seiberg
Abstract: We study $N$ coincident IIA NS5-branes at large $N$ using supergravity. We show that the absorption cross section for gravitons in this background does not vanish at zero string coupling for energies larger than $m_s/\sqrt{N}$ ($m_s$ is the string scale). Using a holographic description of the intrinsic theory of the IIA NS5-branes, we find an expression for the two point function of the stress energy tensor, and comment on its structure.
