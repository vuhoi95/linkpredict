Title: A superspace formulation of an "asymptotic" OSp(3,1|2) invariance of  Yang-Mills theories
Authors: Satish D. Joglekar and Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: We formulate a superspace field theory which is shown to be equivalent to the $c-\bar{c}$ symmetric BRS/Anti-BRS invariant Yang-Mills action. The theory uses a 6-dimensional superspace and one OSp(3,1|2) vector multiplet of unconstrained superfields. We establish a superspace WT identity and show that the formulation has an asymptotic OSp(3,1|2) invariance as the gauge parameter goes to infinity. We give a physical interpretation of this asymptotic OSp(3,1|2) invariance as a symmetry transformation among the longitudinal/time like degrees of freedom of $A_\mu$ and the ghost degrees of freedom.
