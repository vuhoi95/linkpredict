Title: Running gauge coupling and quark-antiquark potential from dilatonic  gravity
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: The running gauge coupling and quark-antiquark potential in d-dimensions are calculated from the explicit solution of d+1-dimensional dilatonic gravity. This background interpolates between usual AdS in UV and flat space with singular dilaton in IR and it realizes two-boundaries AdS/CFT correspondence. The behaviour of running coupling and potential is consistent with results following from IIB supergravity.
