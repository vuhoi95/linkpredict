Title: New Constraints on Chiral Gauge Theories
Authors: Thomas Appelquist and Andrew Cohen and Martin Schmaltz and Robert Shrock
Abstract: Recently, a new constraint on the structure of a wide class of strongly coupled field theories has been proposed. It takes the form of an inequality limiting the number of degrees of freedom in the infrared description of a theory to be no larger than the number of underlying, ultraviolet degrees of freedom. Here we apply this inequality to chiral gauge theories. For some models we find that it is always satisfied, while for others we find that the assumption of the validity of the inequality implies a strong additional restriction on the spectrum of massless composite particles.
