Title: World-Volume Locally Supersymmetric Born-Infeld Actions
Authors: Björn Brinne and Svend E. Hjelmeland and Ulf Lindström
Abstract: We derive manifestly locally supersymmetric extensions of the Born-Infeld action with $p=2$. The construction is based on a first order bosonic action for $Dp$-branes with a generalized Weyl invariance.
