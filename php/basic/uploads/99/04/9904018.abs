Title: Sonoluminescence: Two-photon correlations as a test of thermality
Authors: Francesco Belgiorno and Stefano Liberati and Matt Visser and Dennis Sciama
Abstract: In this Letter we propose a fundamental test for probing the thermal nature of the spectrum emitted by sonoluminescence. We show that two-photon correlations can in principle discriminate between real thermal light and the quasi-thermal squeezed-state photons typical of models based on the dynamic Casimir effect. Two-photon correlations provide a powerful experimental test for various classes of sonoluminescence models.
