Title: Super Weyl Anomalies in the AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: M. Nishimura and Y. Tanii
Abstract: Anomalies of N = (4,4) superconformal field theories coupled to a conformal supergravity background in two dimensions are computed by using the AdS/CFT correspondence. We find that Weyl, axial gauge and super Weyl transformations are anomalous, while general coordinate, local Lorentz, vector gauge and local super transformations are not. The coefficients of the anomalies show that the superconformal field theories have the central charge expected in the AdS/CFT correspondence.
