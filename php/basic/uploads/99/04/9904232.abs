Title: Testing TeV Scale Quantum Gravity using Dijet Production at the Tevatron
Authors: Prakash Mathews and Sreerup Raychaudhuri and K. Sridhar
Abstract: Dijet production at the Tevatron including effects of virtual exchanges of spin-2 Kaluza-Klein modes in theories with large extra dimensions is considered. The experimental dijet mass and angular distribution are exploited to obtain stringent limits ($\sim 1.2$ TeV) on the effective string scale $M_S$.
