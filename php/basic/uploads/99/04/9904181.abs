Authors: Bum-Hoon Lee and Hyuk-jae Lee and Nobuyoshi Ohta and Hyun Seok Yang
Abstract: We study various three-dimensional supersymmetric Maxwell Chern-Simons solitons by using type IIB brane configurations. We give a systematic classification of soliton spectra such as topological BPS vortices and nontopological vortices in $\cn=2,3$ supersymmetric Maxwell Chern-Simons system via the branes of type IIB string theory. We identify the brane configurations with the soliton spectra of the field theory and obtain a nice agreement with field theory aspects. We also discuss possible brane constructions for BPS domain wall solutions.
