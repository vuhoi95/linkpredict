Title: Conformal Symmetry and A New Gauge in the Matrix Model
Authors: Hiroyuki Hata and Sanefumi Moriyama
Abstract: We generalize the background gauge in the Matrix model to propose a new gauge which is useful for discussing the conformal symmetry. In this gauge, the special conformal transformation (SCT) as the isometry of the near-horizon geometry of the D-particle solution is directly reproduced with the correct coefficient as the quantum correction to the SCT in the Matrix model. We also present a general argument for the relation between the gauge choice and the field redefinition in the Matrix model.
