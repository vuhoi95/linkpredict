Title: 3-dimensional low-energy topological invariants
Authors: Malgorzata Bakalarska and Boguslaw Broda
Abstract: A description of the one-loop approximation formula for the partition function of a three-dimensional abelian version of the Donaldson-Witten theory is proposed. The one-loop expression is shown to contain such topological invariants of a three-dimensional manifold M like the Reidemeister-Ray-Singer torsion and Betti numbers.
