Title: Dual Supersymmetry Algebras from Partial Supersymmetry Breaking
Authors: R. Altendorfer and J. Bagger
Abstract: The partial breaking of supersymmetry in flat space can be accomplished using any one of three dual representations for the massive N=1 spin-3/2 multiplet. Each of the representations can be ``unHiggsed'', which gives rise to a set of dual N=2 supergravities and supersymmetry algebras.
