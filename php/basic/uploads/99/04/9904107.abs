Title: A Derivation of the Correct Treatment of 1/(eta.k)^p Singularities in  Axial Gauges
Authors: Satish. D. Joglekar and A. Misra
Abstract: We use the earlier results on the correlations of axial gauge Green's functions and the Lorentz gauge Green's functions obtained via finite field-dependent BRS transformations to study the question of the correct treatment of 1/(eta\cdot k)^p- type singularities in the axial gauge boson propagator. We show how the known treatment of the 1/(k^2)^n-type singularity in the Lorentz-type gauges can be used to write down the axial propagator via field transformation. We examine the singularity structure of the latter and find that the axial propagator so constructed has $no$ spurious poles, but a complex structure near $\eta\cdot k=0$.
