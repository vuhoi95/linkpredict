Title: Spacetime supersymmetry in $AdS_3$ backgrounds
Authors: David Berenstein and Robert G. Leigh
Abstract: We construct string target spacetimes with AdS_3 x X geometry, which have an N=2 spacetime superconformal algebra. X is found to be a U(1) fibration over a manifold which is a target for an N=2 worldsheet conformal field theory. We emphasize theories with free field realizations where in principle it is possible to compute the full one-particle string spectrum.
