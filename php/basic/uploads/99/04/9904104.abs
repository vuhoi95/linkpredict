Title: Superstring Perturbation Theory and Ramond-Ramond Backgrounds
Authors: David Berenstein and Robert G. Leigh
Abstract: We consider perturbative Type II superstring theory in the covariant NSR formalism in the presence of NSNS and RR backgrounds. A concrete example that we have in mind is the geometry of D3-branes which in the near-horizon region is AdS_5 x S_5, although our methods may be applied to other backgrounds as well. We show how conformal invariance of the string path integral is maintained order by order in the number of holes. This procedure makes uses of the Fischler-Susskind mechanism to build up the background geometry. A simple formal expression is given for a \sigma-model Lagrangian. This suggests a perturbative expansion in 1/g^2N and 1/N. As applications, we consider at leading order the mixing of RR and NSNS states, and the realization of the spacetime supersymmetry algebra.
