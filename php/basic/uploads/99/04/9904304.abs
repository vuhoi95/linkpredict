Title: Transcendental numbers and the topology of three-loop bubbles
Authors: S. Groote and J. G. KÃ¶rner and A. A. Pivovarov
Abstract: We present a proof that all transcendental numbers that are needed for the calculation of the master integrals for three-loop vacuum Feynman diagrams can be obtained by calculating diagrams with an even simpler topology, the topology of spectacles.
