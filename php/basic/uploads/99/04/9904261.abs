Title: Stabilization of Embedded Defects by Plasma Effects
Authors: M. Nagasawa and R. Brandenberger
Abstract: In models in which some of the scalar field are charged and some uncharged, interactions with a finite temperature plasma will lead to corrections to the effective potential of the charged fields which may stabilize embedded defects made up of uncharged fields. In these models embedded defects, solutions of the field equations which are unstable at zero temperature, may thus be stable in the early Universe, and may then play an important role in cosmology. Two prototypical examples are the pion string in the theory of strong interactions, and the electroweak Z-string in the standard electroweak theory.
