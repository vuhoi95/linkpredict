Title: 4D quantum black hole physics from 2D models?
Authors: R. Balbinot and A. Fabbri
Abstract: Minimally coupled 4D scalar fields in Schwarzschild space-time are considered. Dimensional reduction to 2D leads to a well known anomaly induced effective action, which we consider here in a local form with the introduction of auxiliary fields. Boundary conditions are imposed on them in order to select the appropriate quantum states (Boulware, Unruh annd Israel-Hartle-Hawking). The stress tensor is then calculated and its comparison with the expected 4D form turns out to be unsuccessful. We also critically discuss in some detail a recent controversial result appeared in the literature on the same topic.
