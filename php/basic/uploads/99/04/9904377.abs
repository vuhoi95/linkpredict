Title: Coulomb Gas Representation of Low Energy QCD
Authors: Sebastian Jaimungal and Ariel R. Zhitnitsky
Abstract: A novel Coulomb gas (CG) description of low energy $QCD_4$, based on the dual transformation of the QCD effective chiral Lagrangian, is constructed. The CG is found to contain several species of charges, one of which is fractionally charged and can be interpreted as instanton-quarks. The creation operator which inserts a pseudo-particle in the CG picture is explicitly constructed and demonstrated to have a non-zero vacuum expectation value. The Wilson loop operator as well as the creation operator for the domain wall in the CG representation is also constructed.
