Title: Self-duality and soldering in odd dimensions
Authors: R. Banerjee and S. Kumar
Abstract: Using the recently developed soldering formalism we highlight certain features of quantum mechanical models. The complete correspondence between these models and self dual field theoretical models in odd dimensions is established. The distinction between self duality and self dual factorisation in these dimensions is clarified.
