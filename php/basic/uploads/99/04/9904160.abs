Title: Spherically Symmetric Solutions of the SU(N) Skyrme Models
Authors: T. Ioannidou and B. Piette and W. J. Zakrzewski
Abstract: Recently we have presented in hep-th/9811071 an ansatz which allows us to construct skyrmion fields from the harmonic maps of $S\sp2$ to $CP\sp{N-1}$. In this paper we examine this construction in detail and use it to construct, in an explicit form, new static spherically symmetric solutions of the SU(N) Skyrme models. We also discuss some properties of these solutions.
