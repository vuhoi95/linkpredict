Title: Hecke Algebra Representations in Ideals Generated by q-Young Clifford  Idempotents
Authors: Rafal Ablamowicz and Bertfried Fauser
Abstract: It is a well known fact from the group theory that irreducible tensor representations of classical groups are suitably characterized by irreducible representations of the symmetric groups. However, due to their different nature, vector and spinor representations are only connected and not united in such description. Clifford algebras are an ideal tool with which to describe symmetries of multi-particle systems since they contain spinor and vector representations within the same formalism, and, moreover, allow for a complete study of all classical Lie groups. In this work, together with an accompanying work also presented at this conference, an analysis of q-symmetry -- for generic q's -- based on the ordinary symmetric groups is given for the first time. We construct q-Young operators as Clifford idempotents and the Hecke algebra representations in ideals generated by these operators. Various relations as orthogonality of representations and completeness are given explicitly, and the symmetry types of representations is discussed. Appropriate q-Young diagrams and tableaux are given. The ordinary case of the symmetric group is obtained in the limit q \to 1. All in all, a toolkit for Clifford algebraic treatment of multi-particle systems is provided. The distinguishing feature of this paper is that the Young operators of conjugated Young diagrams are related by Clifford reversion, connecting Clifford algebra and Hecke algebra features. This contrasts the purely Hecke algebraic approach of King and Wybourne, who do not embed Hecke algebras into Clifford algebras.
