Title: Physics of the Power Corrections in QCD
Authors: F. V. Gubarev and M. I. Polikarpov and V. I. Zakharov
Abstract: We review the physics of the power corrections to the parton model. In the first part, we consider the power corrections which characterize the infrared sensitivity of Feynman graphs when the contribution of short distances dominates. The second part is devoted to the hypothetical power corrections associated with nonperturbative effects at small distances.
