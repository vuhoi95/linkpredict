Title: Anyon Condensation and Persistent Currents
Authors: Antonio Liguori and Mihail Mintchev and Luigi Pilo
Abstract: In this letter we study 1+1 anyon fields at finite temperature and density with non-vanishing chemical potentials. Our approach is based on an operator formalism for bosonization at finite temperature; the correlation functions for the system are given in an explicit form. Two are the main results of this construction: we point out the existence of persistent currents in 1+1 anyon systems; from the analysis of 2-point anyon field correlation function, a remarkable and new condensation phenomenon in momentum space is discovered. As a concrete example, the above formalism is applied to the Thirring model.
