Title: Intersecting M-Fluxbranes
Authors: Chiang-Mei Chen and Dmitri V. Gal'tsov and Sergei A. Sharakin
Abstract: New solution to the six-dimensional vacuum Einstein's equations is constructed as a non-linear superposition of two five-dimensional solutions representing the Melvin-Gibbons-Maeda Universe and its S-dual. Then using duality between D=8 vacuum and a certain class of D=11 supergravity configurations we generate M2 and M5 fluxbranes as well as some of their intersections also including waves and KK-monopoles.
