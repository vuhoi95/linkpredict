Title: From Screening to Confinement in a Gauge-Invariant Formalism
Authors: Patricio Gaete and Iv√°n Schmidt
Abstract: Features of screening and confinement are reviewed in two-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED2). Our discussion is carried out using the gauge-invariant but path-dependent variables formalism. This alternative and useful approach exploits the rich structure of the electromagnetic cloud or dressing around static fermions in a straightforward and simple way.
