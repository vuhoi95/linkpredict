Title: Quantum Dynamics from Classical Dissipative Systems
Authors: T. S. Biró and S. G. Matinyan and B. Müller
Abstract: We argue that the quantized non-Abelian gauge theory can be obtained as the infrared limit of the corresponding classical gauge theory in a higher dimension. We show how the transformation from classical to quantum dynamics emerges and calculate Planck's constant from quantities defined in the underlying classical field theory.
