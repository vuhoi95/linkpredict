Title: On Holography and Cosmology
Authors: Reza Tavakol and George Ellis
Abstract: We consider a recent generalisation by Bousso of an earlier holography proposal by Fischler and Susskind. We demonstrate that in general inhomogeneous universes such a proposal would involve extremely complicated - possibly fractal - light sheets. Furthermore, in general such a light sheet cannot be known a priori on the basis of theory and moreover, the evolution of the universe makes it clear that in general such bounds cannot remain invariant under time reversal and will change with epoch. We propose a modified version of this proposal in which the light sheets end on the boundary of the past, and hence avoid contact with the caustics. In this way the resulting light sheets and projections can be made much simpler. We discuss the question of operational definability of these sheets within the context of both proposals and conclude that in both cases the theoretical existence of such sheets must be clearly distinguished from their complexity and the difficulty of their construction in practice. This puts into perspective the likely practical difficulties one would face in applying the holographic principle to the real cosmos. These issues may also be of relevance in debates regarding the applications of the holographic principle to other settings such as string theory.
