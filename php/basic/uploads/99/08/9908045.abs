Title: A novel realization of the Calogero-Moser scattering states as coherent  states
Authors: N. Gurappa and P. S. Mohanty and Prasanta K. Panigrahi
Abstract: A novel realization is provided for the scattering states of the $N$-particle Calogero-Moser Hamiltonian. They are explicitly shown to be the coherent states of the singular oscillators of the Calogero-Sutherland model. Our algebraic treatment is straightforwardly extendable to a large number of few and many-body interacting systems in one and higher dimensions.
