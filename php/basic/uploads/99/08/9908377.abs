Title: Matching Heavy Particle Approach to Relativistic Theory
Authors: J. Gegelia and G. Japaridze
Abstract: On the simple model of interacting massless and heavy scalar fields it is demonstrated that the technique of heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory reproduces the results of relativistic theory. Explicit calculations are performed for diagrams including two-loops.
