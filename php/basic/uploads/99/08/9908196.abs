Abstract: The discrete spectrum of fluctuations of the metric about an $AdS^5$ black hole background are found. These modes are the strong coupling limit of so called glueball states in a dual 3-d Yang-Mills theory with quantum numbers $J^{PC} = 2^{++}, 1^{-+}, 0^{++}$. For the ground state modes, we find the mass relation: $m(0^{++}) < m(2^{++}) < m(1^{-+})$. Contrary to expectation, the mass of our new $0^{++}$ state ($m^2=5.4573$) associated with the graviton is smaller than the mass of the $0^{++}$ state ($m^2=11.588$) from the dilaton. In fact the dilatonic excitations are exactly degenerate with our tensor $2^{++}$ states. We find that variational methods gives remarkably accurate mass estimates for all three low-lying levels while a WKB treatment describes the higher modes well.
