Title: Aspects of Duality and Confining Strings
Authors: Mauri Miettinen and Antti J. Niemi and Yuri Stroganov
Abstract: We inspect the excitation energy spectrum of a confining string in terms of solitons in an effective field theory model. The spectrum can be characterized by a spectral function, and twisting and bending of the string is manifested by the invariance of this function under a duality transformation. Both general considerations and numerical simulations reveal that the spectral function can be approximated by a simple rational form, which we propose becomes exact in the Yang-Mills theory.
