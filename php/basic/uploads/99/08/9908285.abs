Title: K-matrices for non-abelian quantum Hall states
Authors: E. Ardonne and P. Bouwknegt and S. Guruswamy and K. Schoutens
Abstract: Two fundamental aspects of so-called non-abelian quantum Hall states (the q-pfaffian states and more general) are a (generalized) pairing of the participating electrons and the non-abelian statistics of the quasi-hole excitations. In this paper, we show that these two aspects are linked by a duality relation, which can be made manifest by considering the K-matrices that describe the exclusion statistics of the fundamental excitations in these systems.
