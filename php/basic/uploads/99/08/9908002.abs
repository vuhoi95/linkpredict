Title: Quantum Backlund transformation for the integrable DST model
Authors: V. B. Kuznetsov and M. Salerno and E. K. Sklyanin
Abstract: For the integrable case of the discrete self-trapping (DST) model we construct a Backlund transformation. The dual Lax matrix and the corresponding dual Backlund transformation are also found and studied. The quantum analog of the Backlund transformation (Q-operator) is constructed as the trace of a monodromy matrix with an infinite-dimensional auxiliary space. We present the Q-operator as an explicit integral operator as well as describe its action on the monomial basis. As a result we obtain a family of integral equations for multivariable polynomial eigenfunctions of the quantum integrable DST model. These eigenfunctions are special functions of the Heun class which is beyond the hypergeometric class. The found integral equations are new and they shall provide a basis for efficient analytical and numerical studies of such complicated functions.
