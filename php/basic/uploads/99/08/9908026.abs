Title: Large N corrections to the strong coupling behaviour of SU(N)/Z_N  lattice gauge theories
Authors: A. Gonzalez-Arroyo and C. Pena
Abstract: We derive a formula for the large N behaviour of the expectation values of an arbitrary product of Wilson loops in the adjoint representation. We show the consequences of our formula for the study of the large N strong coupling behaviour of SU(N)/Z_N pure gauge theories, and theories with matter fields in the adjoint representation. This allows us to calculate large N corrections to the gluino condensate and meson propagators in the lattice version of Supersymmetric Yang-Mills. Applications to the strong coupling behaviour of the Kazakov-Migdal model are also given.
