Title: Gaudin Hypothesis for the XYZ Spin Chain
Authors: Yasuhiro Fujii and Miki Wadati
Abstract: The XYZ spin chain is considered in the framework of the generalized algebraic Bethe ansatz developed by Takhtajan and Faddeev. The sum of norms of the Bethe vectors is computed and expressed in the form of a Jacobian. This result corresponds to the Gaudin hypothesis for the XYZ spin chain.
