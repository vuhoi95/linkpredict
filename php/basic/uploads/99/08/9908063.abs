Title: Consistent Superalgebraic Truncations from D=5, N=5 Supergravity
Authors: Chang-Ho Kim and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: We study a novel five-dimensional, {\it N}=5 supergravity in the context of Lie superalgebra SU(5/2). The possible successive superalgebraic truncations from {\it N}=5 theory to the lower supersymmetric {\it N}=4,3,2, and 1 supergravity theories are systematically analyzed as a sub-superalgebraic chain of SU(5/2)$\supset$ SU(4/2) $\supset$ SU(3/2) $\supset$ SU(2/2) $\supset$ SU(1/2) by using the Kac-Dynkin weight techniques.
