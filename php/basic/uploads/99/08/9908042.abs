Abstract: The critical dynamics of the chiral symmetry breaking induced by gauge interaction is examined in the Wilson renormalization group framework in comparison with the Schwinger-Dyson approach. We derive the beta functions for the four-fermi couplings in the sharp cutoff renormalzation group scheme, from which the critical couplings and the anomalous dimensions of the fermion composite operators near criticality are immediately obtained. It is also shown that the beta functions lead to the same critical behavior found by solving the so-called ladder Schwinger-Dyson equation, if we restrict the radiative corrections to a certain limited type.
