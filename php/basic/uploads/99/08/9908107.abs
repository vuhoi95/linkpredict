Title: Holomorphic factorization of correlation functions in (4k+2)-dimensional  (2k)-form gauge theory
Authors: Mans Henningson and Bengt E. W. Nilsson and Per Salomonson
Abstract: We consider a free (2 k)-form gauge-field on a Euclidean (4 k + 2)-manifold. The parameters needed to specify the action and the gauge-invariant observables take their values in spaces with natural complex structures. We show that the correlation functions can be written as a finite sum of terms, each of which is a product of a holomorphic and an anti-holomorphic factor. The holomorphic factors are naturally interpreted as correlation functions for a chiral (2 k)-form, i.e. a (2 k)-form with a self-dual (2 k + 1)-form field strength, after Wick rotation to a Minkowski signature.
