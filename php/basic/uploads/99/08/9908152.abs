Authors: T. Matos and F. S. Guzman and L. A. Urena-Lopez
Abstract: We investigate the hypothesis that the scalar field is the dark matter and the dark energy in the Cosmos, wich comprises about 95% of the matter of the Universe. We show that this hypothesis explains quite well the recent observations on type Ia supernovae.
