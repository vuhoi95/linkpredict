Title: Anti-de Sitter Supersymmetry
Authors: Bernard de Wit and Ivan Herger
Abstract: We give a pedagogical introduction to certain aspects of supersymmetric field theories in anti-de Sitter space. Among them are the presence of masslike terms in massless wave equations, irreducible unitary representations and the phenomenon of multiplet shortening.
