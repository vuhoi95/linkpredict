Title: Power Corrections from Small Distances
Authors: F. V. Gubarev and M. I. Polikarpov and V. I. Zakharov
Abstract: We review recent speculations on power like corrections in QCD which go beyond the standard Operator Product Expansion. Both the theoretical picture underlying these corrections and phenomenological manifestations are discussed in some detail.
