Title: Short Strings and Gluon Propagator in the Infrared Region

Abstract: We discuss how infrared region influence on short distance physics via new object, called ``short string''. This object exists in confining theories and violates the operator product expansion. Most analytical results are obtained for the dual Abelian Higgs theory, while phenomenological arguments are given for QCD.
