Title: Self-energy of electrons in non-perturbative QED
Authors: Elliott Lieb and Michael Loss
Abstract: Various models of charged particles interacting with a quantized, ultraviolet cutoff radiation field (but not with each other) are investigated. Upper and lower bounds are found for the self- or ground state-energies without mass renormalization. For $N$ fermions the bounds are proportional to $N$, but for bosons they are sublinear, which implies `binding', and hence that `free' bosons are never free. Both `relativistic' and non-relativistic kinematics are considered. Our bounds are non-perturbative and differ significantly from the predictions of perturbation theory.
