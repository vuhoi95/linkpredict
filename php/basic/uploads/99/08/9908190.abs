Abstract: A systematic algorithm to derive superpropagators in the case of either explicitly or spontaneously broken supersymmetric three-dimensional theories is presented. We discuss how the explicit breaking terms that are introduced at tree-level induce 1-loop radiative corrections to the effective action. We also point out that the renormalisation effects and the breaking-inducing-breaking mechanism become more immediate whenever we adopt the shifted superpropagators discussed in this letter.
