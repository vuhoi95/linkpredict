Title: Chern-Simons Invariants of Closed Hyperbolic 3-Manifolds
Authors: A. A. Bytsenko and A. E. Goncalves and F. L. Williams
Abstract: The Chern-Simons invariants of irreducible U(n)- flat connections on compact hyperbolic 3-manifolds of the form {\Gamma}\H^3 are derived. The explicit formula for the Chern-Simons functional is given in terms of Selberg type zeta functions related to the twisted eta invariants of Atiyah-Patodi-Singer.
