Title: Chaotic Scattering and Capture of Strings by Black Hole
Authors: Andrei V. Frolov and Arne L. Larsen
Abstract: We consider scattering and capture of circular cosmic strings by a Schwarzschild black hole. Although being a priori a very simple axially symmetric two-body problem, it shows all the features of chaotic scattering. In particular, it contains a fractal set of unstable periodic solutions; a so-called strange repellor. We study the different types of trajectories and obtain the fractal dimension of the basin-boundary separating the space of initial conditions according to the different asymptotic outcomes. We also consider the fractal dimension as a function of energy, and discuss the transition from order to chaos.
