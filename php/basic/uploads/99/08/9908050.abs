Title: Minimal Models of Integrable Lattice Theory and Truncated Functional  Equations
Authors: A. Belavin and Yu. Stroganov
Abstract: We consider the integrable XXZ model with the special open boundary conditions. We perform Quantum Group reduction of this model in roots of unity and use it for the definition Minimal Models of Interable lattice theory. It is shown that after this Quantum Group reduction Sklyanin's transfer-matrices satisfy the closed system of the truncated functional relations. We solve these equations for the simplest case.
