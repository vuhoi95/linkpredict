Title: Annular Vortex Solutions to the Landau-Ginzburg Equations in Mesoscopic  Superconductors
Authors: Jan Govaerts and Geoffrey Stenuit and Damien Bertrand and Olivier van der Aa
Abstract: New vortex solutions to the Landau-Ginzburg equations are described. These configurations, which extend the well known Abrikosov and giant magnetic vortex ones, consist of a succession of ring-like supercurrent vortices organised in a concentric pattern, possibly bound to a giant magnetic vortex then lying at their center. The dynamical and thermodynamic stability of these annular vortices is an important open issue on which hinges the direct experimental observation of such configurations. Nevertheless, annular vortices should affect indirectly specific dynamic properties of mesoscopic superconducting devices amenable to physical observation.
