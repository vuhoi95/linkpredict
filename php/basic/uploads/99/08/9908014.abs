Title: Topology Classes of Flat U(1) Bundles and Diffeomorphic Covariant  Representations of the Heisenberg Algebra
Authors: Jan Govaerts and Victor M. Villanueva
Abstract: The general construction of self-adjoint configuration space representations of the Heisenberg algebra over an arbitrary manifold is considered. All such inequivalent representations are parametrised in terms of the topology classes of flat U(1) bundles over the configuration space manifold. In the case of Riemannian manifolds, these representations are also manifestly diffeomorphic covariant. The general discussion, illustrated by some simple examples in non relativistic quantum mechanics, is of particular relevance to systems whose configuration space is parametrised by curvilinear coordinates or is not simply connected, which thus include for instance the modular spaces of theories of non abelian gauge fields and gravity.
