Title: Dynamical correlation functions of the spin Calogero-Sutherland model
Authors: Takashi Yamamoto and Mitsuhiro Arikawa
Abstract: The thermodynamic limit of the dynamical density and spin-density two-point correlation functions for the spin Calogero-Sutherland model are derived from Uglov's finite-size results. The resultant formula for the density two-point correlation function is consistent with the previous conjecture on the basis of the minimal number of elementary excitations.
