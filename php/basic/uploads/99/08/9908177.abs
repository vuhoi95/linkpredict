Title: On symmetries of Chern-Simons and BF topological theories
Authors: Tatiana A. Ivanova and Alexander D. Popov
Abstract: We describe constructing solutions of the field equations of Chern-Simons and topological BF theories in terms of deformation theory of locally constant (flat) bundles. Maps of flat connections into one another (dressing transformations) are considered. A method of calculating (nonlocal) dressing symmetries in Chern-Simons and topological BF theories is formulated.
