Title: On spin-1 massive particles coupled to a Chern-Simons field
Authors: M. Gomes and L. C. Malacarne and A. J. da Silva
Abstract: We study spin one particles interacting through a Chern-Simons field. In the Born approximation, we calculate the two body scattering amplitude considering three possible ways to introduce the interaction: (a) a Proca like model minimally coupled to a Chern-Simons field, (b) the model obtained from (a) by replacing the Proca's mass by a Chern-Simons term and (c) a complex Maxwell-Chern-Simons model minimally coupled to a Chern-Simons field. In the low energy regime the results show similarities with the Aharonov-Bohm scattering for spin 1/2 particles. We discuss the one loop renormalization program for the Proca's model. In spite of the bad ultraviolet behavior of the matter field propagator, we show that, up to one loop the model is power counting renormalizable thanks to the Ward identities satisfied by the interaction vertices.
