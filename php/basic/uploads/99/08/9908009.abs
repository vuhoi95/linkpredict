Authors: H. Furutsu and T. Kojima and Y. -H. Quano
Abstract: Presented is a free boson representation of the type II vertex operators for the $A_{n-1}^{(1)}$ face model. Using the bosonization, we derive some properties of the type II vertex operators, such as commutation, inversion and duality relations.
