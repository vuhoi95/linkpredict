Title: Spectrum of Maxwell-Chern-Simons Theory Realized on Type IIB Brane
Authors: Takuhiro Kitao and Nobuyoshi Ohta
Abstract: We study the 3D field theory on one D3-brane stretched between (r,s) and (p,q)5-branes. The boundary conditions are determined from the analysis of NS5 and D5 charges of the two 5-branes. We carry out the mode expansions for all the fields and identify the field theory as Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory. We examine the mass spectrum to determine the conditions for unbroken supersymmetry (SUSY) in this field theory and compare the results with those from the brane configurations. The spectrum is found to be invariant under the Type IIB SL(2,{\bf Z})-transformation. We also discuss the theory with matters and its S-dual configuration. The result suggests that the equivalence under S-duality may be valid if we include all the higher modes in the theories with matters. We also find an interesting phenomenon that SUSY enhancement happens in the field theory after dimensional reduction from 3D to 2D.
