Title: The massless Thirring model in spherical field theory
Authors: Nathan Salwen and Dean Lee
Abstract: We use the massless Thirring model to demonstrate a new approach to non-perturbative fermion calculations based on the spherical field formalism. The methods we present are free from the problems of fermion doubling and difficulties associated with integrating out massless fermions. Using a non-perturbative regularization, we compute the two-point correlator and find agreement with the known analytic solution.
