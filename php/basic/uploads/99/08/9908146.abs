Title: Logarithmic Unification From Symmetries Enhanced in the Sub-Millimeter  Infrared
Authors: Nima Arkani-Hamed and Savas Dimopoulos and John March-Russell
Abstract: In theories with TeV string scale and sub-millimeter extra dimensions the attractive picture of logarithmic gauge coupling unification at $10^{16}$ GeV is seemingly destroyed. In this paper we argue to the contrary that logarithmic unification {\it can} occur in such theories. The rationale for unification is no longer that a gauge symmetry is restored at short distances, but rather that a geometric symmetry is restored at large distances in the bulk away from our 3-brane. The apparent `running' of the gauge couplings to energies far above the string scale actually arises from the logarithmic variation of classical fields in (sets of) two large transverse dimensions. We present a number of N=2 and N=1 supersymmetric D-brane constructions illustrating this picture for unification.
