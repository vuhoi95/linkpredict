Title: On Symmetry Restoration at Finite Temperature (Scalar Case)
Authors: M. Bordag and V. Skalozub
Abstract: We investigate the effective potential for a scalar $\Phi^{4}$ theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking at finite temperature. All 'daisy' and 'super daisy' diagrams are summed up and the properties of the corresponding gap eqation are investigated. It is shown exactly that the phase transition is first order.
