Title: New Duality Transformations in Orbifold Theory
Authors: J. de Boer and J. Evslin and M. B. Halpern and J. E. Wang
Abstract: We find new duality transformations which allow us to construct the stress tensors of all the twisted sectors of any orbifold A(H)/H, where A(H) is the set of all current-algebraic conformal field theories with a finite symmetry group H \subset Aut(g). The permutation orbifolds with H = Z_\lambda and H = S_3 are worked out in full as illustrations but the general formalism includes both simple and semisimple g. The motivation for this development is the recently-discovered orbifold Virasoro master equation, whose solutions are identified by the duality transformations as sectors of the permutation orbifolds A(D_\lambda)/Z_\lambda.
