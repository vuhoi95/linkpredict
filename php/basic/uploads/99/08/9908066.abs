Abstract: We discuss general multidimensional axion-dilatonic AdS gravity which may correspond to bosonic sector of Gibbons-Green-Perry (compactified) IIB supergravity with RR-scalar (axion). Using AdS/CFT correspondence the 4d conformal anomaly on axion-dilaton-gravitational background is found from SG side. It is shown that for IIB SG with axion such conformal anomaly coincides with the one obtained from QFT calculation in ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory conformally coupled with ${\cal N}=4$ conformal SG. Brief discussion on possibility to apply these results for gauged SGs is also presented.
