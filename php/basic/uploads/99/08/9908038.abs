Abstract: We review our proposal for a constructive definition of superstring, type IIB matrix model. The IIB matrix model is a manifestly covariant model for space-time and matter which possesses N=2 supersymmetry in ten dimensions. We refine our arguments to reproduce string perturbation theory based on the loop equations. We emphasize that the space-time is dynamically determined from the eigenvalue distributions of the matrices. We also explain how matter, gauge fields and gravitation appear as fluctuations around dynamically determined space-time.
