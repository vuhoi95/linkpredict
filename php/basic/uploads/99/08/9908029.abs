Title: Traversable wormholes from massless conformally coupled scalar fields
Authors: Carlos Barcelo and Matt Visser
Abstract: The massless conformally coupled scalar field is characterized by the so-called "new improved stress-energy tensor", which is capable of classically violating the null energy condition. When coupled to Einstein gravity we find a three-parameter class of exact solutions. These exact solutions include the Schwarzschild geometry, assorted naked singularities, and a large class of traversable wormholes.
