Title: Multi-TeV Scalars are Natural in Minimal Supergravity
Authors: Jonathan L. Feng and Konstantin T. Matchev and Takeo Moroi
Abstract: For a top quark mass fixed to its measured value, we find natural regions of minimal supergravity parameter space where all squarks, sleptons, and heavy Higgs scalars have masses far above 1 TeV and are possibly beyond the reach of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. This result is simply understood in terms of ``focus point'' renormalization group behavior and holds in any supergravity theory with a universal scalar mass that is large relative to other supersymmetry breaking parameters. We highlight the importance of the choice of fundamental parameters for this conclusion and for naturalness discussions in general.
