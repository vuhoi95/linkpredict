Title: Discrete Flux as Quantum Hair
Authors: Atish Dabholkar and Sandip P. Trivedi
Abstract: We investigate Yang-Mills theory on a spatial torus at finite temperature in the presence of discrete electric and magnetic fluxes using the AdS/CFT correspondence. We calculate the leading dependence of the partition function on the fluxes using the dual supergravity theory and comment upon the interpretation of these fluxes as discrete quantum hair for black holes in AdS spacetime.
