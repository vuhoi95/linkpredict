Title: Non-perturbative Supersymmetry Breaking and Finite Temperature  Instabilities in N=4 Superstrings
Authors: I. Antoniadis and J. -P. Derendinger and C. Kounnas
Abstract: We obtain the non-perturbative effective potential for the dual five-dimensional N=4 strings in the context of finite-temperature regarded as a breaking of supersymmetry into four space-time dimensions. Using the properties of gauged N=4 supergravity we derive the universal thermal effective potential describing all possible high-temperature instabilities of the known N=4 superstrings. These strings undergo a high-temperature transition to a new phase in which five-branes condense. This phase is described in detail, using both the effective supergravity and non-critical string theory in six dimensions. In the new phase, supersymmetry is perturbatively restored but broken at the non-perturbative level.
