Title: Killing Spinors and Supersymmetric AdS Orbifolds
Authors: Bahniman Ghosh and Sunil Mukhi
Abstract: We examine the behaviour of Killing spinors on AdS5 under various discrete symmetries of the spacetime. In this way we discover a number of supersymmetric orbifolds, reproducing the known ones and adding a few novel ones to the list. These orbifolds break the SO(4,2) invariance of AdS5 down to subgroups. We also make some comments on the non-compact Stiefel manifold W{4,2}.
