Title: Soft Thermal Loops in Scalar Quantum Electrodynamics
Authors: Stefan Leupold and Markus H. Thoma
Abstract: Scalar QED is used to study approximations in thermal field theory beyond the Hard Thermal Loop resummation scheme. For this purpose the photon self energy is calculated for external momenta of the order e^2T using Hard Thermal Loop resummed Green functions.
