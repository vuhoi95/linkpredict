Title: Scales of Gaugino Condensation and Supersymmetry Breaking in Nonstandard  M-Theory Embeddings
Authors: Zygmunt Lalak and Steven Thomas
Abstract: We investigate the formation of dynamical gaugino condensates and supersymmetry breaking in the compactifications of Horava-Witten theory with perturbative nonstandard embeddings. Specific models are considered where the underlying massless charged states of the condensing sector are determined by the spectra of $Z_2 \times Z_2 $ and $Z_4 $ orbifolds with nonstandard embeddings. We find among them viable examples where gaugino condensation is triggered on the wall with the weakest gauge coupling at $M_{GUT} $. In all these cases the magnitude of the condensate formed is below the energy scales at which extra dimensions are resolved, and so justifies the analysis of condensation in an effective 4-dimensional framework. We make some comments concerning the size of the largest extra dimension in the models considered. We discuss racetrack scenarios in the framework of perturbative nonstandard embeddings.
