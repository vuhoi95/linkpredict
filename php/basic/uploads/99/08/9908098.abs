Title: Partial algebraization and a q-deformed harmonic oscillator
Authors: Abilio De Freitas and Sebastian Salamo
Abstract: From the algebraic treatment of the quasi-solvable systems, and a q-deformation of the associated $su(2)$ algebra, we obtain exact solutions for the q-deformed Schrodinger equation with a 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator potential.
