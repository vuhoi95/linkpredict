Title: Equivalence of the Sutherland Model to Free Particles on a Circle
Authors: N. Gurappa and Prasanta K. Panigrahi
Abstract: A method is developed to construct the solutions of one and many variable, linear differential equations of arbitrary order. Using this, the $N$-particle Sutherland model, with pair-wise inverse sine-square interactions among the particles, is shown to be equivalent to free particles on a circle. Applicability of our method to many other few and many-body problems is also illustrated.
