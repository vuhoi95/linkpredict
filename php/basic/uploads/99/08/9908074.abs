Title: Feynman rules for non-perturbative sectors and anomalous supersymmetry  Ward identities
Authors: A. Casher and Y. Shamir
Abstract: We show that supersymmetry Ward identities contain an anomalous term which takes the form of a surface term in Hilbert space. In the one-instanton sector the anomalous term is the integral of a total rho-derivative where rho is the instanton's size. There are cases where the anomalous term is non-zero, and cannot be modified by subtractions. This constitutes a supersymmetry anomaly. The derivation is based on Feynman rules suitable for any non-perturbative sector of a weakly-coupled, renormalizable gauge theory.
