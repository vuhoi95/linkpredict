Title: Effective Theory for Color-Flavor Locking in high Density QCD
Authors: R. Casalbuoni and R. Gatto
Abstract: We describe the low energy excitations of the diquark condensates in the color-flavor locked phase of QCD with three massless flavors, at high baryon densities, in terms of a non-linear effective lagrangian. Such a lagrangian is formally seen to correspond to the lagrangian for the hidden gauge symmetry description of the effective low energy chiral lagrangian, the role of the hidden symmetry being played by color. In particular, this agrees with the conjecture that the light degrees of freedom of the two phases are in correspondence to each other (complementarity). The discussion includes consideration of the breaking of Lorentz invariance in presence of matter density.
