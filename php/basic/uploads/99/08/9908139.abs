Title: D-Brane Recoil and Supersymmetry Breaking as a Relaxation Process
Authors: A. Campbell-Smith and N. E. Mavromatos
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism for the formation of conical singularities on D-branes by means of recoil resulting from scattering of closed string states propagating in the (large) transverse dimensions. By viewing the (spatial part of the) four-dimensional world as a 3-brane with large transverse dimensions the above mechanism can lead to supersymmetry obstruction at the TeV scale. The vacuum remains supersymmetric while the mass spectrum picks up a supersymmetry obstructing mass splitting. The state with ``broken'' supersymmetry is not an equilibrium ground state, but is rather an excited state of the D-brane which relaxes to the supersymmetric ground state asymptotically in (cosmic) time.
