Title: Strong Coupling Limit of ${\cal N}=2$ SCFT Free Energy and Higher  Derivative AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: We study the role of higher derivative terms (Riemann curvature squared ones) in thermodynamics of SCFTs via AdS/CFT correspondence. Using IIB string effective action (d5 AdS gravity) with such HD terms deduced from heterotic string via duality we calculate strong coupling limit of ${\cal N}=2$ SCFT free energy with the account of next to leading term in large $N$ expansion. It is compared with perturbative result following from boundary QFT. Considering modification of such action where HD terms form Weyl squared tensor we found (strong coupling limit) free energy in such theory. It is interesting that leading and next to leading term of large $N$ expanded free energy may differ only by factor 3/4 if compare with perturbative result. Considering HD gravity as bosonic sector of some (compactified) HD supergravity we suggest new version of AdS/CFT conjecture and successfully test it on the level of free energies for ${\cal N}=2,4$ SCFTs.
