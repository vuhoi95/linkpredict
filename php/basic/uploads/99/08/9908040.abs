Title: Non-commutative World-volume Geometries: Branes on SU(2) and Fuzzy  Spheres
Authors: A. Yu. Alekseev and A. Recknagel and V. Schomerus
Abstract: The geometry of D-branes can be probed by open string scattering. If the background carries a non-vanishing B-field, the world-volume becomes non-commutative. Here we explore the quantization of world-volume geometries in a curved background with non-zero Neveu-Schwarz 3-form field strength H = dB. Using exact and generally applicable methods from boundary conformal field theory, we study the example of open strings in the SU(2) Wess-Zumino-Witten model, and establish a relation with fuzzy spheres or certain (non-associative) deformations thereof. These findings could be of direct relevance for D-branes in the presence of Neveu-Schwarz 5-branes; more importantly, they provide insight into a completely new class of world-volume geometries.
