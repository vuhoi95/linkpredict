Title: Supersymmetric Orientifolds in 6D with D-Branes at Angles
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Lars Goerlich and Boris Kors
Abstract: We study a new class of N=1 supersymmetric orientifolds in six space-time dimensions. The world-sheet parity transformation is combined with a permutation of the internal complex coordinates. In contrast to ordinary orientifolds the twisted sectors contribute to the Klein bottle amplitude leading to new tadpoles to be cancelled by twisted open string sectors. They arise from open strings stretched between D7-branes intersecting at non-trivial angles. We study in detail the Z_3, Z_4 and Z_6 permutational orientifolds obtaining in all cases anomaly free massless spectra.
