Title: Superconformal Field Theories, Multiplet Shortening, and the  AdS$_5$/SCFT$_4$ Correspondence
Authors: S. Ferrara and A. Zaffaroni
Abstract: We review the unitarity bounds and the multiplet shortening of UIR's of 4 dimensional superconformal algebras $SU(2,2|N)$, ($N=1,2,4$) in view of their dual role in the AdS/SCFT correspondence. Some applications to KK spectra, non-perturbative states and stringy states are given.
