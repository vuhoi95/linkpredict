Title: Aspects of Type 0 String Theory
Authors: R. Blumenhagen and A. Font and A. Kumar and D. Lust
Abstract: A construction of compact tachyon-free orientifolds of the non-supersymmetric Type 0B string theory is presented. Moreover, we study effective non-supersymmetric gauge theories arising on self-dual D3-branes in Type 0B orbifolds and orientifolds.
