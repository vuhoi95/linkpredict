Title: Quantum Kinetic Equations and Dark Matter Abundances Reconsidered
Authors: Anupam Singh and Mark Srednicki
Abstract: Starting from a Caldeira-Leggett model for the interaction of a system with an environment, Joichi, Matsumoto, and Yoshimura have reconsidered the derivation of the quantum Boltzmann equation. They find an extra term that accounts for the effects of virtual particles, and which drastically changes the results for relic densities of stable, weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), and for the decay products of unstable particles. We show, however, that this modified Boltzmann equation does not properly account for the interaction energy between the massive particles (which are decaying or annihilating) and the thermal bath of light particles. We argue that the conventional Boltzmann equation gives the correct result.
