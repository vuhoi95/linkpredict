Title: Nonpropagation of tachyon on the BTZ black hole in type 0B string theory
Authors: H. W. Lee and Y. S. Myung and Jin Young Kim
Abstract: We obtain the BTZ black hole (AdS$_3 \times$S$^3$) as a non-dilatonic solution from type 0B string theory. Analyzing the perturbation around this black hole background, we show that the tachyon is not a propagating mode.
