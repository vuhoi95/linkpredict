Title: Dual Anti-de Sitter Superalgebras from Partial Supersymmetry Breaking
Authors: Richard Altendorfer and Jonathan Bagger
Abstract: The partial breaking of supersymmetry in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space can be accomplished using two of four dual representations for the massive OSp(1,4) spin-3/2 multiplet. The representations can be ``unHiggsed,'' which gives rise to a set of dual N=2 supergravities and supersymmetry algebras.
