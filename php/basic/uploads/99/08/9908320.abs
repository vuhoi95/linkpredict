Authors: V. P. Gusynin and V. A. Miransky and I. A. Shovkovy
Abstract: The theory of the magnetic catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking in QED is developed. An approximation for the Schwinger-Dyson equations describing reliably this phenomenon is established, i.e., it is shown that there exists a consistent truncation of those equations in this problem. The equations are solved both analytically and numerically, and the dynamical mass of fermions is determined.
