Title: Dbrane Phase Transitions and Monodromy in K-theory
Authors: Sergei Gukov and Vipul Periwal
Abstract: Majumder and Sen have given an explicit construction of a first order phase transition in a non-supersymmetric system of Dbranes that occurs when the B field is varied. We show that the description of this transition in terms of K-theory involves a bundle of K groups of non-commutative algebras over the Kahler cone with nontrivial monodromy. Thus the study of monodromy in K groups associated with quantized algebras can be used to predict the phase structure of systems of (non-supersymmetric) Dbranes.
