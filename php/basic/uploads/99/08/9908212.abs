Authors: V. A. Miransky and I. A. Shovkovy and L. C. R. Wijewardhana
Abstract: The effective potential of composite diquark fields responsible for color symmetry breaking in cold very dense QCD, in which long-range interactions dominate, is derived. The spectrum of excitations and the universality class of this dynamics are described.
