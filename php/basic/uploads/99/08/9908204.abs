Title: The Freckled Instantons
Authors: A. Losev and N. Nekrasov and S. Shatashvili
Abstract: We study instanton-corrected renormalization group flow in the two dimensional sigma models and four dimensional gauge theory. In two dimensions we do that by replacing the non-linear supersymmetric ${\IC\IP}^{N-1}$ model by the gauged linear sigma model which is in the same universality class. We compare the moduli spaces of the instantons in the non-linear model and that of BPS field configurations in the linear model. We reduce the problem of matching of the parameters of the two systems to the intersection theory on the compact moduli space of the latter model. Both cases (2d and 4d) are unified by the notion of the {\it freckled instantons}. We also put an end to the discussion of the nature of the superpotentials $W \sim {\s} {\rm log} {\s}$ in 2d and 4d and discover the surprising disconnectnessness of the effective target space.
