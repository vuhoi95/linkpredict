Title: (2+1)-Dimensional Fermion Determinant in a Constant Background Field at  Finite Temperature and Density
Authors: Sze-Shiang Feng and Zhi Yao and De-Pin Zhao and De-Si Zang
Abstract: We evaluate exactly both the non-relativistic and relativistic fermion determinant in 2+1 dimensions in a constant background field at finite temperature. The effect of finite chemical potential is also considered. In both cases, the systems are decoupled into an infinite number of 1+1 fermions by Fourier transformation in the $\beta$-variable. The total effective actions demonstrate non-extensiveness in the $\beta$ dimension.
