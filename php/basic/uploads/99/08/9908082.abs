Title: Hyperkahler quotients and algebraic curves
Authors: Ulf Lindstrom and Martin Rocek and Rikard von Unge
Abstract: We develop a graphical representation of polynomial invariants of unitary gauge groups, and use it to find the algebraic curve corresponding to a hyperkahler quotient of a linear space. We apply this method to four dimensional ALE spaces, and for the A_k, D_k, and E_6 cases, derive the explicit relation between the deformations of the curves away from the orbifold limit and the Fayet-Iliopoulos parameters in the corresponding quotient construction. We work out the orbifold limit of E_7, E_8, and some higher dimensional examples.
