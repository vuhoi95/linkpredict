Title: Born-Infeld strings between D-branes
Authors: K. Ghoroku and K. Kaneko
Abstract: We examine the solutions of world-volume action for a D3-brane being put near other D3-brane which is replaced by the background configuration of bulk space. It is shown that the BPS solutions are not affected by the D3-brane background, and they are interpreted as dyonic strings connecting two branes. On the contrary, the non-BPS configurations are largely influenced by the background D-brane, and we find that the solutions with pure electric charge cannot connect two branes. These solutions are corresponding to the bound state of brane and anti-brane which has been found by Callan and Maldacena
