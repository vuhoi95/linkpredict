Title: Symmetry breaking boundaries II. More structures; examples
Authors: J. Fuchs and C. Schweigert
Abstract: Various structural properties of the space of symmetry breaking boundary conditions that preserve an orbifold subalgebra are established. To each such boundary condition we associate its automorphism type. It is shown that correlation functions in the presence of such boundary conditions are expressible in terms of twisted boundary blocks which obey twisted Ward identities. The subset of boundary conditions that share the same automorphism type is controlled by a classifying algebra, whose structure constants are shown to be traces on spaces of chiral blocks. T-duality on boundary conditions is not a one-to-one map in general. These structures are illustrated in a number of examples. Several applications, including the construction of non-BPS boundary conditions in string theory, are exhibited.
