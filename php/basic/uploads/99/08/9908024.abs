Title: Geometric Background for Thermal Field Theories
Authors: Massimo Blasone and Yuan-Xing Gui and Francis Vendrell
Abstract: We study a new spacetime which is shown to be the general geometrical background for Thermal Field Theories at equilibrium. The different formalisms of Thermal Field Theory are unified in a simple way in this spacetime. The set of time-paths used in the Path Ordered Method is interpreted in geometrical terms.
