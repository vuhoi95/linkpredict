Title: Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics from Light Cone Quantization
Authors: S. Hellerman and J. Polchinski
Abstract: We study the supersymmetric quantum mechanical systems that arise from discrete light cone quantization of theories with minimal supersymmetry in various dimensions. These systems, which have previously arisen in the study of black hole moduli spaces, are distinguished by having fewer fermionic fields than the familiar K\"ahler and hyper-K\"ahler models.
