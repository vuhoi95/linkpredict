Title: T-duality and The Gravitational Description Of Gauge Theories
Authors: Cesar Gomez and Pedro J. Silva
Abstract: This is a review of some basic features on the relation between supergravity and pure gauge theories with special emphasis on the relation between T-duality and supersymmetry. Some new results concerning the interplay between T-duality and near horizon geometries are presented
