Title: Heat Kernel Expansion for Semitransparent Boundaries
Authors: M. Bordag and D. V. Vassilevich
Abstract: We study the heat kernel for an operator of Laplace type with a $\delta$-function potential concentrated on a closed surface. We derive the general form of the small $t$ asymptotics and calculate explicitly several first heat kernel coefficients.
