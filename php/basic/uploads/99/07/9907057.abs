Title: Integration of the SL(2,R)/U(1) Gauged WZNW Model with Periodic Boundary  Conditions
Authors: Uwe Mueller and Gerhard Weigt
Abstract: Gauged WZNW models are integrable conformal field theories. We integrate the classical \slu{} theory with periodic boundary conditions, which describes closed strings moving in a curved target-space geometry. We calculate its Poisson bracket structure by solving an initial state problem. The results differ from previous field-theoretic calculations due to zero modes. For a future exact canonical quantization the physical fields are (non-locally) transformed onto canonical free fields.
