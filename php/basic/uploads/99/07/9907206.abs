Title: AdS/CFT and BPS Strings in Four Dimensions
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We consider N=2 superconformal theories defined on a 3+1 dimensional hyperplane intersection of two sets of M5 branes. These theories have (tensionless) BPS string solitons. We use a dual supergravity formulation to deduce some of their properties via the AdS/CFT correspondence.
