Title: Anomalies in String Theory with D-Branes
Authors: Daniel S. Freed and Edward Witten
Abstract: We analyze global anomalies for elementary Type II strings in the presence of D-branes. Global anomaly cancellation gives a restriction on the D-brane topology. This restriction makes possible the interpretation of D-brane charge as an element of K-theory.
