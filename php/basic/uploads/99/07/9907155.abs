Title: Light-cone Quantum Mechanics of the Eleven-dimensional Superparticle
Authors: Michael B. Green and Michael Gutperle and Hwang-h. Kwon
Abstract: The linearized interactions of eleven-dimensional supergravity are obtained in a manifestly supersymmetric light-cone gauge formalism. These vertices are used to calculate certain one-loop processes involving external gravitini, antisymmetric three-form potentials and gravitons, thereby determining some protected terms in the effective action of M-theory compactified on a two-torus.
