Title: Dyonic Instantons in Five Dimensional Gauge Theories
Authors: Neil. D. Lambert and David Tong
Abstract: We show that there exist finite energy, non-singular instanton solutions for five-dimensional theories with broken gauge symmetry. The soliton is supported against collapse by a non-zero electric charge. The low-energy dynamics of these solutions is described by motion on the ADHM moduli space with potential.
