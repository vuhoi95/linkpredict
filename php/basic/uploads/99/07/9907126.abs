Title: Elastic Parton-Parton Scattering from AdS/CFT
Authors: Mannque Rho and Sang-Jin Sin and Ismail Zahed
Abstract: Using the AdS/CFT correspondence and the eikonal approximation, we evaluate the elastic parton-parton scattering amplitude at large $N$ and strong coupling $g^2N$ in N=4 SYM. We obtain a scattering amplitude with a Regge behavior that unitarizes at large $\sqrt{s}$.
