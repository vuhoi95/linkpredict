Title: Solution of Schwinger-Dyson Equations for ${\cal PT}$-Symmetric Quantum  Field Theory
Authors: Carl M. Bender and Kimball A. Milton and Van M. Savage
Abstract: In recent papers it has been observed that non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, such as those describing $ig\phi^3$ and $-g\phi^4$ field theories, still possess real positive spectra so long as the weaker condition of ${\cal PT}$ symmetry holds. This allows for the possibility of new kinds of quantum field theories that have strange and quite unexpected properties. In this paper a technique based on truncating the Schwinger-Dyson equations is presented for renormalizing and solving such field theories. Using this technique it is argued that a $-g\phi^4$ scalar quantum field theory in four-dimensional space-time is renormalizable, is asymptotically free, has a nonzero value of $<0|\phi|0>$, and has a positive definite spectrum. Such a theory might be useful in describing the Higgs boson.
