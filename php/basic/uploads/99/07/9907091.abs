Title: Monople and dyon solutions in the Einstein Yang-Mills theory in  asymptotically AdS space
Authors: Yutaka Hosotani and Jefferson Bjoraker
Abstract: Regular monopole and dyon solutions to the SU(2) Einstein Yang-Mills equations in asymptotically anti-de Sitter space are discussed. A class of monopole solutions are shown to be stable against spherically symmetric linear perturbations.
