Abstract: We construct the Georgi-Glashow Lagrangian for gauge group SU_q(n). Breaking this symmetry spontaneously gives q-dependent masses of gauge field and vacuum manifold. It turned out that the vacuum manifold is parameterized by the non-commutative quantities. We showed that the monopole solutions exist in this model, which is indicated by the presence of the BPS states.
