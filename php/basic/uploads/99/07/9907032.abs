Title: Generalized Second Law in String Cosmology
Authors: Ram Brustein and Stefano Foffa and Riccardo Sturani
Abstract: A generalized second law in string cosmology accounts for geometric and quantum entropy in addition to ordinary sources of entropy. The proposed generalized second law forbids singular string cosmologies, under certain conditions, and forces a graceful exit transition from dilaton-driven inflation by bounding curvature and dilaton kinetic energy.
