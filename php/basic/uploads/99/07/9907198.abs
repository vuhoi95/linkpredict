Title: Tracker fields from nonminimally coupled theory
Authors: R. de Ritis and A. A. Marino and C. Rubano and P. Scudellaro
Abstract: We extend the concept of quintessence to a flat nonminimally coupled scalar - tensor theories of gravity. By means of Noether's symmetries for the cosmological pointlike Lagrangian L, it is possible to exhibit exact solutions for a class of models depending on a free parameter s. This parameter comes out in the relationship existing between the coupling F(\phi) and the potential V(\phi) because of such a symmetry for L. When inverse power law potentials are taken in account, a whole family of exact solutions parametrized by such an s is proposed as a class of tracker fields, and some considerations are made about them.
