Title: Ultraviolet and Infrared freedom from string amplitudes
Authors: Enrique Alvarez and Cesar Gomez
Abstract: The infinite tension limit of string amplitudes is examined with some care, identifying the part responsible of diamagnetic behaviour as well as a peculiar paramagnetic {\em tachyon magnifying} responsible of asymptotic freedom. The way string theory represents abelian gauge theories is connected with the non-planar reggeon/pomeron amplitude and a nontrivial beta function is found in the low energy limit of a single D-brane.
