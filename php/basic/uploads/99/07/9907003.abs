Title: Holography and Rotating AdS Black Holes
Authors: D. S. Berman and Maulik K. Parikh
Abstract: We probe the AdS/CFT correspondence by comparing the thermodynamics of a rotating black hole in five-dimensional anti-de Sitter space with that of a conformal field theory on $S^3$, whose parameters come from the boundary of spacetime. In the high temperature limit, we find agreement between gauge theory and gravity in all thermodynamic quantities upto the same factor of 4/3 that appears for nonrotating holes.
