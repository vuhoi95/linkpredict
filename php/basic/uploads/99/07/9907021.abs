Title: Supersymmetric KP hierarchy in N=1 superspace and its N=2 reductions
Authors: Olaf Lechtenfeld and Alexander Sorin
Abstract: A wide class of N=2 reductions of the supersymmetric KP hierarchy in N=1 superspace is described. This class includes a new N=2 supersymmetric generalization of the Toda chain hierarchy. The Lax pair representations of the bosonic and fermionic flows, local and nonlocal Hamiltonians, finite and infinite discrete symmetries, first two Hamiltonian structures and the recursion operator of this hierarchy are constructed. Its secondary reduction to new N=2 supersymmetric modified KdV hierarchy is discussed.
