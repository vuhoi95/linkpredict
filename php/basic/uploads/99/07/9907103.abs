Title: Non-Abelian Berry connections for quantum computation
Authors: Jiannis Pachos and Paolo Zanardi and Mario Rasetti
Abstract: In the holonomic approach to quantum computation information is encoded in a degenerate eigenspace of a parametric family of Hamiltonians and manipulated by the associated holonomic gates. These are realized in terms of the non-abelian Berry connection and are obtained by driving the control parameters along adiabatic loops. We show how it is possible, for a specific model, to explicitly determine the loops generating any desired logical gate, thus producing a universal set of unitary transformations. In a multi-partite system unitary transformations can be implemented efficiently by sequences of local holonomic gates. Moreover a conceptual scheme for obtaining the required Hamiltonian family, based on frequently repeated pulses, is discussed, together with a possible process whereby the initial state can be prepared and the final one can be measured.
