Title: Vortex String Dynamics in an External Antisymmetric Tensor Field
Authors: K. Lee and Q-Han Park and H. J. Shin
Abstract: We study the Lund-Regge equation that governs the motion of strings in a constant background antisymmetric tensor field by using the duality between the Lund-Regge equation and the complex sine-Gordon equation. Similar to the cases of vortex filament configurations in fluid dynamics, we find various exact solitonic string configurations which are the analogue of the Kelvin wave, the Hasimoto soliton and the smoke ring. In particular, using the duality relation, we obtain a completely new type of configuration which corresponds to the breather of the complex sine-Gordon equation.
