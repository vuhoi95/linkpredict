Title: Generalized AdS-CFT Correspondence for Matrix Theory in the Large N  limit
Authors: Yasuhiro Sekino and Tamiaki Yoneya
Abstract: Guided by the generalized conformal symmetry, we investigate the extension of AdS-CFT correspondence to the matrix model of D-particles in the large N limit. We perform a complete harmonic analysis of the bosonic linearized fluctuations around a heavy D-particle background in IIA supergravity in 10 dimensions and find that the spectrum precisely agrees with that of the physical operators of Matrix theory. The explicit forms of two-point functions give predictions for the large $N$ behavior of Matrix theory with some special cutoff. We discuss the possible implications of our results for the large N dynamics of D-particles and for the Matrix-theory conjecture. We find an anomalous scaling behavior with respect to the large N limit associated to the infinite momentum limit in 11 dimensions, suggesting the existence of a screening mechanism for the transverse extension of the system.
