Title: Left-Right Gauge Model in Nonassociative Geometry
Authors: A. Benslama and N. Mebarki
Abstract: We reformulate the left-right gauge model of Pati-Mohapatra in the framework of nonassociative geometry. At the tree level we obtain the same mixing angles as the ones predicted by SO(10) GUT. However the model does not show the parity breakdown.
