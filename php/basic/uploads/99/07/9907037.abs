Title: Superintegrability on the two dimensional hyperboloid II
Authors: E. G. Kalnins and W. Miller Jr and Ye. M. Hakobyan and G. S. Pogosyan
Abstract: This work is devoted to the investigation of the quantum mechanical systems on the two dimensional hyperboloid which admit separation of variables in at least two coordinate systems. Here we consider two potentials introduced in a paper of C.P.Boyer, E.G.Kalnins and P.Winternitz, which haven't yet been studied. We give an example of an interbasis expansion and work out the structure of the quadratic algebra generated by the integrals of motion.
