Title: Non-perturbative states in the three-dimensional phi^4 theory
Authors: M. Caselle and M. Hasenbusch and P. Provero
Abstract: We study the spectrum of massive excitations of the three-dimensional phi^4 and Ising models, in the broken-symmetry phase. Using a variational method, we show that the spectrum contains all the 0+ states that one expects from duality with the glueball spectrum of the Z(2) gauge model. From the point of view of continuum phi^4 theory, we show that at least one of the states we find has a non-perturbative origin.
