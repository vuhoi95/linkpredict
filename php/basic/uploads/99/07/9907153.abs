Title: One-parameter family of selfdual solutions in classical Yang-Mills  theory
Authors: Masaru Kamata and Atsushi Nakamula
Abstract: The ADHM construction, which yields (anti-)selfdual configurations in classical Yang-Mills theories, is applied to an infinite dimensional l^2 vector space, and as a consequence, a family of (anti-)selfdual configurations with a parameter q is obtained for SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. This l^2 formulation can be seen as a q-analog of Nahm's monopole construction, so that the configuration approaches the BPS monopole at q->1 limit.
