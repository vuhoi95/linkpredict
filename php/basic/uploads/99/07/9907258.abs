Title: Stringy Model for QCD at Finite Density and Generalized Hagedorn  Temperature
Authors: R. C. Brower and J. McGreevy and C-I Tan
Abstract: Using generic properties of string theories, we show how interesting non-perturbative features of QCD can be exploited in heavy ion collisions. In particular, a generalized "semi-circle" law for the phase diagram in the temperature-chemical potential plane is derived.
