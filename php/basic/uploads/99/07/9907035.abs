Title: Monopole-Skyrmions
Authors: B. Kleihaus and D. H. Tchrakian and F. Zimmerschied
Abstract: A systematic numerical study of the classical solutions to the combined system consisting of the Georgi-Glashow model and the SO(3) gauged Skyrme model is presented. The gauging of the Skyrme system permits a lower bound on the energy, so that the solutions of the composite system can be topologically stable. The solutions feature some very interesting bifurcation patterns, and it is found that some branches of these solutions are unstable.
