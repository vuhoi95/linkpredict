Title: Non-BPS String Junctions and Dyons in N=4 Super-Yang-Mills
Authors: Theodora Ioannidou and Paul Sutcliffe
Abstract: We construct non-BPS dyon solutions of N=4 SU(n) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. These solutions are the worldvolume solitons which describe non-BPS Type IIB non-planar string junctions connecting n parallel D3-branes. The solutions are smooth deformations of the 1/4 BPS states which describe planar string junctions.
