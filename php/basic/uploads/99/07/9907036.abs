Title: Quantum corrections for the Reisner-Nordstrom black hole
Authors: Maja Buric and Voja Radovanovic
Abstract: We calculate the quantum corrections of geometric and thermodynamic quantities for the Reisner-Nordstrom charged black hole, within the context of 2D spherically symmetric dilaton gravity model. Special attention is payed to the quantum corrections of the extreme Reisner-Nordstrom solution. We find a state of the extreme black hole with regular behaviour on the horizon.
