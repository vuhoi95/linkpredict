Title: Wormhole as the end state of two-dimensional black hole evaporation
Authors: S. -W. Kim and H. Lee
Abstract: We present a specific two-dimensional dilaton gravity model in which a black hole evaporates leaving a wormhole at the end state. As the black hole formed by infalling matter in a initially static spacetime evaporates by emitting Hawking radiation, the black hole singularity that is initially hidden behind a timelike apparent horizon meets the shrinking horizon. At this intersection point, we imposed boundary conditions which require disappearance of the black hole singularity and generation of the exotic matter which is the source of the wormhole as the end state of the black hole. These, of course, preserve energy conservation and continuity of the metric.
