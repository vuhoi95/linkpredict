Title: Master Equation for Lagrangian Gauge Symmetries
Authors: R. Banerjee and H. J. Rothe and K. D. Rothe
Abstract: Using purely Hamiltonian methods we derive a simple differential equation for the generator of the most general local symmetry transformation of a Lagrangian. The restrictions on the gauge parameters found by earlier approaches are easily reproduced from this equation. We also discuss the connection with the purely Lagrangian approach. The general considerations are applied to the Yang-Mills theory.
