Abstract: We quantize the superstring on the AdS_2 x S^2 background with Ramond-Ramond flux using a PSU(1,1|2)/U(1) x U(1) sigma model with a WZ term. One-loop conformal invariance of the model is guaranteed by a general mechanism which holds for coset spaces G/H where G is Ricci-flat and H is the invariant locus of a Z_4 automorphism of G. This mechanism gives conformal theories for the PSU(1,1|2) x PSU(2|2)/SU(2) x SU(2) and PSU(2,2|4)/SO(4,1) x SO(5) coset spaces, suggesting our results might be useful for quantizing the superstring on AdS_3 x S^3 and AdS_5 x S^5 backgrounds.
