Title: D1/D5 Moduli in SCFT and Gauge Theory, and Hawking Radiation
Authors: Justin R. David and Gautam Mandal and Spenta R. Wadia
Abstract: We construct marginal operators of the orbifold SCFT corresponding to all twenty near-horizon moduli in supergravity, including operators involving twist fields which correspond to the blowing up modes. We identify the operators with the supergravity moduli in a 1-1 fashion by inventing a global SO(4) algebra in the SCFT. We analyze the gauge dynamics of the D1/D5 system relevant to the splitting $(Q_1,Q_5)\to (Q'_1,Q'_5)+ (Q''_1,Q''_5)$ with the help of a linear sigma model. We show in supergravity as well as in SCFT that the absorption cross-section for minimal scalars is the same all over the near-horizon moduli space.
