Abstract: We study the ultraviolet asymptotics in affine Toda theories. These models are considered as perturbed non-affine Toda theories. We calculate the reflection amplitudes, which relate different exponential fields with the same quantum numbers. Using these amplitudes we derive the quantization condition for the vacuum wave function, describing zero-mode dynamics, and calculate the UV asymptotics of the effective central charge. These asymptotics are in a good agreement with thermodynamic Bethe ansatz results.
