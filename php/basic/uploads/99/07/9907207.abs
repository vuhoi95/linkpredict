Title: Quintessence duality
Authors: R. de Ritis and A. A. Marino and C. Rubano and P. Scudellaro
Abstract: We join quintessence cosmological scenarios with the duality simmetry existing in string dilaton cosmologies. Actually, we consider the tracker potential type $V = V_0/{\phi}^{\alpha}$ and show that duality is only established if $\alpha = - 2$.
