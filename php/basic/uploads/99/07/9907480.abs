Title: The Standard Model and the Generalized Covariant Derivative
Authors: M. Chaves and H. Morales
Abstract: The generalized covariant derivative, that uses both scalar and vector bosons, is defined. It is shown how a grand unified theory of the Standard Model can be constructed using a generalized Yang-Mills theory.
