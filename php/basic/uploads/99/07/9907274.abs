Title: No Spontaneous Breakdown of Chiral Symmetry in Nambu-Jona-Lasinio Model
Authors: H. Kleinert and B. Van den Bossche
Abstract: We argue that the spontaneous breakdown of symmetry in the chirally symmetric Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model which was supposed to illustrate the origin of the low mass of pions in hadron physics does not occur due to strong fluctuations in the sigma - pi field space. Although quarks acquire a constituent mass, sigma and pi turn out to have equal heavy masses of the order of the constituent quark mass.
