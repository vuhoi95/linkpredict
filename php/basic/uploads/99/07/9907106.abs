Title: ADM mass of the quantum-corrected Schwarzchild black hole
Authors: Maja Buric and Voja Radovanovic
Abstract: We study the hamiltonian and constraints of spherically symmetric dilaton gravity model. We find the ADM mass of the solution representing the Schwarzchild black hole in thermal equilibrium with the Hawking radiation.
