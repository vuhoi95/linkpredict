Abstract: We study classical solutions of a particular version of the modified Skyrme model in (3+1) dimensions. The model possesses Skyrmion solutions as well as stable domain walls that connect different vacua of the theory. We show that there is an attractive interaction between Skyrmions and domain walls. Thus Skyrmions can be captured by the domain walls. We show also that, when the mass term is of a special type, the model possesses bound states of Skyrmions and of the domain wall. They look like deformed 2-dimensional Skyrmions captured by the wall. The field configurations of these solutions can interpreted as having come from the evolution of the 3-dimensional Skyrmions captured by the domain wall. For more conventional choices of the mass term of the model in the model the attraction between the Skyrmions and the wall leads to the capture of the Skyrmions which are then turned into topological waves which spread out on the wall. We have observed, numerically, such captures and the emission of the waves. We speculate that this observation may be useful in the explanation of the problem of baryogenesis and baryon-antibaryon asymmetry of the Universe.
