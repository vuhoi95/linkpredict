Title: Neutrino Masses and Oscillations in Models with Large Extra Dimensions
Authors: R. N. Mohapatra and S. Nandi and A. PÃ©rez-Lorenzana
Abstract: We discuss the profile of neutrino masses and mixings in models with large extra dimensions when right handed neutrinos are present in the branes along with the usual standard model particles. In these models, string scale must be bigger than $10^{8}$ GeV to have desired properties for the neutrinos at low energies. The lightest neutrino mass is zero and there is oscillations to sterile neutrinos that are different from other models with the bulk neutrino.
