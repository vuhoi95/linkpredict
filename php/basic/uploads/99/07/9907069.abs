Title: Vortex Strings and Nonabelian sine-Gordon Theories
Authors: Q-Han Park and H. J. Shin
Abstract: We generalize the Lund-Regge model for vortex string dynamics in 4-dimensional Minkowski space to the arbitrary n-dimensional case. The n-dimensional vortex equation is identified with a nonabelian sine-Gordon equation and its integrability is proven by finding the associated linear equations of the inverse scattering. An explicit expression of vortex coordinates in terms of the variables of the nonabelian sine-Gordon system is derived. In particular, we obtain the n-dimensional vortex soliton solution of the Hasimoto-type from the one soliton solution of the nonabelian sine-Gordon equation.
