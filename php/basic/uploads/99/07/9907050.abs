Title: The Chiral WZNW Phase Space and its Poisson-Lie Groupoid
Authors: J. Balog and L. Feher and L. Palla
Abstract: The precise relationship between the arbitrary monodromy dependent 2-form appearing in the chiral WZNW symplectic form and the `exchange r-matrix' that governs the corresponding Poisson brackets is established. Generalizing earlier results related to diagonal monodromy, the exchange r-matrices are shown to satisfy a new dynamical generalization of the classical modified Yang-Baxter equation, which is found to admit an interpretation in terms of (new) Poisson-Lie groupoids. Dynamical exchange r-matrices for which right multiplication yields a classical or a Poisson-Lie symmetry on the chiral WZNW phase space are presented explicitly.
