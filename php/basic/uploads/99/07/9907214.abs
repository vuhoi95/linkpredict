Title: Critical Exponents from Five-Loop Strong-Coupling phi^4-Theory in 4-  epsilon Dimensions
Authors: Hagen Kleinert and Verena Schulte-Frohlinde
Abstract: With the help of strong-coupling theory, we calculate the critical exponents of O(N)-symmetric phi^4-theories in 4- epsilon dimensions up to five loops with an accuracy comparable to that achieved by Borel-type resummation methods.
