Title: Non-Abelian Stokes Theorem for Wilson Loops Associated with General  Gauge Groups
Authors: M. Hirayama and M. Ueno
Abstract: A formula constituting the non-Abelian Stokes theorem for general semi-simple compact gauge groups is presented. The formula involves a path integral over a group space and is applicable to Wilson loop variables irrespective of the topology of loops. Some simple expressions analogous to the 't Hooft tensor of a magnetic monopole are given for the 2-form of interest. A special property in the case of the fundamental representation of the group SU(N) is pointed out.
