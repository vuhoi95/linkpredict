Title: D-term Spectroscopy in Realistic Heterotic-String Models
Authors: A. Dedes and A. E. Faraggi
Abstract: The emergence of free fermionic string models with solely the MSSM charged spectrum below the string scale provides further evidence to the assertion that the true string vacuum is connected to the Z_2 x Z_2 orbifold in the vicinity of the free fermionic point in the Narain moduli space. An important property of the Z_2 x Z_2 orbifold is the cyclic permutation symmetry between the three twisted sectors. If preserved in the three generations models the cyclic permutation symmetry results in a family universal anomalous U(1)_A, which is instrumental in explaining squark degeneracy, provided that the dominant component of supersymmetry breaking arises from the U(1)_A D-term. Interestingly, the contribution of the family--universal D_A-term to the squark masses may be intra-family non-universal, and may differ from the usual (universal) boundary conditions assumed in the MSSM. We contemplate how D_A--term spectroscopy may be instrumental in studying superstring models irrespective of our ignorance of the details of supersymmetry breaking. We examine the possible effect of the intra--family non--universality on the resulting SUSY spectrum and the values of the strong coupling, effective weak mixing angle and W-gauge boson mass, up to a two loop accuracy, in the two models (universal and non-universal). We find that non universality relaxes the constraint of color and charge breaking minima which appears in the universal case. In addition, it predicts a 3% smaller value of \alpha_s due to different threshold masses obtained in the latter scenario. Finally, we present the experimentally allowed predictions of the two models in an M_0 and M_{1/2} parameter space.
