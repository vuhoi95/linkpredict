Title: Asymptotics of correlation function of twist fields in two-dimensional  lattice fermion model
Authors: Anatolij I. Bugrij and Vitalij N. Shadura
Abstract: In two-dimensional lattice fermion model a determinant representation for the two-point correlation function of the twist field in the disorder phase is obtained. This field is defined by twisted boundary conditions for lattice fermion field. The large distance asymptotics of the correlation function is calculated at the critical point and in the scaling region. The result is compared with the vacuum expectation values of exponential fields in the sine-Gordon model conjectured by S.Lukyanov and A.Zamolodchikov.
