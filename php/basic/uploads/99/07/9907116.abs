Title: Black Hole Emission Rates and the AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: Saurya Das and Arundhati Dasgupta
Abstract: We study the emission rates of scalar, spinor and vector particles from a 5 dimensional black hole for arbitrary partial waves. The solution is lifted to 6 dimensions, and the near horizon $ BTZ \times S^3$ geometry of the black hole solution is probed to determine the greybody factors. We show that the exact decay rates can be reproduced from a $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theory which lies on the boundary of the near horizon geometry. The AdS/CFT correspondence is used to determine the dimension of the CFT operators corresponding to the bulk fields. These operators couple to plane waves incident on the CFT from infinity to produce emission in the bulk.
