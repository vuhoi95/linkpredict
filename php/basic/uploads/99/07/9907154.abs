Title: Barrett-Crane model from a Boulatov-Ooguri field theory over a  homogeneous space
Authors: R. De Pietri and L. Freidel and K. Krasnov and C. Rovelli
Abstract: Boulatov and Ooguri have generalized the matrix models of 2d quantum gravity to 3d and 4d, in the form of field theories over group manifolds. We show that the Barrett-Crane quantum gravity model arises naturally from a theory of this type, but restricted to the homogeneous space S^3=SO(4)/SO(3), as a term in its Feynman expansion. From such a perspective, 4d quantum spacetime emerges as a Feynman graph, in the manner of the 2d matrix models. This formalism provides a precise meaning to the ``sum over triangulations'', which is presumably necessary for a physical interpretation of a spin foam model as a theory of gravity. In addition, this formalism leads us to introduce a natural alternative model, which might have relevance for quantum gravity.
