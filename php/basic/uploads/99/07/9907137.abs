Title: The non chiral fusion rules in rational conformal field theories
Authors: A. Rida and T. Sami
Abstract: We introduce a general method in order to construct the non chiral fusion rules which determine the operator content of the operator product algebra for rational conformal field theories. We are particularly interested in the models of the complementary D-like solutions of modular invariant partition functions with cyclic center Zn. We find that the non chiral fusion rules have a Zn-grading structure.
