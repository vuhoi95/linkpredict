Title: High energy scattering and the AdS/CFT correspondence
Authors: R. A. Janik and R. Peschanski
Abstract: We consider small angle and large impact parameter high energy scattering of colourless states in SYM using the AdS/CFT correspondence. The gauge theory scattering amplitude is linked with a correlation function of tilted Wilson loops, which can be calculated by the exchange of bulk supergravity fields between the two corresponding string worldsheets. We identify the dominant contributions, which all correspond to real phase shifts. In particular, we find a contribution of the bulk graviton which gives an unexpected `gravity-like' $s^1$ behaviour of the gauge theory phase shift in a specific range of energies and (large) impact parameters.
