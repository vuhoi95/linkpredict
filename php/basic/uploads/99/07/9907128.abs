Title: The longitudinal fivebrane and tachyon condensation in matrix theory
Authors: M. Massar and J. Troost
Abstract: We study a configuration in matrix theory carying longitudinal fivebrane charge, i.e. a D0-D4 bound state. We calculate the one-loop effective potential between a D0-D4 bound state and a D0-anti-D4 bound state and compare our results to a supergravity calculation. Next, we identify the tachyonic fluctuations in the D0-D4 and D0-anti-D4 system. We analyse classically the action for these tachyons and find solutions to the equations of motion corresponding to tachyon condensation.
