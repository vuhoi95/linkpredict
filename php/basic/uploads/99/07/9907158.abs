Title: The Confining String from the Soft Dilaton Theorem
Authors: Enrique Alvarez and Cesar Gomez
Abstract: A candidate for the confining string of gauge theories is constructed via a representation of the ultraviolet divergences of quantum field theory by a closed string dilaton insertion, computed through the soft dilaton theorem. The resulting (critical) confining string is conformally invariant, singles out naturally $d=4$ dimensions, and can not be used to represent theories with Landau poles.
