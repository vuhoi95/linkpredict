Title: Quantum Effects in the Presence of Expanding Semi-Transparent Spherical  Mirrors
Authors: V. Frolov and D. Singh
Abstract: We study quantum effects in the presence of a spherical semi-transparent mirror or a system of two concentric mirrors which expand with a constant acceleration in a flat D-dimensional spacetime. Using the Euclidean approach, we obtain expressions for fluctuations and the renormalized value of stress-energy tensor for a scalar non-minimally coupled massless field. Explicit expressions are obtained for the energy fluxes at the null infinity generated by such mirrors in the physical spacetime and their properties are discussed.
