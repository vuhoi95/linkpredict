Abstract: We discuss Z_2 \times Z_2 orientifolds where the orbifold twists are accompanied by shifts on momentum or winding lattice states. The models contain variable numbers of D5 branes, whose massless (and, at times, even massive) modes have variable numbers of supersymmetries. We display new type-I models with partial supersymmetry breaking N=2 \to N=1, N=4 \to N=1 and N=4 \to N=2. The geometry of these models is rather rich: the shift operations create brane multiplets related by orbifold transformations that support gauge groups of reduced rank. Some of the models are deformations of six-dimensional supersymmetric type-I models, while others have dual M-theory descriptions.
