Title: Duality of Coordinates and Matter Fields in Curved Spacetime
Authors: M. A. De Andrade and I. V. Vancea
Abstract: We show that there exists a duality between the local coordinates and the solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation in curved spacetime in the same sense as in the Minkowski spacetime. However, the duality in curved spacetime does not have the same generality as in flat spacetime and it holds only if the system satisfies certain constraints. We derive these constraints and the basic equations of duality and discuss the implications in the quantum theory.
