Title: Exact fermion zero-mode for the new calorons
Authors: M. N. Chernodub and Thomas C. Kraan and Pierre van Baal
Abstract: We construct the fermion zero-mode for arbitrary charge one SU(n) calorons with non-trivial holonomy, both in the finite temperature context (anti-periodic boundary conditions in time) and in the Kaluza-Klein compactification context (periodic boundary conditions in time). The zero-mode is localised on one of the constituent monopoles and we discuss a relation to the Callias index theorem.
