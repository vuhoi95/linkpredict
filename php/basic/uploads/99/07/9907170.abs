Title: A Calibration Bound for the M-Theory Fivebrane
Authors: O. Baerwald and N. D. Lambert and P. C. West
Abstract: We construct a covariant bound on the energy-momentum of the M-fivebrane which is saturated by all supersymmetric configurations. This leads to a generalised notion of a calibrated geometry for M-fivebranes when the worldvolume gauge field is non-zero. The generalisation relevant for Dp-branes is also given.
