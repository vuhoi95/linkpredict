Title: Further comments on the background field method and gauge invariant  effective actions
Authors: Carlo Becchi and Renzo Collina
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to give a firm and clear proof of the existence in the background field framework of a gauge invariant effective action for any gauge theory ({\it background gauge equivalence}). Here by effective action we mean a functional whose Legendre transform restricted to the physical shell generates the matrix elements of the connected $S$-matrix. We resume and clarify a former argument due to Abbott, Grisaru and Schaefer based on the gauge-artifact nature of the background fields and on the identification of the gauge invariant effective action with the generator of the proper, background field, vertices.
