Title: Remarks on Covariant Matrix Strings
Authors: Laurent Baulieu and Celine Laroche and Nikita Nekrasov
Abstract: We address the issue of the worldsheet and spacetime covariant formulation for matrix strings. The problem is solved in the limit of vanishing string coupling. To go beyond the g_s = 0 limit, we propose a topological quantum field theory as a twisted candidate. Our model involves the generalized octonionic or SU(4) instanton equations defined in eight dimensions for a supersymmetric U(N) Yang--Mills field living on a special holonomy manifold. The question of untwisting this matrix model into an anomaly free theory enlightens the need for an "extended" 2d-gravity sector, that we suggest could be (partially twisted) W-gravity.
