Title: Some Cubic Couplings in Type IIB Supergravity on $AdS_5\times S^5$ and  Three-point Functions in SYM_4 at Large N
Authors: G. Arutyunov and S. Frolov
Abstract: All cubic couplings in type IIB supergravity on $AdS_5\times S^5$ that involve two scalar fields $s^I$ that are mixtures of the five form field strength on $S^5$ and the trace of the graviton on $S^5$ are derived by using the covariant equations of motion and the quadratic action for type IIB supergravity on $AdS_5\times S^5$. All corresponding three-point functions in SYM$_4$ are calculated in the supergravity approximation. It is pointed out that the scalars $s^I$ correspond not to the chiral primary operators in the ${\cal N}=4$ SYM but rather to a proper extension of the operators.
