Title: Abelian gauge fields coupled to simplicial quantum gravity
Authors: J. Ambjorn and K. N. Anagnostopoulos and J. Jurkiewicz
Abstract: We study the coupling of Abelian gauge theories to four-dimensional simplicial quantum gravity. The gauge fields live on dual links. This is the correct formulation if we want to compare the effect of gauge fields on geometry with similar effects studied so far for scalar fields. It shows that gauge fields couple equally weakly to geometry as scalar fields, and it offers an understanding of the relation between measure factors and Abelian gauge fields observed so-far.
