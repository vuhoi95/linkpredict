Title: Qualitative Analysis of Early Universe Cosmologies
Authors: Andrew P Billyard and Alan A Coley and James E Lidsey
Abstract: A qualitative analysis is presented for a class of homogeneous cosmologies derived from the string effective action when a cosmological constant is present in the matter sector of the theory. Such a term has significant effects on the qualitative dynamics. For example, models exist which undergo a series of oscillations between expanding and contracting phases due to the existence of a heteroclinic cycle in the phase space. Particular analytical solutions corresponding to the equilibrium points are also found.
