Title: Linking a Minimal Theoretical Model of Scale Factor Evolution with  Observational Universe Information
Authors: M. P. Infante and N. Sanchez
Abstract: We study several approaches for constructing a minimal model of Universe evolution by matching different stages of scale factor laws. We discuss the continuity in the transitions among the stages and the time variables involved. We develop a way to modelize these transitions without loss of observational predictability. The key is the scale factor and its connection with minimal but well stablished observational information (transition times and expansion ratii). This construction is clearly useful in metric perturbations type computations, but it can be applied in whatever subject dealing with a cosmology involving different evolution stages.
