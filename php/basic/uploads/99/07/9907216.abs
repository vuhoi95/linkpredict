Abstract: We give full details for the computation of the Kaluza--Klein mass spectrum of Type IIB Supergravity on AdS_5 x T^{11}, with T^{11}=SU(2)xSU(2)/U(1), that has recently lead to both stringent tests and interesting predictions on the AdS_5/CFT_4 correspondence for N=1 SCFT's (hep-th/9905226). We exhaustively explain how KK states arrange into SU(2,2|1) supermultiplets, and stress some relevant features of the T^{11} manifold, such as the presence of topological modes in the spectrum originating from the existence of non-trivial 3-cycles. The corresponding Betti vector multiplet is responsible for the extra baryonic symmetry in the boundary CFT. More generally, we use the simple T^{11} coset as a laboratory to revive the technique and show the power of KK harmonic expansion, in view of the present attempts to probe along the same lines also M-theory compactifications and the AdS_4/CFT_3 map.
