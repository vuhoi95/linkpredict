Title: General quantum antibrackets
Authors: Igor Batalin and Robert Marnelius
Abstract: The recently introduced quantum antibracket is further generalized allowing for the defining odd operator Q to be arbitrary. We give exact formulas for higher quantum antibrackets of arbitrary orders and their generalized Jacobi identities. Their applications to BV-quantization and BFV-BRST quantization are then reviewed including some new aspects.
