Title: Some Comments on the Spin of the Chern - Simons Vortices
Authors: R. Banerjee and P. Mukherjee
Abstract: We compute the spin of both the topological and nontopological solitons of the Chern - Simons - Higgs model by using our approach based on constrained analysis. We also propose an extension of our method to the non - relativistic Chern - Simons models. The spin formula for both the relativistic and nonrelativistic theories turn out to be structurally identical. This form invariance manifests the topological origin of the Chern - Simons term responsible for inducing fractional spin. Also, some comparisons with the existing results are done.
