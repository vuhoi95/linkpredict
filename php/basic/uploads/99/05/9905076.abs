Title: Action principles, restoration of BRS symmetry and the renormalization  group equation for chiral non-Abelian gauge theories in dimensional  renormalization with a non-anticommuting $Î³_5$
Authors: C. P. Martin and D. Sanchez-Ruiz
Abstract: The one-loop renormalization of a general chiral gauge theory without scalar and Majorana fields is fully worked out within Breitenlohner and Maison dimensional renormalization scheme. The coefficients of the anomalous terms introduced in the Slavnov-Taylor equations by the minimal subtraction algorithm are calculated and the asymmetric counterterms needed to restore the BRS symmetry, if the anomaly cancellation conditions are met, are computed. The renormalization group equation and its coefficients are worked out in the anomaly free case. The computations draw heavily from the existence of action principles and BRS cohomology theory.
