Title: Propagating Torsion in 3D-Gravity and Dynamical Mass Generation
Authors: J. L. Boldo and J. A. Helayel-Neto and N. Panza
Abstract: In this paper, fermions are minimally coupled to 3D-gravity where a dynamical torsion is introduced. A Kalb-Ramond field is non-minimally coupled to these fermions in a gauge-invariant way. We show that a 1-loop mass generation mechanism takes place for both the 2-form gauge field and the torsion. As for the fermions, no mass is dynamically generated: at 1-loop, there is only a mass shift proportional to the Yukawa coupling whenever the fermions have a non-vanishing tree-level mass.
