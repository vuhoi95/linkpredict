Title: Two-Loop Quantum Corrections of Scalar QED with Non-Minimal Chern-Simons  Coupling
Authors: M. E. Carrington and W. F. Chen and G. Kunstatter and J. Mottershead
Abstract: We investigate two-loop quantum corrections to non-minimally coupled Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory. The non-minimal gauge interaction represents the magnetic moment interaction between the charged scalar and the electromagnetic field. We show that the one-loop renormalizability of the theory found in previous work does not survive to the two-loop level. However, with an appropriate choice of the non-minimal coupling constant, it is possible to renormalize the two-loop effective potential and hence render it potentially useful for a detailed analysis of spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by radiative corrections.
