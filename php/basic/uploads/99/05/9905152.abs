Title: Gauge independent effective gauge fields
Authors: Kirill. A. Kazakov and Petr. I. Pronin
Abstract: The problem of gauge independent definition of the effective gauge field is considered. The Slavnov identities corresponding to a system of interacting quantum gauge and classical matter fields, playing the role of a measuring device, are obtained. With their help, in the case of power-counting renormalizable theories, gauge independence of the effective device action is proved in the low-energy limit, which allows to introduce the gauge independent notion of the effective gauge field.
