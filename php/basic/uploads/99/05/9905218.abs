Title: Duality Invariant Born-Infeld Theory
Authors: Daniel Brace and Bogdan Morariu and Bruno Zumino
Abstract: We present an Sp(2n,R) duality invariant Born-Infeld U(1)^2n gauge theory with scalar fields. To implement this duality we had to introduce complex gauge fields and as a result the rank of the duality group is only half as large as that of the corresponding Maxwell gauge theory with the same number of gauge fields. The latter is self-dual under Sp(4n,R), the largest allowed duality group. A special case appears for n=1 when one can also write an SL(2,R) duality invariant Born-Infeld theory with a real gauge field. We also describe the supersymmetric version of the above construction.
