Title: Relativistic Quantum Thermodynamics of Ideal Gases in 2 Dimensions
Authors: H. Blas and B. M. Pimentel and J. L. Tomazelli
Abstract: In this work we study the behavior of relativistic ideal Bose and Fermi gases in two space dimensions. Making use of polylogarithm functions we derive a closed and unified expression for their densities. It is shown that both type of gases are essentially inequivalent, and only in the non-relativistic limit the spinless and equal mass Bose and Fermi gases are equivalent as known in the literature.
