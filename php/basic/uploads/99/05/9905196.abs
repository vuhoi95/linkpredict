Title: A Bogomol`nyi equation for intersecting domain walls
Authors: G W Gibbons and P K Townsend
Abstract: We argue that the Wess-Zumino model with quartic superpotential admits static solutions in which three domain walls intersect at a junction. We derive an energy bound for such junctions and show that configurations saturating it preserve 1/4 supersymmetry.
