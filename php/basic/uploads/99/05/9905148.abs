Title: The D4-D8 Brane System and Five Dimensional Fixed Points
Authors: Andreas Brandhuber and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We construct dual Type I' string descriptions to five dimensional supersymmetric fixed points with $E_{N_f+1}$ global symmetry. The background is obtained as the near horizon geometry of the D4-D8 brane system in massive Type IIA supergravity. We use the dual description to deduce some properties of the fixed points.
