Title: Octonionic Mobius Transformations
Authors: Corinne A. Manogue and Tevian Dray
Abstract: A vexing problem involving nonassociativity is resolved, allowing a generalization of the usual complex Mobius transformations to the octonions. This is accomplished by relating the octonionic Mobius transformations to the Lorentz group in 10 spacetime dimensions. The result will be of particular interest to physicists working with lightlike objects in 10 dimensions.
