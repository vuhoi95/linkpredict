Title: Gluon - W-meson scattering via different renormalization schemes
Authors: M. M. Deminov and A. A. Slavnov
Abstract: The one loop gluon - W-meson amplitude is calculated by means of the gauge-invariant generalized Pauli-Villars regularization and with the help of dimensional regularization. It is shown that in the former case the amplitude satisfies Generalized Ward Identities, whereas in the latter case the amplitude differs from the first one by the constant.
