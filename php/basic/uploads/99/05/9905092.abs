Title: Space-times which are asymptotic to certain Friedman-Robertson-Walker  space-times at timelike infinity
Authors: Tetsuya Shiromizu and Uchida Gen
Abstract: We define space-times which are asymptotic to radiation dominant Friedman-Robertson-Walker space-times at timelike infinity and study the asymptotic structure. We discuss the local asymptotic symmetry and give a definition of the total energy from the electric part of the Weyl tensor.
