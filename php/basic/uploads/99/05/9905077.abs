Title: Renormalization in spherical field theory
Authors: Dean Lee and Nathan Salwen
Abstract: We derive several results concerning non-perturbative renormalization in the spherical field formalism. Using a small set of local counterterms, we are able to remove all ultraviolet divergences in a manner such that the renormalized theory is finite and translationally invariant. As an explicit example we consider massless phi^4 theory in four dimensions.
