Title: Twisted Quantum Affine Superalgebra $U_q[gl(m|n)^{(2)}]$ and New  $U_q[osp(m|n)]$ Invariant R-matrices
Authors: Mark D. Gould and Yao-Zhong Zhang
Abstract: The minimal irreducible representations of $U_q[gl(m|n)]$, i.e. those irreducible representations that are also irreducible under $U_q[osp(m|n)]$ are investigated and shown to be affinizable to give irreducible representations of the twisted quantum affine superalgebra $U_q[gl(m|n)^{(2)}]$. The $U_q[osp(m|n)]$ invariant R-matrices corresponding to the tensor product of any two minimal representations are constructed, thus extending our twisted tensor product graph method to the supersymmetric case. These give new solutions to the spectral-dependent graded Yang-Baxter equation arising from $U_q[gl(m|n)^{(2)}]$, which exhibit novel features not previously seen in the untwisted or non-super cases.
