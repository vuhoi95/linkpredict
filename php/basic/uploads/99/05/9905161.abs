Title: Timelike Hopf Duality and Type IIA^* String Solutions
Authors: C. N. Pope and A. Sadrzadeh and S. R. Scuro
Abstract: The usual T-duality that relates the type IIA and IIB theories compactified on circles of inversely-related radii does not operate if the dimensional reduction is performed on the time direction rather than a spatial one. This observation led to the recent proposal that there might exist two further ten-dimensional theories, namely type IIA^* and type IIB^*, related to type IIB and type IIA respectively by a timelike dimensional reduction. In this paper we explore such dimensional reductions in cases where time is the coordinate of a non-trivial U(1) fibre bundle. We focus in particular on situations where there is an odd-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime AdS_{2n+1}, which can be described as a U(1) bundle over \widetilde{CP}^n, a non-compact version of CP^n corresponding to the coset manifold SU(n,1)/U(n). In particular, we study the AdS_5\times S^5 and AdS_7\times S^4 solutions of type IIB supergravity and eleven-dimensional supergravity. Applying a timelike Hopf T-duality transformation to the former provides a new solution of the type IIA^* theory, of the form \widetilde{CP}^2\times S^1\times S^5. We show how the Hopf-reduced solutions provide further examples of ``supersymmetry without supersymmetry.'' We also present a detailed discussion of the geometrical structure of the Hopf-fibred metric on AdS_{2n+1}, and its relation to the horospherical metric that arises in the AdS/CFT correspondence.
