Title: Stable non-BPS states in string theory: a pedagogical review
Authors: A. Lerda and R. Russo
Abstract: We present a pedagogical review of the stable non-BPS states in string theory which have recently attracted some attention in the literature. In particular, following the analysis of A. Sen, we discuss in detail the case of the stable non-BPS D-particle of Type I theory whose existence is predicted (and required) by the heterotic/Type I duality. We show that this D-particle originates from an unstable bound state formed by a D1/anti-D1 pair of Type IIB in which the tachyon field acquires a solitonic kink configuration. The mechanism of tachyon condensation is discussed first at a qualitative level and then with an exact conformal field theory analysis.
