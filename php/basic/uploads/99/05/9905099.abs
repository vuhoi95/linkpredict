Title: The Extreme Kerr Throat Geometry: A Vacuum Analog of AdS_2 x S^2
Authors: James Bardeen and Gary T. Horowitz
Abstract: We study the near horizon limit of a four dimensional extreme rotating black hole. The limiting metric is a completely nonsingular vacuum solution, with an enhanced symmetry group SL(2,R) x U(1). We show that many of the properties of this solution are similar to the AdS_2 x S^2 geometry arising in the near horizon limit of extreme charged black holes. In particular, the boundary at infinity is a timelike surface. This suggests the possibility of a dual quantum mechanical description. A five dimensional generalization is also discussed.
