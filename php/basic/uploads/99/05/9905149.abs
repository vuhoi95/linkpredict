Title: Supersymmetry of parafermions
Authors: Sergei Klishevich and Mikhail Plyushchay
Abstract: We show that the single-mode parafermionic type systems possess supersymmetry, which is based on the symmetry of characteristic functions of the parafermions related to the generalized deformed oscillator of Daskaloyannis et al. The supersymmetry is realized in both unbroken and spontaneously broken phases. As in the case of parabosonic supersymmetry observed recently by one of the authors, the form of the associated superalgebra depends on the order of the parafermion and can be linear or nonlinear in the Hamiltonian. The list of supersymmetric parafermionic systems includes usual parafermions, finite-dimensional q-deformed oscillator, q-deformed parafermionic oscillator and parafermionic oscillator with internal $Z_2$ structure.
