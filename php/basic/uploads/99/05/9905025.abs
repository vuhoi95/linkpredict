Title: Dynamics and integrability property of the chiral string model
Authors: Brandon Carter and Patrick Peter
Abstract: The effect of fermionic string conductivity by purely right (or purely left) moving ``zero modes'' is shown to be governed by a simple Lagrangian characterising a certain ``chiral'' (null current carrying) string model whose dynamical equations of motion turn out to be explicitly integrable in a flat spacetime background.
