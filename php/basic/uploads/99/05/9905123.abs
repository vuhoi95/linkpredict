Title: Towards an octonionic world
Authors: S. De Leo and K. Abdel-Khalek
Abstract: In order to obtain a consistent formulation of octonionic quantum mechanics (OQM), we introduce left-right barred operators. Such operators enable us to find the translation rules between octonionic numbers and $8\times 8$ real matrices (a translation is also given for $4\times 4$ complex matrices). The use of a complex geometry allows us to overcome the hermiticity problem and define an appropriate momentum operator within OQM. As an application of our results, we develop an octonionic relativistic free wave equation, linear in the derivatives. Even if the wave functions are only one-component we show that four independent solutions, corresponding to those of the Dirac equation, exist.
