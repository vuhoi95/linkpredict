Title: Large quantum gravity effects and nonlocal variables
Authors: Alfredo E. Dominguez and Manuel H. Tiglio
Abstract: We reconsider here the model where large quantum gravity effects were first found, but now in its Null Surface Formulation (NSF). We find that although the set of coherent states for $Z$, the basic variable of NSF, is as restricted as it is the one for the metric, while some type of small deviations from these states may cause huge fluctuations on the metric, the corresponding fluctuations on $Z$ remain small.
