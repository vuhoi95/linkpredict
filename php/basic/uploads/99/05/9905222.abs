Title: N=2 Supersymmetric Model with Dirac-Kahler Fermions from Generalized  Gauge Theory in Two Dimensions
Authors: Noboru Kawamoto and Takuya Tsukioka
Abstract: We investigate the generalized gauge theory which has been proposed previously and show that in two dimensions the instanton gauge fixing of the generalized topological Yang-Mills action leads to a twisted N=2 supersymmetric action. We have found that the R-symmetry of N=2 supersymmetry can be identified with the flavour symmetry of Dirac-Kahler fermion formulation. Thus the procedure of twist allows topological ghost fields to be interpreted as the Dirac-Kahler matter fermions.
