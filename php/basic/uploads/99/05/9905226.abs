Abstract: We derive the full Kaluza-Klein spectrum of type IIB supergravity compactified on AdS_5 x T^{11} with T^{11} = (SU(2) x SU(2))/U(1). From the knowledge of the spectrum and general multiplet shortening conditions, we make a refined test of the AdS/CFT correspondence, by comparison between various shortenings of SU(2,2|1) supermultiplets on AdS_5 and different families of boundary operators with protected dimensions. Additional towers of long multiplets with rational dimensions, that are not protected by supersymmetry, are also predicted from the supergravity analysis.
