Title: Group-valued equivariant localization
Authors: Anton Alekseev and Eckhard Meinrenken and Chris Woodward
Abstract: We prove a localization formula for group-valued equivariant de Rham cohomology of a compact G-manifold. This formula is a non-trivial generalization of the localization formula of Berline-Vergne and Atiyah-Bott for the usual equivariant de Rham cohomology. As an application, we obtain a version of the Duistermaat-Heckman formula for Hamiltonian spaces with group-valued moment maps.
