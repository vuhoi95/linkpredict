Title: Non-local conservation laws and flow equations for supersymmetric  integrable hierarchies
Authors: Jens Ole Madsen and J. Luis Miramontes
Abstract: An infinite series of Grassmann-odd and Grassmann-even flow equations is defined for a class of supersymmetric integrable hierarchies associated with loop superalgebras. All these flows commute with the mutually commuting bosonic ones originally considered to define these hierarchies and, hence, provide extra fermionic and bosonic symmetries that include the built-in N=1 supersymmetry transformation. The corresponding non-local conserved quantities are also constructed. As an example, the particular case of the principal supersymmetric hierarchies associated with the affine superalgebras with a fermionic simple root system is discussed in detail.
