Title: (F, D5) Bound State, SL(2, Z) Invariance and The Descendant States in  Type IIB/A String Theory
Authors: J. X. Lu and Shibaji Roy
Abstract: Recently the space-time configurations of a set of non-threshold bound states, called the (F, Dp) bound states, have been constructed explicitly for every $p$ with $2 \le p \le 7$ in both type IIA (for $p$ even) and type IIB (for $p$ odd) string theories by the present authors. By making use of the SL(2, Z) symmetry of type IIB theory we construct a more general SL(2, Z) invariant bound state of the type ((F, D1), (NS5, D5)) in this theory from the (F, D5) bound state. There are actually an infinite number of $(m,n)$ strings forming bound states with $(m',n')$ 5-branes, where strings lie along one of the spatial directions of the 5-branes. By applying T-duality along one of the transverse directions we also construct the bound state ((F, D2), (KK, D6)) in type IIA string theory. Then we give a list of possible bound states which can be obtained from these newly constructed bound states by applying T-dualities along the longitudinal directions as well as S-dualities to those in type IIB theory.
