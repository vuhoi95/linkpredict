Title: Holography for Coset Spaces
Authors: Ruth Britto-Pacumio and Andrew Strominger and Anastasia Volovich
Abstract: M/string theory on noncompact, negatively curved, cosets which generalize $AdS_{D+1}=SO(D,2)/SO(D,1)$ is considered. Holographic descriptions in terms of a conformal field theory on the boundary of the spacetime are proposed. Examples include $SU(2,1)/U(2)$, which is a Euclidean signature (4,0) space with no supersymmetry, and $SO(2,2)/SO(2)$ and $SO(3,2)/SO(3)$, which are Lorentzian signature (4,1) and (6,1) spaces with eight supersymmetries. Qualitatively new features arise due to the degenerate nature of the conformal boundary metric.
