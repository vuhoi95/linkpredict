Authors: R. D. M. De Paola and R. B. Rodrigues and N. F. Svaiter
Abstract: The zero-point energy of a massless fermion field in the interior of two parallel plates in a D-dimensional space-time at zero temperature is calculated. In order to regularize the model, a mix between dimensional and zeta-function regularization procedure is used and it is found that the regularized zero-point energy density is finite for any number of space-time dimensions. We present a general expression for the Casimir energy for the fermionic field in such a situation.
