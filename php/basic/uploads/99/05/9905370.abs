Title: Critical Exponents of O(N) Scalar Model at Temperatures below the  Critical Value using Auxiliary Mass Method
Authors: K. Ogure and J. Sato
Abstract: We investigate a phase transition of the O(N) invariant scalar model using the auxiliary mass method. We determine the critical exponent $\beta$ by calculating an effective potential below the critical temperature. This work follows that of a previous paper.
