Title: Thermodynamics of Large-N Super Yang-Mills Theory and AdS/CFT  Correspondence
Authors: Chanju Kim and Soo-Jong Rey
Abstract: Thermodynamics of d=4, N=4 supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills theory is studied with particular attention on perturbative expansion at weak `t Hooft coupling regime and interpolation to strong coupling regime thereof. Non-ideal gas effect to free-energy is calculated and found that leading- and next-to-leading-order corrections contribute with relative opposite sign. Pade approximant method is adopted to improve fixed-order, perturbative series and is found to decrease free-energy monotonically as `t Hooft coupling parameter is increased. This may be regarded as an indication of smooth interpolation of thermodynamics between weak and strong `t Hooft coupling regimes, as suggested by Maldacena's AdS/CFT correspondence.
