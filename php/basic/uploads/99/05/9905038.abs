Title: Symmetry breaking boundary conditions and WZW orbifolds
Authors: L. Birke and J. Fuchs and C. Schweigert
Abstract: Symmetry breaking boundary conditions for WZW theories are discussed. We derive explicit formulae for the reflection coefficients in the presence of boundary conditions that preserve only an orbifold subalgebra with respect to an involutive automorphism of the chiral algebra. The characters and modular transformations of the corresponding orbifold theories are computed. Both inner and outer automorphisms are treated.
