Title: Supersymmetry and generalized calibrations
Authors: J. Gutowski and G. Papadopoulos and P. K. Townsend
Abstract: A static minimal energy configuration of a super p-brane in a supersymmetric (n+1)-dimensional spacetime is shown to be a `generalized calibrated' submanifold. Calibrations in $\bE^{(1,n)}$ and $AdS_{n+1}$ are special cases. We present several M-brane examples.
