Title: A Monograph on the Classification of the Discrete Subgroups of SU(4)
Authors: Amihay Hanany and Yang-Hui He
Abstract: We here present, in modern notation, the classification of the discrete finite subgroups of SU(4) as well as the character tables for the exceptional cases thereof (Cf. http://pierre.mit.edu/~yhe/su4.ct). We hope this catalogue will be useful to works on string orbifold theories, quiver theories, WZW modular invariants, Gorenstein resolutions, nonlinear sigma-models as well as some recently proposed inter-connections among them.
