Title: Exotic Scalar States in the AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: Neil R. Constable and Robert C. Myers
Abstract: We investigate a family of solutions of Type IIb supergravity which asymptotically approach AdS_5 X S^5 but contain a non-constant dilaton and volume scalar for the five-sphere. These solutions preserve an SO(1,3) X SO(6) symmetry. We discuss the solution in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, and we find that as well as running coupling from the nontrivial dilaton, the corresponding field theory has no supersymmetry and displays confinement at least for a certain range of parameters.
