Title: One-Loop Tachyon Amplitude in Unoriented Open-Closed String Field Theory
Authors: Tsuguhiko Asakawa and Taichiro Kugo and Tomohiko Takahashi
Abstract: We calculate one-loop 2-point tachyon amplitudes in unoriented open-closed string field theory, and determine all the coupling constants of the interaction vertices in the theory. It is shown that the planar, nonplanar and nonorientable amplitudes are all reproduced correctly, and nontrivial consistencies between the determined coupling constants are observed. The necessity for the gauge group to be SO(2^{13}=8192) is also reconfirmed.
