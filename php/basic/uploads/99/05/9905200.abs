Title: Curvature Dependence of Running Gauge Coupling and Confinement in  AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: We construct IIB supergravity (viewed as dilatonic gravity) background with non-trivial dilaton and with curved four-dimensional space. Such a background may describe another vacuum of maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory or strong coupling regime of (non)-supersymmetric gauge theory with (power-like) running gauge coupling which depends on curvature. Curvature dependent quark-antiquark potential is calculated where the geometry type of hyperbolic (or de Sitter universe) shows (or not) the tendency of the confinement. Generalization of IIB supergravity background with non-constant axion is presented. Quark-antiquark potential being again curvature-dependent has a possibility to produce the standard area law for large separations.
