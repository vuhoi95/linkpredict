Title: Non-static Dimensional Reduction of QED_3 at Finite Temperature
Authors: Ashok Das and Gerald Dunne
Abstract: We study an extreme non-static limit of 2+1-dimensional QED obtained by making a dimensional reduction so that all fields are spatially uniform but time dependent. This dimensional reduction leads to a 0+1-dimensional field theory that inherits many of the features of the 2+1-dimensional model, such as Chern-Simons terms, time-reversal violation, an analogue of parity violation, and global U(2) flavor symmetry. At one-loop level, interactions induce a Chern-Simons term at finite T with coefficient tanh(beta m_F/2), where m_F is the fermion mass. The finite temperature two loop self-energies are also computed, and are non-zero for all temperatures.
