Title: Spherically Collapsing Matter in AdS, Holography, and Shellons
Authors: Ulf H. Danielsson and Esko Keski-Vakkuri and Martin Kruczenski
Abstract: We investigate the collapse of a spherical shell of matter in an anti-de Sitter space. We search for a holographic description of the collapsing shell in the boundary theory. It turns out that in the boundary theory it is possible to find information about the radial size of the shell. The shell deforms the background spacetime, and the deformed background metric enters into the action of a generic bulk field. As a consequence, the correlators of operators coupling to the bulk field are modified. By studying the analytic structure of the correlators, we find that in the boundary theory there are unstable excitations ("shellons") whose masses are multiples of a scale set by the radius of the shell. We also comment on the relation between black hole formation in the bulk and thermalization in the boundary.
