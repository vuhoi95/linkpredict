Title: The generating solution of regular N=8 BPS black holes
Authors: M. Bertolini and P. Fre` and M. Trigiante
Abstract: In this paper we construct the 5 parameter generating solution of N=8 BPS regular supergravity black holes as a five parameter solution of the N=2 STU model. Our solution has a simpler form with respect to previous constructions already appeared in the literature and moreover, through the embedding [SL(2)]^3\subset SU(3,3)\subset E_{(7)7} discussed in previous papers, the action of the U-duality group is well defined. This allows to reproduce via U-duality rotations any other solution, like those corresponding to R-R black holes whose microscopic description is given by intersecting D-branes.
