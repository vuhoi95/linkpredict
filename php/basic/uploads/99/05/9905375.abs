Title: An effective string theory of Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen vortices
Authors: M. Baker and R. Steinke
Abstract: We obtain an effective string theory of the Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen vortices of the Abelian Higgs model. The theory has an anomaly free effective string action which, when the extrinsic curvature is set equal to zero, yields the Nambu-Goto action. This generalizes previous work in which a string representation was obtained in the London limit, where the magnitude of the Higgs field is fixed. Viewed as a model for long distance QCD, it provides a concrete picture of the QCD string as a fluctuating Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen vortex of a dual superconductor on the border between type I and type II.
