Title: String dynamics near a Kaluza-Klein black hole
Authors: H. K. Jassal and A. Mukherjee and R. P. Saxena
Abstract: The dynamics of a string near a Kaluza-Klein black hole are studied. Solutions to the classical string equations of motion are obtained using the world sheet velocity of light as an expansion parameter. The electrically and magnetically charged cases are considered separately. Solutions for string coordinates are obtained in terms of the world-sheet coordinate $\tau$. It is shown that the Kaluza-Klein radius increases/decreases with $\tau$ for electrically/magnetically charged black hole.
