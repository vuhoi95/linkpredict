Title: A superspace formulation of Abelian antisymmetric tensor gauge theory
Authors: Shinichi Deguchi and Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: We apply a superspace formulation to the four-dimensional gauge theory of a massless Abelian antisymmetric tensor field of rank 2. The theory is formulated in a six-dimensional superspace using rank-2 tensor, vector and scalar superfields and their associated supersources. It is shown that BRS transformation rules of fields are realized as Euler-Lagrange equations without assuming the so-called horizontality condition and that a generating functional $\bar{W}$ constracted in the superspace reduces to that for the ordinary gauge theory of Abelian rank-2 antisymmetric tensor field. The WT identity for this theory is derived by making use of the superspace formulation and is expressed in a neat and compact form $\partial\bar{W}/\partial\theta=0$.
