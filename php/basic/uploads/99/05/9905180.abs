Title: Branes, Waves and AdS Orbifolds
Authors: Klaus Behrndt and Dieter Lust
Abstract: The embedding of a Taub-NUT space in the directions transverse to the world volume of branes describes branes at (spherical) orbifold singularities. Similarly, the embedding of a pp-wave in the brane world volume yields an AdS orbifold. In case of the D1-D5--brane system, the AdS3 orbifolds yields a BTZ black hole; as we will show, the same holds for D3-branes corresponding to AdS5. In addition we will show that the AdS orbifolds and the spherical orbifolds are U-dual to each other. However in contrast to spherical orbifolds the AdS orbifolds lead to a running coupling, which is in the IR inverse to the coupling of the spherical orbifold. A discussion of the general pp-wave solution in AdS space is added.
