Title: Quaternionic Groups in Physics: A Panoramic Review
Authors: S. De Leo and G. Ducati
Abstract: Due to the non-commutative nature of quaternions we introduce the concept of left and right action for quaternionic numbers. This gives the opportunity to manipulate appropriately the $H$-field. The standard problems arising in the definitions of transpose, determinant and trace for quaternionic matrices are overcome. We investigate the possibility to formulate a new approach to Quaternionic Group Theory. Our aim is to highlight the possibility of looking at new quaternionic groups by the use of left and right operators as fundamental step toward a clear and complete discussion of Unification Theories in Physics.
