Title: Ramond-Ramond Couplings on Brane-Antibrane Systems
Authors: Conall Kennedy and Andy Wilkins
Abstract: Couplings between a closed string RR field and open strings are calculated in a system of coincident branes and antibranes of type II theory. The result can be written cleanly using the curvature of the superconnection.
