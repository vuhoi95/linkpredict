Title: Yangian symmetry in the Non Linear Schrodinger hierarchy
Authors: M. Mintchev and E. Ragoucy and P. Sorba and Ph Zaugg
Abstract: We study the Yangian symmetry of the multicomponent Quantum Nonlinear Schrodinger hierarchy in the framework of the Quantum Inverse Scattering Method. We give an explicit realization of the Yangian generators in terms of the deformed oscillators algebra which naturally occurs in this framework.
