Title: Transport in finite incommensurate Peierls-Fr√∂hlich systems
Authors: Luis E. Oxman and Eduardo R. Mucciolo and Ilya V. Krive
Abstract: We show that the conductance of a one-dimensional, finite charge-density-wave (CDW) system of the incommensurate type is not renormalized at low temperatures and depends solely on the leads. Within our formalism, we argue that a similar behavior (perfect conductance) should occur for a wide class of one-dimensional strongly correlated finite systems where interactions are current dependent. The universal conductance is related to the presence of an (anomalous) chiral symmetry. The fundamental role played by the finiteness of the sample and the adiabaticity of the contacts to Fermi-liquid leads is evidenced.
