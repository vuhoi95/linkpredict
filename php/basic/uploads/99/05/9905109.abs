Title: Observable effects from extra dimensions
Authors: U. Guenther and A. Zhuk
Abstract: For any multidimensional theory with compactified internal spaces, conformal excitations of the internal space metric result in gravitational excitons in the external spacetime. These excitations contribute either to dark matter or to cross sections of usual particles.
