Title: Dependence of the vacuum energy on spherically symmetric background  fields
Authors: M. Bordag and M. Hellmund and K. Kirsten
Abstract: The vacuum energy of a scalar field in a spherically symmetric background field is considered. Based on previous work [hep-th/9608070], the numerical procedure is refined further and applied to several examples. We provide numerical evidence that repulsive potentials lead to positive contributions to the vacuum energy. Furthermore, the crucial role played by bound-states is clearly seen.
