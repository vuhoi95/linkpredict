Title: Counterterms for the Dirichlet Prescription of the AdS/CFT  Correspondence
Authors: W. Mueck and K. S. Viswanathan
Abstract: We illustrate the Dirichlet prescription of the AdS/CFT correspondence using the example of a massive scalar field and argue that it is the only entirely consistent regularization procedure known so far. Using the Dirichlet prescription, we then calculate the divergent terms for gravity in the cases $d=2,4,6$, which give rise to the Weyl anomaly in the boundary conformal field theory.
