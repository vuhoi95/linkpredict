Title: Non-Bogomolny SU(N) BPS Monopoles
Authors: Theodora Ioannidou and Paul M. Sutcliffe
Abstract: For N>2 we present static monopole solutions of the second order SU(N) BPS Yang-Mills-Higgs equations which are not solutions of the first order Bogomolny equations. These spherically symmetric solutions may be interpreted as monopole anti-monopole configurations and their construction involves harmonic maps into complex projective spaces.
