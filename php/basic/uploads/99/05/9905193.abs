Title: Open group transformations
Authors: Igor Batalin and Robert Marnelius
Abstract: Open groups whose generators are in arbitrary involutions may be quantized within a ghost extended framework in terms of a nilpotent BFV-BRST charge operator. Previously we have shown that generalized quantum Maurer-Cartan equations for arbitrary open groups may be extracted from the quantum connection operators and that they also follow from a simple quantum master equation involving an extended nilpotent BFV-BRST charge and a master charge. Here we give further details of these results. In addition we establish the general structure of the solutions of the quantum master equation. We also construct an extended formulation whose properties are determined by the extended BRST charge in the master equation.
