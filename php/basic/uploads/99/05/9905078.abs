Title: D-branes on T^4/Z_2 and T-Duality
Authors: Ilka Brunner and Rami Entin and Christian Romelsberger
Abstract: In this note we discuss D-branes on T^4/Z_2 using the boundary states formalism. Explicit formulas for the untwisted boundary states inherited from the underlying T^4 and twisted states corresponding to branes wrapping collapsed 2-cycles at the orbifold singularities are given. The exact CFT description of the orbifold makes it possible to study how the boundary states transform under R_i -> 1/R_i transformation on all directions of the underlying T^4. We compare their transformation law with results obtained from world volume considerations.
