Title: Supersymmetry breaking and loop corrections at the end of inflation
Authors: R. Jeannerot and J. Lesgourgues
Abstract: We show that quantum corrections to the effective potential in supersymmetric hybrid inflation can be calculated all the way from the inflationary period - when the Universe is dominated by a false vacuum energy density - till the fields settle down to the global supersymmetric minimum of the potential. These are crucial for getting a continuous description of the evolution of the fields.
