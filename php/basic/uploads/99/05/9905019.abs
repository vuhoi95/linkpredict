Title: Towards a manifestly SL(2,Z)-covariant action for the type IIB (p,q)  super-five-branes
Authors: Anders Westerberg and Niclas Wyllard
Abstract: We determine a manifestly SL(2,Z)-covariant kappa-symmetric action for the type IIB (p,q) five-branes as a perturbative expansion in the world-volume field strengths within the framework where the brane tension is generated by a world-volume field. In this formulation the Lagrangian is expected to be polynomial; we construct the kappa-invariant action to fourth order in the world-volume field strengths.
