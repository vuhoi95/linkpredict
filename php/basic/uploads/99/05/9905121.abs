Title: Gaugino Condensation in N=1 Supergravity Models with Multiple  Dilaton-Like Fields
Authors: Jonathan Bagger and Yi-Yen Wu
Abstract: We study supersymmetry breaking by hidden-sector gaugino condensation in N=1 D=4 supergravity models with multiple dilaton-like moduli fields. Our work is motivated by Type I string theory, in which the low-energy effective Lagrangian can have different dilaton-like fields coupling to different sectors of the theory. We construct the effective Lagrangian for gaugino condensation and use it to compute the visible-sector gaugino masses. We find that the gaugino masses can be of order the gravitino mass, in stark contrast to heterotic string models with a single dilaton field.
