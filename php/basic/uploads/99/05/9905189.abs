Title: Quantum Caustics for Systems with Quadratic Lagrangians in  Multi-Dimensions
Authors: Kenichi Horie and Hitoshi Miyazaki and Izumi Tsutsui
Abstract: We study quantum caustics in $d$-dimensional systems with quadratic Lagrangians. Based on Schulman's procedure in the path-integral we derive the transition amplitude on caustics in a closed form for generic multiplicity $f$, and thereby complete the previous analysis carried out for the maximal multiplicity case $f=d$. Multiplicity dependence of the caustics phenomena is illusrated by examples of a particle interacting with external electromagnetic fields.
