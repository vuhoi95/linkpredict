Abstract: We propose an effective Lagrangian for the low energy theory of the Pfaffian states of the fractional quantum Hall effect in the bulk in terms of non-Abelian Chern-Simons (CS) actions. Our approach exploits the connection between the topological Chern-Simons theory and chiral conformal field theories. This construction can be used to describe a large class of non-Abelian FQH states.
