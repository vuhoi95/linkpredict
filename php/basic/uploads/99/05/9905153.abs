Title: Kaluza-Klein dipoles, brane/anti-brane pairs and instabilities
Authors: Bert Janssen and Sudipta Mukherji
Abstract: We review the method of constructing dipole and string loop solutions from the higher-dimensional (Euclidean) Kerr black hole. We analyse the results in various dimensions, finding solutions earlier given in the literature. Then we construct a new heterotic dipole with non-trivial dilaton and gauge fields. This can, in turn, be describes as a brane/anti-brane pair which interpolates between the KK-dipole and the H-dipole. Finally an argument is presented on the tachyonic instability by analysing the string fluctuations on the dipole background.
