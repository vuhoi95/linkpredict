Abstract: The GS superstring on AdS_5 x S^5 has a nonlinearly realized, spontaneously broken SU(2,2|4) symmetry. Here we introduce a two-dimensional model in which the unbroken SU(2,2|4) symmetry is linearly realized. The basic variables are supertwistors, which transform in the fundamental representation of this supergroup. The quantization of this supertwistor model leads to the complete oscillator construction of the unitary irreducible representations of the centrally extended SU(2,2|4). They include the states of d=4 SYM theory, massless and KK states of AdS_5 supergravity, and the descendants on AdS_5 of the standard massive string states, which form intermediate and long supermultiplets. We present examples of such multiplets and discuss possible states of solitonic and (p,q) strings.
