Title: Domain walls in supersymmetric QCD: from weak to strong coupling
Authors: B. de Carlos and J. M. Moreno
Abstract: We consider domain walls that appear in supersymmetric QCD with Nf < Nc massive flavours. In particular, for 2 Nf < Nc we explicitly construct the domain walls that interpolate between vacua labeled by i and (i+ N_f). We show that these solutions are Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) saturated for any value of the mass of the matter fields. This fact allows us to evaluate the large mass limit of these domain walls. We comment on the relevance of these solutions for supersymmetric gluodynamics.
