Title: The Faddeev-Jackiw Approach and the Conformal Affine sl(2) Toda Model  Coupled to Matter Field
Authors: H. Blas and B. M. Pimentel
Abstract: The conformal affine sl(2) Toda model coupled to matter field is treated as a constrained system in the context of Faddeev-Jackiw and the (constrained) symplectic schemes. We recover from this theory either, the sine-Gordon or the massive Thirring model, through a process of Hamiltonian reduction, considering the equivalence of the Noether and topological currrents as a constraint and gauge fixing the conformal symmetry.
