Title: Supersymmetry Breakdown at Distant Branes: The Super-Higgs Mechanism
Authors: Krzysztof A. Meissner and Hans Peter Nilles and Marek Olechowski
Abstract: A compactification of 11-dimensional supergravity with two (or more) walls is considered. The whole tower of massive Kaluza-Klein modes along the fifth dimension is taken into account. With the sources on the walls, an explicit composition in terms of Kaluza-Klein modes of massless gravitino (in the supersymmetry preserving case) and massive gravitino (in the supersymmetry breaking case) is obtained. The super-Higgs effect is discussed in detail.
