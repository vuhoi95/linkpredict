Title: Exact static soliton solutions of 3+1 dimensional integrable theory with  nonzero Hopf numbers
Authors: H. Aratyn and L. A. Ferreira and A. H. Zimerman
Abstract: In this paper we construct explicitly an infinite number of Hopfions (static, soliton solutions with non-zero Hopf topological charges) within the recently proposed 3+1-dimensional, integrable and relativistically invariant field theory. Two integers label the family of Hopfions we have found. Their product is equal to the Hopf charge which provides a lower bound to the soliton's finite energy. The Hopfions are constructed explicitly in terms of the toroidal coordinates and shown to have a form of linked closed vortices.
