Title: Batalin-Vilkovisky gauge-fixing of a chiral two-form in six dimensions
Authors: Chris Van Den Broeck and Kor Van Hoof
Abstract: We perform the gauge-fixing of the theory of a chiral two-form boson in six dimensions starting from the action given by Pasti, Sorokin and Tonin. We use the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, introducing antifields and writing down an extended action satisfying the classical master equation. Then we gauge-fix the three local symmetries of the extended action in two different ways.
