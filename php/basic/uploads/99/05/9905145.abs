Title: Extended supersymmetry in D=1+1
Authors: R. Amorim and J. Barcelos-Neto
Abstract: We extend superspace by introducing an antisymmetric tensorial coordinate. The resulting theory presents a supersymmetry with central charge. After integrating over the tensorial coordinate, an effective action describing massive bosons and fermions is explicitely derived for the spacetime dimension D=2. The adopted procedure is simpler than the Kaluza-Klein one and can suggest an alternative for string compactifications.
