Title: Coherent States for the Deformed Algebras
Authors: V. Sunilkumar and B. A. Bambah and P. K. Panigrahi and V. Srinivasan
Abstract: We provide a unified approach for finding the coherent states of various deformed algebras, including quadratic, Higgs and q-deformed algebras, which are relevant for many physical problems. For the non-compact cases, coherent states, which are the eigenstates of the respective annihilation operators, are constructed by finding the canonical conjugates of these operators. We give a general procedure to map these deformed algebras to appropriate Lie algebras. Generalized coherent states, in the Perelomov sense, follow from this construction.
