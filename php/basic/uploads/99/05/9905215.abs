Title: A Resolution to the Supersymmetric CP Problem with Large Soft Phases via  D-branes
Authors: M. Brhlik and L. Everett and G. L. Kane and J. Lykken
Abstract: We examine the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters that result from various ways of embedding the Standard Model (SM) on D-branes within the Type I string picture, allowing the gaugino masses and $\mu$ to have large CP- violating phases. One embedding naturally provides the relations among soft parameters to satisfy the electron and neutron electric dipole moment constraints even with large phases, while with other embeddings large phases are not allowed. The string models provide some motivation for large phases in the soft breaking parameters. The results generally suggest how low energy data might teach us about Planck scale physics.
