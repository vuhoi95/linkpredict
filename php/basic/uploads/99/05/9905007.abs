Title: Dilaton driven Hawking radiation in AdS$_2$ black hole
Authors: Won Tae Kim and John J. Oh
Abstract: A recent study shows that Hawking radiation of the massless scalar field does not appear on the two-dimensional AdS$_2$ black hole background. We study this issue by investigating absorption and reflection coefficients under dilaton coupling with the matter field. If the scalar field does not couple to the dilaton, then it is fully absorbed into the black hole without any outgoing mode. On the other hand, once it couples to the dilaton field, the outgoing mode of the massless scalar field exists and the nontrivial Hawking radiation is obtained. Finally, we comment on this dilaton dependence of Hawking radiation in connection with a three-dimensional black hole.
