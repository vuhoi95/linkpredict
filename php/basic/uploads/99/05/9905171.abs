Title: Energy Levels of Classical Interacting Fields in a Finite Domain in 1+1  Dimension
Authors: J. A. Espichan Carrillo and A. Maia Jr
Abstract: We study the behavior of bound energy levels for the case of two classical interacting fields $\phi$ and $\chi$ in a finite domain (box) in (1 + 1) dimension on which we impose Dirichlet boundary conditions (DBC). The total Lagrangian contain a $\frac{\lambda}{4}\phi^4$ self-interaction and an interaction term given by $g \phi^2 \chi^2$. We calculate the energy eigenfunctions and its correspondent eigenvalues and study their dependence on the size of the box (L) as well on the free parameters of the Lagrangian: mass ratio $\beta = \frac{M^{2}_{\chi}}{M^{2}_{\phi}}$, and interaction coupling constants $\lambda$ and $g$. We show that for some configurations of the above parameters, there exists critical sizes of the box for which instability points of the field $\chi$ appear.
