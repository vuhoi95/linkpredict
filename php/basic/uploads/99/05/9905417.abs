Title: Deviations from the $1/r^2$ Newton law due to extra dimensions
Authors: A. Kehagias and K. Sfetsos
Abstract: We systematically examine corrections to the gravitational inverse square law, which are due to compactified extra dimensions. We find the induced Yukawa-type potentials for which we calculate the strength \alpha and range. In general the range of the Yukawa correction is given by the wavelength of the lightest Kaluza-Klein state and its strength, relative to the standard gravitational potential, by the corresponding degeneracy. In particular, when n extra dimensions are compactified on an n-torus, we find that the strength of the potential is \alpha=2n, whereas the compactification on an n-sphere gives \alpha= n+1. For Calabi-Yau compactifications the strength can be at most \alpha=20.
