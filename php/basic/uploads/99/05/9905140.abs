Title: Calculating the infrared central charges for perturbed minimal models:  improving the RG perturbation
Authors: Lars Kjaergaard and Paul Mansfield
Abstract: We illustrate a method for improving Renormalisation Group improved perturbation theory by calculating the infrared central charge of a perturbed conformal field theory. The additional input is a dispersion relation that exploits analyticity of the energy-momentum tensor correlator.
