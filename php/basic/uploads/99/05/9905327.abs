Title: Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropies and extra dimensions in String  Cosmology
Authors: A. Melchiorri and F. Vernizzi and R. Durrer and G. Veneziano
Abstract: A recently proposed mechanism for large-scale structure in string cosmology --based on massless axionic seeds-- is further analyzed and extended to the acoustic-peak region. Existence, structure, and normalization of the peaks turn out to depend crucially on the overall evolution of extra dimensions during the pre-big bang phase: conversely, precise cosmic microwave background anisotropy data in the acoustic-peak region will provide, within the next decade, a window on string-theory's extra dimensions before their eventual compactification.
