Title: The Complete Black Brane Solutions in D-dimensional Coupled Gravity  System
Authors: Bihn Zhou and Chuan-Jie Zhu
Abstract: In this paper, we use only the equation of motion for an interacting system of gravity, dilaton and antisymmetric tensor to study the black brane solutions. By making use of the property of Schwarzian derivative, we obtain the complete solution of this system of equations. For some special values we obtain the well-known BPS brane and black brane solutions.
