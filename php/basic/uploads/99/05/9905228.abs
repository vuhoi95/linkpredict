Title: Boundary Dynamics of Higher Dimensional AdS Spacetime
Authors: J. Gegenberg and G. Kunstatter
Abstract: We examine the dynamics induced on the four dimensional boundary of a five dimensional anti-deSitter spacetime by the five dimensional Chern-Simons theory with gauge group the direct product of SO(4,2) with U(1). We show that, given boundary conditions compatible with the geometry of 5d AdS spacetime in the asymptotic region, the induced surface theory is the $WZW_4$ model.
