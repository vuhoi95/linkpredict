Title: Supersymmetry and Singular Potentials
Authors: Ashok Das and Sergio A. Pernice
Abstract: The breaking of supersymmetry due to singular potentials in supersymmetric quantum mechanics is critically analyzed. It is shown that, when properly regularized, these potentials respect supersymmetry, even when the regularization parameter is removed.
