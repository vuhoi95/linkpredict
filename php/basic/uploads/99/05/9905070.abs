Title: Extended Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics
Authors: V. Akulov and M. Kudinov
Abstract: A parametrization of the Hamiltonian of the generalized Witten model of the SUSY QM by a single arbitrary function in d=1 has been obtained for an arbitrary number of the supersymmetries N. Possible applications of this formalism have been discussed. It has been shown that the N=1 and 2 conformal SUSY QM is generalized for any N.
