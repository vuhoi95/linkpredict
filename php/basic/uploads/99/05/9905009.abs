Title: $U_q(\hat{sl}_n)$-analog of the XXZ chain with a boundary
Authors: H. Furutsu and T. Kojima
Abstract: We study $U_q(\hat{sl}_n)$ analog of the XXZ spin chain with a boundary magnetic field h. We construct explicit bosonic formulas of the vacuum vector and the dual vacuum vector with a boundary magnetic field. We derive integral formulas of the correlation functions.
