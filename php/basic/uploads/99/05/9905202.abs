Title: The general crossing relation for boundary reflection matrix
Authors: Bo-yu Hou and Kang-jie Shi and Wen-li Yang
Abstract: In this paper, we give the general crossing relation for boundary reflection matrix $R(\beta)$, which is the extension of the work given by Ghoshal and Zamolodchikov .We also use the first non-trivial extended crossing relation to determine the scaler factor of $R(\beta)$ which is the rational diagonal solution to the boundary Yang-Baxter equation in the case of l=2 and n=3.
