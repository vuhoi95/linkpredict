Title: Towards a string representation of infrared SU(2) Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Edwin Langmann and Antti J. Niemi
Abstract: We employ a heat kernel expansion to derive an effective action that describes four dimensional SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in the infrared limit. Our result supports the proposal that at large distances the theory is approximated by the dynamics of knotted string-like fluxtubes which appear as solitons in the effective theory.
