Title: Improved Dirac quantization of a free particle
Authors: Soon-Tae Hong and Won Tae Kim and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: In the framework of Dirac quantization with second class constraints, a free particle moving on the surface of a $(d-1)-$dimensional sphere has an ambiguity in the energy spectrum due to the arbitrary shift of canonical momenta. We explicitly show that this spectrum obtained by the Dirac method can be consistent with the result of the Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin formalism, which is an improved Dirac method, at the level of the first-class constraint by fixing the ambiguity, and discuss its physical consequences.
