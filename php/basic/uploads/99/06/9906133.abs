Title: Father time. II. A physical basis behind Feynman's idea of antiparticles  moving backward in time, and an extension of the CPT theorem to include  non-local gauge fields

Abstract: It has been demonstrated in a recent paper (Mod.Phys.Lett. A13, 1265 (1998); hep-th/9902020) that the existence of a non-thermodynamic arrow of time at the atomic level is a fundamental requirement for conservation of energy in matter-radiation interaction. Since the universe consists of two things only --- energy and massive matter --- we argue that as a consequence of this earlier result, particles and antiparticles must necessarily move in opposite directions in time. Our result further indicates that the CPT theorem can be extended to cover non-local gauge fields.
