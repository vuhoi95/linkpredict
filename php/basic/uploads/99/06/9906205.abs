Title: Bosonization at Finite Temperature and Anyon Condensation
Authors: A. Liguori and M. Mintchev and L. Pilo
Abstract: An operator formalism for bosonization at finite temperature and density is developed. We treat the general case of anyon statistics. The exact $n$-point correlation functions, satisfying the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition, are explicitly constructed. The invariance under both vector and chiral transformations allows to introduce two chemical potentials. Investigating the exact momentum distribution, we discover anyon condensation in certain range of the statistical parameter. Another interesting feature is the occurrence of a non-vanishing persistent current. As an application of the general formalism, we solve the massless Thirring model at finite temperature, deriving the charge density and the persistent current.
