Title: Dualities of Type 0 Strings
Authors: O. Bergman and M. R. Gaberdiel
Abstract: It is conjectured that the two closed bosonic string theories, Type 0A and Type 0B, correspond to certain supersymmetry breaking orbifold compactifications of M-theory. Various implications of this conjecture are discussed, in particular the behaviour of the tachyon at strong coupling and the existence of non-perturbative fermionic states in Type 0A. The latter are shown to correspond to bound states of Type 0A D-particles, thus providing further evidence for the conjecture. We also give a comprehensive description of the various Type 0 closed and open string theories.
