Title: Axial Anomaly in Lattice Abelian Gauge Theory in Arbitrary Dimensions
Authors: Takanori Fujiwara and Hiroshi Suzuki and Ke Wu
Abstract: Axial anomaly of lattice abelian gauge theory in hyper-cubic regular lattice in arbitrary even dimensions is investigated by applying the method of exterior differential calculus. The topological invariance, gauge invariance and locality of the axial anomaly determine the explicit form of the topological part. The anomaly is obtained up to a multiplicative constant for finite lattice spacing and can be interpreted as the Chern character of the abelian lattice gauge theory.
