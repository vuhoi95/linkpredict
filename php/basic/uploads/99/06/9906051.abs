Abstract: The superconformal Ward identities combined with N=2 harmonic analyticity are used to evaluate two-loop four-point correlation functions of gauge-invariant operators in D=4, N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in terms of the well-known one-loop box integral. The result is confirmed by a direct numerical computation.
