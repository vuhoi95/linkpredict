Title: A note on correlation functions in AdS_5/SYM_4 correspondence on the  Coulomb branch
Authors: Iouri Chepelev and Radu Roiban
Abstract: We compute certain two-point functions in D=4, ${\cal N}=4$, SU(N) SYM theory on the Coulomb branch using SUGRA/SYM duality and find an infinite set of first order poles at masses of order $({\rm Higgs~scale})/(g_{YM} \sqrt{N})$.
