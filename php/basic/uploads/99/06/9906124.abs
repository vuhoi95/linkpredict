Abstract: By dimensional reduction of a massive BF theory, a new topological field theory is constructed in (2+1) dimensions. Two different topological terms, one involving a scalar and a Kalb-Ramond fields and another one equivalent to the four-dimensional BF term, are present. We constructed two actions with these topological terms and show that a topological mass generation mechanism can be implemented. Using the non-Chern-Simons topological term, an action is proposed leading to a classical duality relation between Klein-Gordon and Maxwell actions. We also have shown that an action in (2+1) dimensions with the Kalb-Ramond field is related by Buscher's duality transformation to a massive gauge-invariant Stuckelberg-type theory.
