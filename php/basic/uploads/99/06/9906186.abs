Title: Geometric quantisation of the global Liouville mechanics
Authors: Z. Bajnok and D. Nogradi and D. Varga and F. Wagner
Abstract: The reduced SL(2,R) WZW quantum mechanics is analysed in the framework of geometric quantization. The spectrum of the Hamiltonian is determined, and it is found, that contrary to the previous approaches, there is a unique, physically preferred quantisation of the system.
