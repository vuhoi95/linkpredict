Title: Heavy Thresholds, Slepton Masses and the $Î¼$ Term in Anomaly Mediated  Supersymmetry Breaking
Authors: E. Katz and Y. Shadmi and Y. Shirman
Abstract: The effects of heavy mass thresholds on anomaly-mediated soft supersymmetry breaking terms are discussed. While heavy thresholds completely decouple to lowest order in the supersymmetry breaking, it is argued that they do affect the breaking terms at higher orders. The relevant contributions typically occur at lower order in the loop expansion compared to purely anomaly mediated contributions. The non decoupling contributions may be used to render models in which the only source of supersymmetry breaking is anomaly mediation viable, by generating positive contributions to the sleptons' masses squared. They can also be used to generate acceptable mu- and B-terms.
