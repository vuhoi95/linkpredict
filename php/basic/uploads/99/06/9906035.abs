Title: Correspondence between Minkowski and de Sitter Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Marco Bertola and Vittorio Gorini and Ugo Moschella and Richard Schaeffer
Abstract: In this letter we show that the ``preferred'' Klein-Gordon Quantum Field Theories (QFT's) on a d-dimensional de Sitter spacetime can be obtained from a Klein-Gordon QFT on a (d+1)-dimensional ``ambient'' Minkowski spacetime satisfying the spectral condition and, conversely, that a Klein-Gordon QFT on a (d+1)-dimensional ``ambient'' Minkowski spacetime satisfying the spectral condition can be obtained as superposition of d-dimensional de Sitter Klein-Gordon fields in the preferred vacuum. These results establish a correspondence between QFT's living on manifolds having different dimensions. The method exposed here can be applied to study other situations and notably QFT on Anti de Sitter spacetime.
