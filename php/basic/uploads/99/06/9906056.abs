Title: Supergravity spectrum on AdS_2 x S^2
Authors: Jeremy Michelson and Marcus Spradlin
Abstract: The Kaluza-Klein spectrum of N=2, D=4 supergravity compactified on AdS_2 x S^2 is found and shown to consist of two infinite towers of SU(1,1|2) representations. In addition to `pure gauge' modes living on the boundary of AdS which are familiar from higher dimensional cases, in two dimensions there are modes (e.g. massive gravitons) which enjoy no gauge symmetry yet nevertheless have no on-shell degrees of freedom in the bulk. We discuss these two-dimensional subtleties in detail.
