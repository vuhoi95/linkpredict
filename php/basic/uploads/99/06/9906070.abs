Title: CFT's From Calabi-Yau Four-folds
Authors: S. Gukov and C. Vafa and E. Witten
Abstract: We consider F/M/Type IIA theory compactified to four, three, or two dimensions on a Calabi-Yau four-fold, and study the behavior near an isolated singularity in the presence of appropriate fluxes and branes. We analyze the vacuum and soliton structure of these models, and show that near an isolated singularity, one often generates massless chiral superfields and a superpotential, and in many instances in two or three dimensions one obtains nontrivial superconformal field theories. In the case of two dimensions, we identify some of these theories with certain Kazama-Suzuki coset models, such as the N=2 minimal models.
