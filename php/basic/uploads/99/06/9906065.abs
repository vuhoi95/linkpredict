Title: Matrix Representation of Octonions and Generalizations
Authors: J Daboul and R Delbourgo
Abstract: We define a special matrix multiplication among a special subset of $2N\x 2N$ matrices, and study the resulting (non-associative) algebras and their subalgebras. We derive the conditions under which these algebras become alternative non-associative and when they become associative. In particular, these algebras yield special matrix representations of octonions and complex numbers; they naturally lead to the Cayley-Dickson doubling process. Our matrix representation of octonions also yields elegant insights into Dirac's equation for a free particle. A few other results and remarks arise as byproducts.
