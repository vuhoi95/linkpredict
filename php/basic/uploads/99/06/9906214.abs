Title: (F,Dp) bound states from the boundary state
Authors: P. Di Vecchia and M. Frau and A. Lerda and A. Liccardo
Abstract: We use the boundary state formalism to provide the full conformal description of (F,Dp) bound states. These are BPS configurations that arise from a superposition of a fundamental string and a Dp brane, and are charged under both the NS-NS antisymmetric tensor and the (p+1)-form R-R potential. We construct the boundary state for these bound states by switching on a constant electric field on the world-volume of a Dp brane and fix its value by imposing the Dirac quantization condition on the charges. Using the operator formalism we also derive the Dirac-Born-Infeld action and the classical supergravity solutions corresponding to these configurations.
