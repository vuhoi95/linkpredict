Title: NS fivebranes in type 0 string theory
Authors: Ben Craps and Frederik Roose
Abstract: The massless degrees of freedom of type 0 NS5-branes are derived. A non-chiral, purely bosonic spectrum is found in both type 0A and 0B. This non-chirality is confirmed by a one-loop computation in the bulk. Some puzzles concerning type 0B S-duality are pointed out in this context. An interpretation of the spectra in terms of ``type 0 little strings'' is proposed.
