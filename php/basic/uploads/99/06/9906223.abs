Title: Strings, Branes and Two-Time Physics
Authors: I. Bars and C. Deliduman and D. Minic
Abstract: We generalize the ideas and formalism of Two-Time Physics from particle dynamics to some specific examples of string and p-brane (p >= 1) dynamics. The two-time string or p-brane action can be gauge fixed to produce various one-time string or p-brane actions that are dual to each other under gauge transformations. We discuss the particular gauges that correspond to tensionless strings and p-branes in flat (d-1)+1 spacetime, rigid strings and p-branes in flat (d-1)+1 spacetime, and tensionless strings and p-branes propagating in the AdS_{d-n} x S^n backgrounds.
