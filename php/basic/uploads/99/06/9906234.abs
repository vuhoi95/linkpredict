Title: A Note on Orientifolds and Dualities of Type 0B String Theory
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Alok Kumar
Abstract: We generalize the construction of four dimensional non-tachyonic orientifolds of type 0B string theory to non-supersymmetric backgrounds. We construct a four dimensional model containing self-dual D3 and D9-branes and leading to a chiral anomaly-free massless spectrum. Moreover, we discuss a further tachyon-free six dimensional model with only D5 branes. Eventually, we speculate about strong coupling dual models of the ten-dimensional orientifolds of type 0B.
