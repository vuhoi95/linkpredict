Title: Effective field theory approach to N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills at  finite temperature
Authors: Agustin Nieto and Michel H. G. Tytgat
Abstract: We study the perturbation expansion of the free energy of N=4 supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills at finite temperature in powers of 't Hooft's coupling g^2 N in the large N limit. Infrared divergences are controlled by constructing a hierarchy of two 3 dimensional effective field theories. This procedure is applied to the calculation of the free energy to order (g^2 N)^(3/2), but it can be extended to higher order corrections.
