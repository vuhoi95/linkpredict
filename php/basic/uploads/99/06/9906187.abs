Title: Integrable models and degenerate horizons in two-dimensional gravity
Authors: J. Cruz and A. Fabbri and D. J. Navarro and J. Navarro-Salas
Abstract: We analyse an integrable model of two-dimensional gravity which can be reduced to a pair of Liouville fields in conformal gauge. Its general solution represents a pair of ``mirror'' black holes with the same temperature. The ground state is a degenerate constant dilaton configuration similar to the Nariai solution of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter case. The existence of $\phi=const.$ solutions and their relation with the solution given by the 2D Birkhoff's theorem is then investigated in a more general context. We also point out some interesting features of the semiclassical theory of our model and the similarity with the behaviour of AdS$_2$ black holes.
