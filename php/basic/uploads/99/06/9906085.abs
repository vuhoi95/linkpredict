Title: Renormalization Group Flow and Thermodynamics of Conformal Field  Theories
Authors: Anastasios C. Petkou and George Siopsis
Abstract: We discuss the free-energy density of bosonic and fermionic theories possessing strongly coupled critical points in D=3. We construct a stationary renormalization group trajectory which interpolates between the free massless theory of N scalars and a class of interacting theories including both bosons and fermions. At a special point of this trajectory the free-energy density is 5/4 times the free-energy density of the O(N) vector model at its nontrivial critical point. Our method could in principle be useful in the study of other theories with strongly coupled fixed points, such as {\cal N}=4 SYM in D=4.
