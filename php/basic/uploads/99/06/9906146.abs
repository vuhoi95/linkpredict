Title: On the finiteness of a new topological model in D=3
Authors: O. M. Del Cima and J. M. Grimstrup and M. Schweda
Abstract: A new topological model is proposed in three dimensions as an extension of the BF-model. It is a three-dimensional counterpart of the two-dimensional model introduced by Chamseddine and Wyler ten years ago. The BFK-model, as we shall call it, shows to be quantum scale invariant at all orders in perturbation theory. The proof of its full finiteness is given in the framework of algebraic renormalization.
