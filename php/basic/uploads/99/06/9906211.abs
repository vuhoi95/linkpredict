Authors: J. Erickson and G. W. Semenoff and K. Zarembo
Abstract: Correlators of Wilson loop operators with O_4=Tr(F_{\mu\nu}^2+...) are computed in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory using the AdS/CFT correspondence. The results are compared with the leading order perturbative computations. As a consequence of conformal invariance, these correlators have identical forms in the weak and strong coupling limits for circular loops. They are essentially different for contours not protected by conformal symmetry.
