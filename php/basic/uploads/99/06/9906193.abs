Title: Instanton Recursion Relations for the Effective Prepotential in N=2  Super Yang-Mills
Authors: G. Chan and E. D'Hoker
Abstract: Linear recursion relations for the instanton corrections to the effective prepotential of N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories with an arbitrary number of hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation of an arbitrary classical gauge group are dervied. The construction proceeds from the Seiberg-Witten solutions and the renormalization group type equations for the prepotential. Successive iterations of these recursion relations allow us to simple obtain instanton corrections to arbitrarily high order, which we exhibit explicitly up to 6-th order. For gauge groups SU(2) and SU(3), our results agree with previous ones.
