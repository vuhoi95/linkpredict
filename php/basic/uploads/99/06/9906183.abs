Title: On gauge fixing in the Lagrangian formalism of superfield BRST  quantization
Authors: Bodo Geyer and Petr M. Lavrov and Pavel Yu. Moshin
Abstract: We propose a modification of the gauge-fixing procedure in the Lagrangian method of superfield BRST quantization for general gauge theories which simultaneously provides a natural generalization of the well-known BV quantization scheme as far as gauge-fixing is concerned. A superfield form of BRST symmetry for the vacuum functional is found. The gauge-independence of the S-matrix is established.
