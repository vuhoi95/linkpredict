Title: The AdS/CFT Correspondence for the Massive Rarita-Schwinger Field
Authors: P. Matlock and K. S. Viswanathan
Abstract: The complete solution to the massive Rarita-Schwinger field equation in anti-de Sitter space is constructed, and used in the AdS/CFT correspondence to calculate the correlators for the boundary conformal field theory. It is found that when no condition is imposed on the field solution, there appear two different boundary conformal field operators, one coupling to a Rarita-Schwinger field and the other to a Dirac field. These two operators are seen to have different scaling dimensions, with that of the spinor-coupled operator exhibiting non-analytic mass dependence.
