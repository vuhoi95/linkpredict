Title: Non-Supersymmetric Gauge Theories from D-Branes in Type 0 String Theory
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Anamaria Font and Dieter Lust
Abstract: We construct non-supersymmetric four dimensional gauge theories arising as effective theories of D-branes placed on various singularities in Type 0B string theory. We mostly focus on models which are conformal in the large N limit and present both examples appearing on self-dual D3-branes on orbifold singularities and examples including orientifold planes. Moreover, we derive type 0 Hanany-Witten setups with NS 5-branes intersected by D-branes and the corresponding rules for determining the massless spectra. Finally, we discuss possible duality symmetries (Seiberg-duality) for non-supersymmetric gauge theories within this framework.
