Title: Universal correlations of one-dimensional interacting electrons in the  gas phase
Authors: F. GÃ¶hmann and V. E. Korepin
Abstract: We consider dynamical correlation functions of short range interacting electrons in one dimension at finite temperature. Below a critical value of the chemical potential there is no Fermi surface anymore, and the system can no longer be described as a Luttinger liquid. Its low temperature thermodynamics is that of an ideal gas. We identify the impenetrable electron gas model as a universal model for the gas phase and present exact and explicit expressions for the asymptotics of correlation functions at small temperatures, in the presence of a magnetic field.
