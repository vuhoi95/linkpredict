Title: Point Mass Geometries, Spectral Flow and AdS_3-CFT_2 Correspondence
Authors: Justin R. David and Gautam Mandal and Sachindeo Vaidya and Spenta R. Wadia
Abstract: We discuss, in terms of the AdS_3-CFT_2 correspondence, a one-parameter family of (asymptotically AdS_3) conical geometries which are generated by point masses and interpolate between AdS_3 and BTZ spacetimes. We show that these correspond to spectral flow in N= (4,4) SCFT_2 which interpolate between NS and R sectors. Our method involves representing the conical spaces as solutions of three-dimensional supergravity based on the supergroup SU(1,1|2) \times SU(1,1|2). The boundary CFT we use is based on the D1/D5 system. The correspondence includes comparing the Euclidean free energies between supergravity and SCFT for the family of conical spaces including BTZ black holes.
