Title: Stable monopole and dyon solutions in the Einstein-Yang-Mills theory in  asymptotically anti-de Sitter Space
Authors: Jefferson Bjoraker and Yutaka Hosotani
Abstract: A continuum of new monopole and dyon solutions in the Einstein-Yang-Mills theory in asymptotically anti-de Sitter space are found. They are regular everywhere and specified with their mass, and non-Abelian electric and magnetic charges. A class of monopole solutions which have no node in non-Abelian magnetic fields are shown to be stable against spherically symmetric linear perturbations.
