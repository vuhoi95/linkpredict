Title: Casimir Energies for Spherically Symmetric Cavities
Authors: Guido Cognola and Emilio Elizalde and Klaus Kirsten
Abstract: A general calculation of Casimir energies --in an arbitrary number of dimensions-- for massless quantized fields in spherically symmetric cavities is carried out. All the most common situations, including scalar and spinor fields, the electromagnetic field, and various boundary conditions are treated with care. The final results are given as analytical (closed) expressions in terms of Barnes zeta functions. A direct, straightforward numerical evaluation of the formulas is then performed, which yields highly accurate numbers of, in principle, arbitrarily good precision.
