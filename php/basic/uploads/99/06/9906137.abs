Title: A note on the thermodynamics of `little string' theory
Authors: Emil Martinec and Vatche Sahakian
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of the D1-D5 system on a five-torus, focussing on the roles of different scales. One can take a decoupling limit such that the tension of the `little string' inside the fivebrane remains finite and the physics is 5+1 dimensional. The dual black geometry exhibits a boosted Hagedorn phase, as well as a phase describing a boosted fivebrane gas. The dependence on the boost yields information about the nature of the fivebrane modes and their interactions. In particular, the form of the equations of state suggests a description in terms of $k=Q_1 Q_5$ degrees of freedom, which may lead to an explanation of the $(Q_5)^3$ growth in the fivebrane density of states below the Hagedorn transition.
