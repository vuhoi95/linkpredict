Title: Radiative Corrections to the Aharonov-Bohm Scattering
Authors: L. C. de Albuquerque and M. Gomes and A. J. da Silva
Abstract: We consider the scattering of relativistic electrons from a thin magnetic flux tube and perturbatively calculate the order $\alpha$, radiative correction, to the first order Born approximation. We show also that the second order Born amplitude vanishes, and obtain a finite inclusive cross section for the one-body scattering which incorporates soft photon bremsstrahlung effects. Moreover, we determine the radiatively corrected Aharonov-Bohm potential and, in particular, verify that an induced magnetic field is generated outside of the flux tube.
