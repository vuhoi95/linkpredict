Title: Remarks on 2+1 Self-dual Chern-Simons Gravity
Authors: H. Garcia-Compean and O. Obregon and C. Ramirez and M. Sabido
Abstract: We study 2+1 Chern-Simons gravity at the classical action level. In particular we rederive the linear combinations of the ``standard'' and ``exotic'' Einstein actions, from the (anti) self-duality of the ``internal'' Lorentzian indices. The relation to a genuine four-dimensional (anti)self-dual topological theory greatly facilitates the analysis and its relation to hyperbolic three-dimensional geometry. Finally a non-abelian vector field ``dual'' action is also obtained.
