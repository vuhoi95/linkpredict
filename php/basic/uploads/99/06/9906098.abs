Title: Supersymmetric Rotating Black Holes and Causality Violation
Authors: G. W. Gibbons and C. A. R. Herdeiro
Abstract: The geodesics of the rotating extreme black hole in five spacetime dimensions found by Breckenridge, Myers, Peet and Vafa are Liouville integrable and may be integrated by additively separating the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This allows us to obtain the St\"ackel-Killing tensor. We use these facts to give the maximal analytic extension of the spacetime and discuss some aspects of its causal structure. In particular, we exhibit a `repulson'-like behaviour occuring when there are naked closed timelike curves. In this case we find that the spacetime is geodesically complete (with respect to causal geodesics) and free of singularities. When a partial Cauchy surface exists, we show, by solving the Klein-Gordon equation, that the absorption cross-section for massless waves at small frequencies is given by the area of the hole. At high frequencies a dependence on the angular quantum numbers of the wave develops. We comment on some aspects of `inertial time travel' and argue that such time machines cannot be constructed by spinning up a black hole with no naked closed timelike curves.
