Title: Spatial Compactification and Decay-Rate Behavior
Authors: D. K. Park and Soo-Young Lee and Hungsoo Kim
Abstract: The pahse transition from instanton-dominated quantum tunneling regime to sphaleron-dominated classical crossover regime is explored in (1+1)-dimensional scalar field theory when spatial coordinate is compactified. It is shown that the type of sphaleron transition is critically dependent on the circumference of the spatial coordinate.
