Title: Constrained Quantization of Open String in Background B Field and  Noncommutative D-brane
Authors: Chong-Sun Chu and Pei-Ming Ho
Abstract: In a previous paper we provided a consistent quantization of open strings ending on D-branes with a background $B$ field. In this letter, we show that the same result can also be obtained using the more traditional method of Dirac's constrained quantization. We also extend the discussion to the fermionic sector.
