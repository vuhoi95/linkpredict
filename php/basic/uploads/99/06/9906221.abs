Title: Gauged Six-dimensional Supergravity from Massive Type IIA
Authors: M. Cvetic and H. Lu and C. N. Pope
Abstract: We obtain the complete non-linear Kaluza-Klein ansatz for the reduction of the bosonic sector of massive type IIA supergravity to the Romans F(4) gauged supergravity in six dimensions. The latter arises as a consistent warped S^4 reduction.
