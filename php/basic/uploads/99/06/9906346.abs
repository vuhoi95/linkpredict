Title: On two-color QCD with baryon chemical potential
Authors: J. B. Kogut and M. A. Stephanov and D. Toublan
Abstract: We study SU(2) color QCD with even number of quark flavors. First, using QCD inequalities we show that at finite baryon chemical potential mu, condensation must occur in the channel with scalar diquark quantum numbers. This breaks the U(1) symmetry generated by baryon charge (baryon superconductivity). Then we derive the effective Lagrangian describing low lying meson and baryon excitations using extended local chiral symmetry of the theory. This enables us to determine the leading term in the dependence of the masses on mu exactly.
