Authors: Hiroaki Kouno and Akira Hasegawa and Masahiro Nakano and Kunito Tuchitani
Abstract: We study nonlinear effects in the QED ladder Schwinger-Dyson(SD) equation. Without further approximations, we show that all nonlinear effects in the ladder SD equation can be included in the effective couplings and how a linear approximation works well. The analyses is generalized in the case of the improved ladder calculation with the Higashijima-Miransky approximation.
