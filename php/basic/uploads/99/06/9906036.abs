Title: Mode decomposition and renormalization in semiclassical gravity
Authors: Albert Roura and Enric Verdaguer
Abstract: We compute the influence action for a system perturbatively coupled to a linear scalar field acting as the environment. Subtleties related to divergences that appear when summing over all the modes are made explicit and clarified. Being closely connected with models used in the literature, we show how to completely reconcile the results obtained in the context of stochastic semiclassical gravity when using mode decomposition with those obtained by other standard functional techniques.
