Title: Qualitons At High Density
Authors: Deog Ki Hong and Mannque Rho and Ismail Zahed
Abstract: In the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase of the QCD superconductor we show that baryons behave as qualitons (called "superqualitons") with quantum numbers $B=(1 {\rm mod} 2)/3$, S=1/2 and Y=B. An intriguing possibility implied by this identification is that light baryonic modes in the form of superqualitons could be excited below the (color) superconducting gap in the CFL phase, a novel phenomenon foreign to normal superconductors.
