Title: Quantum Decoherence and Higher Order Corrections to the Large Time  Exponential Behaviour
Authors: I. Ya. Aref'eva and I. V. Volovich
Abstract: There exists the well known approximate expression describing the large time behaviour of matrix elements of the evolution operator in quantum theory: <U(t)>=exp(at)+... This expression plays the crucial role in considerations of problems of quantum decoherence, radiation, decay, scattering theory, stochastic limit, derivation of master and kinetic equations etc. This expression was obtained in the Weisskopf-Wigner approximation and in the van Hove (stochastic) limit. We derive the exact general formula which includes the higher order corrections to the above approximate expression: <U(t)>=exp(At+B+C(t)). The constants A and B and the oscillating function C(t) are computed in perturbation theory. The method of perturbation of spectra and renormalized wave operators is used. The formula is valid for a general class of Hamiltonians used in statistical physics and quantum field theory.
