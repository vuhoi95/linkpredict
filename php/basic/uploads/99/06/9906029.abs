Title: A Microscopic Recoil Model for Light-Cone Fluctuations in Quantum  Gravity
Authors: John Ellis and N. E. Mavromatos and D. V. Nanopoulos
Abstract: We present a microscopic model for light-cone fluctuations ``in vacuo'', which incorporates a treatment of quantum-gravitational recoil effects induced by energetic particles. Treating defects in space-time as solitons in string theory, we derive an energy-dependent refractive index and a stochastic spread in the arrival times of mono-energetic photons due to quantum diffusion through space-time foam, as found previously using an effective Born-Infeld action. Distant astrophysical sources provide sensitive tests of these possible quantum-gravitational phenomena.
