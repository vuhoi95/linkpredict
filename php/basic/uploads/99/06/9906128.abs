Title: Behavior of logarithmic branch cuts in the self-energy of gluons at  finite temperature
Authors: F. T. Brandt and J. Frenkel
Abstract: We give a simple argument for the cancellation of the log(-k^2) terms (k is the gluon momentum) between the zero-temperature and the temperature-dependent parts of the thermal self-energy.
