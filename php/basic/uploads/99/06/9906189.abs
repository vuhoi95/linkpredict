Title: A non-perturbative analysis of symmetry breaking in two-dimensional  phi^4 theory using periodic field methods
Authors: Pablo J. Marrero and Erick A. Roura and Dean Lee
Abstract: We describe the generalization of spherical field theory to other modal expansion methods. The main approach remains the same, to reduce a d-dimensional field theory into a set of coupled one-dimensional systems. The method we discuss here uses an expansion with respect to periodic-box modes. We apply the method to phi^4 theory in two dimensions and compute the critical coupling and critical exponents. We compare with lattice results and predictions via universality and the two-dimensional Ising model.
