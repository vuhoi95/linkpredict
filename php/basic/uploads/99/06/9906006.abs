Title: M-theory resolution of four-dimensional cosmological singularities via  U-duality
Authors: A. Feinstein and M. A. Vazquez-Mozo
Abstract: We consider cosmological solutions of string and M-theory compactified to four dimensions by giving a general prescription to construct four-dimensional modular cosmologies with two commuting Killing vectors from vacuum solutions. By lifting these solutions to higher dimensions we analyze the existence of cosmological singularities and find that, in the case of non-closed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universes, singularities can be removed from the higher-dimensional model when only one of the extra dimensions is time-varying. By studying the moduli space of compactifications of M-theory resulting in homogeneous cosmologies in four dimensions we show that U-duality transformations map singular cosmologies into non-singular ones.
