Title: Gauge Coupling Unification with Extra Dimensions and Correction due to  Higher Dimensional Operators
Authors: Katri Huitu and Tatsuo Kobayashi
Abstract: We study the gauge coupling unification with extra dimensions. We take into account corrections due to the higher dimensional operators. We show the prediction of $\alpha_3(M_Z)$ is sensitive to such corrections, even if $c<\Phi>/M=O(0.01)$. We also discuss the $b-\tau$ Yukawa unification.
