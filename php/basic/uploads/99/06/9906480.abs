Title: Large Dimensions and String Physics at a TeV
Authors: I. Antoniadis and B. Pioline
Abstract: Large extra dimensions, of size of order of TeV^{-1} ~= 10^{-16} cm, arise naturally in the context of supersymmetry breaking in string theory, while strings at a TeV scale offer a solution to the gauge hierarchy problem, as an alternative to softly broken supersymmetry or technicolor. In this short review, we present consistent perturbative realizations of string theories with large volume compactifications and low string tensions, and discuss their main physical implications.
