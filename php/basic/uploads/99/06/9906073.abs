Title: Concavity of the $Q\bar Q$ potential in ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills  gauge theory and AdS/CFT duality
Authors: H. Dorn and V. D. Pershin
Abstract: We derive a generalised concavity condition for potentials between static sources obtained from Wilson loops coupling both to gauge bosons and a set of scalar fields. It involves the second derivatives with respect to the distance in ordinary space as well as with respect to the relative orientation in internal space. In addition we discuss the use of this field theoretical condition as a nontrivial consistency check of the AdS/CFT duality.
