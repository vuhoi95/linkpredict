Title: Vector Symmetries and Theta-Vacuum
Authors: V. Azcoiti and A. Galante
Abstract: Under very general assumptions we show that Vafa-Witten theorem on vector symmetries in vector-like theories can be extended to some physically relevant gauge theories with non-positive definite integration measure as QCD with a theta-vacuum term.
