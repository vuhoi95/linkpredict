Title: On Spherically Symmetric Breathers in Scalar Theories
Authors: James N. Hormuzdiar and Stephen D. H. Hsu
Abstract: We develop an algorithm which can be used to exclude the existence of classical breathers (periodic finite energy solutions) in scalar field theories, and apply it to several cases of interest. In particular, the technique is used to show that a pair of potentially periodic solutions of the 3+1 Sine-Gordon Lagrangian, found numerically in earlier work, are not breathers. These ``pseudo-breather states'' do have a signature in our method, which we suggest can be used to find similar quasi-bound state configurations in other theories. We also discuss the results of our algorithm when applied to the 1+1 Sine-Gordon model (which exhibits a well-known set of breathers), and $\phi ^4$ theory.
