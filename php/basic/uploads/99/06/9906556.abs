Title: Higgs as a Slepton
Authors: Aaron K. Grant and Zurab Kakushadze
Abstract: In theories with TeV scale quantum gravity there is a logical possibility where the electroweak Higgs can be a fourth generation slepton. Despite maximal supersymmetry breaking such a scenario turns out to be tightly constrained, and might be testable already at present collider experiments. Also, a light Higgs is no longer a prediction of supersymmetry.
