Title: Gravitating monopole and its black hole solution in Brans-Dicke Theory
Authors: Takashi Tamaki and Takashi Torii and Kei-ichi Maeda
Abstract: We find a self-gravitating monopole and its black hole solution in Brans-Dicke theory. We mainly discuss the properties of these solutions in the Einstein frame and compare the solutions with those in general relativity.
