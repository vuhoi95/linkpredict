Title: Hamiltonian Approach to Lagrangian Gauge Symmetries
Authors: R. Banerjee and H. J. Rothe and K. D. Rothe
Abstract: We reconsider the problem of finding all local symmetries of a Lagrangian. Our approach is completely Hamiltonian without any reference to the associated action. We present a simple algorithm for obtaining the restrictions on the gauge parameters entering in the definition of the generator of gauge transformations.
