Title: On the deformation quantization of coadjoint orbits of semisimple Lie  groups
Authors: R. Fioresi and M. A. Lledo
Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of deformation quantization of the algebra of polynomial functions on coadjoint orbits of semisimple lie groups. The deformation of an orbit is realized by taking the quotient of the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra of the given Lie group, by a suitable ideal. A comparison with geometric quantization in the case of SU(2) is done where both methods agree.
