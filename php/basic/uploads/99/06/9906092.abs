Title: Semiclassical Approximation for Chern-Simons Theory and 3-Hyperbolic  Invariants
Authors: A. A. Bytsenko and L. Vanzo and S. Zerbini
Abstract: The invariant integration method for Chern-Simons theory defined on the compact hyperbolic manifold {\Gamma}\H^3 is verified in the semiclassical approximation. The semiclassical limit for the partition function is presented. We discuss briefly L^2 - analytic torsion and the eta invariant of Atiyah-Patodi-Singer for compact hyperbolic 3-manifolds.
