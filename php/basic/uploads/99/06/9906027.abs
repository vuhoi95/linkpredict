Title: Seiberg-Witten Theory and Calogero-Moser Systems
Authors: Eric D'Hoker and D. H. Phong
Abstract: We present a brief account of a series of recent results on twisted and untwisted elliptic Calogero-Moser systems, and on their fundamental role in the Seiberg-Witten solution of gauge theories with one massive hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation of an arbitrary gauge algebra G.
