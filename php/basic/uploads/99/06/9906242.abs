Title: Fractional Branes and Boundary States in Orbifold Theories
Authors: Duiliu-Emanuel Diaconescu and Jaume Gomis
Abstract: We study the D-brane spectrum of N=2 string orbifold theories using the boundary state formalism. The construction is carried out for orbifolds with isolated singularities, non-isolated singularities and orbifolds with discrete torsion. Our results agree with the corresponding K-theoretic predictions when they are available and generalize them when they are not. This suggests that the classification of boundary states provides a sort of "quantum K-theory" just as chiral rings in CFT provide "quantum" generalizations of cohomology. We discuss the identification of these states with D-branes wrapping holomorphic cycles in the large radius limit of the CFT moduli space. The example C^3/Z_3 is worked out in full detail using local mirror symmetry techniques. We find a precise correspondence between fractional branes at the orbifold point and configurations of D-branes described by vector bundles on the exceptional P^2 cycle.
