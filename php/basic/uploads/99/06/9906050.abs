Title: Exotic solutions in string theory
Authors: Stanislav Klimenko and Igor Nikitin
Abstract: Solutions of classical string theory, correspondent to the world sheets, mapped in Minkowsky space with a fold, are considered. Typical processes for them are creation of strings from vacuum, their recombination and annihilation. These solutions violate positiveness of square of mass and Regge condition. In quantum string theory these solutions correspond to physical states |DDF>+|sp> with non-zero spurious component.
