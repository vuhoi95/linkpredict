Title: One-loop Conformal Anomalies From AdS/CFT in the Schrodinger  Representation
Authors: Paul Mansfield and David Nolland
Abstract: We compute the conformal anomalies of boundary CFTs for scalar and fermionic fields propagating in AdS spacetime at one-loop. The coefficients are quantized, with values related to the mass-spectra for Kaluza-Klein compactifications of Supergravity on AdS5xS5 and AdS7xS4. Our approach interprets the boundary partition function of fields propagating on AdS spacetime in terms of wave-functionals that satisfy the functional Schrodinger equation.
