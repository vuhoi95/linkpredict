Title: Large-N Yang-Mills Theory as Classical Mechanics
Authors: C. -W. H. Lee and S. G. Rajeev
Abstract: To formulate two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory with adjoint matter fields in the large-N limit as classical mechanics, we derive a Poisson algebra for the color-invariant observables involving adjoint matter fields. We showed rigorously in J. Math. Phys. 40, 1870 (1999) that different quantum orderings of the observables produce essentially the same Poisson algebra. Here we explain, in a less precise but more pedagogical manner, the crucial topological graphical observations underlying the formal proof.
