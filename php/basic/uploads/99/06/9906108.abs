Title: An introduction to perturbative and non-perturbative string theory
Authors: Ignatios Antoniadis and Guillaume Ovarlez
Abstract: In these lectures we give a brief introduction to perturbative and non-perturbative string theory. The outline is the following: 1. Introduction to perturbative string theory 1.1 From point particle to extended objects 1.2 Free closed and open string spectrum 1.3 Compactification on a circle and T-duality 1.4 The Superstring: type IIA and IIB 1.5 Heterotic string and orbifold compactifications 1.6 Type I string theory 1.7 Effective field theories References 2. Introduction to non-perturbative string theory 2.1 String solitons 2.2 Non-perturbative string dualities 2.3 M-theory 2.4 Effective field theories and duality tests References
