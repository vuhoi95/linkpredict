Title: On the Quantization of Nambu Brackets
Authors: Hidetoshi Awata and Miao Li and Djordje Minic and Tamiaki Yoneya
Abstract: We present several non-trivial examples of the three-dimensional quantum Nambu bracket which involve square matrices or three-index objects. Our examples satisfy two fundamental properties of the classical Nambu bracket: they are skew-symmetric and they obey the Fundamental Identity. We contrast our approach to the existing literature on the quantum deformations of Nambu mechanics. We also discuss possible applications of our results in M-theory.
