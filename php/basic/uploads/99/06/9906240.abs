Abstract: We construct a two parameter family of 2-particle Hamiltonians closed under the duality operation of interchanging the (relative) momentum and coordinate. Both coordinate and momentum dependence are elliptic, and the modulus of the momentum torus is a non-trivial function of the coordinate. This model contains as limiting cases the standard Ruijsenaars-Calogero and Toda family of Hamiltonians, which are at most elliptic in the coordinates, but not in the momenta.
