Title: On the Pairing Structure of the Vacuum induced by a Magnetic Field in  2+1-dimensional Dirac Field Theory
Authors: Giovanni Jona-Lasinio and Francesca Maria Marchetti
Abstract: Using a sequence of Bogoliubov transformations, we obtain an exact expression for the vacuum state of a Dirac field in 2+1 dimensions in presence of a constant magnetic field. This expression reveals a peculiar two level pairing structure for any value of the mass m greater than zero. This calculation clarifies the nature of the condensate in the lowest Landau level whose existence has been emphasized recently by a several authors.
