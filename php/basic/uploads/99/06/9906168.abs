Title: Exact Embedding of N=1, D=7 Gauged Supergravity in D=11
Authors: H. Lu and C. N. Pope
Abstract: We obtain the explicit and complete bosonic non-linear Kaluza-Klein ansatz for the consistent S^4 reduction of D=11 supergravity to N=1, D=7 gauged supergravity. This provides a geometrical interpretation of the lower dimensional solutions from the eleven-dimensional point of view.
