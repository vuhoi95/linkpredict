Title: D-branes on the Quintic
Authors: Ilka Brunner and Michael R. Douglas and Albion Lawrence and Christian Romelsberger
Abstract: We study D-branes on the quintic CY by combining results from several directions: general results on holomorphic curves and vector bundles, stringy geometry and mirror symmetry, and the boundary states in Gepner models recently constructed by Recknagel and Schomerus, to begin sketching a picture of D-branes in the stringy regime. We also make first steps towards computing superpotentials on the D-brane world-volumes.
