Title: The Potts-q random matrix model : loop equations, critical exponents,  and rational case
Authors: B. Eynard and G. Bonnet
Abstract: In this article, we study the q-state Potts random matrix models extended to branched polymers, by the equations of motion method. We obtain a set of loop equations valid for any arbitrary value of q. We show that, for q=2-2 \cos {l \over r} \pi (l, r mutually prime integers with l < r), the resolvent satisfies an algebraic equation of degree 2 r -1 if l+r is odd and r-1 if l+r is even. This generalizes the presently-known cases of q=1, 2, 3. We then derive for any 0 \leq q \leq 4 the Potts-q critical exponents and string susceptibility.
