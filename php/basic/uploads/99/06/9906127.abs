Title: The Gravitational Action in Asymptotically AdS and Flat Spacetimes
Authors: Per Kraus and Finn Larsen and Ruud Siebelink
Abstract: The divergences of the gravitational action are analyzed for spacetimes that are asymptotically anti-de Sitter and asymptotically flat. The gravitational action is rendered finite using a local counterterm prescription, and the relation of this method to the traditional reference spacetime is discussed. For AdS, an iterative procedure is devised that determines the counterterms efficiently. For asymptotically flat space, we use a different method to derive counterterms which are sufficient to remove divergences in most cases.
