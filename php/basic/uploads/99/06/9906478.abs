Abstract: The problem of color superconductivity in dense QCD is reconsidered in the improved rainbow approximation to the Schwinger-Dyson equation. The effect of the unscreened magnetic modes of gluons on the value of the color condensate is studied. In particular, it is shown that, at sufficiently large values of the chemical potential, these modes lead to the enhancement of the superconducting order parameter. The interplay between the instanton induced interaction and the one-gluon induced one in color superconductivity is discussed.
