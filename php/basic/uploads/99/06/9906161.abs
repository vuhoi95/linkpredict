Title: Dirac Quantization of Open Strings and Noncommutativity in Branes
Authors: F. Ardalan and H. Arfaei and M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari
Abstract: We apply the Dirac bracket quantization to open strings attached to branes in the presence of background antisymmetric field and recover an inherent noncommutativity in the internal coordinates of the brane.
