Title: Undulating Strings and Gauge Theory Waves
Authors: Curtis G. Callan and Alberto Guijosa
Abstract: We study some dynamical aspects of the correspondence between strings in AdS space and external heavy quarks in N=4 SYM. Specifically, by examining waves propagating on such strings, we make some plausible (and some surprising) inferences about the time-dependent fields produced by oscillating quarks in the strongly-coupled gauge theory. We point out a puzzle regarding energy conservation in the SYM theory. In addition, we perform a similar analysis of the gauge fields produced by a baryon (represented as a D5-brane with string-like extension in AdS space) and compare and contrast with the gauge fields produced by a quark-antiquark pair (represented as a string looping through AdS space).
