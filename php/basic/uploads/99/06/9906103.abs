Title: Electric-Magnetic Duality Invariant Lagrangians
Authors: Machiko Hatsuda and Kiyoshi Kamimura and Sayaka Sekiya
Abstract: We find general non-linear lagrangians of a U(1) field invariant under electric-magnetic duality. They are characterized by an arbitrary function and go to the Maxwell theory in the weak field limit. We give some explicit examples which are generalizations of the Born-Infeld theory.
