Title: A Down to Earth Attempt at Determining the Low Energy Effective Action  of N=2 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: M. Chaichian and W. F. Chen and C. Montonen
Abstract: We review a detailed investigation of the perturbative part of the low-energy effective action of N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in a conventional effective field theory approach. With the restriction that the effective action should contain at most two derivatives and not more than four-fermion couplings, the features of the low-energy effective action obtained by Seiberg based on $U(1)_R$ anomaly and non-perturbative $\beta$-function arguments are shown to emerge.
