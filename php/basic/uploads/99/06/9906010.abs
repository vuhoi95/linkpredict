Title: Expectation values of local fields for a two-parameter family of  integrable models and related perturbed conformal field theories
Authors: P. Baseilhac and V. A. Fateev
Abstract: We calculate the vacuum expectation values of local fields for the two-parameter family of integrable field theories introduced and studied by Fateev. Using this result we propose an explicit expression for the vacuum expectation values of local operators in parafermionic sine-Gordon models and in integrable perturbed SU(2) coset conformal field theories.
