Title: Magnetic Confinement in QCD
Authors: Y. M. Cho and D. G. Pak
Abstract: We present a strong evidence for the magnetic confinement in QCD by demonstrating that the one loop effective action of SU(2) QCD induces a dynamical symmetry breaking thorugh the monopole condensation, which could induce the dual Meissner effect and guarantee the confinement of color in the non-Abelian gauge theory. The result is obtained by separating the topological degrees which describes the non-Abelian monopoles from the dynamical degrees of the potential, and integrating out all the dynamical degrees of QCD.
