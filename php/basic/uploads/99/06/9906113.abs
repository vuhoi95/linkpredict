Title: Lam'e Instantons
Authors: Gerald V. Dunne and Kumar Rao
Abstract: We perform a precise analytic test of the instanton approximation by comparing the exact band spectrum of the periodic Lam\'e potential to the tight-binding, instanton and WKB approximations. The instanton result gives the correct leading behavior in the semiclassical limit, while the tight-binding approximation does even better. WKB is off by an overall factor of $\sqrt{e/\pi}$.
