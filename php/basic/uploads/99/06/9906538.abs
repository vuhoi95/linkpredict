Title: Particle Production and Effective Thermalization in Inhomogeneous Mean  Field Theory
Authors: Gert Aarts and Jan Smit
Abstract: As a toy model for dynamics in nonequilibrium quantum field theory we consider the abelian Higgs model in 1+1 dimensions with fermions. In the approximate dynamical equations, inhomogeneous classical (mean) Bose fields are coupled to quantized fermion fields, which are treated with a mode function expansion. The effective equations of motion imply e.g. Coulomb scattering, due to the inhomogeneous gauge field. The equations are solved numerically. We define time dependent fermion particle numbers with the help of the single-time Wigner function and study particle production starting from inhomogeneous initial conditions. The particle numbers are compared with the Fermi-Dirac distribution parametrized by a time dependent temperature and chemical potential. We find that the fermions approximately thermalize locally in time.
