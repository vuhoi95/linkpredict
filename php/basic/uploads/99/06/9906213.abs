Title: Sphaleron of a 4 dimensional SO(4) Higgs model
Authors: B. Kleihaus and D. H. Tchrakian and F. Zimmerschied
Abstract: We construct the finite energy path between topologically distinct vacua of a 4 dimensional SO(4) Higgs model which is known to support an instanton, and show that there is a sphaleron with Chern-Simons number N_CS=1/2 at the top of the energy barrier. This is carried out using the original geometric loop construction of Manton.
