Title: Implications of decoupling effects for one-loop corrected effective  actions from superstring theory
Authors: I. L. Buchbinder and M. Cvetic and A. Yu. Petrov
Abstract: We study the decoupling effects in one-loop corrected N=1 supersymmetric theory with gauge neutral chiral superfields, by calculating the one-loop corrected effective Lagrangian that involves light and heavy fields with the mass scale M, and subsequently eliminating heavy fields by their equations of motion. In addition to new non-renormalizable couplings, we determine the terms that grow as log(M) and renormalize the fields and couplings in the effective field theory, in accordance with the decoupling theorem. However, in a theory derived from superstring theory, these terms can significantly modify low energy predictions for the effective couplings of light fields. For example, in a class of heterotic superstring vacua with an anomalous U(1) the vacuum restabilization introduces such decoupling effects which in turn correct the low energy predictions for certain couplings by 10-50%.
