Title: Comments on Large N Matrix Model
Authors: Hiroshige Kajiura and Akishi Kato and Sachiko Ogushi
Abstract: The large N Matrix model is studied with attention to the quantum fluctuations around a given diagonal background. Feynman rules are explicitly derived and their relation to those in usual Yang-Mills theory is discussed. Background D-instanton configuration is naturally identified as a discretization of momentum space of a corresponding QFT. The structure of large N divergence is also studied on the analogy of UV divergences in QFT.
