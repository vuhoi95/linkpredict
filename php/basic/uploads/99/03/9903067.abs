Title: A Comment on the Zamolodchikov c-Function and the Black String Entropy
Authors: Akikazu Hashimoto and N. Itzhaki
Abstract: Using the spectral representation approach to the Zamolodchikov's c-function and the Maldacena conjecture for the D1-branes, we compute the entropy of type IIB strings. An agreement, up to a numerical constant which cannot be determined using this approach, with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is found.
