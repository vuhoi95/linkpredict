Title: Non-abelian Exclusion Statistics
Authors: Sathya Guruswamy and Kareljan Schoutens
Abstract: We introduce the notion of `order-$k$ non-abelian exclusion statistics'. We derive the associated thermodynamic equations by employing the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz for specific non-diagonal scattering matrices. We make contact with results obtained by different methods and we point out connections with `fermionic sum formulas' for characters in a Conformal Field Theory. As an application, we derive thermodynamic distribution functions for quasi-holes over a class of non-abelian quantum Hall states recently proposed by Read and Rezayi.
