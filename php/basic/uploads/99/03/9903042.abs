Title: Stringy Corrections to the Wilson Loop in N=4 Super Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Stefan Forste and Debashis Ghoshal and Stefan Theisen
Abstract: We study stringy fluctuations as a source for corrections to the Wilson loop as obtained from the superstrings on (adS_5 x S^5)/ N=4 SYM correspondence. We give a formal expression in terms of determinants of two dimensional operators for the leading order correction.
