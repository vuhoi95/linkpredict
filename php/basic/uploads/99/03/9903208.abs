Title: Universality Class of Confining Strings
Authors: M. C. Diamantini and H. Kleinert and C. A. Trugenberger
Abstract: A recently proposed model of confining strings has a non-local world-sheet action induced by a space-time Kalb-Ramond tensor field. Here we show that, in the large-D approximation, an infinite set of ghost- and tachyon-free truncations of the derivative expansion of this action all lead to c=1 models. Their infrared limit describes smooth strings with world-sheets of Hausdorff dimension D_H=2 and long-range orientational order, as expected for QCD strings.
