Title: Lorentz Invariant Renormalization in Causal Perturbation Theory
Authors: K. Bresser and G. Pinter and D. Prange
Abstract: In the framework of causal perturbation theory renormalization consists of the extension of distributions. We give the explicit form of a Lorentz invariant extension of a scalar distribution, depending on one difference of space time coordinates.
