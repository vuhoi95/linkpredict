Title: Local Mirror Symmetry: Calculations and Interpretations
Authors: T. -M. Chiang and A. Klemm and S. -T. Yau and E. Zaslow
Abstract: We describe local mirror symmetry from a mathematical point of view and make several A-model calculations using the mirror principle (localization). Our results agree with B-model computations from solutions of Picard-Fuchs differential equations constructed form the local geometry near a Fano surface within a Calabi-Yau manifold. We interpret the Gromov-Witten-type numbers from an enumerative point of view. We also describe the geometry of singular surfaces and show how the local invariants of singular surfaces agree with the smooth cases when they occur as complete intersections.
