Title: Baryogenesis at the QCD Scale
Authors: R. Brandenberger and I. Halperin and A. Zhitnitsky
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism for explaining the observed asymmetry between matter and antimatter, based on nonperturbative physics at the QCD scale. Our mechanism is a charge separation scenario, making use of domain walls separating the recently discovered long-lived metastable vacua from the lowest energy vacuum. The walls acquire a fractional negative baryon charge, leaving behind a compensating positive baryon charge in the bulk. The regions of metastable vacuum bounded by walls ("B-shells") will contribute to the dark matter of the Universe.
