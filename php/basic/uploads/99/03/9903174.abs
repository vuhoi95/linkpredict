Abstract: The crossover from thermal hopping to quantum tunneling is studied. We show that the decay rate $\Gamma$ with dissipation can accurately be determined near the crossover temperature. Besides considering the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) exponent, we also calculate contribution of the fluctuation modes around the saddle point and give an extended account of a previous study of crossover region. We deal with two dangerous fluctuation modes whose contribution can't be calculated by the steepest descent method and show that higher order couplings between the two dangerous modes need to be taken into considerations. At last the crossover from thermal hopping to quantum tunneling in the molecular magnet Mn_{12}Ac is studied.
