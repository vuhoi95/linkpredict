Title: Poisson-Lie T-Duality and Bianchi Type Algebras
Authors: M. A. Jafarizadeh and A. Rezaei-Aghdam
Abstract: All Bianchi bialgebras have been obtained. By introducing a non-degenerate adjoint invariant inner product over these bialgebras the associated Drinfeld doubles have been constructed, then by calculating the coupling matrices for these bialgebras several sigma-models with Poisson-Lie symmetry have been obtained. Two simple examples as prototypes of Poisson-Lie dual models have been given.
