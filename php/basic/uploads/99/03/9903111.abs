Title: On the Yangian Y(e_8) quantum symmetry of maximal supergravity in two  dimensions
Authors: K. Koepsell and H. Nicolai and H. Samtleben
Abstract: We present the algebraic framework for the quantization of the classical bosonic charge algebra of maximally extended (N=16) supergravity in two dimensions, thereby taking the first steps towards an exact quantization of this model. At the core of our construction is the Yangian algebra $Y(e_8)$ whose RTT presentation we discuss in detail. The full symmetry algebra is a centrally extended twisted version of the Yangian double $DY(e_8)_c$. We show that there exists only one special value of the central charge for which the quantum algebra admits an ideal by which the algebra can be divided so as to consistently reproduce the classical coset structure $E_{8(8)}/SO(16)$ in the limit $\hbar\to 0$.
