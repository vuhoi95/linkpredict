Title: Moduli Spaces of D-branes in CFT-backgrounds
Authors: Andreas Recknagel and Volker Schomerus
Abstract: D-branes in curved backgrounds can be treated with techniques of boundary conformal field theory. We discuss the influence of scalar condensates on such branes, i.e. perturbations of boundary conditions by marginal boundary operators. A general criterion is presented that guarantees a boundary perturbation to be truly marginal in all orders of perturbation theory. Our results on boundary deformations have several interesting applications which are sketched at the end of this note.
