Title: Bosonic Quadratic Actions for 11D Supergravity on AdS_7/4 x S_4/7
Authors: Fiorenzo Bastianelli and Roberto Zucchini
Abstract: We determine from 11D supergravity the quadratic bulk action for the physical bosonic fields relevant for the computation of correlation functions of normalized chiral operators in D=6, N=(0,2) and D=3, N=8 supersymmetric CFT in the large N limit, as dictated by the AdS/CFT duality conjecture.
