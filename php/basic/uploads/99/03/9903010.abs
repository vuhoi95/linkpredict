Title: Representation of the Resonance of a Relativistic Quantum Field  Theoretical Lee-Friedrichs Model in Lax-Phillips Scattering Theory
Authors: Y. Strauss and L. P. Horwitz
Abstract: The quantum mechanical description of the evolution of an unstable system defined initially as a state in a Hilbert space at a given time does not provide a semigroup (exponential) decay law. The Wigner-Weisskopf survival amplitude, describing reversible quantum transitions, may be dominated by exponential type decay in pole approximation at times not too short or too long, but, in the two channel case, for example, the pole residues are not orthogonal, and the evolution does not correspond to a semigroup (experiments on the decay of the neutral $K$-meson system strongly support the semigroup evolution postulated by Lee, Oehme and Yang, and Yang and Wu). The scattering theory of Lax and Phillips, originally developed for classical wave equations, has been recently extended to the description of the evolution of resonant states in the framework of quantum theory. The resulting evolution law of the unstable system is that of a semigroup, and the resonant state is a well-defined function in the Lax-Phillips Hilbert space. In this paper we apply this theory to a relativistically covariant quantum field theoretical form of the (soluble) Lee model. We construct the translation representations with the help of the wave operators, and show that the resulting Lax-Phillips $S$-matrix is an inner function (the Lax-Phillips theory is essentially a theory of translation invariant subspaces). In the special case that the $S$-matrix is a rational inner function, we obtain the resonant state explicitly and analyze its particle ($V, N, \theta$) content. If there is an exponential bound, the general case differs only by a so-called trivial inner factor, which does not change the complex spectrum, but may affect the wave function of the resonant state.
