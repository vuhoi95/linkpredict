Title: A Density Matrix Renormalization Group Approach to an Asymptotically  Free Model with Bound States
Authors: M. A. Martin-Delgado and G. Sierra
Abstract: We apply the DMRG method to the 2 dimensional delta function potential which is a simple quantum mechanical model with asymptotic freedom and formation of bound states. The system block and the environment block of the DMRG contain the low energy and high energy degrees of freedom, respectively. The ground state energy and the lowest excited states are obtained with very high accuracy. We compare the DMRG method with the Similarity RG method and propose its generalization to field theoretical models in high energy physics.
