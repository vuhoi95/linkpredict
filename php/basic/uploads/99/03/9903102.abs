Title: Zitterbewegung and reduction: 4D spinning particles and 3D anyons on  light-like curves
Authors: Sergei Klishevich and Mikhail Plyushchay
Abstract: We construct the model with light-like world-lines for the massive 4D spinning particles and 3D anyons. It is obtained via the formal bosonization of pseudoclassical model for the massive Dirac particle with subsequent reduction to the light-like curves. The peculiarity of the light-like trajectories produced due to the Zitterbewegung is explained from the viewpoint of reduction and reparametrization invariance.
