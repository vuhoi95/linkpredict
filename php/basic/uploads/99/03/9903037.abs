Abstract: We study the role played by multiply-connectedness in the time evolution of the energy E(t) of a radiating system that lies in static flat space-time manifolds M_4 whose t=const spacelike sections M_3 are compact in at least one spatial direction. The radiation reaction equation of the radiating source is derived for the case where M_3 has any non-trivial flat topology, and an exact solution is obtained. We also show that when the spacelike sections are multiply-connected flat 3-manifolds the energy E(t) exhibits a reverberation pattern with discontinuities in the derivative of E(t) and a set of relative minima and maxima, followed by a growth of E(t). It emerges from this result that the compactness in at least one spatial direction of Minkowski space-time is sufficient to induce this type of topological reverberation, making clear that our radiating system is topologically fragile. An explicit solution of the radiation reaction equation for the case where M_3 = R^2 x S^1 is discussed, and graphs which reveal how the energy varies with the time are presented and analyzed.
