Title: On the Realization of Assisted Inflation
Authors: Panagiota Kanti and Keith A. Olive
Abstract: We consider conditions necessary for a successful implementation of so-called assisted inflation. We generalize the applicability of assisted inflation beyond exponential potentials as originally proposed to include standard chaotic (\lambda \phi^4 or m^2 \phi^2) models as well. We also demonstrate that in a purely 4-dimensional theory, unless the assisted sector is in fact decoupled, the additional fields of the assisted sector actually impede inflation. As a specific example of an assisted sector, we consider a 5-dimensional KK model for which the extra dimension may be somewhat or much larger than the inverse Planck scale. In this case, the assisted sector (coming from a KK compactification) eliminates the need for a fine-tuned quartic coupling to drive chaotic inflation. This is a general result of models with one or more "large" extra dimensions.
