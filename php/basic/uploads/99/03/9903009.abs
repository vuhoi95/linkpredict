Authors: Gabriel H. Flores and Rudnei O. Ramos and N. F. Svaiter
Abstract: We evaluate both the vacuum decay rate at zero temperature and the finite temperature nucleation rate for the $(\lambda\phi^4/4! + \sigma\phi^6/6!)_{3D}$ model. Using the thin-wall approximation, we obtain the bounce solution for the model and we were also able to give the approximate eigenvalue equations for the bounce.
