Title: Infinite Dimensional Free Algebra and the Forms of the Master Field
Authors: M. B. Halpern and C. Schwartz
Abstract: We find an infinite dimensional free algebra which lives at large N in any SU(N)-invariant action or Hamiltonian theory of bosonic matrices. The natural basis of this algebra is a free-algebraic generalization of Chebyshev polynomials and the dual basis is closely related to the planar connected parts. This leads to a number of free-algebraic forms of the master field including an algebraic derivation of the Gopakumar-Gross form. For action theories, these forms of the master field immediately give a number of new free-algebraic packagings of the planar Schwinger-Dyson equations.
