Title: Bosonic-type S-Matrix, Vacuum Instability and CDD Ambiguities
Authors: G. Mussardo and P. Simon
Abstract: We consider the simplest bosonic-type S-matrix which is usually regarded as unphysical due to the complex values of the finite volume ground state energy. While a standard quantum field theory interpretation of such a scattering theory is precluded, we argue that the physical situation described by this S-matrix is of a massive Ising model perturbed by a particular set of irrelevant operators. The presence of these operators drastically affects the stability of the original vacuum of the massive Ising model and its ultraviolet properties.
