Title: Composite Vector and Tensor Gauge Fields, and Volume-Preserving  Diffeomorphisms
Authors: Eduardo I. Guendelman and Emil Nissimov and Svetlana Pacheva
Abstract: We describe new theories of composite vector and tensor (p-form) gauge fields made out of zero-dimensional constituent scalar fields (``primitives''). The local gauge symmetry is replaced by an infinite-dimensional global Noether symmetry -- the group of volume-preserving (symplectic) diffeomorphisms of the target space of the scalar primitives. We find additional non-Maxwell and non-Kalb-Ramond solutions describing topologically massive tensor gauge field configurations in odd space-time dimensions. Generalization to the supersymmetric case is also sketched.
