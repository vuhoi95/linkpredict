Title: Three Dimensional Black Hole Coupled to the Born-Infeld Electrodynamics
Authors: Mauricio Cataldo and Alberto Garcia
Abstract: A nonlinear charged version of the (2+1)-anti de Sitter black hole solution is derived. The source to the Einstein equations is a Born-Infeld electromagnetic field, which in the weak field limit becomes the (2+1)-Maxwell field. The obtained Einstein-Born-Infeld solution for certain range of the parameters (mass, charge, cosmological and Born-Infeld constants) represent a static circularly symmetric black hole. Although the covariant metric components and the electric field do not exhibit a singular behavior at r=0 the curvature invariants are singular at that point.
