Title: More on coupling coefficients for the most degenerate representations of  SO(n)
Authors: Markus Hormess and Georg Junker
Abstract: We present explicit closed-form expressions for the general group-theoretical factor appearing in the alpha-topology of a high-temperature expansion of SO(n)-symmetric lattice models. This object, which is closely related to 6j-symbols for the most degenerate representation of SO(n), is discussed in detail.
