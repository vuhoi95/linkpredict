Title: Using the Hopf Algebra Structure of QFT in Calculations
Authors: D. Kreimer and R. Delbourgo
Abstract: We employ the recently discovered Hopf algebra structure underlying perturbative Quantum Field Theory to derive iterated integral representations for Feynman diagrams. We give two applications: to massless Yukawa theory and quantum electrodynamics in four dimensions.
