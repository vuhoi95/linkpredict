Title: Dynamics on the Light Cone : Compact versus Continuum Quantization
Authors: S. Salmons and P. Grange and E. Werner
Abstract: Compact canonical quantization on the light cone (DLCQ) is examined in the limit of infinite periodicity lenth L. Pauli Jordan commutators are found to approach continuum expressions with marginal non causal terms of order $L^{-3/4}$ traced back to the handling of IR divergence through the elimination of zero modes. In contrast direct quantization in the continuum (CLCQ) in terms of field operators valued distributions is shown to provide the standard causal result while at the same time ensuring consistent IR and UV renormalization.
