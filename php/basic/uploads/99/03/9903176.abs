Title: Exclusion statistics in conformal field theory and the UCPF for WZW  models
Authors: Peter Bouwknegt and Leung Chim and David Ridout
Abstract: In this paper we further elaborate on the notion of fractional exclusion statistics, as introduced by Haldane, in two-dimensional conformal field theory, and its connection to the Universal Chiral Partition Function as defined by McCoy and collaborators. We will argue that in general, besides the pseudo-particles introduced recently by Guruswamy and Schoutens, one needs additional `null quasi-particles' to account for the null-states in the quasi-particle Fock space. We illustrate this in several examples of WZW-models.
