Title: Returns to origin of a one-dimensional random walk visiting each site an  even number of times
Authors: G. M. Cicuta and M. Contedini
Abstract: The class of random walks in one dimension, returning to the origin, restricted by the requirement that any site visited (different from the origin) is visited an even number of times, is analyzed in the present note. We call this class the even-visiting random walks and provide a closed expression to evaluate them.
