Title: Landau-Siegel Zeroes and Black Hole Entropy
Authors: Stephen D. Miller and Gregory Moore
Abstract: There has been some speculation about relations of D-brane models of black holes to arithmetic. In this note we point out that some of these speculations have implications for a circle of questions related to the generalized Riemann hypothesis on the zeroes of Dirichlet $L$-functions.
