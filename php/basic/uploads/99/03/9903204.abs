Title: Dynamical content of Chern-Simons Supergravity
Authors: Osvaldo Chandia and Ricardo Troncoso and Jorge Zanelli
Abstract: The dynamical content of local AdS supergravity in five dimensions is discussed. The bosonic sector of the theory contains the vielbein ($e^{a}$), the spin connection ($\omega ^{ab}$) and internal SU(N) and U(1) gauge fields. The fermionic fields are complex Dirac spinors ($\psi ^{i}$) in a vector representation of SU(N). All fields together form a connection 1-form in the superalgebra SU(2,2|N). For N=4, the symplectic matrix has maximal rank in a locally AdS background in which the dynamical degrees of freedom can be identified. The resulting efective theory have different numbers of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom.
