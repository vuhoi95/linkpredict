Title: Comment on ``Singularities in axially symmetric solutions of  Einstein-Yang Mills and related theories, by Ludger Hannibal,  [hep-th/9903063]''
Authors: B. Kleihaus and J. Kunz
Abstract: We point out that the statements in [hep-th/9903063] concerning the regularity of static axially symmetric solutions in Yang-Mills-dilaton (YMD) [1] and Einstein-Yang-Mills(-dilaton) (EYMD) theory [2,3] are incorrect, and that the non-singular local gauge potential of the YMD solutions [4] is twice differentiable.
