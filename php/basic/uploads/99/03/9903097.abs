Title: Gauge conditions for non-abelian Chern-Simons system consistent with  equations of motion
Authors: K. Dasgupta and M. Sami and Pankaj Sharan and Anupama Mehra
Abstract: Complete constraint analysis and choice of gauge conditions consistent with equations of motion is done for non-abelian Chern-Simons field interacting with N-component complex scalar field. Dirac-Schwinger condition is satisfied by the reduced phase-space Hamiltonian density with respect to the Dirac bracket.
