Title: Type IIB Random Superstrings
Authors: S. Oda and T. Yukawa
Abstract: We consider random superstrings of type IIB in $d$-dimensional space. The discretized action is constructed from the supersymetric matrix model, which has been proposed as a constructive definition of superstring theory. Our action is invariant under the local N=2 super transformations, and doesn't have any redundant fermionic degrees of freedom.
