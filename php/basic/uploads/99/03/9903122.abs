Title: Explicit N=2 supersymmetry for higher-spin massless fields in D=4 AdS  superspace
Authors: A. Yu. Segal and A. G. Sibiryakov
Abstract: We develop two N=2 superfield formulations of free equations of motion for the joint model of all D=4 massless higher-superspin fields in generating form. The explicit Osp(2|4) supersymmetry is achieved without exploiting the harmonic superspace, and with adding no auxiliary component fields to those of N=1 superfields. The formulations are developed in two different Osp(2|4) homogeneous superspaces which have a structure of a fibre bundle over the standard D=4 AdS superspace, with dimensions (7|4) and (7|8). The N=2 covariant derivatives in these spaces are expressed in terms of N=1 ones which gives simple rules for component analysis.
