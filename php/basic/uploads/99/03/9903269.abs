Title: Black holes and membranes in AdS_7
Authors: James T. Liu and Ruben Minasian
Abstract: We investigate maximal gauged supergravity in seven dimensions and some of its solitonic solutions. By focusing on a truncation of the gauged SO(5) R-symmetry group to its U(1)^2 Cartan subgroup, we construct general two charge black holes that are asymptotically anti-de Sitter. We demonstrate that 1- and 2-charge black holes preserve 1/2 and 1/4 of the supersymmetries respectively. Additionally, we examine the odd-dimensional self-duality equation governing the three-form potential transforming as the 5 of SO(5), and provide some insight on the construction of membrane solutions in anti-de Sitter backgrounds.
