Title: Solitons on Branes
Authors: G. W. Semenoff and K. Zarembo
Abstract: We examine the possibility that gauge field configurations on stacks of parallel Dp branes support topological solitons. We give an exhaustive list of possible soliton charges for p<7. We also discuss how configurations carrying the soliton charges can be constructed from intersecting branes.
