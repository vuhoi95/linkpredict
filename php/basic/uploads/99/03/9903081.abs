Title: String creation in D6-brane background
Authors: Toshihiro Matsuo and Takashi Yokono
Abstract: The production of string charge during a crossing of certain oriented D-branes is studied. We compute the string charge in the system of a probe D2-brane and a background D6-brane by use of the equations of motion in the ten-dimensions. We confirm the creation of string charge as inflow from the background D6-brane.
