Abstract: Considering a class of (2,0)-super-Yang-Mills multiplets that accommodate a pair of independent gauge potentials in connection with a single symmetry group, we present here their coupling to ordinary matter and to non-linear $\sigma$-models in (2,0)-superspace. The dynamics and the couplings of the gauge potentials are discussed and the interesting feature that comes out is a sort of ``chirality'' for one of the gauge potentials once light-cone coordinates are chosen.
