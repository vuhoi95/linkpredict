Title: Glueball Mass Spectrum from Supergravity
Authors: Csaba Csaki and John Terning
Abstract: We review the calculation of the spectrum of glueball masses in non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory using the conjectured duality between supergravity and large N gauge theories. The glueball masses are obtained by solving the supergravity wave equations in a black hole geometry. The glueball masses found this way are in unexpected agreement with the available lattice data. We also show how to use a modified version of the duality based on rotating branes to calculate the glueball mass spectrum with some of the Kaluza-Klein states of the supergravity theory decoupled from the spectrum.
