Title: On the Interaction of Monopoles and Domain Walls
Authors: Stephon Alexander and Robert Brandenberger and Richard Easther and Andrew Sornborger
Abstract: We study the interaction between monopoles and embedded domain walls in a O(3) linear sigma model. We discover that there is an attractive force between the monopole and the wall. We provide evidence that after the monopole and domain wall collide, the monopole unwinds on the wall, and that the winding number spreads out on the surface. These results support the suggestion by Dvali et al. (hep-ph/9710301) that the monopole problem can be solved by monopole-domain wall interactions.
