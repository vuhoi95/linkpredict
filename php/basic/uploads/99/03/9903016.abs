Title: Symplectic Geometry on Quantum Plane
Authors: Sergio Albeverio and Shao-Ming Fei
Abstract: A study of symplectic forms associated with two dimensional quantum planes and the quantum sphere in a three dimensional orthogonal quantum plane is provided. The associated Hamiltonian vector fields and Poissonian algebraic relations are made explicit.
