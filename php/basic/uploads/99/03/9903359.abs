Title: Chiral Phase Transition for SU(N) Gauge Theories via an Effective  Lagrangian Approach
Authors: F. Sannino and J. Schechter
Abstract: We study the chiral phase transition for vector-like SU(N) gauge theories as a function of the number of quark flavors N_f by making use of an anomaly-induced effective potential. We modify an effective potential of a previous work, suggested for N_f < N, and apply it to larger values of N_f where the phase transition is expected to occur. The new effective potential depends explicitly on the full \beta-function and the anomalous dimension \gamma of the quark mass operator. By using this potential we argue that chiral symmetry is restored for \gamma <1. A perturbative computation of \gamma then leads to an estimate of the critical value N_f^c for the transition.
