Title: Confinement in 4D Yang-Mills Theories from Non-Critical Type 0 String  Theory
Authors: Adi Armoni and Ehud Fuchs and Jacob Sonnenschein
Abstract: We study five dimensional non critical type 0 string theory and its correspondence to non supersymmetric Yang Mills theory in four dimensions. We solve the equations of motion of the low energy effective action and identify a class of solutions that translates into a confining behavior in the IR region of the dual gauge theories. In particular we identify a setup which is dual to pure SU(N) Yang-Mills theory. Possible flows of the solutions to the UV region are discussed. The validity of the solutions and potential sub-leading string corrections are also discussed.
