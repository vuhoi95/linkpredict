Title: Issues on Orientifolds: On the brane construction of gauge theories with  SO(2n) global symmetry
Authors: Amihay Hanany and Alberto Zaffaroni
Abstract: We discuss issues related to orientifolds and the brane realization for gauge theories with orthogonal and symplectic groups. We specifically discuss the case of theories with (hidden) global SO(2n) symmetry, from three to six dimensions. We analyze mirror symmetry for three dimensional N=4 gauge theories, Brane Box Models and six-dimensional gauge theories. We also discuss the issue of T-duality for D_n space-time singularities. Stuck D branes on ON^0 planes play an interesting role.
