Title: Direct Calculation of Breather S Matrices
Authors: Anastasia Doikou and Rafael I. Nepomechie
Abstract: We formulate a systematic Bethe-Ansatz approach for computing bound-state (``breather'') S matrices for integrable quantum spin chains. We use this approach to calculate the breather boundary S matrix for the open XXZ spin chain with diagonal boundary fields. We also compute the soliton boundary S matrix in the critical regime.
