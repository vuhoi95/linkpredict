Title: D=5 Simple Supergravity on AdS_2 \times S^3
Authors: Akira Fujii and Ryuji Kemmoku
Abstract: The Kaluza-Klein spectrum of D=5 simple supergravity compactified on S^3 is studied. A classical background solution which preserves maximal supersymmetry is fulfilled by the geometry of AdS_2\times S^3. The physical spectrum of the fluctuations is classified according to SU(1,1|2)\times SU(2) symmetry, which has a very similar structure to that in the case of compactification on AdS_3\times S^2.
