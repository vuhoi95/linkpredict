Title: Thermodynamic Partition Function of Matrix Superstrings
Authors: G. Grignani and G. W. Semenoff
Abstract: We show that, in the limit of zero string coupling, $g_s \to 0$, the thermodynamic partition function of matrix string theory is identical to that of the finite temperature, discrete light-cone quantised (DLCQ) type IIA superstring. We discuss how the superstring is recovered in the decompactified $R^+\to\infty$ limit.
