Authors: Jerome Gauntlett and Chris Koehl and David Mateos and Paul Townsend and Marija Zamaklar
Abstract: It is shown that the worldvolume field theory of a single D3-brane in a supergravity D3-brane background admits finite energy, and non-singular, abelian monopoles and dyons preserving 1/2 or 1/4 of the ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetry and saturating a Bogomol'nyi-type bound. The 1/4 supersymmetric solitons provide a worldvolume realisation of string-junction dyons. We also discuss the dual M-theory realisation of the 1/2 supersymmetric dyons as finite tension self-dual strings on the M5-brane, and of the 1/4 supersymmetric dyons as their intersections.
