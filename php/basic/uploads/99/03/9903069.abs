Title: New Gauge Invariant Formulation of the Chern-Simons Gauge Theory:  Classical and Quantal Analysis
Authors: Mu-In Park and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: Recently proposed new gauge invariant formulation of the Chern-Simons gauge theory is considered in detail. This formulation is consistent with the gauge fixed formulation. Furthermore it is found that the canonical (Noether) Poincar\'e generators are not gauge invariant even on the constraints surface and do not satisfy the Poincar\'e algebra contrast to usual case. It is the improved generators, constructed from the symmetric energy-momentum tensor, which are (manifestly) gauge invariant and obey the quantum as well as classical Poincar\'e algebra. The physical states are constructed and it is found in the Schr\"odinger picture that unusual gauge invariant longitudinal mode of the gauge field is crucial for constructing the physical wavefunctional which is genuine to (pure) Chern-Simons theory. In matching to the gauge fixed formulation, we consider three typical gauges, Coulomb, axial and Weyl gauges as explicit examples. Furthermore, recent several confusions about the effect of Dirac's dressing function and the gauge fixings are clarified. The analysis according to old gauge independent formulation a' la Dirac is summarized in an appendix.
