Title: Simple Spin Networks as Feynman Graphs
Authors: Laurent Freidel and Kirill Krasnov
Abstract: We show how spin networks can be described and evaluated as Feynman integrals over an internal space. This description can, in particular, be applied to the so-called simple SO(D) spin networks that are of importance for higher-dimensional generalizations of loop quantum gravity. As an illustration of the power of the new formalism, we use it to obtain the asymptotics of an amplitude for the D-simplex and show that its oscillatory part is given by the Regge action.
