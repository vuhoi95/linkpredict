Title: Conformal Approach to Particle Phenomenology
Authors: P. H. Frampton and C. Vafa
Abstract: We propose the existence of a non-supersymmetric conformal field theory softly broken at the TeV scale as a new mechanism for solving the hierarchy problem. We find the imposition of conformal invariance to be very restrictive with many predictive consequences, including severe restrictions on the field content, the number of families as well as on the structure of inter-family Yukawa couplings. A large class of potentially conformal non-supersymmetric theories are considered and some general predictions are made about the existence of a rich spectrum of color and weak multiplets in the TeV range.
