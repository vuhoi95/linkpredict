Title: High Temperature Resummation in the Linear $Î´$-Expansion
Authors: Marcus B. Pinto and Rudnei O. Ramos
Abstract: The optimized linear $\delta$-expansion is applied to the $\lambda \phi^4$ theory at high temperature. Using the imaginary time formalism the thermal mass is evaluated perturbatively up to order $\delta^2$. A variational procedure associated with the method generates nonperturbative results which are used to obtain the critical temperature for the phase transition. Our results are compared with the ones given by propagator dressing methods.
