Title: Zero modes of the Dirac operator in three dimensions
Authors: C. Adam and B. Muratori and C. Nash
Abstract: We investigate zero modes of the Dirac operator coupled to an Abelian gauge field in three dimensions. We find that the existence of a certain class of zero modes is related to a specific topological property precisely when the requirement of finite Chern--Simons action is imposed.
