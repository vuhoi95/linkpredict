Title: Comments on Topologically Massive Gravity with Propagating Torsion
Authors: J. L. Boldo and L. M. de Moraes and J. A. Helayel-Neto
Abstract: We study and discuss some of the consequences of the inclusion of torsion in 3D Einstein-Chern-Simons gravity. Torsion may trigger the excitation of non-physical modes in the spectrum. Higher-derivative terms are then added up and tree-level unitarity is contemplated.
