Title: Comments on CP, T and CPT Violation in Neutral Kaon Decays
Authors: John Ellis and N. E. Mavromatos
Abstract: We comment on CP, T and CPT violation in the light of interesting new data from the CPLEAR and KTeV Collaborations on neutral kaon decay asymmetries. Other recent data from the CPLEAR experiment, constraining possible violations of CPT and the $\Delta S = \Delta Q$ rule, exclude the possibility that the semileptonic-decay asymmetry $A_{T}$ measured by CPLEAR could be solely due to CPT violation, confirming that their data constitute direct evidence for T violation. The CP-violating asymmetry in $K_L \to e^-e^+\pi^-\pi^+$ recently measured by the KTeV Collaboration does not by itself provide direct evidence for T violation, but we use it to place new bounds on CPT violation.
