Title: The Wess-Zumino Model and the AdS_4/CFT_3 Correspondence
Authors: W. Mueck and K. S. Viswanathan
Abstract: We consider the non-interacting massive Wess-Zumino model in four-dimensional anti-de Sitter space and show that the conformal dimensions of the corresponding boundary fields satisfy the relations expected from superconformal invariance. In some cases the irregular mode must be used for one of the scalar fields.
