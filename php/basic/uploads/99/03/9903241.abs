Title: AdS Superalgebras with Brane Charges
Authors: S. Ferrara and M. Porrati
Abstract: We consider the inclusion of brane charges in AdS_5 superalgebras that contain the maximal central extension of the super-Poincar\'e algebra on the boundary of AdS_5. For theories with N supersymmetries on the boundary, the maximal extension is OSp(1/8N,R), which contains the group $Sp(8N,R)\supset U(2N,2N) \supset SU(2,2)\times U(N)$ as extension of the conformal group. An ``intermediate'' extension to U(2N,2N/1) is also discussed, as well as the inclusion of brane charges in AdS_7 and AdS_4 superalgebras. BPS conditions in the presence of brane charges are studied in some details.
