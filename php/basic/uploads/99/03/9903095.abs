Title: Qualitative Analysis of String Cosmologies
Authors: Andrew P. Billyard and Alan A. Coley and James E. Lidsey
Abstract: A qualitative analysis is presented for spatially flat, isotropic and homogeneous cosmologies derived from the string effective action when the combined effects of a dilaton, modulus, two-form potential and central charge deficit are included. The latter has significant effects on the qualitative dynamics. The analysis is also directly applicable to the anisotropic Bianchi type I cosmology.
