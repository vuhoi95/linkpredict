Title: Three-dimensional topological quantum field theory of Witten type
Authors: Malgorzata Bakalarska and Boguslaw Broda
Abstract: Description of two three-dimensional topological quantum field theories of Witten type as twisted supersymmetric theories is presented. Low-energy effective action and a corresponding topological invariant of three-dimensional manifolds are considered.
