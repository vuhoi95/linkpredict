Title: Effects of Kaluza-Klein Excitations on g_Î¼-2
Authors: Pran Nath and Masahiro Yamaguchi
Abstract: An analysis of the effects associated with the Kaluza-Klein excitations of the photon and of the W and Z bosons on g_{\mu}-2 for d number of extra dimensions with large radius compactifications is given. The Kaluza-Klein effects on g_{\mu}-2 are found to be very sensitive to the number of extra dimensions. For models where the quark-lepton generations live on the 4D wall, it is shown that when the constraints from the Kaluza-Klein corrections to the Fermi constant are included, the effects of the Kaluza-Klein excitations to g_{\mu}-2 become too small to be observable. A model which evades Kaluza-Klein corrections to the muon decay \mu\to e\bar\nu_e\nu_{\mu} without suppression of their effects on g_{\mu}-2 is discussed.
