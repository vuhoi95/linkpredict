Title: Vortex Solutions of Nonrelativistic Fermion and Scalar Field Theories  Coupled to Maxwell-Chern-Simons theories
Authors: Bom Soo Kim and Hyuk-jae Lee and Jae Hyung Yee
Abstract: We have constructed nonrelativistic fermion and scalar field theories coupled to a Maxwell-Chern-Simons gauge field which admit static multi-vortex solutions. This is achieved by introducing a magnetic coupling term in addition to the usual minimal coupling.
