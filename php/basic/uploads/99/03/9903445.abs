Title: Towards Phonon-Like Excitations of Instanton Liquid
Authors: S. V. Molodtsov and A. M. Snigirev and G. M. Zinovjev
Abstract: The phonon-like excitations of (anti)-instanton ($\bar II$) liquid due to adiabatic variations of vacuum wave functions are studied in this paper. The kinetic energy term is found and the proper effective Lagrangian for such excitations is evaluated. The properties of their spectrum, while corresponding masses are defined by $\Lambda_{QCD}$, are investigated.
