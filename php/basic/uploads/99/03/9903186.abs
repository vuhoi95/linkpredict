Title: Branes at Singularities in Type 0 String Theory
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha and Andreas Brandhuber and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We consider Type 0B D3-branes placed at conical singularities and analyze in detail the conifold singularity. We study the non supersymmetric gauge theories on their worldvolume and their conjectured dual gravity descriptions. In the ultraviolet the solutions exhibit a logarithmic running of the gauge coupling. In the infrared we find confining solutions and IR fixed points.
