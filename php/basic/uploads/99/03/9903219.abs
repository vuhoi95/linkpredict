Title: More Comments on String Theory on AdS_3
Authors: D. Kutasov and N. Seiberg
Abstract: We clarify a number of issues regarding the worldsheet and spacetime descriptions of string propagation on AdS_3. We construct the vertex operators of spacetime current algebra and spacetime (super) Virasoro generators in the full interacting SL(2) WZW theory and study their Ward identities. We also explain the relation between the analysis in this note and some recent work on this subject.
