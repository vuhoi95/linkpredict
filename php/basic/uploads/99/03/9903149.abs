Title: Towards a stringy extension of self-dual super Yang-Mills
Authors: Anton Galajinsky and Olaf Lechtenfeld
Abstract: Motivated by the search for a space-time supersymmetric extension of the N=2 string, we construct a particle model which, upon quantization, describes (abelian) self-dual super Yang-Mills in 2+2 dimensions. The local symmetries of the theory are shown to involve both world-line supersymmetry and kappa symmetry.
