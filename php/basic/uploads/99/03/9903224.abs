Abstract: It was recently pointed out that the fundamental Planck mass could be close to the TeV scale with the observed weakness of gravity at long distances being due the existence of new sub-millimeter spatial dimensions. In this picture the standard model fields are localized to a $(3+1)$-dimensional wall or ``3-brane''. We show that in such theories there exist attractive models of inflation that occur while the size of the new dimensions are still small. We show that it is easy to produce the required number of efoldings, and further that the density perturbations $\delta\rho/\rho$ as measured by COBE can be easily reproduced, both in overall magnitude and in their approximately scale-invariant spectrum. In the minimal approach, the inflaton field is just the moduli describing the size of the internal dimensions, the role of the inflationary potential being played by the stabilizing potential of the internal space. We show that under quite general conditions, the inflationary era is followed by an epoch of contraction of our world on the brane, while the internal dimensions slowly expand to their stabilization radius. We find a set of exact solutions which describe this behavior, generalizing the well-known Kasner solutions. During this phase, the production of bulk gravitons remains suppressed. The period of contraction is terminated by the blue-shifting of Hawking radiation left on our wall at the end of the inflationary de Sitter phase. The temperature to which this is reheated is consistent with the normalcy bounds. We give a precise definition of the radion moduli problem.
