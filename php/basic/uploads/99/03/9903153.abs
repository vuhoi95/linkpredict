Title: The String Tension in Two Dimensional Gauge Theories
Authors: A. Armoni and Y. Frishman and J. Sonnenschein
Abstract: We review and elaborate on properties of the string tension in two-dimensional gauge theories. The first model we consider is massive QED in the $m\ll e$ limit. We evaluate the leading string tension both in the fermionic and bosonized descriptions. We discuss the next to leading corrections in $m/e$. The next-to-leading terms in the long distance behavior of the quark-antiquark potential, are evaluated in a certain region of external versus dynamical charges. The finite temperature behavior is also determined. In $QCD_2$ we review the results for the string tension of quarks in cases with dynamical quarks in the fundamental, adjoint, symmetric and antisymmetric representations. The screening nature of $SYM_2$ is re-derived.
