Title: The infrared behaviour of the static potential in perturbative QCD
Authors: N. Brambilla and A. Pineda and J. Soto and A. Vairo
Abstract: The definition of the quark-antiquark static potential is given within an effective field theory framework. The leading infrared divergences of the static singlet potential in perturbation theory are explicitly calculated.
