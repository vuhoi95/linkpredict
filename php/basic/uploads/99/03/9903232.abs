Title: Remarks on Goldstone bosons and hard thermal loops
Authors: G. Alexanian and E. F. Moreno and V. P. Nair and R. Ray
Abstract: The hard thermal loop effective action for Goldstone bosons is deduced by symmetry arguments from the corresponding result for gauge bosons. Pseudoscalar mesons in Chromodynamics and magnons in an antiferromagnet are discussed as special cases, including the hard thermal loop contribution to their scattering.
