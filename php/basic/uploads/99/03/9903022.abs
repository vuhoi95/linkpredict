Title: Calorons on the lattice - a new perspective
Authors: M. Garcia Perez and A. Gonzalez-Arroyo and A. Montero and P. van Baal
Abstract: We discuss the manifestation of instanton and monopole solutions on a periodic lattice at finite temperature and their relation to the infinite volume analytic caloron solutions with asymptotic non-trivial Polyakov loops. As a tool we use improved cooling and twisted boundary conditions. Typically we find 2Q lumps for topological charge Q. These lumps are BPS monopoles.
