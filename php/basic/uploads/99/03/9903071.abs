Title: Gauss vs Coulomb and the Cosmological Mass-deficit Problem
Authors: Manoelito M. de Souza and Robson N. Silveira
Abstract: In a previous work General Relativity has been presented as a microscopic theory of finite and discrete point-like fields that we associate to a classical description of gravitons. The standard macroscopic continuous field is retrieved as an average-valued field through an integration over these gravitons. Here we discuss extreme alternative (the Gauss's and the Coulomb's) ways of obtaining and interpreting the averaged fields, how they depend on the kind of measurements involved, and how do they fit with the experimental data. The field measurements in the classical tests of general relativity correspond to the Coulomb's mode whereas the determination of the overall spacetime curvature in a cosmological scale is clearly a Gauss's mode. As a natural consequence there is no missing mass and, therefore, no such a need of dark mass as the value predicted by General Relativity, in the context of the Gauss's mode, agrees with the observed one.
