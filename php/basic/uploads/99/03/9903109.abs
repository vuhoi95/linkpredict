Title: On Asymptotic Freedom and Confinement from Type-IIB Supergravity
Authors: A. Kehagias and K. Sfetsos
Abstract: We present a new type-IIB supergravity vacuum that describes the strong coupling regime of a non-supersymmetric gauge theory. The latter has a running coupling such that the theory becomes asymptotically free in the ultraviolet. It also has a running theta angle due to a non-vanishing axion field in the supergravity solution. We also present a worm-hole solution, which has finite action per unit four-dimensional volume and two asymptotic regions, a flat space and an AdS^5\times S^5. The corresponding N=2 gauge theory, instead of being finite, has a running coupling. We compute the quark-antiquark potential in this case and find that it exhibits, under certain assumptions, an area-law behaviour for large separations.
