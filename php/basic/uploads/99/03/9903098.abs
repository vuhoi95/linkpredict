Abstract: Complete constraint analysis and choice of gauge conditions consistent with equations of motion is done for Abelian Chern Simons field interacting minimally with a complex scalar field. The Dirac-Schwinger consistency condition is satisfied by the reduced phase space Hamiltonian density with respect to the the Dirac bracket. It is shown that relativistic invariance under boosts can be obtained only if gauge conditions were chosen consistent with the equations of motion. Moreover all gauge invariant quantities are shown to be free of transformation anomaly.
