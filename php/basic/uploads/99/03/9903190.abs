Title: Spacetime and the Holographic Renormalization Group
Authors: Vijay Balasubramanian and Per Kraus
Abstract: Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space can be foliated by a family of nested surfaces homeomorphic to the boundary of the space. We propose a holographic correspondence between theories living on each surface in the foliation and quantum gravity in the enclosed volume. The flow of observables between our ``interior'' theories is described by a renormalization group equation. The dependence of these flows on the foliation of space encodes bulk geometry.
