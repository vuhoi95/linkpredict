Title: On Central Charges and Hamiltonians for 0-brane dynamics
Authors: R. D'Auria and S. Ferrara amd M. A. Lled√≥
Abstract: We consider general properties of central charges of zero branes and associated duality invariants, in view of their double role, on the bulk and on the world volume (quantum-mechanical) theory. A detailed study of the BPS condition for the mass spectrum arising from toroidal compactifications is given for 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 BPS states in any dimensions. As a byproduct, we retreive the U-duality invariant conditions on the charge (zero mode) spectrum and the orbit classification of BPS states preserving different fractions of supersymmetry. The BPS condition for 0-branes in theories with 16 supersymmetries in any dimension is also discussed.
