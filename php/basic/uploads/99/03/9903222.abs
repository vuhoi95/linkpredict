Title: On Modular Invariance and 3D Gravitational Instantons
Authors: T. Brotz and M. Ortiz and A. Ritz
Abstract: We study the modular transformation properties of Euclidean solutions of 3D gravity whose asymptotic geometry has the topology of a torus. These solutions represent saddle points of the grand canonical partition function with an important example being the BTZ black hole, and their properties under modular transformations are inherited from the boundary conformal field theory encoding the asymptotic dynamics. Within the Chern Simons formulation, classical solutions are characterised by specific holonomies describing the wrapping of the gauge field around cycles of the torus. We find that provided these holonomies transform in an appropriate manner, there exists an associated modular invariant grand canonical partition function and that the spectrum of saddle points naturally includes a thermal bath in $AdS_3$ as discussed by Maldacena and Strominger. Indeed, certain modular transformations can naturally be described within classical bulk dynamics as mapping between different foliations with a "time" coordinate along different cycles of the asymptotic torus.
