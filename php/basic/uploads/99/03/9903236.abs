Title: The Statistical Mechanics of the Self-Gravitating Gas: Equation of State  and Fractal Dimension
Authors: H. J. de Vega and N. S'anchez
Abstract: We provide a complete picture of the self-gravitating non-relativistic gas at thermal equilibrium using Monte Carlo simulations (MC), analytic mean field methods (MF) and low density expansions. The system is shown to possess an infinite volume limit, both in the canonical (CE) and in the microcanonical ensemble (MCE) when N, V \to \infty, keeping N/ V^{1/3} fixed. We {\bf compute} the equation of state (we do not assume it as is customary), the entropy, the free energy, the chemical potential, the specific heats, the compressibilities, the speed of sound and analyze their properties, signs and singularities. The MF equation of state obeys a {\bf first order} non-linear differential equation of Abel type. The MF gives an accurate picture in agreement with the MC simulations both in the CE and MCE. The inhomogeneous particle distribution in the ground state suggest a fractal distribution with Haussdorf dimension D with D slowly decreasing with increasing density, 1 \lesssim D < 3.
