Abstract: We derive the free Osp(8|4) singleton action by sending the M2brane to the Minkowski boundary of an AdS_4x{\cal M}_7 background. We do this by means of the solvable Lie algebra parametrization of the coset space. We also give some comments on singleton actions from membranes on AdS_4xG/H backgrounds.
