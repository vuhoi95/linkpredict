Title: A Comment on Nonsupersymmetric Fixed Points and Duality at large N
Authors: M. Berkooz and A. Kapustin
Abstract: We review some of the problems associated with deriving field theoretic results from nonsupersymmetric AdS, focusing on how to control the behavior of the field theory along the flat directions. We discuss an example in which the origin of the moduli space remains a stable vacuum at finite $N$, and argue that it corresponds to an interacting CFT in three dimensions. Associated to this fixed point is a statement of nonsupersymmetric duality. Because 1/N corrections may change the global picture of the RG flow, the statement of duality is much weaker than in the supersymmetric case.
