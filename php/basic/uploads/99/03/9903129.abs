Title: Stable Non-BPS Membranes on M(atrix) Orientifold
Authors: Nakwoo Kim and Soo-Jong Rey and Jung-Tay Yee
Abstract: Examples of stable, non-BPS M-theory membrane configuration are constructed via M(atrix) theory. The stable membranes are localized on O4 or O8 orientifolds, which projects Chan-Paton gauge bundle of M(atrix) zero-brane partons to USp-type. The examples are shown to be consistent with prediction based on K-theory analysis.
