Title: Toward a Field Theoretical Description of Topologically Linked Polymers
Authors: F. Ferrari and I. Lazzizzera
Abstract: In this work a field theoretical model is constructed to describe the statistical mechanics of an arbitrary number of topologically linked polymers in the context of the analytical approach of Edwards. As an application, the effects of the topological interactions are studied in the one loop approximation. A natural way to include in the treatment also more sophisticated link invariants than the Gauss linking number is outlined.
