Title: Infrared Behaviour of the Gauge Boson Propagator in a Confining Theory
Authors: M. N. Chernodub and M. I. Polikarpov and V. I. Zakharov
Abstract: We study the gauge boson propagator in the dual Abelian Higgs theory which confines electric charges. The confinement is due to dual Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen strings. We show that the infrared double pole 1/(p^2)^2 in the propagator is absent due to the confinement phenomenon. Instead, specific angular singularities signal the eventual set in of the confinement. These angular singularities are a manifestation of the confining strings.
