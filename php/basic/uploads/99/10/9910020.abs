Title: On signature transition in Robertson-Walker cosmologies
Authors: K. Ghafoori-Tabrizi and S. S. Gousheh and H. R. Sepangi
Abstract: We analyse a classical model of gravitation coupled to a self interacting scalar field. We show that, within the context of this model for Robertson-Walker cosmologies, there exist solutions in the spatially non-flat cases exhibiting transitions from a Euclidean to a Lorentzian spacetime. We then discuss the conditions under which these signature changing solutions to Einstein's field equations exist. In particular, we find that an upper bound for the cosmological constant exists and that close to the signature changing hypersurface, both the scale factor and the scalar field have to be constant. Moreover we find that the signature changing solutions do not exist when the scalar field is massless.
