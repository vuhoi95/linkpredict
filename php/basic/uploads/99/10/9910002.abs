Title: Connected Correlators in Random Geometries
Authors: J. Ambjorn and P. Bialas and J. Jurkiewicz
Abstract: We analyze correlation functions in a toy model of a random geometry interacting with matter. We show that in general the connected correlator will contain a long-range scaling part which is in some sense a remnant of the disconnected part. This result supports the previously conjectured general form of correlation functions. We discuss the interplay between matter and geometry and the role of the symmetry in the matter sector.
