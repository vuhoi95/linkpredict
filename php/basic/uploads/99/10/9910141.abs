Abstract: We suggest a closed form expression for the path integral of quantum transition amplitudes. We introduce a quantum action with renormalized parameters. We present numerical results for the $V \sim x^{4}$ potential. The renormalized action is relevant for quantum chaos and quantum instantons.
