Title: Renormalization of QCD Coupling Constant in Terms of Physical Quantities
Authors: G. Sh. Japaridze and K. Sh. Turashvili
Abstract: A renormalization scheme is suggested where QCD input parameters - quark mass and coupling constant - are expressed in terms of gauge invariant and infrared stable quantities. For the renormalization of coupling constant the quark anomalous electromagnetic moment is used; the latter is calculated in a two loop approximation. Examination of the renormalized S matrix indicated confinement phenomenon already in the framework of perturbation theory.
