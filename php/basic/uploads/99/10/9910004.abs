Title: Wilson Loops in Noncommutative Yang Mills
Authors: Nobuyuki Ishibashi and Satoshi Iso and Hikaru Kawai and Yoshihisa Kitazawa
Abstract: We study the correlation functions of the Wilson loops in noncommutative Yang-Mills theory based upon its equivalence to twisted reduced models. We point out that there is a crossover at the noncommutativity scale. At large momentum scale, the Wilson loops in noncommmutative Yang-Mills represent extended objects. They coincide with those in ordinary Yang-Mills theory in low energy limit. The correlation functions on D-branes in IIB matrix model exhibit the identical crossover behavior. It is observed to be consistent with the supergravity description with running string coupling. We also explain that the results of Seiberg and Witten can be simply understood in our formalism.
