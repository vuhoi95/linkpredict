Title: Spectral Zeta Functions for a Cylinder and a Circle
Authors: V. V. Nesterenko and I. G. Pirozhenko
Abstract: Spectral zeta functions $\zeta(s)$ for the massless scalar fields obeying the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on a surface of an infinite cylinder are constructed. These functions are defined explicitly in a finite domain of the complex plane s containing the closed interval of real axis $-1\le$ Re $s \le 0$. Proceeding from this the spectral zeta functions for the boundary conditions given on a circle (boundary value problem on a plane) are obtained without any additional calculations. The Casimir energy for the relevant field configurations is deduced.
