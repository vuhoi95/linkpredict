Title: Bi-Local Higgs-Like Fields Based on Non-Commutative Geometry
Authors: Shigefumi Naka and Shinji Abe and Eizou Umezawa and Tetsu Matsufuji
Abstract: The bi-local model of hadrons is studied from the viewpoint of non-commutative geometry formulated so that Higgs-like scalar fields play the role of a bridge, the bi-local fields, connecting different spacetime points. We show that the resultant action for Higgs-like scalar fields has a structure similar to that of the linear sigma model. According to this formalism, we can deduce the dual nature of meson fields as the Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated with chiral symmetry breaking and bound states of quarks.
