Title: Gauge Dependence in the AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: H. O. Girotti and Victor O. Rivelles
Abstract: We consider the AdS space formulation of the classical dynamics deriving from the Stueckelberg Lagrangian. The on-shell action is shown to be free of infrared singularities as the vector boson mass tends to zero. In this limit the model becomes Maxwell theory formulated in an arbitrary covariant gauge. Then we use the AdS/CFT correspondence to compute the two-point correlation functions on the boundary. It is shown that the gauge dependence concentrates on the contact terms.
