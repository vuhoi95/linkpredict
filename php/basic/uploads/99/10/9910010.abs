Title: Schlesinger transformations for elliptic isomonodromic deformations
Authors: D. Korotkin and N. Manojlovic and H. Samtleben
Abstract: Schlesinger transformations are discrete monodromy preserving symmetry transformations of the classical Schlesinger system. Generalizing well-known results from the Riemann sphere we construct these transformations for isomonodromic deformations on genus one Riemann surfaces. Their action on the system's tau-function is computed and we obtain an explicit expression for the ratio of the old and the transformed tau-function.
