Title: Dirac Relation and Renormalization Group Equations for Electric and  Magnetic Fine Structure Constants
Authors: L. V. Laperashvili and H. B. Nielsen
Abstract: The quantum field theory describing electric and magnetic charges and revealing a dual symmetry was developed in the Zwanziger formalism. The renormalization group (RG) equations for both fine structure constants - electric $\alpha$ and magnetic $\tilde \alpha$ - were obtained. It was shown that the Dirac relation is valid for the renormalized $\alpha $ and $\tilde \alpha$ at the arbitrary scale, but these RG equations can be considered perturbatively only in the small region: $0.25 \stackrel{<}{\sim} \alpha, \tilde \alpha \stackrel{<}{\sim} 1$ with $\tilde \alpha$ given by the Dirac relation: $\alpha {\tilde \alpha}$ = 1/4.
