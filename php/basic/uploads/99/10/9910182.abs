Title: BPS Structure of Argyres-Douglas Superconformal Theories
Authors: Alfred D. Shapere and Cumrun Vafa
Abstract: We study geometric engineering of Argyres-Douglas superconformal theories realized by type IIB strings propagating in singular Calabi-Yau threefolds. We use this construction to count the degeneracy of light BPS states under small perturbations away from the conformal point, by computing the degeneracy of D3-branes wrapped around supersymmetric 3-cycles in the Calabi-Yau. We find finitely many BPS states, the number of which depends on how this deformation is done, similarly to the degeneracy of kink solutions for the deformation of N=2 Landau-Ginzburg superconformal theories in two dimensions. Also, some aspects of worldsheet theories near general Calabi-Yau singularities are discussed.
