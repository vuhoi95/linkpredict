Title: Path integral quantization of the Poisson-Sigma model
Authors: Allen C. Hirshfeld and Thomas Schwarzweller
Abstract: We apply the antifield quantization method of Batalin and Vilkovisky to the calculation of the path integral for the Poisson-Sigma model in a general gauge. For a linear Poisson structure the model reduces to a nonabelian gauge theory, and we obtain the formula for the partition function of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory for closed two-dimensional manifolds.
