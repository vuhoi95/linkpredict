Title: Partially embedding of the quantum mechanical analog of the nonlinear  sigma model
Authors: R. Amorim and J. Barcelos-Neto and C. Wotzasek
Abstract: We consider the quantum mechanical analog of the nonlinear sigma model. There are difficulties to completely embed this theory by directly using the Batalin, Fradkin, Fradkina, and Tyutin (BFFT) formalism. We show in this paper how the BFFT method can be conveniently adapted in order to achieve a gauge theory that partially embeds the model.
