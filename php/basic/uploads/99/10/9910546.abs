Title: Three flavor neutrino oscillations in matter
Authors: Tommy Ohlsson and Hakan Snellman
Abstract: We derive analytic expressions for three flavor neutrino oscillations in the presence of matter in the plane wave approximation using the Cayley-Hamilton formalism. Especially, we calculate the time evolution operator in both flavor and mass bases. Furthermore, we find the transition probabilities, matter mass squared differences, and matter mixing angles all expressed in terms of the vacuum mass squared differences, the vacuum mixing angles, and the matter density. The conditions for resonance in the presence of matter are also studied in some examples.
