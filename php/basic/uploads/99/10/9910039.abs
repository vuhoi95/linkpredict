Title: Lattice QCD and chiral mesons
Authors: Sergio Caracciolo and Fabrizio Palumbo and Roberto Scimia
Abstract: The standard QCD action is improved by the addition of irrelevant operators built with chiral composites. An effective Lagrangian is derived in terms of auxiliary fields, which has the form of the phenomenological chiral Lagrangians. Our improved QCD action appears promising for numerical simulations as the pion physics is explicitely accounted for by the auxiliary fields.
