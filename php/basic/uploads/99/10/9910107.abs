Title: Stochastic field theory for a Dirac particle propagating in gauge field  disorder
Authors: T. Guhr and T. Wilke and H. A. Weidenmueller
Abstract: Recent theoretical and numerical developments show analogies between quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and disordered systems in condensed matter physics. We study the spectral fluctuations of a Dirac particle propagating in a finite four dimensional box in the presence of gauge fields. We construct a model which combines Efetov's approach to disordered systems with the principles of chiral symmetry and QCD. To this end, the gauge fields are replaced with a stochastic white noise potential, the gauge field disorder. Effective supersymmetric non-linear sigma-models are obtained. Spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry is found. We rigorously derive the equivalent of the Thouless energy in QCD. Connections to other low-energy effective theories, in particular the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model and chiral perturbation theory, are found.
