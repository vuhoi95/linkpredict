Title: Making the gravitational path integral more Lorentzian, or: Life beyond  Liouville gravity
Authors: R. Loll and J. Ambjorn and K. N. Anagnostopoulos
Abstract: In two space-time dimensions, there is a theory of Lorentzian quantum gravity which can be defined by a rigorous, non-perturbative path integral and is inequivalent to the well-known theory of (Euclidean) quantum Liouville gravity. It has a number of appealing features: i) its quantum geometry is non-fractal, ii) it remains consistent when coupled to matter, even beyond the c=1 barrier, iii) it is closer to canonical quantization approaches than previous path-integral formulations, and iv) its construction generalizes to higher dimensions.
