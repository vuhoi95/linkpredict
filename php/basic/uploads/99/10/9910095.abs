Title: An Exact Solution of BPS Domain Wall Junction
Authors: Hodaka Oda and Kenji Ito and Masashi Naganuma and Norisuke Sakai
Abstract: An exact solution of domain wall junction is obtained in a four-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric U(1) X U(1)' gauge theory with three pairs of chiral superfields which is motivated by the N=2 SU(2) gauge theory with one flavor perturbed by an adjoint scalar mass. The solution allows us to evaluate various quantities including a new central charge Y_k associated with the junction besides Z_k which appears already in domain walls. We find that the new central charge Y_k gives a negative contribution to the mass of the domain wall junction whereas the central charge Z_k gives a dominant positive contribution. One has to be cautious to identify the central charge Y_k alone as the mass of the junction.
