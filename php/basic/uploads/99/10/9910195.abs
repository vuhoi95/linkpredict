Title: Bottleneck Surfaces and Worldsheet Geometry of Higher-Curvature Quantum  Gravity
Authors: Richard J. Szabo and John F. Wheater
Abstract: We describe a simple lattice model of higher-curvature quantum gravity in two dimensions and study the phase structure of the theory as a function of the curvature coupling. It is shown that the ensemble of flat graphs is entropically unstable to the formation of baby universes. In these simplified models the growth in graphs exhibits a branched polymer behaviour in the phase directly before the flattening transition.
