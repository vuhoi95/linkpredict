Title: Decoherence via Dynamical Casimir Effect
Authors: Diego A. R. Dalvit and Paulo A. Maia Neto
Abstract: We derive a master equation for a mirror interacting with the vacuum field via radiation pressure. The dynamical Casimir effect leads to decoherence of a 'Schroedinger cat' state in a time scale that depends on the degree of 'macroscopicity' of the state components, and which may be much shorter than the relaxation time scale. Coherent states are selected by the interaction as pointer states.
