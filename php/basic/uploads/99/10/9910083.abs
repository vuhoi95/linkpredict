Title: Noncommutative Geometry and Anyonic Field Theory in the Magnetic Field
Authors: H. W. Lee and Y. S. Myung
Abstract: We consider an easy way to get the noncommutative spacetime in Minkowski space. This corresponds to introducing a magnetic field ${\rm\bf B} = B \hat {\rm\bf k}$ in the plane. We construct a green's function in coordinate space which includes a Moyal phase factor. The projection to the lowest Landau level(LLL) is necessary for a simple calculation. Using this green's function and a second quantized formalism, we study the thermodynamic property of the anyons on the noncommutative geometry. It turns out that the Moyal phase factors contribute to the thermodynamic potential $\Omega$ as opposed to the free-particle nature.
