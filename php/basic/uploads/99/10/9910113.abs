Title: Weyl anomaly from Weyl gravity
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: We calculate the conformal anomaly from 5d Weyl gravity (with broken conformal symmetry) which is conjectured to be supergravity dual to ${\cal N}=2$ superconformal field theory via AdS/CFT correspondence. Its comparison with ${\cal N}=2$ SCFT conformal anomaly (UV calculation) suggests that such duality may exist subject to presence of sub-leading 1/N corrections to cosmological and gravitational constants.
