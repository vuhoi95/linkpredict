Title: On the form of Lorentz-Stern-Gerlach force
Authors: Sameen Ahmed Khan and Modesto Pusterla
Abstract: In recent times there has been a renewed interest in the force experienced by a charged-particle with anomalous magnetic moment in the presence of external fields. In this paper we address the basic question of the force experienced by a spin-1/2 point-like charged-particle with magnetic and electric moments in the presence of space-and time-dependent external electromagnetic fields, when derived from the Dirac equation {\em via} the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation technique. It is interesting to note that the force thus derived differs from the ones obtained by various other prescriptions.
