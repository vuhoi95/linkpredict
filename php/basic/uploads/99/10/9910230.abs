Abstract: Recently, we demonstrated the existence of heterotic--string solutions in which the observable sector effective field theory just below the string scale reduces to that of the MSSM, with the standard observable gauge group being just SU(3)_C x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y and the SU(3)_C x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y-charged spectrum of the observable sector consisting solely of the MSSM spectrum. Associated with this model is a set of distinct flat directions of vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of non-Abelian singlet fields that all produce solely the MSSM spectrum. In this paper, we study the effective superpotential induced by these choices of flat directions. We investigate whether sufficient degrees of freedom exist in these singlet flat directions to satisfy various phenomenological constraints imposed by the observed Standard Model data. For each flat direction, the effective superpotential is given to sixth order. The variations in the singlet and hidden sector low energy spectrums are analyzed. We then determine the mass matrices (to all finite orders) for the three generations of MSSM quarks and leptons. Possible Higgs mu-terms are investigated. We conclude by considering generalizations of our flat directions involving VEVs of non-Abelian fields.
