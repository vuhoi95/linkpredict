Title: Product Integral Formalism and Non-Abelian Stokes Theorem
Authors: Robert L. Karp and Freydoon Mansouri and Jung S. Rno
Abstract: We make use of the properties of product integrals to obtain a surface product integral representation for the Wilson loop operator. The result can be interpreted as the non-abelian version of Stokes' theorem.
