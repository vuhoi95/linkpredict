Title: Brane Configuration from Monopole Solution in Non-Commutative Super  Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Koji Hashimoto and Hiroyuki Hata and Sanefumi Moriyama
Abstract: We study the structure of the monopole configuration in U(2) non-commutative super Yang-Mills theory. Our analysis consists of two steps: solving the BPS equation and then the eigenvalue equation in the non-commutative space. Calculation to the first non-trivial order in the non-commutativity parameter theta shows that the monopole exhibits a certain non-locality. This structure is precisely the one expected from the recent predictions by the brane-configuration technique.
