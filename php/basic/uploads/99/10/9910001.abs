Title: Dispersionless Fermionic KdV
Authors: J. Barcelos-Neto and Alin Constandache and Ashok Das
Abstract: We analyze the dispersionless limits of the Kupershmidt equation, the SUSY KdV-B equation and the SUSY KdV equation. We present the Lax description for each of these models and bring out various properties associated with them as well as discuss open questions that need to be addressed in connection with these models.
