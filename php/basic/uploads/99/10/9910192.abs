Title: Local Symmetries in the AdS_7/CFT_6 Correspondence
Authors: M. Nishimura and Y. Tanii
Abstract: It is shown that local symmetry transformations of the maximal AdS supergravity in seven-dimensional anti de Sitter space induce those of the N=(2,0) conformal supergravity on the six-dimensional boundary at infinity. Boundary values of the AdS supergravity fields form a supermultiplet of the conformal supergravity.
