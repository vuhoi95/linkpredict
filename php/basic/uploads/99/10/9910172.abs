Title: D-Branes and Bundles on Elliptic Fibrations
Authors: Duiliu-Emanuel Diaconescu and Christian Romelsberger
Abstract: We study the D-brane spectrum on a two-parameter Calabi-Yau model. The analysis is based on different tools in distinct regions of the moduli space: wrapped brane configurations on elliptic fibrations near the large radius limit, and SCFT boundary states at the Gepner point. We develop an explicit correspondence between these two classes of objects, suggesting that boundary states are natural quantum generalizations of bundles. We also find interesting D-brane dynamics in deep stringy regimes. The most striking example is, perhaps, that nonsupersymmetric D6-D0 and D4-D2 large radius configurations become stable BPS states at the Gepner point.
