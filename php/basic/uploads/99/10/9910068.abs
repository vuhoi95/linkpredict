Title: Laws Governing Isolated Horizons: Inclusion of Dilaton Couplings
Authors: Abhay Ashtekar and Alejandro Corichi
Abstract: Mechanics of non-rotating black holes was recently generalized by replacing the static event horizons used in standard treatments with `isolated horizons.' This framework is extended to incorporate dilaton couplings. Since there can be gravitational and matter radiation outside isolated horizons, now the fundamental parameters of the horizon, used in mechanics, must be defined using only the local structure of the horizon, without reference to infinity. This task is accomplished and the zeroth and first laws are established. To complement the previous work, the entire discussion is formulated tensorially, without any reference to spinors.
