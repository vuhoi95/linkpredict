Title: Stochastic Quantization of Bottomless Systems: Stationary quantities in  a diffusive process
Authors: Kazuya Yuasa and Hiromichi Nakazato
Abstract: By making use of the Langevin equation with a kernel, it was shown that the Feynman measure exp(-S) can be realized in a restricted sense in a diffusive stochastic process, which diverges and has no equilibrium, for bottomless systems. In this paper, the dependence on the initial conditions and the temporal behavior are analyzed for 0-dim bottomless systems. Furthermore, it is shown that it is possible to find stationary quantities.
