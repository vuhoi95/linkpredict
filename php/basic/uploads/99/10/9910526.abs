Title: Dual Quantum Electrodynamics: Dyon-Dyon and Charge-Monopole Scattering  in a High-Energy Approximation
Authors: Leonard Gamberg and Kimball A. Milton
Abstract: We develop the quantum field theory of electron-point magnetic monopole interactions and more generally, dyon-dyon interactions, based on the original string-dependent ``nonlocal'' action of Dirac and Schwinger. We demonstrate that a viable nonperturbative quantum field theoretic formulation can be constructed that results in a string {\em independent} cross section for monopole-electron and dyon-dyon scattering. Such calculations can be done only by using nonperturbative approximations such as the eikonal and not by some mutilation of lowest-order perturbation theory.
