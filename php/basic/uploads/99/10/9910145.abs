Title: Quantization of Superstrings in Ramond-Ramond Backgrounds
Authors: David Berenstein and Robert G. Leigh
Abstract: We present a perturbative study of Ramond-Ramond backgrounds in the NSR formalism. We show how to perform sigma-model computations and discuss in detail the structure of the BRST charge and picture-changing operators. Contact terms play a vital role in the analysis. We also give evidence for a two loop non-renormalization theorem for the background beta functions.
