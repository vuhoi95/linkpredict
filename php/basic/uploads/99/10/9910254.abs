Title: Morse potential energy spectra through the variational method and  supersymmetry
Authors: Elso Drigo Filho and Regina Maria Ricotta
Abstract: The Variational Method is applied within the context of Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics to provide information about the energy and eigenfunction of the lowest levels of a Hamiltonian. The approach is illustrated by the case of the Morse potential applied to several diatomic molecules and the results are compared with stablished results.
