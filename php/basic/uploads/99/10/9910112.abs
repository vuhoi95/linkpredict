Title: Classical Wakimoto Realizations of Chiral WZNW Bloch Waves
Authors: J. Balog and L. Feher and L. Palla
Abstract: It is well-known that the chiral WZNW Bloch waves satisfy a quadratic classical exchange algebra which implies the affine Kac-Moody algebra for the corresponding currents. We here obtain a direct derivation of the exchange algebra by inverting the symplectic form on the space of Bloch waves, and give a completely algorithmic construction of its generalized free field realizations that extend the classical Wakimoto realizations of the current algebra.
