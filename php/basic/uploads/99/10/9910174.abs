Title: Mirage Cosmology
Authors: A. Kehagias and E. Kiritsis
Abstract: A brane universe moving in a curved higher dimensional bulk space is considered. The motion induces a cosmological evolution on the universe brane that is indistiguishable from a similar one induced by matter density on the brane. The phenomenological implications of such an idea are discussed. Various mirage energy densities are found, corresponding to dilute matter driving the cosmological expansion, many having superluminal properties $|w|>1$ or violating the positive energy condition. It is shown that energy density due to the world-volume fields is nicely incorporated into the picture. It is also pointed out that the initial singularity problem is naturally resolved in this context.
