Title: Chiral Condensate in the Deconfined Phase of Quenched Gauge Theories
Authors: Robert G. Edwards and Urs M. Heller and Joe Kiskis and Rajamani Narayanan
Abstract: We compute the low lying spectrum of the overlap Dirac operator in the deconfined phase of finite-temperature quenched gauge theory. It suggests the existence of a chiral condensate which we confirm with a direct stochastic estimate. We show that the part of the spectrum responsible for the chiral condensate can be understood as arising from a dilute gas of instantons and anti-instantons.
