Title: Integrable Quantum Field Theories with Unstable Particles
Authors: J. Luis Miramontes and C. R. Fern√°ndez-Pousa
Abstract: A new family of S-matrix theories with resonance poles is constructed and conjectured to correspond to the Homogeneous sine-Gordon theories associated with simply laced compact Lie groups, where some of the resonance poles can be traced to the presence of unstable particles in the spectrum. These theories are unitary in the usual S S^\dagger =1 sense, they are not parity invariant, and they exhibit continuous coupling constants that determine both the mass spectrum of stable particles and the masses and the position of the resonance poles.
