Title: D-Walls and Junctions in Supersymmetric Gluodynamics in the Large N  Limit Suggest the Existence of Heavy Hadrons
Authors: G. Gabadadze and M. Shifman
Abstract: A number of arguments exists that the "minimal" BPS wall width in large N supersymmetric gluodynamics vanishes as 1/N. There is a certain tension between this assertion and the fact that the mesons coupled to the gluino condensate have masses which do not scale with N. To reconcile these facts we argue that there should exist additional soliton-like states with masses scaling as N. The BPS walls must be "made" predominantly of these heavy states which are coupled to the gluino condensate stronger than the conventional mesons. The tension of the BPS wall junction scales as N^2, which serves as an additional argument in favor of the 1/N scaling of the wall width. The heavy states can be thought of as solitons of the corresponding closed string theory. They are related to certain fivebranes in the M-theory construction. We study the issue of the wall width in toy models which capture some features of supersymmetric gluodynamics. We speculate that special hadrons with mass scaling as N should also exist in the large N limit of non-supersymmetric gluodynamics.
