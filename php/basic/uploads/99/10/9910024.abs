Title: The fate of Reissner-Nortstr√∂m black hole in the  Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs system
Authors: Takashi Tamaki and Kei-ichi Maeda
Abstract: We study about an evaporating process of black holes in SO(3) Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs system. We consider a massless scalar field which couple neither with the Yang-Mills field nor with the Higgs field surrounding the black hole. We discuss differences in evaporating rate between a monopole black hole and a Reissner-Nortstr\"{o}m (RN) black hole.
