Title: Non-chiral fusion rules, structure constants of D_m minimal models
Authors: A. Rida and T. Sami
Abstract: We present a technique to construct, for $D_{m}$ unitary minimal models, the non-chiral fusion rules which determines the operator content of the operator product algebra. Using these rules we solve the bootstrap equations and therefore determine the structure constants of these models. Through this approach we emphasize the role played by some discrete symmetries in the classification of minimal models.
