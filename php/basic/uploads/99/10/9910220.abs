Title: A New Superconformal Mechanics
Authors: E. Deotto and G. Furlan and E. Gozzi
Abstract: In this paper we propose a new supersymmetric extension of conformal mechanics. The Grassmannian variables that we introduce are the basis of the forms and of the vector-fields built over the symplectic space of the original system. Our supersymmetric Hamiltonian itself turns out to have a clear geometrical meaning being the Lie-derivative of the Hamiltonian flow of conformal mechanics. Using superfields we derive a constraint which gives the exact solution of the supersymmetric system in a way analogous to the constraint in configuration space which solved the original non-supersymmetric model. Besides the supersymmetric extension of the original Hamiltonian, we also provide the extension of the other conformal generators present in the original system. These extensions have also a supersymmetric character being the square of some Grassmannian charge. We build the whole superalgebra of these charges and analyze their closure. The representation of the even part of this superalgebra on the odd part turns out to be integer and not spinorial in character.
