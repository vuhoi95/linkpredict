Title: Cohomological analysis of gauged-fixed gauge theories
Authors: Glenn Barnich and Marc Henneaux and Tobias Hurth and Kostas Skenderis
Abstract: The relation between the gauge-invariant local BRST cohomology involving the antifields and the gauge-fixed BRST cohomology is clarified. It is shown in particular that the cocycle conditions become equivalent once it is imposed, on the gauge-fixed side, that the BRST cocycles should yield deformations that preserve the nilpotency of the (gauge-fixed) BRST differential. This shows that the restrictions imposed on local counterterms by the Quantum Noether condition in the Epstein--Glaser construction of gauge theories are equivalent to the restrictions imposed by BRST invariance on local counterterms in the standard Lagrangian approach.
