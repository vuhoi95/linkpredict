Title: Twisted Boundary Conditions and Matching to the Effective Four  Dimensional Theory
Authors: T. E. Clark and S. T. Love
Abstract: Nontrivial twisted boundary conditions associated with extra compact dimensions produce an ambiguity in the value of the four dimensional coupling constants of the renormalizable interactions of the twisted fields' zero modes. Resolving this indeterminancy would require a knowledge of the exact form of the higher dimensional action including the coefficients of higher dimensional operators. For the case of moderately sized extra dimensions, the uncertainty in the coupling constants can be of order one and may lead to modifications in the stability of the model.
