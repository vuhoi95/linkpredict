Title: SDLCQ: Supersymmetric Discrete Light Cone Quantization
Authors: O. Lunin and S. Pinsky
Abstract: In these lectures we discuss the application of discrete light cone quantization (DLCQ) to supersymmetric field theories. We will see that it is possible to formulate DLCQ so that supersymmetry is exactly preserved in the discrete approximation. We call this formulation of DLCQ, SDLCQ and it combines the power of DLCQ with all of the beauty of supersymmetry. In these lecture we will review the application of SDLCQ to several interesting supersymmetric theories. We will discuss two dimensional theories with (1,1), (2,2) and (8,8) supersymmetry, zero modes, vacuum degeneracy, massless states, mass gaps, theories in higher dimensions, and the Maldacena conjecture among other subjects.
