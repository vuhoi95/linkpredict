Title: Thermodynamics of Fateev's models in the Presence of External Fields
Authors: D. Controzzi and A. M. Tsvelik
Abstract: We study the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz equations for a one-parameter quantum field theory recently introduced by V.A.Fateev. The presence of chemical potentials produces a kink condensate that modifies the excitation spectrum. For some combinations of the chemical potentials an additional gapless mode appears. Various energy scales emerge in the problem. An effective field theory, describing the low energy excitations, is also introduced.
