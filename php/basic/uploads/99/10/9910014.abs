Title: Group Invariant Solutions without Transversality and the Principle of  Symmetric Criticality
Authors: I. Anderson and M. Fels and C. Torre
Abstract: We extend Lie's classical method for finding group invariant solutions to the case of non-transverse group actions. For this extension of Lie's method we identify a local obstruction to the principle of symmetric criticality. Two examples of non-transverse symmetry reductions for the potential form of Maxwell's equations are then examined.
