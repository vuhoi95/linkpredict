Title: Domain walls in supersymmetric QCD
Authors: B. de Carlos and J. M. Moreno
Abstract: We consider domain walls that appear in supersymmetric SU(N) with one massive flavour. In particular, for N > 3 we explicitly construct the elementary domain wall that interpolates between two contiguous vacua. We show that these solutions are BPS saturated for any value of the mass of the matter fields. We also comment on their large N limit and their relevance for supersymmetric gluodynamics.
