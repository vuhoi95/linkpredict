Title: On 1/N Corrections to the Entropy of Noncommutative Yang-Mills Theories
Authors: J. L. F. Barbon and E. Rabinovici
Abstract: We study thermodynamical aspects of string theory in the limit in which it corresponds to Noncommutative Yang-Mills. We confirm, using the AdS/CFT correspondence, that for general Dp branes the entropy in the planar approximation depends neither on the value of the background magnetic field B nor on its rank. We find 1/N corrections to the planar entropy in the WKB approximation. For all appropriate values of p these corrections are much softer than the corresponding corrections for the B=0 case, and vanish altogether in the high temperature limit.
