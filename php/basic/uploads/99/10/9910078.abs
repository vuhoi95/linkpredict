Title: The vortex oscillations in Abelian Higgs model
Authors: J. Karkowski and Z. Swierczynski
Abstract: The excitations of the vortex in Abelian Higgs model with small ratio of vector and Higgs particle masses are considered. Three main modes encountered in numerical computations are described in detail. They are also compared to analytic results obtained recently by Arodz and Hadasz.
