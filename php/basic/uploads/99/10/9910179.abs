Title: Area law corrections from state counting and supergravity
Authors: Gabriel Lopes Cardoso and Bernard de Wit and Thomas Mohaupt
Abstract: Modifications of the Bekenstein-Hawking area law for black holes are crucial in order to find agreement between the microscopic entropy based on state counting and the macroscopic entropy based on an effective field theory computation. We discuss this and related issues for the case of four-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric black holes. We also briefly comment on the state counting for N=4 and N=8 black holes.
