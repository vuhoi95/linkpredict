Title: Type II Branes from Brane-Antibrane in M-theory
Authors: Laurent Houart and Yolanda Lozano
Abstract: We discuss in a systematic way all the possible realisations of branes of M and type II theories as topological solitons of a brane-antibrane system. The classification of all the possibilities, consistent with the structure of the theory, is achieved by studying the Wess-Zumino terms in the worldvolume effective actions of the branes of M-theory and their reductions.
