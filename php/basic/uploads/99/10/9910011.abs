Title: Connes' trace formula and Dirac realization of Maxwell and Yang-Mills  action
Authors: P. M. Alberti and R. Matthes
Abstract: The paper covers known facts about the Dixmier trace (with some generalities about traces), the Wodzicki residue, and Connes' trace theorem, including two variants of proof of the latter. Action formulas are treated very sketchy, because they were considered in other lectures of the workshop.
