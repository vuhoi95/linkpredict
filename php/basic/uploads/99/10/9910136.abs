Title: Symmetry Realization, Poisson Kernel and the AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: Zhe Chang and Han-Ying Guo
Abstract: Two kinds of realizations of symmetry on classical domains or the Euclidean version of AdS space are used to study AdS/CFT correspondence. Mass of free particles is defined as an AdS group invariant, the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations for relativistic particles in the AdS space are set up as a mimic in the case of Minkowskian space. The bulk-boundary propagator on the AdS space is given by the Poisson kernel. Theorems on the Poisson kernel guarantee the existence and sole of the bulk-boundary propagator. The propagator is used to calculate correlators of the theories that live on the boundary of the AdS space and show conformal invariance, which is desired by the AdS/CFT correspondence.
