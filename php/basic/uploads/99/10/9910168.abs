Abstract: We discuss the possibility to construct an effective quantum field theory for an axial vector coupled to a Dirac spinor field. A massive axial vector describes antisymmetric torsion. The consistency conditions include unitarity and renormalizability in the low-energy region. The investigation of the Ward identities and the one- and two-loop divergences indicate serious problems arising in the theory. The final conclusion is that torsion may exist as a string excitation, but there are very severe restrictions for the existence of a propagating torsion field, subject to the quantization procedure, at low energies.
