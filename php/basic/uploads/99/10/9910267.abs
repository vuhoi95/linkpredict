Title: Diffeomorphisms and Holographic Anomalies
Authors: C. Imbimbo and A. Schwimmer and S. Theisen and S. Yankielowicz
Abstract: Using the relation between diffeomorphisms in the bulk and Weyl transformations on the boundary we study the Weyl transformation properties of the bulk metric on shell and of the boundary action. We obtain a universal formula for one of the classes of trace anomalies in any even dimension in terms of the parameters of the gravity action.
