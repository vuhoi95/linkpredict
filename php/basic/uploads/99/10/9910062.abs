Title: (m,n)-Strings In IIB Matrix Model
Authors: Shahrokh Parvizi and Amir H. Fatollahi
Abstract: By adding gauge fields to the D-string classical solution, which have non-zero contribution to commutators in continuum limit (extreme large $N$), we introduced $(m,n)$-strings in IIB matrix model. It is found that the size of matrices depends on the value of the electric field. The tension of these strings appears in $SL(2,Z)$ invariant form. The interaction for parallel and angled strings are found in agreement with the string theory for small electric fields.
