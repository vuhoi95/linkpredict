Title: Calogero-Moser Models V: Supersymmetry and Quantum Lax Pair
Authors: A. J. Bordner and N. S. Manton and R. Sasaki
Abstract: It is shown that the Calogero-Moser models based on all root systems of the finite reflection groups (both the crystallographic and non-crystallographic cases) with the rational (with/without a harmonic confining potential), trigonometric and hyperbolic potentials can be simply supersymmetrised in terms of superpotentials. There is a universal formula for the supersymmetric ground state wavefunction. Since the bosonic part of each supersymmetric model is the usual quantum Calogero-Moser model, this gives a universal formula for its ground state wavefunction and energy, which is determined purely algebraically. Quantum Lax pair operators and conserved quantities for all the above Calogero-Moser models are established.
