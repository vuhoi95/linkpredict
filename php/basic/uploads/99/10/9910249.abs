Title: Non-BPS Branes on a Calabi-Yau Threefold and Bose-Fermi Degeneracy
Authors: Mihail Mihailescu and Kyungho Oh and Radu Tatar
Abstract: We consider the spectrum of open strings for non-BPS D-brane configuration in type II string theory on a Calabi-Yau threefold. In general, there is no degeneracy between bosonic and fermionic states. However we find special values for the moduli space of Calabi-Yau threefolds there are non-BPS brane configurations which have an exact degeneracy between bosonic and fermionic states. For these values there is no force between pairs of non-BPS D-branes. This gives rise to a possibility of building diverse non-supersymmetric gauge field theories on the brane world-volume. We use the approach recently elaborated by Gaberdiel and Sen.
