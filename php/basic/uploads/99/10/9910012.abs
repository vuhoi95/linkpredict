Title: Form factors of the SU(2) invariant massive Thirring model with boundary  reflection
Authors: H. Furutsu and T. Kojima and Y. -H. Quano
Abstract: The SU(2) invariant massive Thirring model with a boundary is considered on the basis of the vertex operator approach. The bosonic formulae are presented for the vacuum vector and its dual in the presence of the boundary. The integral representations are also given for form factors of the present model.
