Title: Phase diagram of a 1 dimensional spin-orbital model
Authors: Chigak Itoi and Shaojin Qin and Ian Affleck
Abstract: We study a 1 dimensional spin-orbital model using both analytical and numerical methods. Renormalization group calculations are performed in the vicinity of a special integrable point in the phase diagram with SU(4) symmetry. These indicate the existence of a gapless phase in an extended region of the phase diagram, missed in previous studies. This phase is SU(4) invariant at low energies apart from the presence of different velocities for spin and orbital degrees of freedom. The phase transition into a gapped dimerized phase is in a generalized Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class. The phase diagram of this model is sketched using the density matrix renormalization group technique.
