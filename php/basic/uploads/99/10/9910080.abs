Title: Scalar QED $\hbar$-Corrections to the Coulomb Potential
Authors: J. A. Helayel-Neto and A. Penna-Firme and I. L. Shapiro
Abstract: The leading long-distance 1-loop quantum corrections to the Coulomb potential are derived for scalar QED and their gauge-independence is explicitly checked. The potential is obtained from the direct calculation of the 2-particle scattering amplitude, taking into account all relevant 1-loop diagrams. Our investigation should be regarded as a first step towards the same programme for effective Quantum Gravity. In particular, with our calculation in the framework of scalar QED, we are able to demonstrate the incompleteness of some previous studies concerning the Quantum Gravity counterpart.
