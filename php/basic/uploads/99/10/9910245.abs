Title: Connectedness Of The Boundary In The AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: Edward Witten and S. -T. Yau
Abstract: Let $M$ be a complete Einstein manifold of negative curvature, and assume that (as in the AdS/CFT correspondence) it has a Penrose compactification with a conformal boundary $N$ of positive scalar curvature. We show that under these conditions, $H_n(M;Z)=0$ and in particular $N$ must be connected. These results resolve some puzzles concerning the AdS/CFT correspondence.
