Title: Kaluza-Klein Excitations and Electroweak Symmetry Breaking
Authors: B. Grzadkowski and J. F. Gunion
Abstract: We explore the possibility that the Kaluza-Klein graviton states induce electroweak symmetry breaking. We also demonstrate that electroweak symmetry breaking could have a large impact on KK phenomenology.
