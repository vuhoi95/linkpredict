Title: The Weak-Coupling Limit of 3D Simplicial Quantum Gravity
Authors: P. Bialas and B. Petersson and G. Thorleifsson
Abstract: We investigate the weak-coupling limit, kappa going to infinity, of 3D simplicial gravity using Monte Carlo simulations and a Strong Coupling Expansion. With a suitable modification of the measure we observe a transition from a branched polymer to a crinkled phase. However, the intrinsic geometry of the latter appears similar to that of non-generic branched polymer, probable excluding the existence of a sensible continuum limit in this phase.
