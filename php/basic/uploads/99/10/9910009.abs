Title: Asymptotic freedom and Confinement imply spontaneously broken chiral  symmetry in Quantum Chromodynamics
Authors: R. Acharya and P. Narayana Swamy
Abstract: We utilize Coleman's theorem and show that quantum chromodynamics based on asymptotic freedom and confinement must have chiral symmetry realized as a spontaneously broken symmetry.
