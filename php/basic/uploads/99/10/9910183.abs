Title: Pair Correlation Function of Wilson Loops
Authors: S. Chaudhuri and Y. Chen and E. Novak
Abstract: We give a path integral prescription for the pair correlation function of Wilson loops lying in the worldvolume of Dbranes in the bosonic open and closed string theory. The results can be applied both in ordinary flat spacetime in the critical dimension d or in the presence of a generic background for the Liouville field. We compute the potential between heavy nonrelativistic sources in an abelian gauge theory in relative collinear motion with velocity v = tanh(u), probing length scales down to r_min^2 = 2 \pi \alpha' u. We predict a universal -(d-2)/r static interaction at short distances. We show that the velocity dependent corrections to the short distance potential in the bosonic string take the form of an infinite power series in the dimensionless variables z = r_min^2/r^2, uz/\pi, and u^2.
