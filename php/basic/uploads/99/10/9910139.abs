Title: Configuration spaces and Vassiliev classes in any dimension
Authors: Alberto S. Cattaneo and Paolo Cotta-Ramusino and Riccardo Longoni
Abstract: The real cohomology of the space of imbeddings of S^1 into R^n, n>3, is studied by using configuration space integrals. Nontrivial classes are explicitly constructed. As a by-product, we prove the nontriviality of certain cycles of imbeddings obtained by blowing up transversal double points in immersions. These cohomology classes generalize in a nontrivial way the Vassiliev knot invariants. Other nontrivial classes are constructed by considering the restriction of classes defined on the corresponding spaces of immersions.
