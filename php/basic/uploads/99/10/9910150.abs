Title: Extremal correlators in four-dimensional SCFT
Authors: B. Eden and P. S. Howe and C. Schubert and E. Sokatchev and P. C. West
Abstract: It is shown that certain extremal correlators in four-dimensional N=2 superconformal field theories (including N=4 super-Yang-Mills as a special case) have a free-field functional form. It is further argued that the coupling constant dependence receives no correction beyond the lowest order. These results hold for any finite value of N_c.
