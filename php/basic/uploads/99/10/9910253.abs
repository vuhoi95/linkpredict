Title: Solution of the quantum inverse problem
Authors: F. GÃ¶hmann and V. E. Korepin
Abstract: We derive a formula that expresses the local spin and field operators of fundamental graded models in terms of the elements of the monodromy matrix. This formula is a quantum analogue of the classical inverse scattering transform. It applies to fundamental spin chains, such as the XYZ chain, and to a number of important exactly solvable models of strongly correlated electrons, such as the supersymmetric t-J model or the the EKS model.
