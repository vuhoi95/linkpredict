Title: Exotic Gauge Theories from Tensor Calculus
Authors: Friedemann Brandt and Joan Simon and Ulrich Theis
Abstract: We construct non-standard interactions between exterior form gauge fields by gauging a particular global symmetry of the Einstein-Maxwell action for such fields. Furthermore we discuss generalizations of such interactions by adding couplings to gravitational Chern-Simons forms and to fields arising through dimensional reduction. The construction uses an appropriate tensor calculus.
