Title: Small Instantons and Weak Scale String Theory
Authors: Karim Benakli and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We consider heterotic string compactifications to four dimensions when instantons shrink to zero size. If the standard model gauge group originates from the new gauge symmetry associated with the small instantons singularity, then the weakly or strongly coupled heterotic string scales can be taken to be arbitrarily low. The SO(32) and E_8\times E_8 gauge groups can then be very weakly coupled even at the string scale and behave as non-abelian global symmetries. We comment on a possible role of small instantons in supersymmetry breaking.
