Title: Remark on the variational principle in the AdS/CFT correspondence for  the scalar field
Authors: Henrique Boschi-Filho and Nelson R. F. Braga
Abstract: We discuss how the variational principle can be used as a criterion for choosing, among scalar field actions implying the same equation of motion, the appropriate one for the AdS/CFT correspondence.
