Title: Single mass scale diagrams: construction of a basis for the  $Îµ$-expansion
Authors: J. Fleischer and M. Yu. Kalmykov
Abstract: Exploring the idea of Broadhurst on the ``sixth root of unity'' we present an ansatz for construction of a basis of transcendental numbers for the epsilon-expansion of single mass scale diagrams with two particle massive cut. As example, several new two- and three-loop master integrals are calculated.
