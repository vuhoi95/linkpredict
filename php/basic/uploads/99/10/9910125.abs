Title: New S-dualities in N=2 supersymmetric SU(2) x SU(2) gauge theory
Authors: Philip C. Argyres and Alex Buchel
Abstract: New S-dualities in a scale invariant N=2 gauge theory with SU(2) x SU(2) gauge group are derived from embeddings of the theory in two different larger asymptotically free theories. The true coupling space of the scale invariant theory is a 20-fold identification of the coupling space found in the M- and string-theory derivations of the low energy effective action, implying a larger S-duality group. Also, this coupling space is different from the naively expected direct product of two SL(2,Z) fundamental domains, as it contains a different topology of fixed points.
