Title: Quantum Field Theory of Topological Defects as Inhomogeneous Condensates
Authors: Massimo Blasone and Petr Jizba
Abstract: In the framework of the Closed-Time-Path formalism, we show how topological defects may arise in Quantum Field Theory as result of a localized (inhomogeneous) condensation of particles. We demonstrate our approach on two examples; kinks in the $2D \lambda \psi^{4}$ theory (both at zero and finite temperature) and vortices in the complex $4D \lambda \psi^{4} $ theory.
