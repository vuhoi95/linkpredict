Title: Gauging Yang-Mills Symmetries In 1+1-Dimensional Spacetime
Authors: Raja Q. Almukahhal and Tristan Hubsch
Abstract: We present a systematic and 'from the ground up' analysis of the 'minimal coupling' type of gauging of Yang-Mills symmetries in (2,2)-supersymmetric 1+1-dimensional spacetime. Unlike in the familiar 3+1-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric case, we find several distinct types of minimal coupling symmetry gauging, and so several distinct types of gauge (super)fields, some of which entirely novel. Also, we find that certain (quartoid) constrained superfields can couple to no gauge superfield at all, others (haploid ones) can couple only very selectively, while still others (non-minimal, i.e., linear ones) couple universally to all gauge superfields.
