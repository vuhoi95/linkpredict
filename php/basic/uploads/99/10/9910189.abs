Title: Generalized Invariants and Quantum Evolution of Open Fermionic System
Authors: S. P. Kim and A. E. Santana and F. C. Khanna
Abstract: Open systems acquire time-dependent coupling constants through interaction with an external field or environment. We generalize the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant theorem to open system of quantum fields after second quantization. The generalized invariants and thereby the quantum evolution are found explicitly for time-dependent quadratic fermionic systems. The pair production of fermions is computed and other physical implications are discussed.
