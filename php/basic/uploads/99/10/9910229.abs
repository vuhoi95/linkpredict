Title: On heavy states in supersymmetric gluodynamics at large N
Authors: A. Gorsky and K. Selivanov
Abstract: It is argued that there are states (quasiparticles) with masses ranging over the scales $\Lambda N_{c}^{1/3} \div \Lambda N_{c}$ in N=1 supersymmetric multicolor gluodynamics. These states exist in the form of quantum bubbles made out of the BPS domain walls. Analogous states are likely to exist in non-supersymmetric case as well.
