Title: A Simple Proof of the Non-Renormalization of the Chern-Simons Coupling
Authors: Makoto Sakamoto and Hiroyuki Yamashita
Abstract: We give a very simple proof that the renormalization of the Chern-Simons coupling in the Wilsonian effective action is exhausted at one-loop. Our proof can apply to arbitrary 2+1-dimensional abelian as well as nonabelian gauge theories without a bare Chern-Simons coupling, including any non-renormalizable interactions and non-minimal couplings. Our proof reveals that small (but not large) gauge invariance is enough to ensure the absence of higher order corrections.
