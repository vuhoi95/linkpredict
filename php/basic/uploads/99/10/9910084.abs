Title: Topological current of point defects and its bifurcation
Authors: Yishi Duan and Libin Fu and Hong Zhang
Abstract: From the topological properties of a three dimensional vector order parameter, the topological current of point defects is obtained. One shows that the charge of point defects is determined by Hopf indices and Brouwer degrees. The evolution of point defects is also studied. One concludes that there exist crucial cases of branch processes in the evolution of point defects when the Jacobian $D(\frac \phi x)=0$.
