Title: Vacuum effects in an asymptotically uniformly accelerated frame with a  constant magnetic field
Authors: Victor M. Villalba and Juan Mateu
Abstract: In the present article we solve the Dirac-Pauli and Klein Gordon equations in an asymptotically uniformly accelerated frame when a constant magnetic field is present. We compute, via the Bogoliubov coefficients, the density of scalar and spin 1/2 particles created. We discuss the role played by the magnetic field and the thermal character of the spectrum.
