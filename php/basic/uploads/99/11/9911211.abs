Title: Split dimensional regularization for the Coulomb gauge at two loops
Authors: G. Heinrich and G. Leibbrandt
Abstract: We evaluate the coefficients of the leading poles of the complete two-loop quark self-energy \Sigma(p) in the Coulomb gauge. Working in the framework of split dimensional regularization, with complex regulating parameters \sigma and n/2-\sigma for the energy and space components of the loop momentum, respectively, we find that split dimensional regularization leads to well-defined two-loop integrals, and that the overall coefficient of the leading pole term for \Sigma(p) is strictly local. Extensive tables showing the pole parts of one- and two-loop Coulomb integrals are given. We also comment on some general implications of split dimensional regularization, discussing in particular the limit \sigma \to 1/2 and the subleading terms in the epsilon-expansion of noncovariant integrals.
