Abstract: We have computed the contribution of zero modes to the value of the number of particles in the model of discrete (2+1)-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. It is shown for the first time that in the region of small values of the Chern-Simons coefficient k there exists a universal attraction between field configurations. For k=2 this phenomenon may be a dynamic origin of the semion pairing in high temperature superconducting state of planar systems.
