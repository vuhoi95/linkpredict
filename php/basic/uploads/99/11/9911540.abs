Title: GUTs and String-GUTs
Authors: Abdel PÃ©rez-Lorenzana and William A. Ponce
Abstract: We look for a connection between string theories and Grand Unified Theories (GUTs), with the aim to look for new insights in the existing four dimensional string-GUT problems. We argue that the construction of consistent string-GUT models could require the use of non canonical affine levels. We list the most common level values related to realistic GUTs.
