Title: The Finiteness Requirement for Six-Dimensional Euclidean Einstein  Gravity
Authors: G. W. Gibbons and S. Ichinose
Abstract: The finiteness requirement for Euclidean Einstein gravity is shown to be so stringent that only the flat metric is allowed. We examine counterterms in 4D and 6D Ricci-flat manifolds from general invariance arguments.
