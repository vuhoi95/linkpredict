Title: Noncommutative spacetime and the fractional quantum Hall effect
Authors: Y. S. Myung and H. W. Lee
Abstract: We propose the two formalisms for obtaining the noncommutative spacetime in a magnetic field. One is the first-order formalism and the other is the second-order formalism. Although the noncommutative spacetime is realized manifestly in the first-order formalism, the second-order formalism would be more useful for calculating the physical quantities in the noncommutative geometry than the first-order one. Several interesting points for string theory and fractional quantum Hall effect are discussed. In particular, we point out that the noncommutative geometry is closely related to the fractional quantum Hall effect(FQHE).
