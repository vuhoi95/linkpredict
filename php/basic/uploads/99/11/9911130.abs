Title: The partition function of a 3-dimensional topological scalar-vector  model
Authors: Boguslaw Broda and Malgorzata Bakalarska
Abstract: A study of the partition function of a 3-dimensional scalar-vector model formally related via duality to the Rozansky-Witten topological sigma-model is presented. The partition function is shown to consist of such topological quantities of a 3-dimensional manifold M like a lattice sum, the Reidemeister-Ray-Singer torsion and the Massey product.
