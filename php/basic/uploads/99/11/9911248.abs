Title: Casimir energy of a non-uniform string
Authors: L. Hadasz and G. Lambiase and V. V. Nesterenko
Abstract: The Casimir energy of a non-uniform string built up from two pieces with different speed of sound is calculated. A standard procedure of subtracting the energy of an infinite uniform string is applied, the subtraction being interpreted as the renormalization of the string tension. It is shown that in the case of a homogeneous string this method is completely equivalent to the zeta renormalization.
