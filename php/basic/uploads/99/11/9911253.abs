Title: Curved branes from string dualities
Authors: G. Papadopoulos and J. Russo and A. A. Tseytlin
Abstract: We describe a simple method for generating new string solutions for which the brane worldvolume is a curved space. As a starting point we use solutions with NS-NS charges combined with 2-d CFT's representing different parts of space-time. We illustrate our method with many examples, some of which are associated with conformally invariant sigma models. Using U-duality, we also obtain supergravity solutions with RR charges which can be interpreted as D-branes with non-trivial worldvolume geometry. In particular, we discuss the case of a D5-brane wrapped on AdS_3 x S^3, a solution interpolating between AdS_3 x S^3 x R^5 and AdS_3 x S^3 x S^3 x R, and a D3-brane wrapped over S^3 x R or AdS_2 x S^2. Another class of solutions we discuss involves NS5-branes intersecting over a 3-space and NS5-branes intersecting over a line. These solutions are similar to D7-brane or cosmic string backgrounds.
