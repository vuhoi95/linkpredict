Title: Theta-terms in nonlinear sigma-models
Authors: A. G. Abanov and P. B. Wiegmann
Abstract: We trace the origin of theta-terms in non-linear sigma-models as a nonperturbative anomaly of current algebras. The non-linear sigma-models emerge as a low energy limit of fermionic sigma-models. The latter describe Dirac fermions coupled to chiral bosonic fields. We discuss the geometric phases in three hierarchies of fermionic sigma-models in spacetime dimension (d+1) with chiral bosonic fields taking values on d-, d+1-, and d+2-dimensional spheres. The geometric phases in the first two hierarchies are theta-terms. We emphasize a relation between theta-terms and quantum numbers of solitons.
