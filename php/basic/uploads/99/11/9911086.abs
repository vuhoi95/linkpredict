Title: Qualitative Analysis of Isotropic Curvature String Cosmologies
Authors: Andrew P. Billyard and Alan A. Coley and James E. Lidsey
Abstract: A complete qualitative study of the dynamics of string cosmologies is presented for the class of isotopic curvature universes. These models are of Bianchi types I, V and IX and reduce to the general class of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universes in the limit of vanishing shear isotropy. A non-trivial two-form potential and cosmological constant terms are included in the system. In general, the two-form potential and spatial curvature terms are only dynamically important at intermediate stages of the evolution. In many of the models, the cosmological constant is important asymptotically and anisotropy becomes dynamically negligible. There also exist bouncing cosmologies.
