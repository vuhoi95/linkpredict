Title: On the Birth of a Closed Hyperbolic Universe
Authors: S. S. e Costa and H. V. Fagundes
Abstract: We clarify and develop the results of a previous paper on the birth of a closed universe of negative spatial curvature and multiply connected topology. In particular we discuss the initial instanton and the second topology change in more detail. This is followed by a short discussion of the results.
