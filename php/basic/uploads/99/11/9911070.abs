Title: Quasilocal energy for rotating charged black hole solutions in general  relativity and string theory
Authors: Sukanta Bose and Thant Zin Naing
Abstract: We explore the (non)-universality of Martinez's conjecture, originally proposed for Kerr black holes, within and beyond general relativity. The conjecture states that the Brown-York quasilocal energy at the outer horizon of such a black hole reduces to twice its irreducible mass, or equivalently, to \sqrt{A} /(2\sqrt{pi}), where `A' is its area. We first consider the charged Kerr black hole. For such a spacetime, we calculate the quasilocal energy within a two-surface of constant Boyer-Lindquist radius embedded in a constant stationary-time slice. Keeping with Martinez's conjecture, at the outer horizon this energy equals the irreducible mass. The energy is positive and monotonically decreases to the ADM mass as the boundary-surface radius diverges. Next we perform an analogous calculation for the quasilocal energy for the Kerr-Sen spacetime, which corresponds to four-dimensional rotating charged black hole solutions in heterotic string theory. The behavior of this energy as a function of the boundary-surface radius is similar to the charged Kerr case. However, we show that in this case it does not approach the expression conjectured by Martinez at the horizon.
