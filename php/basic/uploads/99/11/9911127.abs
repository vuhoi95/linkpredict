Title: A comment on the 4D antisymmetric tensor field model
Authors: J. Rant and M. Schweda and H. Zerrouki
Abstract: We show the existence of a renormalizable local supersymmetry for the gauge fixed action of the four dimensional antisymmetric tensor field model in a curved background quantized in a generalized axial gauge. By using the technique of the algebraic renormalization procedure, we prove the ultraviolet finiteness of the model to all orders of perturbation theory.
