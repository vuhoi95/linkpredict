Title: Quantum reflection of massless neutrinos from a torsion-induced  potential
Authors: M. Alimohammadi and A. shariati
Abstract: In the context of the Einstein-Cartan-Dirac model, where the torsion of the space-time couples to the axial currents of the fermions, we study the effects of this quantum-gravitational interaction on a massless neutrino beam crossing through a medium with high number density of fermions at rest. We calculate the reflection amplitude and show that a specific fraction of the incident neutrinos reflects from this potential if the polarization of the medium is different from zero. We also discuss the order of magnitude of the fermionic number density in which this phenomenon is observable, in other theoretical contexts, for example the strong-gravity regime and the effective field theory approach.
