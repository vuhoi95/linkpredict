Title: Branes, AdS gravitons and Virasoro symmetry
Authors: M. Banados and A. Chamblin and G. W. Gibbons
Abstract: We consider travelling waves propagating on the anti-de Sitter (AdS) background. It is pointed out that for any dimension d, this space of solutions has a Virasoro symmetry with a non-zero central charge. This result is a natural generalization to higher dimensions of the three-dimensional Brown-Henneaux symmetry.
