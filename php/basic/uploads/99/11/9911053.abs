Title: Hopf Map and Quantization on Sphere
Authors: H. Ikemori and S. Kitakado and H. Otsu and T. Sato
Abstract: Quantization of a system constrained to move on a sphere is considered by taking a square root of the ``on sphere condition''. We arrive at the fibre bundle structure of the Hopf map in the cases of $S^{2} $and $S^{4}$. This leads to more geometrical understanding of monopole and instanton gauge structures that emerge in the course of quantization.
