Title: Counterterms in type I Supergravities
Authors: David C. Dunbar and Bernard Julia and Domenico Seminara and Mario Trigiante
Abstract: We compute the one-loop divergences of D=10, N=1 supergravity and of its reduction to D=8. We study the tensor structure of the counterterms appearing in D=8 and D=10 and compare these to expressions previously found in the low energy expansion of string theory. The infinities have the primitive Yang-Mills tree amplitude as a common factor.
