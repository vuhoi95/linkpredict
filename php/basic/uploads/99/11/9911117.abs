Title: The cosmology with the Dp-brane gas
Authors: Chanyong Park and Sang-Jin Sin and Sunggeun Lee
Abstract: We study the effect of the Dp-brane gas in string cosmology. When one kind of Dp-brane gas dominates, we find that the cosmology is equivalent to that of the Brans-Dicke theory with the perfect fluid type matter. We obtain $\gamma$, the equation of state parameter, in terms of p and the space-time dimension.
