Title: Topology and phase transitions: a paradigmatic evidence
Authors: Roberto Franzosi and Marco Pettini and Lionel Spinelli
Abstract: We report upon the numerical computation of the Euler characteristic \chi (a topologic invariant) of the equipotential hypersurfaces \Sigma_v of the configuration space of the two-dimensional lattice $\phi^4$ model. The pattern \chi(\Sigma_v) vs. v (potential energy) reveals that a major topology change in the family {\Sigma_v}_{v\in R} is at the origin of the phase transition in the model considered. The direct evidence given here - of the relevance of topology for phase transitions - is obtained through a general method that can be applied to any other model.
