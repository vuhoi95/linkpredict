Title: Discrete Deformations in Type I Vacua
Authors: Carlo Angelantonj and Ralph Blumenhagen
Abstract: We study supersymmetric orientifolds where the world-sheet parity transformation is combined with a conjugation of some compact complex coordinates. We investigate their T-duality relation to standard orientifolds and discuss the origin of continuous and discrete moduli. In contrast to standard orientifolds, the antisymmetric tensor describes a continuous deformation, while the off-diagonal part of the metric is frozen to quantized values and is responsible for the rank reduction of the gauge group. We also give a geometrical interpretation of some recently constructed six-dimensional permutational orientifolds.
