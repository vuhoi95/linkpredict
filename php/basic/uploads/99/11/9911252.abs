Title: What does E_8 know about 11 dimensions ?
Authors: Ian I. Kogan and John F. Wheater
Abstract: We discuss some possible relationships in gauge theories, string theory and M theory in the light of some recent results obtained in gauge invariant supersymmetric quantum mechanics. In particular this reveals a new relationship between the gauge group E_8 and 11-dimensional space.
