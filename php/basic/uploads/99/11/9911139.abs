Title: Supersymmetric Nonlinear Sigma Models as Gauge Theories
Authors: Kiyoshi Higashijima and Muneto Nitta
Abstract: Supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models are obtained from linear sigma models by imposing supersymmetric constraints. If we introduce auxiliary chiral and vector superfields, these constraints can be expressed by D-terms and F-terms depending on the target manifolds. Auxiliary vector superfields appear as gauge fields without kinetic terms. If there are no D-term constraints, the target manifolds are always non-compact manifolds. When all the degrees of freedom in these non-compact directions are eliminated by gauge symmetries, the target manifold becomes compact. All supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models, whose target manifolds are the hermitian symmetric spaces, are successfully formulated as gauge theories.
