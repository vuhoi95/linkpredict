Title: Entropy for Asymptotically AdS_3 Black Holes
Authors: Makoto Natsuume and Takashi Okamura
Abstract: We propose that Strominger's method to derive the BTZ black hole entropy is in fact applicable to other asymptotically AdS_3 black holes and gives the correct functional form of entropies. We discuss various solutions in the Einstein-Maxwell theory, dilaton gravity, Einstein-scalar theories, and Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory. In some cases, solutions approach AdS_3 asymptotically, but their entropies do not have the form of Cardy's formula. However, it turns out that they are actually not "asymptotically $AdS_3$" solutions. On the other hand, for truly asymptotically AdS_3 solutions, their entropies have the form of Cardy's formula. In this sense, all known solutions are consistent with our proposal.
