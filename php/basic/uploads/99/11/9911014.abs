Title: Schrödinger quantum modes on the Taub-NUT background
Authors: Ion I. Cotăescu and Mihai Visinescu
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger equation is investigated in the Euclidean Taub-NUT geometry. The bound states are degenerate and an extra degeneracy is due to the conserved Runge-Lenz vector. The existence of the extra conserved quantities, quadratic in four-velocities implies the possibility of separating variables in two different coordinate systems. The eigenvalues and the eigenvectors are given in both cases in explicit, closed form.
