Title: Peeling and Multi-critical Matter Coupled to Quantum Gravity
Authors: Martin G. Harris and John F. Wheater
Abstract: We show how to determine the unknown functions arising when the peeling decomposition is applied to multi-critical matter coupled to two-dimensional quantum gravity and compute the loop-loop correlation functions. The results that $\eta=2+2/(2K-3)$ and $\nu=1-3/2K$ agree with the slicing decomposition, and satisfy Fisher scaling.
