Authors: M. Azreg-Ainou and G. Clement and C. P. Constantinidis and J. C. Fabris
Abstract: We investigate the family of electrostatic spherically symmetric solutions of the five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory. Both charged and neutral cases are considered. The analysis of the solutions, through their geometrical properties, reveals the existence of black holes, wormholes and naked singularities. A new class of regular solutions is identified. A monopole perturbation study of all these solutions is carried out, enabling us to prove analytically the stability of large classes of solutions. In particular, the black hole solutions are stable, while for the regular solutions the stability analysis leads to an eigenvalue problem.
