Title: On the geometry of non-trivially embedded branes
Authors: Ruben Minasian and Dimitrios Tsimpis
Abstract: We present a formal supersymmetric solution of type IIB supergravity generalizing previously known solutions corresponding to D3 branes to geometries without an orthogonal split between parallel and transverse directions. The metric is given implicitly as one with respect to which a certain connection is compatible. The case of the deformed conifold is discussed in detail.
