Title: O(d,d) invariance at two and three loops
Authors: I. Jack and S. Parsons
Abstract: We show that in a two-dimensional sigma-model whose fields only depend on one target space co-ordinate, the O(d,d) invariance of the conformal invariance conditions observed at one loop is preserved at two loops (in the general case with torsion) and at three loops (in the case without torsion).
