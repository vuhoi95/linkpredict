Title: On first order formulations of supergravities
Authors: B. Julia and S. Silva
Abstract: Supergravities are usually presented in a so-called 1.5 order formulation. Here we present a general scheme to derive pure 1^{st} order formulations of supergravities from the 1.5 order ones. The example of N_4=1 supergravity will be rederived and new results for N_4=2 and N_11=1 will be presented. It seems that beyond four dimensions the auxiliary fields introduced to obtain first order formulations of SUGRA theories do not admit supergeometrical transformation laws at least before a full superfield treatment. On the other hand first order formalisms simplify eventually symmetry analysis and the study of dimensional reductions.
