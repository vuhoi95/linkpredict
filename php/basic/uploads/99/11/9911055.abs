Title: Gravitational-Recoil Effects on Fermion Propagation in Space-Time Foam
Authors: J. Ellis and N. E. Mavromatos and D. V. Nanopoulos and G. Volkov
Abstract: Motivated by the possible experimental opportunities to test quantum gravity via its effects on high-energy neutrinos propagating through space-time foam, we discuss how to incorporate spin structures in our D-brane description of gravitational recoil effects in vacuo. We also point to an interesting analogous condensed-matter system. We use a suitable supersymmetrization of the Born-Infeld action for excited D-brane gravitational backgrounds to argue that energetic fermions may travel slower than the low-energy velocity of light: \delta c / c \sim -E/M. It has been suggested that Gamma-Ray Bursters may emit pulses of neutrinos at energies approaching 10^{19} eV: these would be observable only if M \gsim 10^{27} GeV.
