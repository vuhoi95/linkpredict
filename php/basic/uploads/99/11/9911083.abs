Title: BPS Domain Wall Junctions in Infinitely Large Extra Dimensions
Authors: Sean M. Carroll and Simeon Hellerman and Mark Trodden
Abstract: We consider models of scalar fields coupled to gravity which are higher-dimensional generalizations of four dimensional supergravity. We use these models to describe domain wall junctions in an anti-de Sitter background. We derive Bogomolnyi equations for the scalar fields from which the walls are constructed and for the metric. From these equations a BPS-like formula for the junction energy can be derived. We demonstrate that such junctions localize gravity in the presence of more than one uncompactified extra dimension.
