Title: A Note on "Irreducible" p-Form Gauge Theories with Stueckelberg Coupling
Authors: C. Bizdadea and S. O. Saliu
Abstract: p-form gauge theories with Stueckelberg coupling are quantized in an irreducible antifield-BRST way. As a consequence, neither the ghosts of ghosts nor their antifields appear. Some irreducible gauge conditions are inferred naturally within our formalism. In the end we briefly discuss the interacting case.
