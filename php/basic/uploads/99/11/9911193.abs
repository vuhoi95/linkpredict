Title: Greybody factor for D3-branes in B field
Authors: Y. S. Myung and Gungwon Kang and H. W. Lee
Abstract: We calculate the effect of noncommutative spacetime on the greybody factor on the supergravity side. For this purpose we introduce a system of D3-branes with a constant NS $B$-field along their world volume directions ($x_2, x_3$). Considering the propagation of minimally coupled scalar with non-zero momentum along($x_2, x_3$), we derive an exact form of the greybody factor in $B$ field. It turns out that $\sigma^{B\ne0}_l > \sigma^{B=0}_l$. This means that the presence of $B$-field (the noncommutativity) suppresses the potential barrier surrounding the black hole. As a result, it comes out the increase of greybody factor.
