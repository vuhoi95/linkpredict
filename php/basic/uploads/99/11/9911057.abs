Title: On the Hierarchy Between Non-Commutative and Ordinary Supersymmetric  Yang-Mills
Authors: Akikazu Hashimoto and N. Itzhaki
Abstract: Non-commutative supersymmetric Yang-Mills with rational Theta is dual to an ordinary supersymmetric Yang-Mills with a 't Hooft flux. It is believed that the simplest description is via the ordinary supersymmetric Yang-Mills. We claim, however, that the two descriptions form a hierarchy. The SYM description is the proper description in the ultra violet while the non-commutative description takes over in the infra red.
