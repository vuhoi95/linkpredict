Title: Fivebrane Gravitational Anomalies
Authors: Katrin Becker and Melanie Becker
Abstract: Freed, Harvey, Minasian and Moore have proposed a mechanism to cancel the gravitational anomaly of the M-theory fivebrane coming from diffeomorphisms acting on the normal bundle. This procedure is based on a modification of the conventional M-theory Chern-Simons term. We compactify this space-time interaction to the ten-dimensional type IIA theory. We then analyze the relation to the anomaly cancellation mechanism for the type IIA fivebrane proposed by Witten.
