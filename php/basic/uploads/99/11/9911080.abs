Title: Wormholes and Flux Tubes in the 7D Gravity on the Principal Bundle with  SU(2) Gauge Group as the Extra Dimensions
Authors: V. Dzhunushaliev and H. -J. Schmidt
Abstract: Vacuum solutions for multidimensional gravity on the principal bundle with the SU(2) structural group as the extra dimensions are found and discussed. This generalizes the results of Ref. \cite{vds3} from U(1) to the SU(2) gauge group. The spherically symmetric solution with the off-diagonal components of the multidimensional metric is obtained. It is shown that two types of solutions exist: the first has a wormhole-like 4D base, the second is a gravitational flux tube with two color and electric charges. The solution depends only on two parameters: the values of the electric and magnetic fields at the origin. In the plane of these parameters there exists a curve separating the regions with different types of solutions. An analogy with the 5D solutions is discussed.
