Title: On the Casimir Elements of q-Algebras U'_q(so_n) and Their Eigenvalues  in Representations
Authors: A. M. Gavrilik and N. Z. Iorgov
Abstract: The nonstandard q-deformed algebras U'_q(so_n) are known to possess q-analogues of Gel'fand-Tsetlin type representations. For these q-algebras, all the Casimir elements (corresponding to basis set of Casimir elements of so(n)) are found, and their eigenvalues within irreducible representations are given explicitly.
