Title: Regular Black Hole in General Relativity Coupled to Nonlinear  Electrodynamics
Authors: Eloy Ayón-Beato and Alberto García
Abstract: The first regular exact black hole solution in General Relativity is presented. The source is a nonlinear electrodynamic field satisfying the weak energy condition, which in the limit of weak field becomes the Maxwell field. The solution corresponds to a charged black hole with |q| \leq 2 s_c m \approx 0.6 m, having the metric, the curvature invariants, and the electric field regular everywhere.
