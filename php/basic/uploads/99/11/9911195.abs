Title: Magnetic Strings In Five Dimensional Gauged Supergravity Theories
Authors: A. H. Chamseddine and W. A. Sabra
Abstract: Magnetic BPS string solutions preserving quarter of supersymmetry are obtained for all abelian gauged d=5 N=2 supergravity theories coupled to vector supermultiplets. Due to a ``generalised Dirac quantization'' condition satisfied by the minimized magnetic central charge, the string metric takes a universal form for all five dimensional gauged theories.
