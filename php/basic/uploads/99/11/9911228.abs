Title: 4-dimensional BF Gravity on the Lattice
Authors: Noboru Kawamoto and Noriaki Sato and Yukiya Uchida
Abstract: We propose the lattice version of $BF$ gravity action whose partition function leads to the product of a particular form of 15-$j$ symbol which corresponds to a 4-simplex. The action is explicitly constructed by lattice $B$ field defined on triangles and link variables defined on dual links and is shown to be invariant under lattice local Lorentz transformation and Kalb-Ramond gauge transformation. We explicitly show that the partition function is Pachner move invariant and thus topological. The action includes the vanishing holonomy constraint which can be interpreted as a gauge fixing condition. This formulation of lattice $BF$ theory can be generalized into arbitrary dimensions.
