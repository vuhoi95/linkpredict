Title: Spontaneous Time Asymmetry due to Horizon
Authors: Ramesh Anishetty and R. Parthasarathy
Abstract: We show that quantized matter fields in the presence of background metrics with Horizon exhibit spontaneous time asymmetry. All quantized matter fields have to vanish at the horizon. Some phenemenological applications of this in the context of black holes and early universe are considered.
