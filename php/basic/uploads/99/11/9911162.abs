Title: Grand unification using a generalized Yang-Mills theory
Authors: M. Chaves and H. Morales
Abstract: Generalized Yang-Mills theories have a covariant derivative that employs both scalar and vector bosons. Here we show how grand unified theories of the electroweak and strong interactions can be constructed with them. In particular the SU(5) GUT can be obtained from SU(6) with SU(5)xU(1) as a maximal subgroup. The choice of maximal subgroup also determines the chiral structure of the theory. The resulting Lagrangian has only two terms, and only two irreducible representations are needed, one for fermions and another for bosons.
