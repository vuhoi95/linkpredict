Title: Two-dimensional QCD and instanton contribution
Authors: A. Bassetto and L. Griguolo and F. Vian
Abstract: In these notes Yang-Mills theories in 1+1 dimensions are reviewed. Instantons on a sphere prove to be -in the decompactification limit- the key issue to clarify an old controversy between equal-time and light-front quantization.
