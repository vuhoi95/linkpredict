Title: On Wigner's clock and the detectability of spacetime foam with  gravitational-wave interferometers
Authors: Y. J. Ng and H. van Dam
Abstract: A recent paper (gr-qc/9909017) criticizes our work on the structure of spacetime foam. Its authors argue that the quantum uncertainty limit for the position of the quantum clock in a gedanken timing experiment, obtained by Wigner and used by us, is based on unrealistic assumptions. Here we point out some flaws in their argument. We also discuss their other comments and some other issues related to our work, including a simple connection to the holographic principle. We see no reason to change our cautious optimism on the detectability of spacetime foam with future refinements of modern gravitational-wave interferometers like LIGO/VIRGO and LISA.
