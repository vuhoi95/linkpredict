Title: Mirror Symmetry and Toric Geometry in Three-Dimensional Gauge Theories
Authors: Nick Dorey and David Tong
Abstract: We study three dimensional gauge theories with N=2 supersymmetry. We show that the Coulomb branches of such theories may be rendered compact by the dynamical generation of Chern-Simons terms and present a new class of mirror symmetric theories in which both Coulomb and Higgs branches have a natural description in terms of toric geometry.
