Title: The Master Gauge String
Authors: Enrique Alvarez and César Gómez
Abstract: A string background, which is in some precise sense {\em universal} (i.e., incorporating all orders in the Feynman diagram expansion), is proposed to represent pure gauge theories. S-duality at the level of the string metric is considered as well as the vacuum expectation values of 't Hooft and Wilson loops in semiclassical approximation.
