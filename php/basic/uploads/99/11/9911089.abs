Title: Duality of massive gauge invariant theories in arbitrary space-time  dimension
Authors: A. Smailagic and E. Spallucci
Abstract: We show that dualization of Stueckelberg-like massive gauge theories and $B\wedge F$ models, follows form a general p-dualization of interacting theories in d spacetime dimensions. This is achieved by a particular choice of the external current.
