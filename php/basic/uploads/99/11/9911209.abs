Title: Monopole Solutions in AdS Space
Authors: A. R. Lugo and E. F. Moreno and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We find monopole solutions for a spontaneously broken SU(2)-Higgs system coupled to gravity in asymptotically anti-de Sitter space. We present new analytic and numerical results discussing,in particular, how the gravitational instability of self-gravitating monopoles depends on the value of the cosmological constant.
