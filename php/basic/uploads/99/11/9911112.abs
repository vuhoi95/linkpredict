Title: Combinatorics of q-characters of finite-dimensional representations of  quantum affine algebras
Authors: Edward Frenkel and Evgeny Mukhin
Abstract: We study finite-dimensional representations of quantum affine algebras using q-characters. We prove the conjectures from math.QA/9810055 and derive some of their corollaries. In particular, we prove that the tensor product of fundamental representations is reducible if and only if at least one of the corresponding normalized R-matrices has a pole.
