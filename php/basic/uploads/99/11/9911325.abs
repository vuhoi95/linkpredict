Title: Covariant Perturbation Theory of Non-Abelian Kinetic Theory
Authors: Xiaoping Zheng and Jiarong Li
Abstract: A double perturbation idea is presented in framework of the quark-gluon plasma kinetic theory. A solvable set of equations from the 'double perturbation' is derived and the equations are showed to be gauge-independent. The formalism of Landau damping rate for the plasmon at zero momentum is given and discussed.
