Title: Open Descendants of Non-Diagonal Invariants
Authors: L. R. Huiszoon and A. N. Schellekens and N. Sousa
Abstract: The open descendants of simple current automorphism invariants are constructed. We consider the case where the order of the current is two or odd. We prove that our solutions satisfy the completeness conditions, positivity and integrality of the open and closed sectors and the Klein bottle constraint (apart from an interesting exception). In order to do this, we derive some new relations between the tensor Y and the fixed point conformal field theory. Some non-standard Klein bottle projections are considered as well.
