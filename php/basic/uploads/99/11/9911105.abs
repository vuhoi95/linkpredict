Title: The Exact S-Matrix for an osp(2|2) Disordered System
Authors: Z. S. Bassi and A. LeClair
Abstract: We study a two-dimensional disordered system consisting of Dirac fermions coupled to a scalar potential. This model is closely related to a more general disordered system that has been introduced in conjunction with the integer quantum Hall transition. After disorder averaging, the interaction can be written as a marginal osp(2|2) current-current perturbation. The osp(2|2) current-current model in turn can be viewed as the fully renormalized version of an osp(2|2)^(1) Toda-type system (at the marginal point). We build non-local charges for the Toda system satisfying the U_q[osp(2|2)^(1)] quantum superalgebra. The corresponding quantum group symmetry is used to construct a Toda S-matrix for the vector representation. We argue that in the marginal (or rational) limit, this S-matrix gives the exact (Yangian symmetric) physical S-matrix for the fundamental "solitons" of the osp(2|2) current-current model.
