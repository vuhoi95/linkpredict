Title: Superconformal Multi-Black Hole Moduli Spaces in Four Dimensions
Authors: Alexander Maloney and Marcus Spradlin and Andrew Strominger
Abstract: Quantum mechanics on the moduli space of N supersymmetric Reissner-Nordstrom black holes is shown to admit 4 supersymmetries using an unconventional supermultiplet which contains 3N bosons and 4N fermions. A near-horizon limit is found in which the quantum mechanics of widely separated black holes decouples from that of strongly-interacting, near-coincident black holes. This near-horizon theory is shown to have an enhanced D(2,1;0) superconformal symmetry. The bosonic symmetries are SL(2,R) conformal symmetry and SU(2)xSU(2) R-symmetry arising from spatial rotations and the R-symmetry of N=2 supergravity.
