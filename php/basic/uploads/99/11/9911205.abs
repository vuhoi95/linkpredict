Title: Mass scales, supersymmetry breaking and open strings
Authors: I. Antoniadis and A. Sagnotti
Abstract: We review physical motivations and possible realizations of string vacua with large internal volume and/or low string scale and discuss the issue of supersymmetry breaking. In particular, we describe the key features of Scherk-Schwarz deformations in type I models and conclude by reviewing the phenomenon of ``brane supersymmetry breaking'': the tadpole conditions of some type-I models require that supersymmetry be {\it broken at the string scale} on a collection of branes, while being exact, to lowest order, in the bulk and on other branes.
