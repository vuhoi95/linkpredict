Title: Reaction-rate formula in out of equilibrium quantum field theory
Authors: A. Niegawa and K. Okano and H. Ozaki
Abstract: A complete derivation, from first principles, of the reaction-rate formula for a generic reaction taking place in an out of equilibrium quantum-field system is given. It is shown that the formula involves no finite-volume correction. Each term of the reaction-rate formula represents a set of physical processes that contribute to the reaction under consideration.
