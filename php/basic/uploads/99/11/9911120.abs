Title: Experimental test for 5th dimension in Kaluza-Klein gravity
Authors: V. Dzhunushaliev and D. Singleton
Abstract: Several electric/magnetic charged solutions (dyons) to 5D Kaluza-Klein gravity on the principal bundle are reviewed. Here we examine the possibility that these solutions can act as quantum virtual wormholes in spacetime foam models. By applying a sufficently large, external electric and/or magnetic field it may be possible to ``inflate'' these solutions from a quantum to a classical state. This effect could lead to a possible experimental signal for higher dimensions in multidimensional gravity.
