Title: Super-p-brane actions from interpolating dualisations
Authors: Anders Westerberg and Niclas Wyllard
Abstract: We review a recently proposed method for constructing super-p-brane world-volume actions. In this approach, starting from a democratic choice of world-volume gauge-fields guided by p-brane intersection rules, the requirements of kappa-symmetry and gauge invariance can be used to determine the corresponding action. We discuss the application of the method to some cases of interest, notably the (p,q)-5-branes of type-IIB string theory in a manifestly S-duality covariant formulation.
