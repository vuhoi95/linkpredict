Title: Gravitating monopole and black holes at intermediate Higgs masses
Authors: Y. Brihaye and B. Hartmann and J. Kunz
Abstract: Self-gravitating SU(2) Higgs magnetic monopoles exist up to a critical value of the ratio of the vector meson mass to the Planck mass, which depends on the Higgs boson mass. At the critical value a critical solution with a degenerate horizon is reached. As pointed out by Lue and Weinberg, there are two types of critical solutions, with a transition at an intermediate Higgs boson mass. Here we investigate this transition for black holes, and reconsider it for the case of gravitating monopoles.
