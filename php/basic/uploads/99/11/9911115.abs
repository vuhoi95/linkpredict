Authors: Jose D. Edelstein and Marta Gomez-Reino and Marcos Marino and Javier Mas
Abstract: We embed the Seiberg-Witten solution for the low energy dynamics of N=2 super Yang-Mills theory with an even number of massive hypermultiplets into the Whitham hierarchy. Expressions for the first and second derivatives of the prepotential in terms of the Riemann theta function are provided which extend previous results obtained by Gorsky, Marshakov, Mironov and Morozov. Checks in favour of the new equations involve both their behaviour under duality transformations and the consistency of their semiclassical expansions.
