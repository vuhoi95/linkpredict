Title: Thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equation for osp(1|2) integrable spin chain
Authors: Kazumitsu Sakai and Zengo Tsuboi
Abstract: The thermodynamic Bethe ansatz is applied to a quantum integrable spin chain associated with the Lie superalgebra osp(1|2). Using the string hypothesis, we derive a set of infinite number of non-linear integral equations (thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equation), which characterize the free energy. The low temperature limit of the free energy is also discussed.
