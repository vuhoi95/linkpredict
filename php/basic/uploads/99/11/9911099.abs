Title: Freckled Instantons in Two and Four Dimensions
Authors: A. Losev and N. Nekrasov and S. Shatashvili
Abstract: Field theory with instantons can be partially regularized by adding degrees of freedom at some scale. These extra degrees of freedom lead to the appearence of the new topological defects. These defects which we call freckles have some characteristic size depending on the scale at which the extra degrees of freedom revive. The examples of two dimensional sigma model, four dimensional gauge theory are studied. The compactification of the four dimensional supersymmetric gauge theory down to two dimensions is also considered and the new phenomena are found.
