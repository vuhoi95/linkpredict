Title: Exact Description of Black Holes on Branes
Authors: Roberto Emparan and Gary T. Horowitz and Robert C. Myers
Abstract: To test recent ideas about lower dimensional gravity bound to a brane, we construct exact solutions describing black holes on two-branes in four dimensions. We find that 2+1 gravity is indeed recovered at large distances along the brane, although there are significant deviations at smaller scales. Large black holes appear as flattened "pancakes", with a relatively small extent off the brane. Black hole thermodynamics is discussed from both the standpoint of the brane and the bulk. We comment on the analogous black holes bound to higher dimensional branes.
