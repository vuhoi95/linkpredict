Title: Non-BPS Dyons and Branes in the Dirac-Born-Infeld Theory
Authors: H. R. Christiansen and N. Grandi and F. A. Schaposnik and G. Silva
Abstract: Non-BPS dyon solutions to D3-brane actions are constructed when one or more scalar fields describing transverse fluctuations of the brane, are considered. The picture emerging from such non-BPS configurations is analysed, in particular the response of the D-brane-string system to small perturbations.
