Title: On the Supergravity Evaluation of Wilson Loop Correlators in Confining  Theories
Authors: J. Sonnenschein and A. Loewy
Abstract: We explicitly show the area law behavior of a circular Wilson loop in confining theories from supergravity. We calculate the correlator of two Wilson loops from supergravity in confining backgrounds. We find that it is dominated by an exchange of a ``scalarball'' that is lighter than the glueballs. We interpret these results in terms of the meson-meson potential in such theories.
