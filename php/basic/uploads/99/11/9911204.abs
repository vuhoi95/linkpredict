Title: On Infinite Quon Statistics and "Ambiguous" Statistics
Authors: S. Meljanac and M. Milekovic and R. Ristic
Abstract: We critically examine a recent suggestion that "ambiguous" statistics is equivalent to infinite quon statistics and that it describes a dilute, nonrelativistics ideal gas of extremal black holes. We show that these two types of statistics are different and that the description of extremal black holes in terms of "ambiguous" statistics cannot be applied.
