Title: Decomposition of SU(N) connection and Effective Theory of SU(N) QCD
Authors: Sheng Li and Yong Zhang and Zhongyuan Zhu
Abstract: We give a general decomposition of SU(N) connection and derive a generalized Skyrme-Faddeev action as the effective action of SU(N) QCD in the low energy limit. The result is obtained by separating the topological degrees which describes the non-Abelian monopoles from the dynamical degree of gauge potential, and integrating all the dynamical degrees of SU(N) QCD.
