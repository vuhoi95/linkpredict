Title: Supersymmetric extension of Moyal algebra and its application to the  matrix model
Authors: Takuya Masuda and Satoru Saito
Abstract: We construct operator representation of Moyal algebra in the presence of fermionic fields. The result is used to describe the matrix model in Moyal formalism, that treat gauge degrees of freedom and outer degrees of freedom equally.
