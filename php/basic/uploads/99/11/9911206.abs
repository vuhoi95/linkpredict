Title: Nonlinear Instantons from Supersymmetric p-Branes
Authors: Marcos Marino and Ruben Minasian and Gregory Moore and Andrew Strominger
Abstract: Supersymmetric configurations of type II D-branes with nonzero gauge field strengths in general supersymmetric backgrounds with nonzero B fields are analyzed using the kappa-symmetric worldvolume action. It is found in dimension four or greater that the usual instanton equation for the gauge field obtains a nonlinear deformation. The deformation is parameterized by the topological data of the B-field, the background geometry and the cycle wrapped by the brane. In the appropriate dimensions, limits and settings these equations reduce to deformed instanton equations recently found in the context of noncommutative geometry as well as those following from Lagrangians based on Bott-Chern forms. We further consider instantons comprised of M5-branes wrapping a Calabi-Yau space with non-vanishing three-form field strengths. It is shown that the instanton equations for the three-form are related to the Kodaira-Spencer equations.
