Title: Casimir force between Chern-Simons surfaces
Authors: M. Bordag and D. V. Vassilevich
Abstract: We calculate the Casimir force between two parallel plates if the boundary conditions for the photons are modified due to presence of the Chern-Simons term. We show that this effect should be measurable within the present experimental technique.
