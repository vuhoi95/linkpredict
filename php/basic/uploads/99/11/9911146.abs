Title: Mixed Branes Interaction in Compact Spacetime
Authors: H. Arfaei and D. Kamani
Abstract: We present a general description of two mixed branes interactions. For this we consider two mixed branes with dimensions p_1 and p_2, in external field B_{\mu\nu} and arbitrary gauge fields A^1_{\alpha_1} and A^2_{\alpha_2} on the world volume of them, in spacetime in which some of its directions are compactified on circles with different radii. Some examples are considered to clear these general interactions. Finally contribution of the massless states on the interactions is extracted. Closed string with mixed boundary conditions and boundary state formalism, provide useful tools for calculation of these interactions.
