Title: Covariant Quantization with Extended BRST Symmetry
Authors: B. Geyer and D. M. Gitman and P. M. Lavrov
Abstract: A short rewiev of covariant quantization methods based on BRST-antiBRST symmetry is given. In particular problems of correct definition of Sp(2) symmetric quantization scheme known as triplectic quantization are considered.
