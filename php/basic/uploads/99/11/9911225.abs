Title: Quantum Equivalence of Auxiliary Field Methods in Supersymmetric  Theories
Authors: Kiyoshi Higashijima and Muneto Nitta
Abstract: Quantum corrections to Legendre transformations are shown to cancel to all orders in supersymmetric theories in path integral formalism. Using this result, lagrangians for auxiliary fields are generalized to non-quadratic forms. In supersymmetric effective nonlinear lagrangians, the arbitrariness due to the existence of quasi Nambu-Goldstone bosons is shown to disappear when local auxiliary gauge fields are introduced.
