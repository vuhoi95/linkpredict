Title: Monopoles in non-Abelian Einstein-Born-Infeld Theory
Authors: Prasanta K. Tripathy and Fidel A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We study static spherically symmetric monopole solutions in non-Abelian Einstein-Born-Infeld-Higgs model with normal trace structure. These monopoles are similar to the corresponding solution with symmetrised trace structure and are existing only up to some critical value of the strength of the gravitational interaction. In addition, similar to their flat space counterpart, they also admit a critical value of the Born-Infeld parameter $\b$.
