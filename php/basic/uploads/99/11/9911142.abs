Title: Aspects of (2+1) dimensional gravity: AdS3 asymptotic dynamics in the  framework of Fefferman-Graham-Lee theorems
Authors: M. Rooman and Ph. Spindel
Abstract: Using the Chern-Simon formulation of (2+1) gravity, we derive, for the general asymptotic metrics given by the Fefferman-Graham-Lee theorems, the emergence of the Liouville mode associated to the boundary degrees of freedom of (2+1) dimensional anti de Sitter geometries.
