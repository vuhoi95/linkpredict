Title: New Regular Black Hole Solution from Nonlinear Electrodynamics
Authors: Eloy Ayón-Beato and Alberto García
Abstract: Using a nonlinear electrodynamics coupled to General Relativity a new regular exact black hole solution is found. The nonlinear theory reduces to the Maxwell one in the weak limit, and the solution corresponds to a charged black hole for |q| \leq 2s_c m \approx 1.05 m, with metric, curvature invariants, and electric field regular everywhere.
