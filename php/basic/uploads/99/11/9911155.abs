Title: Duality in a fermion-like formulation for the electromagnetic field
Authors: Everton M. C. Abreu and Marcelo Hott
Abstract: We employ the Dirac-like equation for the gauge field proposed by Majorana to obtain an action that is symmetric under duality transformation. We also use the equivalence between duality and chiral symmetry in this fermion-like formulation to show how the Maxwell action can be seen as a mass term.
