Title: On the Irreducible BRST Quantization of Spin-5/2 Gauge Fields
Authors: C. Bizdadea and S. O. Saliu and E. N. TÃ®mneanu
Abstract: Spin-5/2 gauge fields are quantized in an irreducible way within both the BRST and BRST-anti-BRST manners. To this end, we transform the reducible generating set into an irreducible one, such that the physical observables corresponding to these two formulations coincide. The gauge-fixing procedure emphasizes on the one hand the differences among our procedure and the results obtained in the literature, and on the other hand the equivalence between our BRST and BRST-anti-BRST approaches.
