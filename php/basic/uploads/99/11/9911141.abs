Title: Bosonization Based on Bethe Ansatz Equations and Spin-Charge Separation  in the Hubbard Model with Finite U
Authors: Yue Yu and Huan-Xiong Yang and Yong-Shi Wu
Abstract: We develop a bosonization approach for one-dimensional models based on Bethe ansatz equations. The operator formalism of the exact soluble models in the low energy limit provides a systematic method to calculate the asymptotic correlation functions. As examples with and without internal degrees of freedom, the Calogero-Sutherland (C-S) model and the repulsive Hubbard model are considered respectively. We verify that the low energy behavior of the C-S model is controlled by two classes of c=1 conformal field theories, depending on whether the C-S interactions are among bosons or among fermions. For the Hubbard model, we show the explicit charge-spin separation at low energy for arbitrary U>0. The low energy behavior of the system is described by the (semi-) direct product of two independent Virasoro algebras with c=1.
