Title: Resonant Production of Topological Defects
Authors: Sanatan Digal and Rajarshi Ray and Supratim Sengupta and Ajit M. Srivastava
Abstract: We describe a novel phenomenon in which vortices are produced due to resonant oscillations of a scalar field which is driven by a periodically varying temperature T, with T remaining much below the critical temperature $T_c$. Also, in a rapid heating of a localized region to a temperature {\it below} $T_c$, far separated vortex and antivortex can form. We compare our results with recent models of defect production during reheating after inflation. We also discuss possible experimental tests of our predictions of topological defect production {\it without} ever going through a phase transition.
