Title: Three Family Type IIB Orientifold String Vacua with Non-Abelian Wilson  Lines
Authors: Mirjam Cvetic and Michael Plumacher and Jing Wang
Abstract: We address the implementation of non-Abelian Wilson lines in D=4 N=1 Type IIB orientifold constructions. We present an explicit three-family example with the gauge group (U(4)xU(2)xSU(2)xSU(2))^2x(U(6)xSp(4))^2 and give the particle spectrum and the trilinear superpotential. Emphasizing the new subtleties associated with the introduction of non-Abelian Wilson lines, we show that the Abelian gauge anomalies are cancelled by the Green-Schwarz-type mechanism, and calculate the Fayet-Iliopoulos terms and gauge coupling corrections. The analysis thus sets a stage for further investigations of the phenomenological implications of this model.
