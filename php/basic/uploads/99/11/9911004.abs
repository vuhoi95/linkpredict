Title: Free-Field Realization of D-dimensional Cylindrical Gravitational Waves
Authors: A. Mikovic and N. Manojlovic
Abstract: We find two-dimensional free-field variables for D-dimensional general relativity on spacetimes with D-2 commuting spacelike Killing vector fields and non-compact spatial sections for D>4. We show that there is a canonical transformation which maps the corresponding two-dimensional dilaton gravity theory into a two-dimensional diffeomorphism invariant theory of the free-field variables. We also show that the spacetime metric components can be expressed as asymptotic series in negative powers of the dilaton, with coefficients which can be determined in terms of the free fields.
