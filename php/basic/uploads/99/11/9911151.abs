Title: Thermal Renormalons in Scalar Field Theory
Authors: M. Loewe and C. Valenzuela
Abstract: In the frame of the scalar theory $g \phi ^{4}$, we explore the occurrence of thermal renormalons, i. e. temperature dependent singularities in the Borel plane. The discussion of a particular renormalon type diagram at finite temperature, using Thermofield Dynamics, allows us to establish that these singularities actually get a temperature dependence. This dependence appears in the residues of the poles, remaining their positions unchanged with temperature.
