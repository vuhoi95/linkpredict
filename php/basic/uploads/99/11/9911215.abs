Title: The Renormalization Group Approach to the Confining String
Authors: Enrique Alvarez and César Gómez
Abstract: The renormalization group approach towards the string representation of non abelian gauge theories translates, in terms of the string sigma model beta function equations, the renormalization group evolution of the gauge coupling constant and Zamolodchikov`s $c$ function. Tachyon stability, glueball mass gap, renormalization group evolution of the $c$ function and the area law for the Wilson loop are studied for a critical bosonic string vacuum corresponding to a non abelian gauge theory in four dimensional space-time. We prove that the same intrinsic geometry for the string vacuum is universal in some sense, reproducing the Yang-Mills beta function to arbitrary loop order in perturbation theory.
