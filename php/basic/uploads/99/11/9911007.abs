Title: Composite diholes and intersecting brane-antibrane configurations in  string/M-theory
Authors: Auttakit Chattaraputi and Roberto Emparan and Anne Taormina
Abstract: We construct new configurations of oppositely charged, static black hole pairs (diholes) in four dimensions which are solutions of low energy string/M-theory. The black holes are extremal and have four different charges. We also consider diholes in other theories with an arbitrary number of abelian gauge fields and scalars, where the black holes can be regarded as composite objects. We uplift the four-charge solutions to higher dimensions in order to describe intersecting brane-antibrane systems in string and M-theory. The properties of the strings and membranes stretched inbetween these branes and antibranes are studied. Several other generic features of these solutions are discussed.
