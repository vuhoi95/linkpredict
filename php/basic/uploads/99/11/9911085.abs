Title: Noncommutative open strings from Dirac quantization
Authors: Won Tae Kim and John J. Oh
Abstract: We study Dirac commutators of canonical variables on D-branes with a constant Neveu-Schwarz 2-form field by using the Dirac constraint quantization method, and point out some subtleties appearing in previous works in analyzing constraint structure of the brane system. Overcoming some ad hoc procedures, we obtain desirable noncommutative coordinates exactly compatible with the result of the conformal field theory in recent literatures. Furthermore, we find interesting commutator relations of other canonical variables.
