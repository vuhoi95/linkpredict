Title: Massive Two-Dimensional Quantum Chromodynamics
Authors: E. Abdalla and M. C. B. Abdalla and K. D. Rothe
Abstract: In this work we study the zero-charge sector of massive two-dimensional Quantum Chromodynamics in the decoupled formulation. We find that some general features of the massless theory, concerning the constraints and the right- and left-moving character of the corresponding BRST currents, survive in the massive case. The implications for the integrability properties previously valid in the massless case, and the structure of the Hilbert space are discussed.
