Title: Spectra of Conformal Field Theories with Current Algebras
Authors: T. Gannon and P. Ruelle and M. A. Walton
Abstract: This is an elementary review of our recent work on the classification of the spectra of those two-dimensional rational conformal field theories (RCFTs) whose (maximal) chiral algebras are current algebras. We classified all possible partition functions for such theories when the defining finite-dimensional Lie algebra is simple. The concepts underlying this work are emphasized, and are illustrated using simple examples.
