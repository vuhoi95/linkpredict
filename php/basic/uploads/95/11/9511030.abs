Title: Observing instantons directly on the lattice without cooling
Authors: Eduardo Mendel and Guido Nolte
Abstract: Based on the study of the simple Abelian Higgs model in $1+1$ dimensions we will present a new method to identify and localize extended instantons. The idea is to measure the topological charge on regions somewhat larger than the extended instantons so as to average out the ultraviolet fluctuations but without losing the detailed topological information when going to the full space. The instanton size and probability density can be directly extracted from this analysis. Local dislocations, which can be avoided for fine enough lattices, can be reinterpreted as modified boundary conditions producing sectors with net topological charge.
