Title: A novel BRST approach in generalizing the Jackiw-Nair anyon
Authors: Subir Ghosh and S. Mukhopadhyay
Abstract: A novel BRST quantization is described, which is applied in generalizing the Jackiw-Nair construction of anyon. We have explicitly shown that the matter states connected to an unconventional ("non-zero") BRST ghost sector are physical. They are identified to the Jackiw-Nair system in a particular gauge. Also for the first time an indepth analysis of the present kind for a reducible constraint system, ( where the constraints are not independent), has been performed.
