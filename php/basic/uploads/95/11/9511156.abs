Title: A Lagrangian Formulation of 2-Dimensional Topological Gravity and  ÄŒech-De-Rham Cohomology
Authors: Carlo M. Becchi and Camillo Imbimbo
Abstract: We present a very simplified analysis of how one can overcome the Gribov problem in a non-abelian gauge theory. Our formulae, albeit quite simplified, show that possible breakdowns of the Slavnov-Taylor identity could in principle come from singularities in space of gauge orbits. To test these ideas we exhibit the calculation of a very simple correlation function of 2-dimensional topological gravity and we show how in this model the singularities of the moduli space induce a breakdown of the Slavnov-Taylor identity. We comment on the technical relevance of the possibility of including the singularities into a finite number of cells of the moduli space.
