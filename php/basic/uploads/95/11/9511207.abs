Title: Solving The N-Body Problem in (2+1)-Gravity
Authors: A. Bellini and M. Ciafaloni and P. Valtancoli
Abstract: We construct a non-perturbative, single-valued solution for the metric and the motion of $N$ interacting particles in $2+1$-Gravity. The solution is explicit for two particles with any speed and for any number of particles with small speed. It is based on a mapping from multivalued Minkowskian coordinates to single-valued ones, which solves the non-abelian monodromies due to particles' momenta. The two and three-body cases are treated in detail.
