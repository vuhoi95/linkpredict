Title: Greensite-Halpern stabilization of $A_k$ singularities in the $N \to  \infty$ limit
Authors: J. Maeder and W. Ruehl
Abstract: The Greensite-Halpern method of stabilizing bottomless Euclidean actions is applied to zerodimensional O(N) sigma models with unstable $A_k$ singularities in the $N = \infty$ limit.
