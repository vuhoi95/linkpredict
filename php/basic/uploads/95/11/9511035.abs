Title: Dirac Equation in Gauge and Affine-Metric Gravitation Theories
Authors: G. Giachetta and G. Sardanashvily
Abstract: We show that the covariant derivative of Dirac fermion fields in the presence of a general linear connection on a world manifold is universal for Einstein's, gauge and affine-metric gravitation theories.
