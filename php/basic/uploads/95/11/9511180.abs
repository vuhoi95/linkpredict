Title: Exceptional Equivalences in N=2 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Ulf H. Danielsson and Bo Sundborg
Abstract: We find low energy equivalences between $N=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories with different simple gauge groups with and without matter. We give a construction of equivalences based on subgroups and find all examples with maximal simple subgroups. This is used to solve some theories with exceptional gauge groups $G_2$ and $F_4$. We are also able to solve an $E_6$ theory on a codimension one submanifold of its moduli space.
