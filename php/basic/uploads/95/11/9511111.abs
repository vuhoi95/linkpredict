Title: String center of mass operator and its effect on BRST cohomology
Authors: Alexander Astashkevich and Alexander Belopolsky
Abstract: We consider the theory of bosonic closed strings on the flat background R(25,1). We show how the BRST complex can be extended to a complex where the string center of mass operator, x^mu_0, is well defined. We investigate the cohomology of the extended complex. We demonstrate that this cohomology has a number of interesting features. Unlike in the standard BRST cohomology, there is no doubling of physical states in the extended complex. The cohomology of the extended complex is more physical in a number of of aspects related to the zero-momentum states. In particular, we show that the ghost number one zero-momentum cohomology states are in one to one correspondence with the generators of the global symmetries of the background i.e., the Poincare algebra.
