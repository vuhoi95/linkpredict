Title: Non-Abelian Antibrackets
Authors: J. Alfaro and P. H. Damgaard
Abstract: The $\Delta$-operator of the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism is the Hamiltonian BRST charge of Abelian shift transformations in the ghost momentum representation. We generalize this $\Delta$-operator, and its associated hierarchy of antibrackets, to that of an arbitrary non-Abelian and possibly open algebra of any rank. We comment on the possible application of this formalism to closed string field theory.
