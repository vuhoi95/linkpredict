Title: The IIA super-eightbrane
Authors: E. Bergshoeff and M. B. Green and G. Papadopoulos and P. K. Townsend
Abstract: We present a version of ten-dimensional IIA supergravity containing a 9-form potential for which the field equations are equivalent to those of the standard, massless, IIA theory for vanishing 10-form field strength, $F_{10}$, and to those of the `massive' IIA theory for non-vanishing $F_{10}$. We exhibit a multi 8-brane solution of this theory which preserves half the supersymmetry. We propose this solution as the effective field theory realization of the Dirichlet 8-brane of type IIA superstring theory.
