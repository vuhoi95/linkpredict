Title: Multidimensional Isotropic and Anisotropic Q-Oscillator Models
Authors: A. Ghosh and P. Mitra and A. Kundu
Abstract: q-oscillator models are considered in two and higher dimensions and their symmetries are explored. New symmetries are found for both isotropic and anisotropic cases. Applications to the spectra of triatomic molecules and superdeformed nuclei are discussed.
