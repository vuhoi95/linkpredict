Title: New N=2 Superconformal Field Theories in Four Dimensions
Authors: P. C. Argyres and M. R. Plesser and N. Seiberg and E. Witten
Abstract: New examples of N=2 supersymmetric conformal field theories are found as fixed points of SU(2) N=2 supersymmetric QCD. Relations among the scaling dimensions of their relevant chiral operators, global symmetries, and Higgs branches are understood in terms of the general structure of relevant deformations of non-trivial N=2 conformal field theories. The spectrum of scaling dimensions found are all those compatible with relevant deformations of a y^2 = x^3 singular curve.
