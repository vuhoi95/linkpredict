Title: The O(N) sigma-model Laplacian
Authors: Paul Mansfield and Jiannis Pachos
Abstract: For fields that vary slowly on the scale of the lightest mass the logarithm of the vacuum functional of a massive quantum field theory can be expanded in terms of local functionals satisfying a form of the Schr\"odinger equation, the principal ingredient of which is a regulated functional Laplacian. We construct to leading order a Laplacian for the O(N) sigma-model that acts on such local functionals. It is determined by imposing rotational invariance in the internal space together with closure of the Poincar\'e algebra.
