Title: D-Brane Boundary State Dynamics
Authors: Curtis G. Callan, Jr. and Igor R. Klebanov
Abstract: We construct the open string boundary states corresponding to various time-dependent deformations of the D-brane and explore several ways in which they may be used to study stringy soliton collective coordinate quantum dynamics. Among other things, we find that D-strings have exact moduli corresponding to arbitrary chiral excitations of the basic soliton. These are presumably the duals of the BPS-saturated excitations of the fundamental Type IIB string. These first steps in a systematic study of the dynamics and interactions of Dirichlet-brane solitons give further evidence of the consistency of Polchinski's new approach to string soliton physics.
