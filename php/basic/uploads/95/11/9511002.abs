Title: Constructive building of the Lax pair in the non-linear sigma model
Authors: Ariel O. Garcia and Roberto C. Trinchero
Abstract: A derivation of the Lax pair for the (1+1)-dimensional non-linear sigma-model is described. Its main benefit is to have a clearer physical origin and to allow the study of a generalization to higher dimensions.
