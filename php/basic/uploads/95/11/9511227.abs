Title: String Physics and Black Holes
Authors: Leonard Susskind and John Uglum
Abstract: In these lectures we review the quantum physics of large Schwarzschild black holes. Hawking's information paradox, the theory of the stretched horizon and the principle of black hole complementarity are covered. We then discuss how the ideas of black hole complementarity may be realized in string theory. Finally, arguments are given that the world may be a hologram. Lectures delivered at ICTP Spring School on String Theory, Gauge Theory, and Quantum Gravity, 1995.
