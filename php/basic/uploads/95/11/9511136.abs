Title: How Many New Worlds Are Inside a Black Hole?
Authors: Claude Barrab√®s and Valeri Frolov
Abstract: We propose a possible internal structure for a Schwarzschild black hole resulting from the creation of multiple de Sitter universes with lightlike boundaries when the curvature reaches Planckian values. The intersection of the boundaries is studied and a scenario leading to disconnected de Sitter universes is proposed. The application to the information loss problem is then discussed.
