Title: Gauge Invariant Geometric Variables For Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Peter E. Haagensen and Kenneth Johnson and C. S. Lam
Abstract: In a previous publication [1], local gauge invariant geometric variables were introduced to describe the physical Hilbert space of Yang-Mills theory. In these variables, the electric energy involves the inverse of an operator which can generically have zero modes, and thus its calculation is subtle. In the present work, we resolve these subtleties by considering a small deformation in the definition of these variables, which in the end is removed. The case of spherical configurations of the gauge invariant variables is treated in detail, as well as the inclusion of infinitely heavy point color sources, and the expression for the associated electric field is found explicitly. These spherical geometries are seen to correspond to the spatial components of instanton configurations. The related geometries corresponding to Wu-Yang monopoles and merons are also identified.
