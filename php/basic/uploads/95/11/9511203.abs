Title: Dilatonic p-brane solitons
Authors: H. Lu and C. N. Pope and E. Sezgin and K. S. Stelle
Abstract: We find new 4-brane and 5-brane solitons in massive gauged $D=6$, $N=2$ and $D=7$, $N=1$ supergravities. In each case, the solutions preserve half of the original supersymmetry. These solutions make use of the metric and dilaton fields only. We also present more general dilatonic $(D-2)$-branes in $D$ dimensions.
