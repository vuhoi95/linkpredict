Title: Complex actions in two-dimensional topology change
Authors: Jorma Louko and Rafael D. Sorkin
Abstract: We investigate topology change in (1+1) dimensions by analyzing the scalar-curvature action $1/2 \int R dV$ at the points of metric-degeneration that (with minor exceptions) any nontrivial Lorentzian cobordism necessarily possesses. In two dimensions any cobordism can be built up as a combination of only two elementary types, the ``yarmulke'' and the ``trousers.'' For each of these elementary cobordisms, we consider a family of Morse-theory inspired Lorentzian metrics that vanish smoothly at a single point, resulting in a conical-type singularity there. In the yarmulke case, the distinguished point is analogous to a cosmological initial (or final) singularity, with the spacetime as a whole being obtained from one causal region of Misner space by adjoining a single point. In the trousers case, the distinguished point is a ``crotch singularity'' that signals a change in the spacetime topology (this being also the fundamental vertex of string theory, if one makes that interpretation). We regularize the metrics by adding a small imaginary part whose sign is fixed to be positive by the condition that it lead to a convergent scalar field path integral on the regularized spacetime. As the regulator is removed, the scalar density $1/2 \sqrt{-g} R$ approaches a delta-function whose strength is complex: for the yarmulke family the strength is $\beta -2\pi i$, where $\beta$ is the rapidity parameter of the associated Misner space; for the trousers family it is simply $+2\pi i$. This implies that in the path integral over spacetime metrics for Einstein gravity in three or more spacetime dimensions, topology change via a crotch singularity is exponentially suppressed, whereas appearance or disappearance of a universe via a yarmulke singularity is exponentially enhanced.
