Title: Spectral invariants for the Dirac equation on the d-Ball with various  boundary conditions
Authors: J. S. Dowker and J. S. Apps and K. Kirsten and M. Bordag
Abstract: The mode properties for spectral and mixed boundary conditions for massless spin-half fields are derived for the $d$--ball. The corresponding functional determinants and heat-kernel coefficients are presented, the latter as polynomials in $d$.
