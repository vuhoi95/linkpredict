Title: Maxwell and Dirac theories as an already unified theory
Authors: J. Vaz, Jr. and W. A. Rodrigues, Jr.
Abstract: In this paper we formulate Maxwell and Dirac theories as an already unified theory (in the sense of Misner and Wheeler). We introduce Dirac spinors as "Dirac square root" of the Faraday bivector, and use this in order to find a spinorial representation of Maxwell equations. Then we show that under certain circunstances this spinor equation reduces to an equation formally identical to Dirac equation. Finally we discuss certain conditions under which this equation can be really interpreted as Dirac equation, and some other possible interpretations of this result.
