Title: Non-Linear Affine Embedding of the Dirac Field from the  Multiplicity-Free SL(4,R) Unirreps
Authors: A. Lopez-Pinto and A. Tiemblo and R. Tresguerres
Abstract: The correspondence between the linear multiplicity-free unirreps of SL(4, R) studied by Ne'eman and {\~{S}}ija{\~{c}}ki and the non-linear realizations of the affine group is worked out. The results obtained clarify the inclusion of spinorial fields in a non-linear affine gauge theory of gravitation.
