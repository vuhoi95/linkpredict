Title: Universality for SU(2) Yang-Mills Theory in (2+1)D
Authors: C. J. Hamer and M. Sheppeard and Zheng Weihong and D. Schutte
Abstract: The Green's Function Monte Carlo method of Chin et al is applied to SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in (2+1)D. Accurate measurements are obtained for the ground-state energy and mean plaquette value, and for various Wilson loops. The results are compared with series expansions and coupled cluster estimates, and with the Euclidean Monte Carlo results of Teper. A striking demonstration of universality between the Hamiltonian and Euclidean formulations is obtained.
