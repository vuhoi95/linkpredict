Title: The accelerated observer and quantum effects
Authors: Roberto Casadio and Giovanni Venturi
Abstract: An extended monopole detector at constant acceleration coupled to a massless scalar field is allowed to evolve quantum mechanically. It is found that while in the classical, followed by the point particle, limit the usual result Unruh effect is recovered, in the point particle (before the classical) limit the detector decouples from the scalar field and therefore the effect disappears.
