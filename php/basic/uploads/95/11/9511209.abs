Title: All order I.R. finite expansion for short distance behavior of massless  theories perturbed by a relevant operator
Authors: R. Guida and N. Magnoli
Abstract: We consider here renormalizable theories without relevant couplings and present an I.R. consistent technique to study corrections to short distance behavior (Wilson O.P.E. coefficients) due to a relevant perturbation. Our method is the result of a complete reformulation of recent works on the field, and is characterized by a more orthodox treatment of U.V. divergences that allows for simpler formulae and consequently an explicit all order (regularization invariant) I.R. finitess proof. Underlying hypotheses are discussed in detail and found to be satisfied in conformal theories that constitute a natural field of application of this approach.
