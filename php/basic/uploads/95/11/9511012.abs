Title: Glue Ball Masses and the Chameleon Gauge
Authors: E. Marinari and M. L. Paciello and G. Parisi and B. Taglienti
Abstract: We introduce a new numerical technique to compute mass spectra, based on difference method and on a new gauge fixing procedure. We show that the method is very effective by test runs on a $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory.
