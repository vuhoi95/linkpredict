Title: Massive Loop Amplitudes from Unitarity
Authors: Z. Bern and A. G. Morgan
Abstract: We show, for previously uncalculated examples containing a uniform mass in the loop, that it is possible to obtain complete massive one-loop gauge theory amplitudes solely from unitarity and known ultraviolet or infrared mass singularities. In particular, we calculate four-gluon scattering via massive quark loops in QCD. The contribution of a heavy quark to five-gluon scattering with identical helicities is also presented.
