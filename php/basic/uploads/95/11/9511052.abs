Title: Integrability in N=2 Gauge Theory: A Proof
Authors: E. J. Martinec and N. P. Warner
Abstract: The holomorphic prepotential of ultraviolet finite N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories is obtained by a partial twisting of N=1 gauge theory in six dimensions, compactified on $\IR^4\timesT^2$. We show that Ward identities for the conserved chiral $\R$-symmetry in these theories generate a set of constraints on the correlation functions of chiral ring operators. These correlators depend only on the coordinates of the $T^2$, and the constraints are analogs of the Knihnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard equations at the critical level.
