Title: Simple Quantum Mechanical Phenomena and the Feynman Real Time Path  Integral
Authors: A. Dullweber and E. R. Hilf and E. Mendel
Abstract: The path integral formalism gives a very illustrative and intuitive understanding of quantum mechanics but due to its difficult sum over phases one usually prefers Schr\"odinger's approach. We will show that it is possible to calculate simple quantum phenomena by performing Feynman's sum over all paths staying entirely in real time. Once the propagator is obtained it is particularly easy to get the energy spectrum or the evolution of any wavefunction.
