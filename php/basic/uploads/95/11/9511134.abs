Title: Logarithmic Operators and Hidden Continuous Symmetry in Critical  Disordered Models
Authors: J. -S. Caux and Ian I. Kogan and A. M. Tsvelik
Abstract: We study the model of (2 + 1)-dimensional relativistic fermions in a random non-Abelian gauge potential at criticality. The exact solution shows that the operator expansion contains a conserved current - a generator of a continuous symmetry. The presence of this operator changes the operator product expansion and gives rise to logarithmic contributions to the correlation functions at the critical point. We calculate the distribution function of the local density of states in this model and find that it follows the famous log-normal law.
