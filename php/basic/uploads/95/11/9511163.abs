Title: Colliding Plane Waves in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton Fields
Authors: Nora Breton and Tonatiuh Matos and Alberto Garcia
Abstract: Within the metric structure endowed with two orthogonal space-like Killing vectors a class of solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton field equations is presented. Two explicitly given sub-classes of solutions bear an interpretation as colliding plane waves in the low-energy limit of the heterotic string theory.
