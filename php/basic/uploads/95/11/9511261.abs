Title: Tensor reduction of two-loop vacuum diagrams and projectors for  expanding three-point functions
Authors: A. I. Davydychev and J. B. Tausk
Abstract: Explicit general formulae for the tensor reduction of two-loop massive vacuum diagrams are presented. The problem of calculating the corresponding coefficients is shown to be equivalent to the problem of constructing differential operators (projectors) extracting the coefficients of the momentum expansion of massive scalar three-point functions (with any number of loops), so the solution to the latter problem is also given.
