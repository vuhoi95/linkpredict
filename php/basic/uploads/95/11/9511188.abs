Title: Rotating Charged Black Strings in General Relativity
Authors: Jos√© P. S. Lemos and Vilson T. Zanchin
Abstract: Einstein-Maxwell equations with a cosmological constant are analyzed in a four dimensional stationary spacetime admitting in addition a two dimensional group $G_2$ of spatial isometries. Charged rotating open and closed black string solutions are found.
