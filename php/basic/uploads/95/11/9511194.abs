Title: Brane - Anti-Brane Forces
Authors: T. Banks and L. Susskind
Abstract: The force between like sign BPS saturated objects generally vanishes. This is a reflection of the fact that BPS states are really massless uncharged particles with nonvanishing momenta in compactified directions. Two like sign BPS objects with zero relative velocity can be viewed as a boosted state of two neutral massless particles in a state of vanishing relative motion. By contrast two unlike sign BPS particles may be thought of as colliding objects moving in opposite directions in compact space. This leads to complicated interactions which are totally intractable at present. We illustrate this by considering the potential between opposite sign zero-D- branes .
