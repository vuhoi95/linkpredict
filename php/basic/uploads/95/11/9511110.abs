Title: Charge Screening in the Finite Temperature Schwinger Model
Authors: G. Grignani and G. Semenoff and P. Sodano and O. Tirkkonen
Abstract: We compute the effective action and correlators of the Polyakov loop operator in the Schwinger model at finite temperature and discuss the realization of the discrete symmetries that occur there. We show that, due to nonlocal effects of massless fermions in two spacetime dimensions, the discrete symmetry which governs the screening of charges is spontaneously broken even in an effective one-dimensional model, when the volume is infinite. In this limit, the thermal state of the Schwinger model screens an arbitrary external charge; consequently the model is in the deconfined phase, with the charge of the deconfined fermions completely screened. In a finite volume we show that the Schwinger model is always confining.
