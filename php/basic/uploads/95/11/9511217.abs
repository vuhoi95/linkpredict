Title: Renormalizability of Quantum Gravity near Two Dimensions
Authors: H. Kawai and Y. Kitazawa and M. Ninomiya
Abstract: We study the renormalizability of quantum gravity near two dimensions. Our formalism starts with the tree action which is invariant under the volume preserving diffeomorphism. We identify the BRS invariance which originates from the full diffeomorphism invariance. We study the Ward-Takahashi identities to determine the general structure of the counter terms. We prove to all orders that the counter terms can be supplied by the coupling and the wave function renormalization of the tree action. The bare action can be constructed to be the Einstein action form which ensures the full diffeomorphism invariance.
