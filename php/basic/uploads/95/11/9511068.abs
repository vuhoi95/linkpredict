Title: Infrared Regularization of Yang-Mills Theories
Authors: Alberto Blasi and Nicola Maggiore
Abstract: We introduce an infrared regulator in Yang--Mills theories under the form of a mass term for the nonabelian fields. We show that the resulting action, built in a covariant linear gauge, is multiplicatively renormalizable by proving the validity at all orders of the Slavnov identity defining the theory.
