Title: Quantum Corrections in Two-Dimensional Non-Supersymmetric Heterotic  Strings
Authors: M. A. R. Osorio and M. A. Vazquez-Mozo
Abstract: We study quantum corrections for a family of 24 non-supersymmetric heterotic strings in two dimensions. We compute their genus two cosmological constant using the hyperelliptic formalism and the genus one two-point functions for the massless states. From here we get the mass corrections to the states in the massless sector and discuss the role of the infrared divergences that appear in the computation. We also study some tree-level aspects of these theories and find that they are classified not only by the corresponding Niemeier lattice but also by their {\it hidden} right-moving gauge symmetry.
