Title: Operator Product Expansion in Two-Dimensional Quantum Gravity
Authors: H. Aoki and H. Kawai and J. Nishimura and A. Tsuchiya
Abstract: We consider correlation functions of operators and the operator product expansion in two-dimensional quantum gravity. First we introduce correlation functions with geodesic distances between operators kept fixed. Next by making two of the operators closer, we examine if there exists an analog of the operator product expansion in ordinary field theories. Our results suggest that the operator product expansion holds in quantum gravity as well, though special care should be taken regarding the physical meaning of fixing geodesic distances on a fluctuating geometry.
