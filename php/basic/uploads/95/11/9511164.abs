Title: Two-Dimensional Black Hole and Singularities of CY Manifolds
Authors: Hirosi Ooguri and Cumrun Vafa
Abstract: We study the degenerating limits of superconformal theories for compactifications on singular K3 and Calabi-Yau threefolds. We find that in both cases the degeneration involves creating an Euclidean two-dimensional black hole coupled weakly to the rest of the system. Moreover we find that the conformal theory of A_n singularities of K3 are the same as that of the symmetric fivebrane. We also find intriguing connections between ADE (1,n) non-critical strings and singular limits of superconformal theories on the corresponding ALE space.
