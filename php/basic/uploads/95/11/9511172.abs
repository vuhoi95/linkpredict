Title: Toda lattice realization of integrable hierarchies
Authors: L. Bonora and C. P. Constantinidis and E. Vinteler
Abstract: We present a new realization of scalar integrable hierarchies in terms of the Toda lattice hierarchy. In other words, we show on a large number of examples that an integrable hierarchy, defined by a pseudodifferential Lax operator, can be embedded in the Toda lattice hierarchy. Such a realization in terms the Toda lattice hierarchy seems to be as general as the Drinfeld--Sokolov realization.
