Title: q-deformed Phase Space and its Lattice Structure
Authors: M. Fichtmueller and A. Lorek and J. Wess
Abstract: A q-deformed two-dimensional phase space is studied as a model for a noncommutative phase space. A lattice structure arises that can be interpreted as a spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry. The eigenfunctions of a Hamiltonian that lives on such a lattice are derived as wavefunctions in ordinary $x$-space.
