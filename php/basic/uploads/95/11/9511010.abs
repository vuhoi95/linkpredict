Title: The regulated four parameter one dimensional point interaction
Authors: J. M. Roman and R. Tarrach
Abstract: The general four parameter point interaction in one dimensional quantum mechanics is regulated. It allows the exact solution, but not the perturbative one. We conjecture that this is due to the interaction not being asymptotically free. We then propose a different breakup of unperturbed theory and interaction, which now is asymptotically free but leads to the same physics. The corresponding regulated potential can be solved both exactly and perturbatively, in agreement with the conjecture.
