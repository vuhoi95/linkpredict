Title: Twining characters, orbit Lie algebras, and fixed point resolution
Authors: J"urgen Fuchs and Bert Schellekens and Christoph Schweigert
Abstract: We describe the resolution of field identification fixed points in coset conformal field theories in terms of representation spaces of the coset chiral algebra. A necessary ingredient from the representation theory of Kac Moody algebras is the recently developed theory of twining characters and orbit Lie algebras, as applied to automorphisms representing identification currents.
