Title: Lorentz Anomaly and 1+1-Dimensional Radiating Black Holes
Authors: G. Amelino-Camelia and L. Griguolo and D. Seminara
Abstract: The radiation from the black holes of a 1+1-dimensional chiral quantum gravity model is studied. Most notably, a non-trivial dependence on a renormalization parameter that characterizes the anomaly relations is uncovered in an improved semiclassical approximation scheme; this dependence is not present in the naive semiclassical approximation.
