Title: Quantum dynamics of N=1, D=4 supergravity chiral compensator
Authors: I. L. Buchbinder and A. Yu. Petrov
Abstract: A new four-dimensional $N=1$ superfield model is suggested. The model is induced by supertrace anomaly of matter superfields in curved superspace and leads to effective theory of supergravity chiral compensator. A renormalization structure of this model is studied, one-loop counterterms are calculated and renormalization group equations are investigated. It is shown that the theory under consideration is infrared free.
