Title: Renormalization by Projection: On the Equivalence of the Bloch-Feshbach  Formalism and Wilson's Renormalization
Authors: Jochen Mueller and Jochen Rau
Abstract: We employ projection operator techniques in Hilbert space to derive a continuous sequence of effective Hamiltonians which describe the dynamics on successively larger length scales. We show for the case of \phi^4 theory that the masses and couplings in these effective Hamiltonians vary in accordance with 1-loop renormalization group equations. This is evidence for an intimate connection between Wilson's renormalization and the venerable Bloch-Feshbach formalism.
