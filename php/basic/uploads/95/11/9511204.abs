Title: Black Hole Condensation and the Web of Calabi-Yau Manifolds
Authors: Ti-ming Chiang and Brian R. Greene and Mark Gross and Yakov Kanter
Abstract: We review recent work concerning topology changing phase transitions through black hole condensation in Type II string theory. We then also briefly describe a present study aimed at extending the known web of interconnections between Calabi-Yau manifolds. We show, for instance, that all 7555 Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in weighted projective four space are mathematically connected by extremal transitions.
