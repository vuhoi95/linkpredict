Title: Subluminal and superluminal solutions in vacuum of the Maxwell equations  and the massless Dirac equation
Authors: W. A. Rodrigues, Jr. and J. Vaz, Jr.
Abstract: We show that Maxwell equations and Dirac equation (with zero mass term) have both subluminal and superluminal solutions in vacuum. We also discuss the possible fundamental physical consequences of our results.
