Title: Scaling Properties of the Ising Model in a Field
Authors: Uwe Grimm and Bernard Nienhuis
Abstract: The dilute A_3 model is a solvable IRF (interaction-round-a-face) model with three local states and adjacency conditions encoded by the Dynkin diagram of the Lie algebra A_3. It can be regarded as a solvable version of a critical Ising model in a magnetic field. One therefore expects the scaling limit to be governed by Zamolodchikov's integrable perturbation of the c=1/2 conformal field theory. We perform a detailed numerical investigation of the solutions of the Bethe ansatz equation for the off-critical model. Our results agree perfectly with the predicted values for the lowest masses of the stable particles and support the assumptions on the nature of the Bethe ansatz solutions which enter crucially in a recent thermodynamic Bethe ansatz calculation of the factorized scattering matrix.
