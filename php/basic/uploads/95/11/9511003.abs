Authors: Somendra M. Bhattacharjee and Avinash Khare
Abstract: The exact solution of the two-dimensional Ising model by Onsager in 1944 represents one of the landmarks in theoretical physics. On the occassion of the fifty years of the exact solution, we give a historical review of this model. After briefly discussing the exact solution by Onsager, we point out some of the recent developments in this field. The exact solution by Onsager has inspired several developments in various other fields. Some of these are also briefly mentioned.
