Title: BRST-BFV quantization and the Schwinger action principle
Authors: J. Antonio Garcia and J. David Vergara and Luis F. Urrutia
Abstract: We introduce an operator version of the BRST-BFV effective action for arbitrary systems with first-class constraints. Using the Schwinger action principle we calculate the propagators corresponding to: (i) the parametrized non-relativistic free particle, (ii) the relativistic free particle and (iii) the spining relativistic free particle. Our calculation correctly imposes the BRST-invariance at the end-points. The precise use of the additional boundary terms required in the description of fermionic variables is also incorporated.
