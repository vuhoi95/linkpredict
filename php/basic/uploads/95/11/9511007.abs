Title: Algebra of Non-Local Charges in Supersymmetric Non-Linear Sigma Models
Authors: L. E. Saltini and A. Zadra
Abstract: We propose a graphic method to derive the classical algebra (Dirac brackets) of non-local conserved charges in the two dimensional supersymmetric non-linear $O(N)$ sigma model. As in the purely bosonic theory we find a cubic Yangian algebra. We also consider the extension of graphic methods to other integrable theories.
