Title: Three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics as an effective interaction
Authors: E. Abdalla and F. M. de Carvalho Filho
Abstract: We obtain a Quantum Electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions by applying a Kaluza--Klein type method of dimensional reduction to Quantum Electrodynamics in 3+1 dimensions rendering the model more realistic to application in solid-state systems, invariant under translations in one direction. We show that the model obtained leads to an effective action exhibiting an interesting phase structure and that the generated Chern--Simons term survives only in the broken phase.
