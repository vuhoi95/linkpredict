Title: Approach to D-dimensional Gross-Neveu model at finite temperature and  curvature
Authors: S. Kanemura and H. -T. Sato
Abstract: We discuss phase structure of chiral symmetry breaking of the $D$-dimensional ($2\leq D\leq3$) Gross-Neveu model at finite temperature, density and constant curvature. We evaluate the effective potential in a weak background approximation to thermalize the model as well as in the leading order of the $1/N$-expansion. A third order critical line is observed similarly to the $D=2$ case.
