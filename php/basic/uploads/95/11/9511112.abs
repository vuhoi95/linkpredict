Title: Supersymmetry and localization
Authors: Albert Schwarz and Oleg Zaboronsky
Abstract: We study conditions under which an odd symmetry of the integrand leads to localization of the corresponding integral over a (super)manifold. We also show that in many cases these conditions guarantee exactness of the stationary phase approximation of such integrals.
