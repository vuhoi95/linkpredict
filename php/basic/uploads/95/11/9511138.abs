Title: Quasi-Exactly Solvable Systems and Orthogonal Polynomials
Authors: Carl M. Bender and Gerald V. Dunne
Abstract: This paper shows that there is a correspondence between quasi-exactly solvable models in quantum mechanics and sets of orthogonal polynomials $\{ P_n\}$. The quantum-mechanical wave function is the generating function for the $P_n (E)$, which are polynomials in the energy $E$. The condition of quasi-exact solvability is reflected in the vanishing of the norm of all polynomials whose index $n$ exceeds a critical value $J$. The zeros of the critical polynomial $P_J(E)$ are the quasi-exact energy eigenvalues of the system.
