Title: Higher bundle gerbes and cohomology classes in gauge theories
Authors: A. L. Carey and M. K. Murray and B. L. Wang
Abstract: The notion of a higher bundle gerbe is introduced to give a geometric realization of the higher degree integral cohomology of certain manifolds. We consider examples using the infinite dimensional spaces arising in gauge theories.
