Title: The Zero Curvature Formulation of TB, sTB Hierarchy and Topological  Algebras
Authors: Ashok Das and Shibaji Roy
Abstract: A particular dispersive generalization of long water wave equation in $1+1$ dimensions, which is important in the study of matrix models without scaling limit, known as two--Boson (TB) equation, as well as the associated hierarchy has been derived from the zero curvature condition on the gauge group $SL(2,R)\otimes U(1)$. The supersymmetric extension of the two--Boson (sTB) hierarchy has similarly been derived from the zero curvature condition associated with the gauge supergroup $OSp(2|2)$. Topological algebras arise naturally as the second Hamiltonian structure of these classical integrable systems, indicating a close relationship of these models with 2d topological field theories.
