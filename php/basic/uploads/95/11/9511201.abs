Title: Discrete gauge theories
Authors: Mark de Wild Propitius and F. Alexander Bais
Abstract: In these lecture notes, we present a self-contained discussion of planar gauge theories broken down to some finite residual gauge group H via the Higgs mechanism. The main focus is on the discrete H gauge theory describing the long distance physics of such a model. The spectrum features global H charges, magnetic vortices and dyonic combinations. Due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect, these particles exhibit topological interactions. Among other things, we review the Hopf algebra related to this discrete H gauge theory, which provides an unified description of the spin, braid and fusion properties of the particles in this model. Exotic phenomena such as flux metamorphosis, Alice fluxes, Cheshire charge, (non)abelian braid statistics, the generalized spin-statistics connection and nonabelian Aharonov-Bohm scattering are explained and illustrated by representative examples.
