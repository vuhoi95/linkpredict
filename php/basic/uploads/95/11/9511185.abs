Title: Central Extensions of Gauge Groups Revisited
Authors: A. Losev and G. Moore and N. Nekrasov and S. Shatashvili
Abstract: We present an explicit construction for the central extension of the group $\Map(X, G)$ where $X$ is a compact manifold and $G$ is a Lie group. If $X$ is a complex curve we obtain a simple construction of the extension by the Picard variety $\Pic(X)$. The construction is easily adapted to the extension of $\Aut(E)$, the gauge group of automorphisms of a nontrivial vector bundle $E$.
