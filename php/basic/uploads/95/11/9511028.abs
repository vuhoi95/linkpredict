Abstract: Inspired by Reshetikhin's twisting procedure to obtain multiparametric extensions of a Hopf algebra, a general `symmetry transformation' of the `particle conserving' $R$-matrix is found such that the resulting multiparametric $R$-matrix, with a spectral parameter as well as a colour parameter, is also a solution of the Yang-Baxter equation (YBE). The corresponding transformation of the quantum YBE reveals a new relation between the associated quantized algebra and its multiparametric deformation. As applications of this general relation to some particular cases, multiparametric and coloured extensions of the quantum group $GL_q(N)$ and the Yangian algebra $Y(gl_N)$ are investigated and their explicit realizations are also discussed. Possible interesting physical applications of such extended Yangian algebras are indicated.
