Title: Single-particle Green's functions of the Calogero-Sutherland model at  couplings Î»= 1/2, 1, and 2
Authors: M. R. Zirnbauer and F. D. M. Haldane
Abstract: At coupling strengths lambda = 1/2, 1, or 2, the Calogero-Sutherland model (CSM) is related to Brownian motion in a Wigner-Dyson random matrix ensemble with orthogonal, unitary, or symplectic symmetry. Using this relation in conjunction with superanalytic techniques developed in mesoscopic conductor physics, we derive an exact integral representation for the CSM two-particle Green's function in the thermodynamic limit. Simple closed expressions for the single-particle Green's functions are extracted by separation of points. For the advanced part, where a particle is added to the ground state and later removed, a sum of two contributions is found: the expected one with just one particle excitation present, plus an extra term arising from fractionalization of the single particle into a number of elementary particle and hole excitations.
