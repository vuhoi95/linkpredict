Title: EQUIVALENCES BETWEEN STOCHASTIC SYSTEMS
Authors: Malte Henkel and Enzo Orlandini and Gunter M. Sch√ºtz
Abstract: Time-dependent correlation functions of (unstable) particles undergoing biased or unbiased diffusion, coagulation and annihilation are calculated. This is achieved by similarity transformations between different stochastic models and between stochastic and soluble {\em non-stochastic} models. The results agree with experiments on one-dimensional annihilation-coagulation processes.
