Title: Classical moduli $O(Î±')$ hair
Authors: P. Kanti and K. Tamvakis
Abstract: We extend existing treatments of black hole solutions in String Gravity to include moduli fields. We compute the external moduli and dilaton hair, as well as of their associated axions,to $O(\alpha')$ in the framework of the loop corrected superstring effective action for a Kerr-Newman black hole background.
