Title: On the Equivalence of the Maxwell-Chern-Simons Theory and a Self-Dual  Model
Authors: R. Banerjee and H. J. Rothe and K. D. Rothe
Abstract: We study the connection between the Green functions of the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory and a self-dual model by starting from the phase-space path integral representation of the Deser-Jackiw master Lagrangian. Their equivalence is established modulo time-ordering ambiguities.
