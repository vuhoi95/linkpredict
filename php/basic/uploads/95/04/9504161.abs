Title: S-DUALITY AND THE ENTROPY OF BLACK HOLES IN HETEROTIC STRING THEORY
Authors: Amit Ghosh and Jnanadeva Maharana
Abstract: Four dimensional heterotic string effective action is known to admit non-rotating electrically and magnetically charged black hole solutions. It is shown that the partition functions and entropies in both the cases are identical when these black hole solutions are related by S-duality transformations. The entropy is computed and is vanishing for each black hole in the extremal limit.
