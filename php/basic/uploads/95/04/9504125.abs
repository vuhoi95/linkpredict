Title: More about Path Integral for Spin
Authors: Kunio Funahashi and Taro Kashiwa and Shuji Nima and Seiji Sakoda
Abstract: Path integral for the $SU(2)$ spin system is reconsidered. We show that the Nielsen-Rohrlich(NR) formula is equivalent to the spin coherent state expression so that the phase space in the NR formalism is not topologically nontrivial. We also perform the WKB approximation in the NR formula and find that it gives the exact result.
