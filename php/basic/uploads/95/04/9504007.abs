Title: Strings and Multi-Strings in Black Hole and Cosmological Spacetimes
Authors: A. L. Larsen and N. SÃ¡nchez
Abstract: Recent results on classical and quantum strings in a variety of black hole and cosmological spacetimes, in various dimensions, are presented. The curved backgrounds under consideration include the $2+1$ black hole anti de Sitter spacetime and its dual, the black string, the ordinary $D\geq 4$ black holes with or without a cosmological constant, the de Sitter and anti de Sitter spacetimes and static Robertson-Walker spacetimes. Exact solutions to the string equations of motion and constraints are obtained in these backgrounds and their physical properties (length, energy, pressure) are described. The existence of {\it multi-string} solutions, describing finitely or infinitely many strings, is shown to be a general feature of spacetimes with a positive or negative cosmological constant. Furthermore, using a canonical quantization procedure, we find the string mass spectrum in de Sitter and anti de Sitter spacetimes. New features as compared to the string spectrum in flat Minkowski spacetime appear, for instance the {\it fine-structure effect} at all levels beyond the graviton in both de Sitter and anti de Sitter spacetimes, and the {\it non-existence} of a Hagedorn temperature in anti de Sitter spacetime. Finally, we consider the effect of spatial curvature on the string dynamics in Robertson-Walker spacetimes.
