Title: Doubling of Scattering Phase Shifts for Two Dimensional Strings
Authors: Antal Jevicki and Miao Li and Tamiaki Yoneya
Abstract: We discuss the origin of the leg factors appearing in 2D string theory. Computing in the world sheet framework we use the semiclassical method to study string amplitudes at high energy. We show that in the case of a simplest 2-point amplitude these factors correspond entirely to the time delay for reflection off the Liouville wall. Our semiclassical calculation reveals that the string longitudinal modes, although nonpropagating in 2D spacetime, have the effect of doubling the phase shift. Particular emphasis is put on comparison with the point particle (center of mass) case. A general method is then given for calculating an arbitrary amplitude semiclassically.
