Title: Semiclassical Stability of the Extreme Reissner-Nordstrom Black Hole
Authors: Paul R. Anderson and William A. Hiscock and Daniel J. Loranz
Abstract: The stress-energy tensor of a free quantized scalar field is calculated in the extreme Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole spacetime in the zero temperature vacuum state. The stress-energy appears to be regular on the event horizon, contrary to the suggestion provided by two-dimensional calculations. An analytic calculation on the event horizon for a thermal state shows that if the temperature is nonzero then the stress-energy diverges strongly there.
