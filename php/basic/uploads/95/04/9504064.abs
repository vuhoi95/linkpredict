Title: One-loop Quantum Corrections to the Entropy for an Extremal  Reissner-Nordstr√∂m Black Hole
Authors: G. Cognola and L. Vanzo and S. Zerbini
Abstract: The first quantum corrections to the entropy for an eternal 4-dimensional extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole is investigated at one-loop level, in the large mass limit of the black hole, making use of the conformal techniques related to the optical metric. A leading cubic horizon divergence is found and other divergences appear due to the singular nature of the optical manifold. The area law is shown to be violated.
