Title: Duality in the Type--II Superstring Effective Action
Authors: E. Bergshoeff and C. M. Hull and T. Ortin
Abstract: We derive the T-duality transformations that transform a general d=10 solution of the type-IIA string with one isometry to a solution of the type-IIB string with one isometry and vice versa. In contrast to other superstring theories, the T-duality transformations are not related to a non-compact symmetry of a d=9 supergravity theory. We also discuss S-duality in d=9 and d=10 and the relationship with eleven-dimensional supergravity theory. We apply these dualities to generate new solutions of the type IIA and type IIB superstrings and of eleven-dimensional supergravity.
