Title: 2D (4,4) Hypermultiplets
Authors: S. James Gates Jr. and Sergei V. Ketov
Abstract: The structure of on-shell and off-shell 2D, (4,4) supersymmetric scalar multiplets is investigated, in components and in superspace. We reach the surprising result that there exist eight {\underline {distinct}} on-shell versions and an even greater variety of off-shell ones. The off-shell generalised tensor and relaxed N = 4 multiplets are introduced in superspace, and their universal invariant self-interaction is constructed.
