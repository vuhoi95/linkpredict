Title: Static skyrmions in (2+1)-dimensions
Authors: R. J. Cova and W. J. Zakrzewski
Abstract: In the spirit of previous papers, but using more general field configurations, the non-linear O(3) model in (2+1)-D, modified by the addition of both a potential-like term and a Skyrme-like term, is considered. The instanton solutions are numerically evolved in time and some of their stability properties studied. They are found to be stable, and a repulsive force is seen to exist among them. These results, which are restricted to the case of zero speed systems, confirm those obtained in previous investigations, in which a similar problem was studied for a different choice of the potential-like term.
