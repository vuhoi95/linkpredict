Title: Scaling Behavior of Ricci Curvature at Short Distance near Two  Dimensions
Authors: Yoshihisa Kitazawa and Masao Ninomiya
Abstract: We study the renormalization of the Ricci curvature as an example of generally covariant operators in quantum gravity near two dimensions. We find that it scales with a definite scaling dimension at short distance. The Ricci curvature singularity at the big bang can be viewed as such a scaling phenomenon. The problem of the spacetime singularity may be resolved by the scale invariance of the spacetime at short distance.
