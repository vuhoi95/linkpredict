Title: On the Super-NLS Equation and its Relation with N=2 Super-KdV within  Coset Approach
Authors: S. Krivonos and A. Sorin and F. Toppan
Abstract: A manifestly $N=2$ supersymmetric coset formalism is introduced to describe integrable hierarchies. It is applied to analyze the super-NLS equation. It possesses an $N=2$ symmetry since it can be obtained from a manifest $N=2$ coset algebra construction. A remarkable result is here discussed: the existence of a B\"{a}cklund transformation which connects the super-NLS equation to the equations belonging to the integrable hierarchy of one particular (the $a=4$) $N=2$ super-KdV equation. $N=2$ scalar Lax pair operators are introduced for both super-KdV and super-NLS.
