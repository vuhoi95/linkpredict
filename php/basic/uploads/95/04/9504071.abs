Title: Extended Gauge Invariance in Geometrical Particle Models and the  Geometry of W-Symmetry
Authors: E. Ramos and J. Roca
Abstract: We prove that particle models whose action is given by the integrated $n$-th curvature function over the world line possess $n+1$ gauge invariances. A geometrical characterization of these symmetries is obtained via Frenet equations by rephrasing the $n$-th curvature model in $\reals^d$ in terms of a standard relativistic particle in $S^{d-n}$. We ``prove by example'' that the algebra of these infinitesimal gauge invariances is nothing but $\W_{n+2}$, thus providing a geometrical picture of the $\W$-symmetry for these models. As a spin-off of our approach we give a new global invariant for four-dimensional curves subject to a curvature constraint.
