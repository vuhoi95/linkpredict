Title: THERMAL EFFECTS ON THE CATALYSIS BY A MAGNETIC FIELD
Authors: Ashok Das and Marcelo Hott
Abstract: We show that the formation of condensates in the presence of a constant magnetic field in 2+1 dimensions is extremely unstable. It disappears as soon as a heat bath is introduced with or without a chemical potential. We point out some new nonanalytic behavior that develops in this system at finite temperature.
