Title: General dilatonic gravity with an asymptotically free gravitational  coupling constant near two dimensions
Authors: E. Elizalde and S. D. Odintsov
Abstract: We study a renormalizable, general theory of dilatonic gravity (with a kinetic-like term for the dilaton) interacting with scalar matter near two dimensions. The one-loop effective action and the beta functions for this general theory are written down. It is proven that the theory possesses a non-trivial ultraviolet fixed point which yields an asymptotically free gravitational coupling constant (at $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$) in this regime. Moreover, at the fixed point the theory can be cast under the form of a string-inspired model with free scalar matter. The renormalization of the Jackiw-Teitelboim model and of lineal gravity in $2+\epsilon$ dimensions is also discussed. We show that these two theories are distinguished at the quantum level. Finally, fermion-dilatonic gravity near two dimensions is considered.
