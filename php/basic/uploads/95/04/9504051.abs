Authors: I. Yu. Karataeva and S. L. Lyakhovich
Abstract: The regularization scheme is proposed for the constrained Hamiltonian formulation of the gauge fields coupled to the chiral or axial fermions. The Schwinger terms in the regularized operator first-class constraint algebra are shown to be consistent with the covariant divergence anomaly of the corresponding current. Regularized quantum master equations are studied, and the Schwinger terms are found out to break down both nilpotency of the BRST-charge and its conservation law. Wess-Zumino consistency conditions are studied for the BRST anomaly and they are shown to contradict to the covariant Schwinger terms in the BRST algebra.
