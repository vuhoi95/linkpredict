Title: BRST cohomology for 2D gravity
Authors: Paul A. Blaga and L. Tataru and Ion V. Vancea
Abstract: The BRST cohomology group in the space of local functionals of the fields for the two-dimensional conformally invariant gravity is calculated. All classical local actions (ghost number equal to zero) and all candidate anomalies are given and discussed for our model.
