Title: Variational Calculation of Effective Classical Potential at $T \neq 0$  to Higher Orders
Authors: H. Kleinert and H. Meyer
Abstract: Using the new variational approach proposed recently for a systematic improvement of the locally harmonic Feynman-Kleinert approximation to path integrals we calculate the partition function of the anharmonic oscillator for all temperatures and coupling strength with high accuracy.
