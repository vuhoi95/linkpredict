Title: Flows and Duality Symmetries in N=1 Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
Authors: O. Aharony and J. Sonnenschein and S. Yankielowicz
Abstract: We present more examples of dual N=1 SUSY gauge theories. This set of theories is connected by flows to both Seiberg's and Kutasov's dual theories. This provides a unifying picture of the various dual theories. We investigate the dual theories, their flat directions and mass perturbations.
