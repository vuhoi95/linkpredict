Title: Primordial Magnetic Fields From String Cosmology
Authors: M. GasperinI and M. Giovannini and G. Veneziano
Abstract: Sufficiently large seeds for generating the observed (inter)galactic magnetic fields emerge naturally in string cosmology from the amplification of electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations due to a dynamical dilaton background. The success of the mechanism depends crucially on two features of the so-called pre-big-bang scenario, an early epoch of dilaton-driven inflation at very small coupling, and a sufficiently long intermediate stringy era preceding the standard radiation-dominated evolution.
