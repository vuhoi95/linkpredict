Title: More Results in $N=1$ Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
Authors: S. Elitzur and A. Forge and A. Giveon and E. Rabinovici
Abstract: We present the exact effective superpotentials in $4d$, $N=1$ supersymmetric $SU(2)$ gauge theories with $N_3$ triplets and $N_2$ doublets of matter superfields. For the theories with a single triplet matter superfield we present the exact gauge couplings for arbitrary bare masses and Yukawa couplings.
