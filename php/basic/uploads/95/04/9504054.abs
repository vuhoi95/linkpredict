Abstract: We perform numerical simulations of the two and three-dimensional spin systems with competing interaction. They describe the model of random surfaces with linear-gonihedric action.The degeneracy of the vacuum state of this spin system is equal to $~~d \cdot 2^{N}~~$ for the lattice of the size $~N^{d}~$. We observe the second order phase transition of the three-dimensional system, at temperature $\beta_{c} \simeq 0.43932$ which almost coincides with $\beta_{c}$ of the 2D Ising model. This confirms the earlier analytical result for the case when self-interaction coupling constant $k$ is equal to zero. We suggest the full set of order parameters which characterize the structure of the vacuum states and of the phase transition.
