Title: Non-Abelian Monopoles on Four-Manifolds
Authors: J. M. F. Labastida and M. Mari√±o
Abstract: We present a non-abelian generalization of Witten monopole equations and we analyze the associated moduli problem, which can be regarded as a generalization of Donaldson theory. The moduli space of solutions for SU(2) monopoles on K\"ahler manifolds is discussed. We also construct, using the Mathai-Quillen formalism, the topological quantum field theory corresponding to the new moduli problem. This theory involves the coupling of topological Yang-Mills theory to topological matter in four dimensions
