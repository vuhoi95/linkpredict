Title: Dynamical Supersymmetry Breaking and the Linear Multiplet
Authors: P. Binetruy and M. K. Gaillard and T. R. Taylor
Abstract: We analyze gaugino condensation in the presence of a dilaton and an antisymmetric tensor field, with couplings reminiscent of string theories. The degrees of freedom relevant to a supersymmetric description of the effective theory below the scale of condensation are discussed in this context.
