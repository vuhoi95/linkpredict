Title: SPINON BASIS FOR (sl2^)_k INTEGRABLE HIGHEST WEIGHT MODULES AND NEW  CHARACTER FORMULAS
Authors: Peter Bouwknegt and Andreas W. W. Ludwig and Kareljan Schoutens
Abstract: In this note we review the spinon basis for the integrable highest weight modules of sl2^ at levels k\geq1, and give the corresponding character formula. We show that our spinon basis is intimately related to the basis proposed by Foda et al. in the principal gradation of the algebra. This gives rise to new identities for the q-dimensions of the integrable modules.
