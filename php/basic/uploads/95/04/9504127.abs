Title: Conformal Blocks for admissible representations in SL(2) current algebra
Authors: J. L. Petersen and J. Rasmussen and M. Yu
Abstract: We show how to deal with screening charges involving fractional powers of free fields. This enables us to use the free field Wakimoto construction to obtain complete expressions for integral representations of conformal blocks for N-point functions on the sphere, also in the case of non-integrable representations, in particular for admissible representations. We verify several formal properties including the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations. We discuss the fusion rules which result from our treatment, and compare with the literature.
