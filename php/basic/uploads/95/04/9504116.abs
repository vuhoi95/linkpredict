Title: The canonical connection in quantum mechanics
Authors: Peter Levay and David McMullan and Izumi Tsutsui
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the form of induced gauge fields that arises in two types of quantum systems. In the first we consider quantum mechanics on coset spaces G/H, and argue that G-invariance is central to the emergence of the H-connection as induced gauge fields in the different quantum sectors. We then demonstrate why the same connection, now giving rise to the non-abelian generalization of Berry's phase, can also be found in systems which have slow variables taking values in such a coset space.
