Title: Mass Spectra of Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theories in 1+1 Dimensions
Authors: Yoichiro Matsumura and Norisuke Sakai and Tadakatsu Sakai
Abstract: Physical mass spectra of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories in 1+1 dimensions are evaluated in the light-cone gauge with a compact spatial dimension. The supercharges are constructed and the infrared regularization is unambiguously prescribed for supercharges, instead of the light-cone Hamiltonian. This provides a manifestly supersymmetric infrared regularization for the discretized light-cone approach. By an exact diagonalization of the supercharge matrix between up to several hundred color singlet bound states, we find a rapidly increasing density of states as mass increases.
