Title: Theory of Events
Authors: Ph. Blanchard and A. Jadczyk
Abstract: We review what we call "event-enhanced formalism" of quantum theory. In this approach we explicitly assume classical nature of events. Given a quantum system, that is coupled to a classical one by a suitable coupling, classical events are being triggered. The trigerring process is partly random and partly deterministic. Within this new approach one can modelize real experimental events, including pointer readings of measuring devices. Our theory gives, for the first time, a unique algorithm that can be used for computer generation of experimental runs with individual quantum objects.
