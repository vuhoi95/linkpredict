Abstract: We quantize the Chern-Simons-Proca theory in three dimensions by using the Batalin-Tyutin Hamiltonian method, which systematically embeds second class constraint system into first class by introducing new fields in the extended phase space. As results, we obtain simultaneously the St\"uckelberg scalar term, which is needed to cancel the gauge anomaly due to the mass term, and the new type of Wess-Zumino action, which is irrelevant to the gauge symmetry. We also investigate the infrared property of the Chern-Simons-Proca theory by using the Batalin-Tyutin formalism comparing with the symplectic formalism. As a result, we observe that the resulting theory is precisely the gauge invariant Chern-Simons-Proca quantum mechanical version of this theory.
