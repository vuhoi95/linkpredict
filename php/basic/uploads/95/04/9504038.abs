Title: Exchange statistics in 1D: from the viewpoint of exact solution
Authors: Ilinski and G. V. Kalinin and V. S. Kapitonov
Abstract: We show that the exchange statistics have consequences in 1D systems with compact topology, contrary to the common opinion that exchange statistics is arbitrary in 1D. As examples of non-trivial statistical behavior we exactly calculate the partition function and correlators for systems of free q-particles on compactified chains using functional integral techniques and the supersymmetric trick. In particular we consider a spin 1/2 XY-chain with periodic boundary conditions that corresponds to the case of q=-1.
