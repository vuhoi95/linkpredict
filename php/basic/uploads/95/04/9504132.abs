Title: The BFV Approach for a Nonlocal Symmetry of QED
Authors: Silvio J. Rabello and Patricio Gaete
Abstract: In this paper we use the Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky formalism to study a recently proposed nonlocal symmetry of QED. In the BFV extended phase space we show that this symmetry stems from a canonical transformation in the ghost sector.
