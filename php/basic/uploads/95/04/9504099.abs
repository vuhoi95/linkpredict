Title: UNIVERSAL STRING AND SMALL $N=4$ SUPERSTRING
Authors: Nobuyoshi Ohta and Takashi Shimizu
Abstract: It was previously shown that most of the superstrings can be obtained from those with higher world-sheet supersymmetry as spontaneously broken phases. In this paper, we show that the small $N=4$ superstring, which was left out of this hierarchy of the universal string, can be obtained from the large $N=4$ strings. We also show that the $N=2$ string is a special vacuum of small $N=4$ string. Thus all the known superstring theories can be derived from a universal string by spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetry.
