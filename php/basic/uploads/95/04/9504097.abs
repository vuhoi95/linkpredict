Title: Loop calculations in quantum-mechanical non-linear sigma models
Authors: Jan de Boer and Bas Peeters and Kostas Skenderis and Peter van Nieuwenhuizen
Abstract: By carefully analyzing the relations between operator methods and the discretized and continuum path integral formulations of quantum-mechanical systems, we have found the correct Feynman rules for one-dimensional path integrals in curved spacetime. Although the prescription how to deal with the products of distributions that appear in the computation of Feynman diagrams in configuration space is surprising, this prescription follows unambiguously from the discretized path integral. We check our results by an explicit two-loop calculation.
