Title: Path Integrals with Generalized Grassmann Variables
Authors: M. Chaichian and A. P. Demichev
Abstract: We construct path integral representations for the evolution operator of q-oscillators with root of unity values of q-parameter using Bargmann-Fock representations with commuting and non-commuting variables, the differential calculi being q-deformed in both cases. For $q^2=-1$ we obtain a new form of Grassmann-like path integral.
