Title: kappa-deformed realisation of D=4 conformal algebra
Authors: Malgorzata Klimek and Jerzy Lukierski
Abstract: We describe the generators of kappa-conformal transformations, leaving invariant the kappa-deformed d'Alembert equation. In such a way one obtains the conformal extension of the off-shell spin zero realization of kappa-deformed Poincare algebra. Finally the algebraic structure of kappa-deformed conformal algebra is discussed.
