Title: Black Holes in Two Dimensional Dilaton Gravity and Nonlinear  Klein-Gordon Soliton
Authors: Hyeon-Min Johng and Hak-Soo Shin and Kwang-Sup Soh
Abstract: Two-dimensional dilaton gravity coupled to a Klein-Gordon matter field with a quartic interaction term is considered. The theory has a classical solution which exhibits black hole formation by a soliton. The geometry of black hole induced by a soliton is investigated.
