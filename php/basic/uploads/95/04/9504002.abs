Title: $V_{(1,1)}^{(t)}$-PERTURBED MODELS OF CFT AND THEIR QUANTUM GROUP  SYMMETRY
Authors: S. A. APIKYAN and C. J. EFTHIMIOU
Abstract: We propose a new massive integrable model in quantum field theory. This model is obtained as a perturbed model of the minimal conformal field theories on the hyper-elliptic surfaces by a particular relavant operator $V_{(1,1)}^{(t)}$. The non-local conserved charges of the model and their $q$-deformed algebra are also constructed explicitly.
