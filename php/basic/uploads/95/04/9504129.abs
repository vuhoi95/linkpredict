Title: Moduli Dependence of One--Loop Gauge Couplings in (0,2)  Compactifications
Authors: P. Mayr and S. Stieberger
Abstract: We derive the moduli dependence of the one--loop gauge couplings for non--vanishing gauge background fields in a four--dimensional heterotic (0,2) string compactification. Remarkably, these functions turn out to have a representation as modular functions on an auxiliary Riemann surface on appropriate truncations of the full moduli space. In particular, a certain kind of one--loop functions is given by the free energy of two--dimensional solitons on this surface.
