Title: The beta functions of a scalar theory coupled to gravity
Authors: L. Griguolo and R. Percacci
Abstract: We study a scalar field theory coupled to gravity on a flat background, below Planck's energy. Einstein's theory is treated as an effective field theory. Within the context of Wilson's renormalization group, we compute gravitational corrections to the beta functions and the anomalous dimension of the scalar field, taking into account threshold effects.
