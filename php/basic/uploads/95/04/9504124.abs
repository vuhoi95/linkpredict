Title: Supersymmetric sigma models and the 't Hooft instantons
Authors: A. Galperin and E. Sokatchev
Abstract: Witten's linear sigma model for ADHM instantons possesses a natural $(0,4)$ supersymmetry. We study generalizations of the infrared limit of the model that are invariant under $(4,4)$ supersymmetry. In the case of four space-time dimensions a background with a conformally flat metric and torsion is required. The geometry is specified by a single real scalar function satisfying Laplace's equation. It gives rise to 't Hooft instantons for the gauge group $SU(2)$, instead of the general ADHM instantons for an $SO(n)$ gauge group in the case $(0,4)$.
