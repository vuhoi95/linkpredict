Title: Conserved Monodromy RTT=TTR Algebra in the Quantum Self-Dual Yang-Mills  System
Authors: Ling-Lie Chau and Itaru Yamanaka
Abstract: We find a conserved monodromy matrix differential operator T in the quantum Self-Dual Yang-Mills (SDYM) system and show that it satisfies the exchange algebra RTT=TTR. From its two infinitesimal forms, we obtain the infinite conserved quantum nonlocal-charge algebras and the infinite conserved Yangian algebras. It is remarkable that such conserved algebras exist in a four-dimensional nontrivial quantum field theory with interactions.
