Title: Bethe--Salpeter equation in QCD
Authors: N. Brambilla and E. Montaldi and G. M. Prosperi
Abstract: We extend to regular QCD the derivation of a confining $ q \bar{q}$ Bethe--Salpeter equation previously given for the simplest model of scalar QCD in which quarks are treated as spinless particles. We start from the same assumptions on the Wilson loop integral already adopted in the derivation of a semirelativistic heavy quark potential. We show that, by standard approximations, an effective meson squared mass operator can be obtained from our BS kernel and that, from this, by ${1\over m^2}$ expansion the corresponding Wilson loop potential can be reobtained, spin--dependent and velocity--dependent terms included. We also show that, on the contrary, neglecting spin--dependent terms, relativistic flux tube model is reproduced.
