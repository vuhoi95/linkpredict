Title: BRST cohomology in Beltrami parametrization
Authors: L. Tataru and Ion V. Vancea
Abstract: We study the BRST cohomology within a local conformal Lagrangian field theory model built on a two dimensional Riemann surface with no boundary. We deal with the case of the complex structure parametrized by Beltrami differential and the scalar matter fields. The computation of {\em all} elements of the BRST cohomology is given.
