Title: Algebraic Renormalization of $N=2$ Supersymmetric Yang-Mills  Chern-Simons Theory in the Wess-Zumino Gauge
Authors: Nicola Maggiore and Olivier Piguet and Mathieu Ribordy
Abstract: We consider a N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons model, coupled to matter, in the Wess-Zumino gauge. The theory is characterized by a superalgebra which displays two kinds of obstructions to the closure on the translations: field dependent gauge transformations, which give rise to an infinite algebra, and equations of motion. The aim is to put the formalism in a closed form, off-shell, without introducing auxiliary fields. In order to perform that, we collect all the symmetries of the model into a unique nilpotent Slavnov-Taylor operator. Furthermore, we prove the renormalizability of the model through the analysis of the cohomology arising from the generalized Slavnov-Taylor operator. In particular, we show that the model is free of anomaly.
