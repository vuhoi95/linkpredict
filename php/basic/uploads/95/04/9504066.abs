Title: BATALIN-FRADKIN-TYUTIN EMBEDDING OF A SELF-DUAL MODEL AND THE  MAXWELL-CHERN-SIMONS THEORY
Authors: R. Banerjee and Heinz J. Rothe
Abstract: We convert the self-dual model of Townsend, Pilch, and Nieuwenhuizen to a first-class system using the generalized canonical formalism of Batalin, Fradkin, and Tyutin and show that gauge-invariant fields in the embedded model can be identified with observables in the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory as well as with the fundamental fields of the self-dual model. We construct the phase-space partition function of the embedded model and demonstrate how a basic set of gauge-variant fields can play the role of either the vector potentials in the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory or the fundamental fields of the self-dual model by appropriate choices of gauge.
