Title: The gauge invariant lagrangian for Seiberg-Witten topological monopoles
Authors: R. Gianvittorio and I. Martin and A. Restuccia
Abstract: A topological gauge invariant lagrangian for Seiberg-Witten monopole equations is constructed. The action is invariant under a huge class of gauge transformations which after BRST fixing leads to the BRST invariant action associated to Seiberg-Witten monopole topological theory. The supersymmetric transformation of the fields involved in the construction is obtained from the nilpotent BRST algebra.
