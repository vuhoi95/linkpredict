Title: DYNAMICAL SUPERSYMMETRY
Authors: Ashok Das and Marcelo Hott
Abstract: We show, in a simple quantum mechanical model, how a theory can become supersymmetric in the presence of interactions even when the free theory is not. This dynamical generation of supersymmetry relaxes the condition on the equality of masses of the superpartners which would be of phenomenological interest.
