Title: On Abelianization of First Class Constraints
Authors: S. A. Gogilidze and A. M. Khvedelidze and V. N. Pervushin
Abstract: The systematic method for the conversion of first class constraints to the equivalent set of Abelian one based on the Dirac equivalence transformation is developed. The representation for the corresponding matrix performing this transformation is proposed. This representation allows one to lead the problem of abelianization to the solution of a certain system of first order {\it linear } differential equations for matrix elements .
