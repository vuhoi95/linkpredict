Title: New boundary conditions for integrable lattices
Authors: V. B. Kuznetsov and M. F. Jorgensen and P. L. Christiansen
Abstract: New boundary conditions for integrable nonlinear lattices of the XXX type, such as the Heisenberg chain and the Toda lattice are presented. These integrable extensions are formulated in terms of a generic XXX Heisenberg magnet interacting with two additional spins at each end of the chain. The construction uses the most general rank 1 ansatz for the 2x2 L-operator satisfying the reflection equation algebra with rational r-matrix. The associated quadratic algebra is shown to be the one of dynamical symmetry for the A1 and BC2 Calogero-Moser problems. Other physical realizations of our quadratic algebra are also considered.
