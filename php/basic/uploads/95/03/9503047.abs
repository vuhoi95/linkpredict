Title: A Rigorous Analysis of the Superconducting Phase of an Electron - Phonon  System
Authors: Joel Feldman and Jacques Magnen and Vincent Rivasseau and Eugene Trubowitz
Abstract: In these notes we give a very rough sketch of nonperturbative methods of many body quantum field theory that are powerful enough to rigorously control weak coupling instabilities in condensed matter phyics, for example, the Cooper instability in an electron - phonon system.
