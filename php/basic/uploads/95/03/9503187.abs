Title: Gauge Independent Trace Anomaly for Gravitons
Authors: H. T. Cho and R. Kantowski
Abstract: We show that the trace anomaly for gravitons calculated using the usual effective action formalism depends on the choice of gauge when the background spacetime is not a solution of the classical equation of motion, that is, when off-shell. We then use the gauge independent Vilkovisky-DeWitt effective action to restore gauge independence to the off-shell case. Additionally we explicitly evaluate trace anomalies for some N-sphere background spacetimes.
