Title: GEOMETRICAL STRING and DUAL SPIN SYSTEMS
Authors: G. K. Savvidy and K. G. Savvidy and F. J. Wegner
Abstract: We are able to perform the duality transformation of the spin system which was found before as a lattice realization of the string with linear action. In four and higher dimensions this spin system can be described in terms of a two-plaquette gauge Hamiltonian. The duality transformation is constructed in geometrical and algebraic language. The dual Hamiltonian represents a new type of spin system with local gauge invariance. At each vertex $\xi$ there are $d(d-1)/2$ Ising spins $\Lambda_{\mu,\nu}= \Lambda_{\nu,\mu}$, $\mu \neq \nu = 1,..,d$ and one Ising spin $\Gamma$ on every link $(\xi,\xi +e_{\mu})$. For the frozen spin $\Gamma \equiv 1$ the dual Hamiltonian factorizes into $d(d-1)/2$ two-dimensional Ising ferromagnets and into antiferromagnets in the case $\Gamma \equiv -1$. For fluctuating $\Gamma$ it is a sort of spin glass system with local gauge invariance. The generalization to $p$-branes is given.
