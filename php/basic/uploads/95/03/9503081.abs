Title: Addendum to Supersymmetric Dyonic Black Holes in Kaluza-Klein Theory
Authors: Mirjam Cvetiƒç and Donam Youm
Abstract: We complete the study of 4-dimensional (4-d), static, spherically symmetric, supersymmetric black holes (BH's) in Abelian $(4+n)$-d Kaluza-Klein theory, by showing that for such solutions $n$ electric charges $\vec{\cal Q} \equiv (Q_1,...,Q_n)$ and $n$ magnetic charges $\vec{\cal P} \equiv (P_1,...,P_n)$ are subject to the constraint $\vec{\cal P}\cdot \vec{\cal Q}=0$. All such solutions can be obtained by performing the SO(n) rotations, which do not affect the 4-d space-time metric and the volume of the internal space, on the supersymmetric $U(1)_M\times U(1)_E$ BH's, {\it i.e.}, supersymmetric BH's with a diagonal internal metric.
