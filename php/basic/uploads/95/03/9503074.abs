Title: New Action Principle for Classical Particle Trajectories in Spaces with  Torsion
Authors: P. Fiziev and H. Kleinert
Abstract: To comply with recent developments of path integrals in spaces with curvature and torsion we find the correct variational principle for the classical trajectories. Although the action depends only on the length, the trajectories are {\em autoparallels} rather than geodesics due to the effects of a new torsion force.
