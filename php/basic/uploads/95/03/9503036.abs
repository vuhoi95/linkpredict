Title: Holomorphic Yang-Mills Theory and Variation of the Donaldson Invariants
Authors: Seungjoon Hyun and Jae-Suk Park
Abstract: We study the path integrals of the holomorphic Yang-Mills theory on compact K\"{a}hler surface with $b_2^+ = 1$. Based on the results, we examine the correlation functions of the topological Yang-Mills theory and the corresponding Donaldson invariants as well as their transition formulas.
