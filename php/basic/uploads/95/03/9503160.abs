Title: Anyons beyond the plane
Authors: Edouard Gorbar and Stefan Mashkevich and Sergei Sharapov
Abstract: We consider particles in three-dimensional space, which have a certain probability to find themselves in a thin layer (``plane''), where they are assumed to be well described by a planar Hamiltonian and are subject to Aharonov-Bohm-type interaction. We demonstrate that their planar motion is then anyonlike, with the ``effective statistical parameter'' proportional essentially to the square of the probability. We also show that charge-flux composites with solenoids of finite length, provided they are themselves fermions, can form a bound state in which they behave like anyons, without any external potential confining them to a plane.
