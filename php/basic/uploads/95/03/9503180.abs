Title: Unification of Gravity and Yang-Mills-Higgs Gauge Theories
Authors: T. Ackermann and J. Tolksdorf
Abstract: In this letter we show how the action functional of the standard model and of gravity can be derived from a specific Dirac operator. Far from being exotic this particular Dirac operator turns out to be structurally determined by the Yukawa coupling term. The main feature of our approach is that it naturally unifies the action of the standard model with gravity.
