Title: Free Field Realization of $WBC_{n}$ and $WG_{2}$ algebras
Authors: Katsushi Ito and Seiji Terashima
Abstract: We study the BRST-cohomology in the quantum hamiltonian reduction of affine Lie algebras of non-simply laced type. We obtain the free field realization of the $W{\bf g}$-algebra for $\bg=B_{2}$, $B_{3}$, $C_{3}$ and $G_{2}$. The $WC_{3}$ algebra is shown to be equal to the $WB_{3}$ algebra at the quantum level by duality transformation.
