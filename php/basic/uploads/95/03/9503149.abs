Title: String Theory and Inflation
Authors: Thibault Damour and Alexander Vilenkin
Abstract: String theory abounds with light scalar fields (the dilaton and various moduli) which create a host of observational problems, and notably some serious cosmological difficulties similar to the ones associated with the Polonyi field in the earliest versions of spontaneously broken supergravity. We show that all these problems are naturally avoided if a recently introduced mechanism for fixing the vacuum expectation values of the dilaton and/or moduli is at work. We study both the classical evolution and the quantum fluctuations of such scalar fields during a primordial inflationary era and find that the results are naturally compatible with observational facts. In this model, dilatons or moduli within a very wide range of masses (which includes the SUSY-breaking favored 1 TeV value and extends up to the Planck scale) qualify to define a novel type of essentially stable ultra-weakly interacting massive particles able to provide enough mass density to close the universe
