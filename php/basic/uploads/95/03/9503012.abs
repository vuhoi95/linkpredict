Title: Relation between energy shifts and relaxation rates for a small system  coupled to a reservoir
Authors: Juergen Audretsch and Rainer Mueller and Markus Holzmann
Abstract: For a small system the coupling to a reservoir causes energy shifts as well as transitions between the system's energy levels. We show for a general stationary situation that the energy shifts can essentially be reduced to the relaxation rates. The effects of reservoir fluctuations and self reaction are treated separately. We apply the results to a two-level atom coupled to a reservoir which may be the vacuum of a radiation field.
