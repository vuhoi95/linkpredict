Title: Ambiguity of the one-loop calculations in a nonrenormalizable quantum  gravity.
Authors: M. Yu. Kalmykov and P. I. Pronin
Abstract: The ambiguity in the calculations of one-loop counterterms by the background field method in nonrenormalizable theories of gravity is discussed. Some examples of such ambiguous calculations are given. The non-equivalence of the first and second order formalism in the quantum gravity is shown.
