Title: BLACK HOLES IN THREE-DIMENSIONAL DILATON GRAVITY THEORIES
Authors: Paulo M. Sa' and Antares Kleber and Jose' P. S. Lemos
Abstract: Three dimensional black holes in a generalized dilaton gravity action theory are analysed. The theory is specified by two fields, the dilaton and the graviton, and two parameters, the cosmological constant and the Brans-Dicke parameter. It contains seven different cases, of which one distinguishes as special cases, string theory, general relativity and a theory equivalent to four dimensional general relativity with one Killing vector. We study the causal structure and geodesic motion of null and timelike particles in the black hole geometries and find the ADM masses of the different solutions.
