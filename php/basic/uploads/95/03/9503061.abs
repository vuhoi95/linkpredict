Title: Spinor vortices in non-relativistic Chern-Simons theory
Authors: C. Duval and P. A. Horv√°thy and L. Palla
Abstract: The non-relativistic `Dirac' equation of L\'evy-Leblond is used to describe a spin {\small 1/2} particle interacting with a Chern-Simons gauge field. Static, purely magnetic, self-dual spinor vortices are constructed. The solution can be `exported' to a uniform magnetic background field.
