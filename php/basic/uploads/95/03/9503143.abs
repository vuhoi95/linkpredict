Title: The Conformal Points of the Generalized Thirring Model II
Authors: Korkut Bardakci and Luis M. Bernardo
Abstract: In the large N limit, conditions for the conformal invariance of the generalized Thirring model are derived, using two different approaches: the background field method and the Hamiltonian method based on an operator algebra, and the agreement between them is established. A free field representation of the relevant algebra is presented, and the structure of the stress tensor in terms of free fields (and free currents) is studied in detail.
