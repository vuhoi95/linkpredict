Title: High Temperature Phase Transition in Two-Scalar Theories
Authors: S. Bornholdt and N. Tetradis and C. Wetterich
Abstract: Two-scalar theories at high temperature exhibit a rich spectrum of possible critical behaviour, with a second or first order phase transition. In the vicinity of the critical temperature one can observe critical exponents, tricritical points and crossover behaviour. None of these phenomena are visible to high temperature perturbation theory.
