Title: W$(2,4)$, Linear and Non-local \W-Algebras in Sp(4) Particle Model
Authors: J. Gomis and J. Herrero and K. Kamimura
Abstract: We comment on relations between the linear W_{2,4}^{linear} algebra and non-linear W(2,4)$ algebra appearing in a Sp(4) particle mechanics model by using Lax equations. The appearance of the non-local V_{2,2} algebra is also studied.
