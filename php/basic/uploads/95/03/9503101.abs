Title: Canonical quantization of non-local field equations
Authors: D. G. Barci and L. E. Oxman and M. Rocca
Abstract: We consistently quantize a class of relativistic non-local field equations characterized by a non-local kinetic term in the lagrangian. We solve the classical non-local equations of motion for a scalar field and evaluate the on-shell hamiltonian. The quantization is realized by imposing Heisenberg's equation which leads to the commutator algebra obeyed by the Fourier components of the field. We show that the field operator carries, in general, a reducible representation of the Poincare group. We also consider the Gupta-Bleuler quantization of a non-local gauge field and analyze the propagators and the physical states of the theory.
