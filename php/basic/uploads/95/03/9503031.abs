Title: $N$-point amplitudes for d=2 c=1 Discrete States from String Field  Theory
Authors: I. Ya. Aref'eva and P. B. Medvedev and A. P. Zubarev
Abstract: Starting from string field theory for 2d gravity coupled to c=1 matter we analyze N-point off-shell tree amplitudes of discrete states. The amplitudes exhibit the pole structure and we use the oscillator representation to extract the residues. The residues are generated by a simple effective action. We show that the effective action can be directly deduced from a string field action in a special transversal-like gauge.
