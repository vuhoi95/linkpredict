Title: Scaling in four dimensional quantum gravity
Authors: Jan Ambjorn and Jerzy Jurkiewicz
Abstract: We discuss scaling relations in four dimensional simplicial quantum gravity. Using numerical results obtained with a new algorithm called ``baby universe surgery'' we study the critical region of the theory. The position of the phase transition is given with high accuracy and some critical exponents are measured. Their values prove that the transition is continuous. We discuss the properties of two distinct phases of the theory. For large values of the bare gravitational coupling constant the internal Hausdorff dimension is {\em two} (the elongated phase), and the continuum theory is that of so called branched polymers. For small values of the bare gravitational coupling constant the internal Hausdorff dimension seems to be {\em infinite} (the crumpled phase). We conjecture that this phase corresponds to a theory of topological gravity. {\em At} the transition point the Hausdorff dimension might be finite and larger than two. This transition point is a potential candidate for a non-perturbative theory of quantum gravity.
