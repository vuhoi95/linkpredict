Title: Composite Gauge fields and Broken Symmetries
Authors: B. S. Balakrishna and K. T. Mahanthappa
Abstract: A generalization of the non-Abelian version of the $CP^{N-1}$ models (also known as Grassmannian models) is presented. The generalization helps accommodate a partial breaking of the non-Abelian gauge symmetry. Constituents of the composite gauge fields, in many cases, are naturally constrained to belong to an anomaly free representation which in turn generates a composite scalar simulating Higgs mechanism to break the gauge symmetry dynamically for large $N$. Two cases are studied in detail: one based on the SU(2) gauge group and the other on SO(10). Breakings such as SU(2)$\to$U(1) or SO(10)$\to$SU(5)$\times$U(1) are found feasible. Properties of the composites fields and gauge boson masses are computed by doing a derivative expansion of the large $N$ effective action.
