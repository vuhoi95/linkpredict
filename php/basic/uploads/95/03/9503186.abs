Title: Exact Results in Softly Broken Supersymmetric Models
Authors: Nick Evans and Stephen D. H. Hsu and Myckola Schwetz
Abstract: We show how recent exact results in supersymmetric theories can be extended to models which include {\it explicit} soft supersymmetry breaking terms. We thus derive new exact results for non-supersymmetric models.
