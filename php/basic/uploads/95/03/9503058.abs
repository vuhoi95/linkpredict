Title: Radiative energy shifts of accelerated atoms
Authors: Juergen Audretsch and Rainer Mueller
Abstract: We consider the influence of acceleration on the radiative energy shifts of atoms in Minkowski space. We study a two-level atom coupled to a scalar quantum field. Using a Heisenberg picture approach, we are able to separate the contributions of vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction to the Lamb shift of the two-level atom. The resulting energy shifts for the special case of a uniformly accelerated atom are then compared with those of an atom at rest.
