Title: Lie algebra cohomology and group structure of gauge theories
Authors: Hyun Seok Yang and Bum-Hoon Lee
Abstract: We explicitly construct the adjoint operator of coboundary operator and obtain the Hodge decomposition theorem and the Poincar\'e duality for the Lie algebra cohomology of the infinite-dimensional gauge transformation group. We show that the adjoint of the coboundary operator can be identified with the BRST adjoint generator $Q^{\dagger}$ for the Lie algebra cohomology induced by BRST generator $Q$. We also point out an interesting duality relation - Poincar\'e duality - with respect to gauge anomalies and Wess-Zumino-Witten topological terms. We consider the consistent embedding of the BRST adjoint generator $Q^{\dagger}$ into the relativistic phase space and identify the noncovariant symmetry recently discovered in QED with the BRST adjoint N\"other charge $Q^{\dagger}$.
