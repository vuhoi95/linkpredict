Title: One-loop effective action for Einstein gravity in special background  gauge
Authors: P. M. Lavrov and A. A. Reshetnyak
Abstract: The one-loop effective action for Einstein gravity in a special one-parameter background gauge is calculated up to first order in a gauge parameter. It is shown that the effective action does not depend upon the gauge parameter on shell.
