Title: Properties of the Scale Invariant $O(g^4)$ Lipatov Kernel
Authors: Claudio Coriano' and Alan R. White
Abstract: We study the scale-invariant $O(g^4)$ kernel which appears as an infra-red contribution in the BFKL evolution equation and is constructed via multiparticle $t$-channel unitarity. We detail the variety of Ward identity constraints and infra-red cancellations that characterize its infrared behaviour. We give an analytic form for the full non-forward kernel. For the forward kernel controlling parton evolution at small-x, we give an impact parameter representation, derive the eigenvalue spectrum, and demonstrate a holomorphic factorisation property related to conformal invariance. The results show that, at next-to-leading-order, the transverse momentum infra-red region may produce a strong reduction of the BFKL small-x behavior.
