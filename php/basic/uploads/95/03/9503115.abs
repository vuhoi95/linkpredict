Title: INSTANTON CALCULATIONS VERSUS EXACT RESULTS IN 4 DIMENSIONAL SUSY GAUGE  THEORIES.
Authors: D. Finnell and P. Pouliot
Abstract: We relate the non-perturbative exact results in supersymmetry to perturbation theory using several different methods: instanton calculations at weak or strong coupling, a method using gaugino condensation and another method relating strong and weak coupling. This allows many precise numerical checks of the consistency of these methods, especially the amplitude of instanton effects, and of the network of exact solutions in supersymmetry. However, there remain difficulties with the instanton computations at strong coupling.
