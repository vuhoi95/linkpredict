Title: All the Four Dimensional Static, Spherically Symmetric Solutions of  Abelian Kaluza-Klein Theory
Authors: Mirjam Cvetic and Donam Youm
Abstract: We present the explicit form for all the four dimensional, static, spherically symmetric solutions in $(4+n)$-d Abelian Kaluza-Klein theory by performing a subset of $SO(2,n)$ transformations corresponding to four $SO(1,1)$ boosts on the Schwarzschild solution, supplemented by $SO(n)/SO(n-2)$ transformations. The solutions are parameterized by the mass $M$, Taub-Nut charge $a$, $n$ electric $\vec{\cal Q}$ and $n$ magnetic $\vec{\cal P}$ charges. Non-extreme black holes (with zero Taub-NUT charge) have either the Reissner-Nordstr\" om or Schwarzschild global space-time. Supersymmetric extreme black holes have a null or naked singularity, while non-supersymmetric extreme ones have a global space-time of extreme Reissner-Nordstr\" om black holes.
