Title: EFFICIENT ANALYTIC COMPUTATION OF HIGHER-ORDER QCD AMPLITUDES
Authors: Z. Bern and G. Chalmers and L. Dixon and D. C. Dunbar and D. A. Kosower
Abstract: We review techniques simplifying the analytic calculation of one-loop QCD amplitudes with many external legs, for use in next-to-leading-order corrections to multi-jet processes. Particularly useful are the constraints imposed by perturbative unitarity, collinear singularities and a supersymmetry-inspired organization of helicity amplitudes. Certain sequences of one-loop helicity amplitudes with an arbitrary number of external gluons have been obtained using these constraints.
