Title: DIAGRAMMATIC ANALYSIS OF QCD GAUGE TRANSFORMATIONS AND GAUGE  CANCELLATIONS
Authors: Y. J. Feng and C. S. Lam
Abstract: Diagrammatic techniques are invented to implement QCD gauge transformations. These techniques can be used to discover how gauge-dependent terms are cancelled among diagrams to yield gauge-invariant results in the sum. In this way a multiloop pinching technique can be developed to change ordinary vertices into background-gauge vertices. The techniques can also be used to design new gauges to simplify calculations by reducing the number of gauge-dependent terms present in the intermediate steps. Two examples are discussed to illustrate this aspect of the applications.
