Title: The Bogomol'nyi Bound of Lee-Weinberg Magnetic Monopoles
Authors: Choonkyu Lee and Piljin Yi
Abstract: The Lee-Weinberg $U(1)$ magnetic monopoles, which have been reinterpreted as topological solitons of a certain non-Abelian gauged Higgs model recently, are considered for some specific choice of Higgs couplings. The model under consideration is shown to admit a Bogomol'nyi-type bound which is saturated by the configurations satisfying the generalized BPS equations. We consider the spherically symmetric monopole solutions in some detail.
