Title: On third Poisson structure of KdV equation
Authors: A. Gorsky and A. Marshakov and A. Orlov and V. Rubtsov
Abstract: The third Poisson structure of KdV equation in terms of canonical ``free fields'' and reduced WZNW model is discussed. We prove that it is ``diagonalized'' in the Lagrange variables which were used before in formulation of 2D gravity. We propose a quantum path integral for KdV equation based on this representation.
