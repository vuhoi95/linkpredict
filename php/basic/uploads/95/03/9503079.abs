Title: Exact S-Matrices with Affine Quantum Group Symmetry
Authors: Gustav W. Delius and King's College and London
Abstract: We show how to construct the exact factorized S-matrices of 1+1 dimensional quantum field theories whose symmetry charges generate a quantum affine algebra. Quantum affine Toda theories are examples of such theories. We take into account that the Lorentz spins of the symmetry charges determine the gradation of the quantum affine algebras. This gives the S-matrices a non-rigid pole structure. It depends on a kind of ``quantum'' dual Coxeter number which will therefore also determine the quantum mass ratios in these theories. As an example we explicitly construct S-matrices with $U_q(c_n^{(1)})$ symmetry.
