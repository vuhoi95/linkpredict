Title: An Octonionic Gauge Theory
Authors: C. C. Lassig and G. C. Joshi
Abstract: The nonassociativity of the octonion algebra necessitates a bimodule representation, in which each element is represented by a left and a right multiplier. This representation can then be used to generate gauge transformations for the purpose of constructing a field theory symmetric under a gauged octonion algebra, the nonassociativity of which appears as a failure of the representation to close, and hence produces new interactions in the gauge field kinetic term of the symmetric Lagrangian.
