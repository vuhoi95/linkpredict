Title: Multidimensional Classical and Quantum Cosmology with Perfect Fluid
Authors: V. D. Ivashchuk and V. N. Melnikov
Abstract: A cosmological model describing the evolution of n Ricci-flat spaces (n>1) in the presence of 1-component perfect-fluid and minimally coupled scalar field is considered. When the pressures in all spaces are proportional to the density, the Einstein and Wheeler-DeWitt equations are integrated for a large variety of parameters. Classical and quantum wormhole solutions are obtained for negative density. Some special classes of solutions, e.g. solutions with spontaneous and dynamical compactification, exponential and power-law inflations, are singled out. For positive density a third quantized cosmological model is considered and the Planckian spectrum of ``created universes'' is obtained.
