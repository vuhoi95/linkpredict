Title: What's Wrong with Pauli-Villars Regularization in $QED_{3}$ ?
Authors: B. M. Pimentel and J. L. Tomazelli
Abstract: In this letter we argue that there is no ambiguity between the Pauli-Villars and other methods of regularization in (2+1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics with respect to dynamical mass generation, provided we properly choose the couplings for the regulators.
