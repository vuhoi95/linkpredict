Title: Comparison of the Pade Approximation Method to Perturbative QCD  Calculations
Authors: Mark A. Samuel and John Ellis and Marek Karliner
Abstract: We present a method of estimating perturbative coefficients in Quantum Field Theory using Pade Approximants. We test this method on various known QCD results, and find that the method works very well.
