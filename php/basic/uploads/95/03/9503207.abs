Title: Planar Duality in $SU(2)$ WZW Models
Authors: G. Pradisi and A. Sagnotti and Ya. S. Stanev
Abstract: We show how to generalize the $SU(2)$ WZW models to allow for open and unoriented sectors. The construction exhibits some novel patterns of Chan-Paton charge assignments and projected spectra that reflect the underlying current algebra.
