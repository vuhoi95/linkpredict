Title: Self-avoiding Tethered Membranes at the Tricritical Point
Authors: K. J. Wiese and F. David
Abstract: The scaling properties of self-avoiding tethered membranes at the tricritical point (theta-point) are studied by perturbative renormalization group methods. To treat the 3-body repulsive interaction (known to be relevant for polymers), new analytical and numerical tools are developped and applied to 1-loop calculations. These technics are a prerequisite to higher order calculations for self-avoiding membranes. The cross-over between the 3-body interaction and the modified 2-body interaction, attractive at long range, is studied through a new double epsilon-expansion. It is shown that the latter interaction is relevant for 2-dimensional membranes at the theta-point.
