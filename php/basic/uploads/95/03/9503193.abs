Title: Gauge Properties of Conserved Currents in Abelian Versus Nonabelian  Theories
Authors: S. Deser and M. Henneaux
Abstract: We clarify the physical origin of the difference between gauge properties of conserved currents in abelian and nonabelian theories. In the latter, but not in the former, such currents can always be written on shell as gauge invariants modulo identically conserved, superpotential, terms. For the ``isotopic" vector and the stress tensor currents of spins 1 and 2 respectively, we explain this difference by the fact that the non-abelian theories are just the self-coupled versions of the abelian ones using these currents as sources. More precisely, we indicate how the self-coupling turns the non-invariantizable abelian conserved currents into (on-shell) superpotentials. The fate of other conserved currents is also discussed.
