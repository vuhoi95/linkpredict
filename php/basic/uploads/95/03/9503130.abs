Title: HIGH TEMPERATURE EXPANSION OF STRING FREE ENERGY IN HYPERBOLIC SPACE
Authors: A. A. Btysenko and S. D. Odintsov and S. Zerbini
Abstract: The high temperature behaviour of the open bosonic string free energy in the space $S^1 \otimes H^N$ with vanishingly small curvature is investigated. The leading term of the high temperature expansion of the one-loop free energy, near the Hagedorn instability, is obtained. The problem of infrared regularization of thermodynamical quantities is pointed out. For minimally coupling quantum fields related to the normal modes of strings, the results are similar to the ones valid for Rindler space. In the lower mass string states regime a connection with the quantum corrections to the black hole entropy is outlined.
