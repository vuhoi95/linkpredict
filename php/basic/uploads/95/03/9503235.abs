Title: Loop scattering in two-dimensional QCD
Authors: E. Abdalla and M. C. B. Abdalla
Abstract: Using the integrability conditions that we recently obtained in QCD$_2$ with massless fermions, we arrive at a sufficient number of conservation laws to be able to fix the scattering amplitudes involving a local version of the Wilson loop operator.
