Title: Boundary Sine-Gordon Interactions at the Free Fermion Point
Authors: M. Ameduri and R. Konik and A. LeClair
Abstract: We study bosonization of the sine-Gordon theory in the presence of boundary interactions at the free fermion point. In this way we obtain the boundary S-matrix as a function of physical parameters in the boundary sine-Gordon Lagrangian. The boundary S-matrix can be matched onto the solution of Ghoshal and Zamolodchikov, thereby relating the formal parameters in the latter solution to the physical parameters in the lagrangian.
