Title: On the entropy bound of three dimensional simplicial gravity
Authors: MOGAMI and Tsuguo
Abstract: It is proven that the partition function of 3-dimensional simplicial gravity has an exponential upper bound with the following assumption: any three dimensional sphere $S^3$ is constructed by repeated identification of neighboring links and neighboring triangles in the boundary of a simplicial 3-ball. This assumption is weaker than the one proposed by other authors.
