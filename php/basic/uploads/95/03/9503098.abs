Title: Lattice realizations of unitary minimal modular invariant partition  functions
Authors: David O'Brien and Paul A. Pearce
Abstract: The conformal spectra of the critical dilute A-D-E lattice models are studied numerically. The results strongly indicate that, in branches 1 and 2, these models provide realizations of the complete A-D-E classification of unitary minimal modular invariant partition functions given by Cappelli, Itzykson and Zuber. In branches 3 and 4 the results indicate that the modular invariant partition functions factorize. Similar factorization results are also obtained for two-colour lattice models.
