Title: Integrability of Schwinger-Dyson Equations in 2D Quantum Gravity and c <  1 Non-critical String Field Theory
Authors: Ryuichi Nakayama and Toshiya Suzuki
Abstract: We investigate the integrability of the Schwinger-Dyson equations in $c = 1 - \frac{6}{m(m+1)}$ string field theory which were proposed by Ikehara et al as the continuum limit of the Schwinger-Dyson equations of the matrix chain model. We show the continuum Schwinger-Dyson equations generate a closed algebra. This algebra contains Virasoro algebra but does not coincide with $W_{\infty}$ algebra. We include in the Schwinger-Dyson equations a new process of removing from the loop boundaries the operator ${\cal H}(\sigma)$ which locally changes the spin configuration. We also derive the string field Hamiltonian from the continuum Schwinger-Dyson equations. Its form is universal for all $c = 1 - \frac{6}{m(m+1)}$ string theories.
