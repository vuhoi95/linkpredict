Title: A HIERARCHY OF GAUGED GRASSMANIAN MODELS IN $4p$ DIMENSIONS WITH  SELF-DUAL INSTANTONS
Authors: R. P. Manvelyan and D. H. Tchrakian
Abstract: We present a hierarchy of gauged Grassmanian models in $4p$ dimensions, where the gauge field takes its values in the $2^{2p- 1}\times 2^{2p-1}$ chiral representation of SO(4p). The actions of all these models are absolutely minimised by a hierarchy of self-duality equations, all of which reduce to a single pair of coupled ordinary differential equations when subjected to $4p$ dimensional spherical symmetry.
