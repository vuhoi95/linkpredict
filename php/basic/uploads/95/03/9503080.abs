Title: Using Functional Methods to Compute Quantum Effects in the Liouville  Model
Authors: T. L. Curtright and G. I. Ghandour
Abstract: We use time-independent canonical transformation methods to discuss the energy eigenfunctions for the simple linear potential, pedagogically setting the stage for some field theory calculations to follow. We then discuss the Schr\"odinger wave-functional method of calculating correlation functions for Liouville field theory. We compare this approach to earlier treatments, in particular we check against known weak-coupling results for the Liouville field defined on a cylinder. Finally, we further set the stage for future Liouville calculations on curved two-manifolds and briefly discuss simple quantum mechanical systems with time-dependent Hamiltonians.
