Title: Does the Gursey-Tze Solution Represent a Monopole Condensate?
Authors: Serdar Nergiz and Cihan Saclioglu
Abstract: We recast the quaternionic Gursey-Tze solution, which is a fourfold quasi-periodic self-dual Yang-Mills field with a unit instanton number per Euclidean spacetime cell, into an ordinary coordinate formulation. After performing the sum in the Euclidean time direction, we use an observation by Rossi which suggests the solution represents an arrangement with a BPS monopole per space lattice cell. This may provide a concrete realization of a monopole condensate in pure Yang-Mills theory.
