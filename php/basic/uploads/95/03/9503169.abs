Title: Stochastic bosonization in arbitrary dimensions
Authors: L. Accardi and Y. G. Lu and I. Volovich
Abstract: A procedure of bosonization of Fermions in an arbitrary dimension is suggested. It is shown that a quadratic expression in the fermionic fields after rescaling time $t\to t/\lambda^2$ and performing the limit $\lambda\to0$ (stochastic limit), gives rise to a bosonic operator satisfying the boson canonical commutation relations. This stochastic bosonization of Fermions is considered first for free fields and then for a model with three--linear couplings. The limiting dynamics of the bosonic theory turns out to be described by means of a quantum stochastic differential equations.
