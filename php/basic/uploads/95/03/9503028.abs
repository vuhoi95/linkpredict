Title: A Note on Calogero-Sutherland Model, W_n Singular Vectors and  Generalized Matrix Models
Authors: H. Awata and Y. Matsuo and S. Odake and J. Shiraishi
Abstract: We review some recent results on the Calogero-Sutherland model with emphasis upon its algebraic aspects. We give integral formulae for excited states (Jack polynomials) of this model and their relations with W_n singular vectors and generalized matrix models.
