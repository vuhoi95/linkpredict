Title: Random Bond Ising Model and Massless Phase of the Gross-Neveu Model
Authors: G. Mussardo and P. Simonetti
Abstract: The $O(n)$ Gross-Neveu model for $n < 2$ presents a massless phase that can be characterized by right-left mover scattering processes. The limit $n \goto 0$ describes the on-shell properties of the random bond Ising model.
