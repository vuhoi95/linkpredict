Title: THE HIGGS-YUKAWA MODEL IN CURVED SPACETIME
Authors: E. Elizalde and S. D. Odintsov
Abstract: The Higgs-Yukawa model in curved spacetime (renormalizable in the usual sense) is considered near the critical point, employing the $1/N$--expansion and renormalization group techniques. By making use of the equivalence of this model with the standard NJL model, the effective potential in the linear curvature approach is calculated and the dynamically generated fermionic mass is found. A numerical study of chiral symmetry breaking by curvature effects is presented.
