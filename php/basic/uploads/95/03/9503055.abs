Title: String Theory, Misaligned Supersymmetry, and the Supertrace Constraints
Authors: Keith R. Dienes and Moshe Moshe and Robert C. Myers
Abstract: We demonstrate that string consistency in four spacetime dimensions leads to a spectrum of string states which satisfies the supertrace constraints Str(M^0)=0 and Str(M^2)=\Lambda at tree level, where \Lambda is the one-loop string cosmological constant. This result holds for a large class of string theories, including critical heterotic strings. For strings lacking spacetime supersymmetry, these supertrace constraints will be satisfied as a consequence of a hidden ``misaligned supersymmetry'' in the string spectrum. These results thus severely constrain the possible supersymmetry-breaking scenarios in string theory, and suggest a new intrinsically stringy mechanism whereby such supertrace constraints may be satisfied without phenomenologically unacceptable consequences.
