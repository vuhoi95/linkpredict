Title: Non-linear finite $W$-symmetries and applications in elementary systems
Authors: Jan de Boer and Frederique Harmsze and Tjark Tjin
Abstract: In this paper it is stressed that there is no {\em physical} reason for symmetries to be linear and that Lie group theory is therefore too restrictive. We illustrate this with some simple examples. Then we give a readable review on the theory finite $W$-algebras, which is an important class of non-linear symmetries. In particular, we discuss both the classical and quantum theory and elaborate on several aspects of their representation theory. Some new results are presented. These include finite $W$ coadjoint orbits, real forms and unitary representation of finite $W$-algebras and Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt theorems for finite $W$-algebras. Also we present some new finite $W$-algebras that are not related to $sl(2)$ embeddings. At the end of the paper we investigate how one could construct physical theories, for example gauge field theories, that are based on non-linear algebras.
