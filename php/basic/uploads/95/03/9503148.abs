Title: BRST Analysis of Gauge Theories Based on Nonlinear Algebras in 2d
Authors: M. Blagojević and T. Vukašinac
Abstract: Covariant quantization of theories based on nonlinear extensions of Lie algebras in 2d is studied by using a generalized Lagrangian BRST formalism. The quantum action is constructed to be invariant under the off--shell nilpotent BRST transformations by using a set of independent antifields as auxiliary, nonpropagating variables in the quantum theory. The general results are applied to the quantization of nonlinear gauge theory based on quadratic Poincar\'e algebra, which is closely related to 2d gravity with dynamical torsion.
