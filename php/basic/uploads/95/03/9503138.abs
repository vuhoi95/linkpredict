Title: Quarks in the Skyrme-'t Hooft-Witten Model
Authors: L. C. Biedenharn and L. P. Horwitz
Abstract: The three-flavor Skyrme-'t Hooft-Witten model is interpreted in terms of a quark-like substructure, leading to a new model of explicitly confined color-free ``quarks'' reminiscent of Gell-Mann's original pre-color quarks, but with unexpected and significant differences.
