Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of errors in six of the 135 diagrams in the published five-loop expansions of the $\beta$-function and the anomalous dimensions of the ${O}(n)$-symmetric $\phi^4$-theory in $D=4-\ep$ dimensions we present the results of a full analytic reevaluation of all diagrams. The divergences are removed by minimal subtraction and $\ep$-expansions are given for the critical exponents $\eta$, $\nu$, and $\omega$ up to order $\epsilon^5$.
