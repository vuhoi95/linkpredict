Title: A TOPOLOGICAL LAGRANGIAN FOR MONOPOLES ON FOUR-MANIFOLDS
Authors: J. M. F. Labastida and M. Mari√±o
Abstract: We present a topological quantum field theory which corresponds to the moduli problem associated to Witten's monopole equations for four-manifolds. The construction of the theory is carried out in purely geometrical terms using the Mathai-Quillen formalism, and the corresponding observables are described. These provide a rich set of new topological quantites.
