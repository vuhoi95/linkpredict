Title: PATH INTEGRAL BOSONIZATION OF THREE FLAVOUR QUARK DYNAMICS
Authors: B. O. Kerbikov and Yu. A. Simonov
Abstract: Chiral symmetry breaking due to instanton-produced fermion zero modes in the confining vacuum is considered. Zero modes provide 'tHooft-type determinant quark interaction, which is bosonized by introduction of auxiliary fields. For three flavours this procedure becomes nontrivial and a method is suggested which allows to derive effective Lagrangian for massless Nambu--Goldstone modes.
