Title: A CLASSIFICATION OF QUANTUM HALL FLUIDS
Authors: J. Froehlich and U. M. Studer and E. Thiran
Abstract: In this paper, the key ideas of characterizing universality classes of dissipation-free (incompressible) quantum Hall fluids by mathematical objects called quantum Hall lattices are reviewed. Many general theorems about the classification of quantum Hall lattices are stated and their physical implications are discussed. Physically relevant subclasses of quantum Hall lattices are defined and completely classified. The results are carefully compared with experimental data and also with other theoretical schemes (the hierarchy schemes). Several proposals for new experiments are made which could help to settle interesting issues in the theory of the (fractional) quantum Hall effect and thus would lead to a deeper understanding of this remarkable effect.
