Title: IRREDUCIBLE GAUGE THEORIES IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE Sp(2)-COVARIANT  QUANTIZATION METHOD
Authors: P. M. Lavrov and P. Yu. Moshin and A. A. Reshetnyak
Abstract: Irreducible gauge theories in both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian versions of the Sp(2)-covariant quantization method are studied. Solutions to generating equations are obtained in the form of expansions in power series of ghost and auxiliary variables up to the 3d order inclusively.
