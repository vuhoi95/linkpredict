Title: General Correlation Functions in the Schwinger Model at Zero and Finite  Temperature
Authors: James V. Steele and Ajay Subramanian and Ismail Zahed
Abstract: The general correlations between massless fermions are calculated in the Schwinger model at arbitrary temperature. The zero temperature calculations on the plane are reviewed and clarified. Then the finite temperature fermionic Green's function is computed and the results on the torus are compared to those on the plane. It is concluded that a simpler way to calculate the finite temperature results is to associate certain terms in the zero temperature structure with their finite temperature counterparts.
