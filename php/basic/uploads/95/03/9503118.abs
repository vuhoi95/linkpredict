Title: MORE ON THE LINEARIZATION OF $W$-ALGEBRAS
Authors: S. Krivonos and A. Sorin
Abstract: We show that a wide class of $W$-(super)algebras, including $W_N^{(N-1)}$, $U(N)$-superconformal as well as $W_N$ nonlinear algebras, can be linearized by embedding them as subalgebras into some {\em linear} (super)conformal algebras with finite sets of currents. The general construction is illustrated by the example of $W_4$ algebra.
