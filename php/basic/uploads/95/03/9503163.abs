Title: Dynamics of $SU(N)$ Supersymmetric Gauge Theory
Authors: Michael R. Douglas and Stephen H. Shenker
Abstract: We study the physics of the Seiberg-Witten and Argyres-Faraggi-Klemm-Lerche-Theisen-Yankielowicz solutions of $D=4$, $\CN=2$ and $\CN=1$ $SU(N)$ supersymmetric gauge theory. The $\CN=1$ theory is confining and its effective Lagrangian is a spontaneously broken $U(1)^{N-1}$ abelian gauge theory. We identify some features of its physics which see this internal structure, including a spectrum of different string tensions. We discuss the limit $N\rightarrow\infty$, identify a scaling regime in which instanton and monopole effects survive, and give exact results for the crossover from weak to strong coupling along a scaling trajectory. We find a large hierarchy of mass scales in the scaling regime, including very light $W$ bosons, and the absence of weak coupling. The light $W$'s leave a novel imprint on the effective dual magnetic theory. The effective Lagrangian appears to be inadequate to understand the conventional large $N$ limit of the confining $\CN=1$ theory.
