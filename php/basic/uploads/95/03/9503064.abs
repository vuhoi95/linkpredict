Title: Dual versions of extended supergravities
Authors: V. A. Tsokur and Yu. M. Zinoviev
Abstract: Recently, using the model of N=2 supergravity -- vector multiplets interaction with the scalar field geometry $SU(1,m)/SU(m)\otimes U(1)$ as an example, we have shown that even when the scalar field geometry is fixed, one can have a whole family of the Lagrangians, which differ by vector field duality transformation. In this paper we carry out the construction of such families for the case of N=3 and N=4 supergravities, the scalar field geometry being $SU(3,m)/SU(3)\otimes SU(m)\otimes U(1)$ and $SU(1,1)/U(1)\otimes O(6,m)/O(6)\otimes O(m)$, correspondingly. Moreover, it turns out that these families contain, as a partial case, the models describing the interaction of arbitrary number of vector multiplets with our hidden sectors, admitting spontaneous supersymmetry breaking without a cosmological term.
