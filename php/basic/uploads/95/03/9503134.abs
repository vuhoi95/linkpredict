Title: A Background Independent Formulation of Noncritical String Theory
Authors: Nobuyuki Ishibashi and Hikaru Kawai
Abstract: Using the string field theory recently proposed by the authors and collaborators, we give a background independent formulation of rational noncritical string theories with $c\leq 1$. With a little modification of the string field Hamiltonians previously constructed, we obtain string field theories which include various rational noncritical string theories as classical backgrounds.
