Abstract: We discuss the Chern-Simons theory in three-dimensional curved space-time in the vielbein formalism. Due to the additional presence of the local Lorentz symmetry, beside the diffeomorphisms, we will include a local gravitational supersymmetry (superdiffeomorphisms and super-Lorentz transformations), which allows us to show the perturbative finiteness at all orders.
