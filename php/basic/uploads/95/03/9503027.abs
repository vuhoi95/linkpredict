Title: A Conformal Field Theory of a Rotating Dyon
Authors: Clifford V. Johnson and Robert C. Myers
Abstract: A conformal field theory representing a four-dimensional classical solution of heterotic string theory is presented. The low-energy limit of this solution has U(1) electric and magnetic charges, and also nontrivial axion and dilaton fields. The low-energy metric contains mass, NUT and rotation parameters. We demonstrate that this solution corresponds to part of an extremal limit of the Kerr-Taub-NUT dyon solution. This limit displays interesting `remnant' behaviour, in that asymptotically far away from the dyon the angular momentum vanishes, but far down the infinite throat in the neighbourhood of the horizon (described by our CFT) there is a non-zero angular velocity. A further natural generalization of the CFT to include an additional parameter is presented, but the full physical interpretation of its role in the resulting low energy solution is unclear.
