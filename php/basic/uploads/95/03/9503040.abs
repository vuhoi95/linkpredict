Title: Inflationary Cosmology from Noncommutative Geometry
Authors: F. Lizzi and G. Mangano and G. Miele and G. Sparano
Abstract: In the framework of the Connes-Lott model based on noncommutative geometry, the basic features of a gauge theory in the presence of gravity are reviewed, in order to show the possible physical relevance of this scheme for inflationary cosmology. These models naturally contain at least two scalar fields, interacting with each other whenever more than one fermion generation is assumed. In this paper we propose to investigate the behaviour of these two fields (one of which represents the distance between the copies of a two-sheeted space-time) in the early stages of the universe evolution. In particular the simplest abelian model, which preserves the main characteristics of more complicate gauge theories, is considered and the corresponding inflationary dynamics is studied. We find that a chaotic inflation is naturally favoured, leading to a field configuration in which no symmetry breaking occurs and the final distance between the two sheets of space-time is smaller the greater the number of $e$-fold in each sheet.
