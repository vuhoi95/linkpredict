Abstract: We study conformal field theories describing two massless one-dimensional fields interacting at a single spatial point. The interactions we include are periodic functions of the bosonized fields separately plus a ``magnetic'' interaction that mixes the two fields. Such models arise in open string theory and dissipative quantum mechanics and perhaps in edge state tunneling in the fractional quantized Hall effect. The partition function for such theories is a Coulomb gas with interchange phases arising from the magnetic field. These ``fractional statistics'' have a profound effect on the phase structure of the Coulomb gas. In this paper we present new exact and approximate results for this type of generalized Coulomb gas.
