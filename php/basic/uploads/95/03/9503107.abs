Title: The embedding structure and the shift operator of the U(1) lattice  current algebra
Authors: A. Yu. Alekseev and A. Recknagel
Abstract: The structure of block-spin embeddings of the U(1) lattice current algebra is described. For an odd number of lattice sites, the inner realizations of the shift automorphism areclassified. We present a particular inner shift operator which admits a factorization involving quantum dilogarithms analogous to the results of Faddeev and Volkov.
