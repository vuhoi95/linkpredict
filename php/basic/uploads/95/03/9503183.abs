Title: IDENTICAL PARTICLES AND PERMUTATION GROUP
Authors: E. Celeghini and M. Rasetti and G. Vitiello
Abstract: Second quantization is revisited and creation and annihilation operators are shown to be related, on the same footing both to the algebra ${\it h}(1)$, ${\underline {and}}$ to the superalgebra ${\it osp}(1|2)$ that are shown to be both compatible with Bose ${\underline {and}}$ Fermi statistics. The two algebras are completely equivalent in the one-mode sector but, because of grading of ${\it osp}(1|2)$, differ in the many-particle case. The possibility of a unorthodox quantum field theory is suggested.
