Title: On Some New Black String Solutions in Three Dimensions
Authors: Warren G. Anderson and Nemanja Kaloper
Abstract: We derive several new solutions in three-dimensional stringy gravity. The solutions are obtained with the help of string duality transformations. They represent stationary configurations with horizons, and are surrounded by (quasi) topologically massive Abelian gauge hair, in addition to the dilaton and the Kalb-Ramond axion. Our analysis suggests that there exists a more general family, where our solutions are special limits. Finally, we use the generating technique recently proposed by Garfinkle to construct a traveling wave on the extremal variant of one of our solutions.
