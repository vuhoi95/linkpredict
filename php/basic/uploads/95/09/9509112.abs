Abstract: The ADM and Bondi mass for the RST model have been first discussed from Hawking and Horowitz's argument. Expressing the localized RST action in terms of the ADM formulation, the RST Hamiltonian can be derived, meanwhile keeping track of all boundary terms. Then the total boundary terms can be taken as the total energy for the RST model. It has been found that there is a new contribution to the ADM and Bondi mass from the RST boundary due to the existence of the hidden dynamical field. The ADM and Bondi mass have been discussed respectively in detail, and some new properties have been found.
