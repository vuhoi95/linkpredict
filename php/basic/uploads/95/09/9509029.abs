Title: Classical and Quantum Nonultralocal Systems on the Lattice
Authors: M. A. Semenov-Tian-Shansky and A. V. Sevostyanov
Abstract: We classify nonultralocal Poisson brackets for 1-dimensional lattice systems and describe the corresponding regularizations of the Poisson bracket relations for the monodromy matrix . A nonultralocal quantum algebras on the lattices for these systems are constructed.For some class of such algebras an ultralocalization procedure is proposed.The technique of the modified Bethe-Anzatz for these algebras is developed.This technique is applied to the nonlinear sigma model problem.
