Abstract: We review our new method, which might be the most direct and efficient way for approaching the continuum physics from Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory. It consists of solving the eigenvalue equation with a truncation scheme preserving the continuum limit. The efficiency has been confirmed by the observations of the scaling behaviors for the long wavelength vacuum wave functions and mass gaps in (2+1)-dimensional models and (1+1)-dimensional $\sigma$ model even at very low truncation orders. Most of these results show rapid convergence to the available Monte Carlo data, ensuring the reliability of our method.
