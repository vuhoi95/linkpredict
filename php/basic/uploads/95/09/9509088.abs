Title: Non-Polynomial Realizations of W-Algebras
Authors: F. Barbarin and E. Ragoucy and P. Sorba
Abstract: Relaxing first-class constraint conditions in the usual Drinfeld-Sokolov Hamiltonian reduction leads, after symmetry fixing, to realizations of W algebras expressed in terms of all the J-current components. General results are given for G a non exceptional simple (finite and affine) algebra. Such calculations directly provide the commutant, in the (closure of) G enveloping algebra, of the nilpotent subalgebra $G_-$, where the subscript refers to the chosen gradation in G. In the affine case, explicit expressions are presented for the Virasoro, $W_3$, and Bershadsky algebras at the quantum level.
