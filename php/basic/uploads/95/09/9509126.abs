Title: Regularisation of functional determinants using boundary perturbations
Authors: A J McKane and M B Tarlie
Abstract: The formalism which has been developed to give general expressions for the determinants of differential operators is extended to the physically interesting situation where these operators have a zero mode which has been extracted. In the approach adopted here, this mode is removed by a novel regularisation procedure, which allows remarkably simple expressions for these determinants to be derived.
