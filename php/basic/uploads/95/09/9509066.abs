Title: Lectures on supersymmetric gauge theories and electric-magnetic duality
Authors: K. Intriligator and N. Seiberg
Abstract: We review some of the recent work on the dynamics of four dimensional, supersymmetric gauge theories. The kinematics are largely determined by holomorphy and the dynamics are governed by duality. The results shed light on the phases of gauge theories. Some results and interpretations which have not been published before are also included.
