Title: Fractional Statistics in Three Dimensions: Compact Maxwell-Higgs System
Authors: H. Fort and R. Gambini
Abstract: We show that a (3+1)-dimensional system composed of an open magnetic vortex and an electrical point charge exhibits the phenomenon of Fermi-Bose transmutation. In order to provide the physical realization of this system we focus on the lattice compact scalar electrodynamics $SQED_c$ whose topological excitations are open Nielsen-Olesen strings with magnetic monopoles attached at their ends.
