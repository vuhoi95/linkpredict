Abstract: We consider a class of 2 dimensional Toda equations on discrete space-time. It has arisen as functional relations in commuting family of transfer matrices in solvable lattice models associated with any classical simple Lie algebra $X_r$. For $X_r = B_r, C_r$ and $D_r$, we present the solution in terms of Pfaffians and determinants. They may be viewed as Yangian analogues of the classical Jacobi-Trudi formula on Schur functions.
