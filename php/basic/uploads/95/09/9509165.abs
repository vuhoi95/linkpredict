Title: Duality and other Exotic Gauge Dynamics in Softly Broken Supersymmetric  QCD
Authors: Ofer Aharony and Michael E. Peskin and Jacob Sonnenschein and Shimon Yankielowicz
Abstract: We analyze the theory of softly broken supersymmetric $QCD$. Exotic behavior like spontaneously broken baryon number, massless composite fermions and Seiberg's duality seems to persist also in the presence of (small) soft supersymmetry breaking. We argue that certain, specially tailored, lattice simulations may be able to detect the novel phenomena. Most of the exotic behavior does not survive the decoupling limit of large SUSY breaking parameters.
