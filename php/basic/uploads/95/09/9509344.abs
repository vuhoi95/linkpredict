Title: Constituent Quarks from QCD
Authors: Martin Lavelle and David McMullan
Abstract: Starting from the observation that colour charge is only well defined on gauge invariant states, we construct perturbatively gauge invariant, dynamical dressings for individual quarks. Explicit calculations show that an infra-red finite mass-shell renormalisation of the gauge invariant, dressed propagator is possible and, further, that operator product effects, which generate a running mass, may be included in a gauge invariant way in the propagator. We explain how these fields may be combined to form hadrons and show how the interquark potential can now be directly calculated. The onset of confinement is identified with an obstruction to building a non-perturbative dressing. We propose several methods to extract the hadronic scale from the interquark potential. Various extensions are discussed.
