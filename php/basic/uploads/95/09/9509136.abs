Title: Mesons in the massive Schwinger model on the light-cone
Authors: koji Harada and Atsushi Okazaki and Masa-aki Taniguchi
Abstract: We investigate mesons in the bosonized massive Schwinger model in the light-front Tamm-Dancoff approximation in the strong coupling region. We confirm that the three-meson bound state has a few percent fermion six-body component in the strong coupling region when expressed in terms of fermion variables, consistent with our previous calculations. We also discuss some qualitative features of the three-meson bound state based on the information about the wave function.
