Title: Operator algebra of the 4D W_3 string
Authors: Peter Bouwknegt and Jim McCarthy and Krzysztof Pilch
Abstract: The noncritical $4D$ $\cW_3$ string is a model of $\cW_3$ gravity coupled to two free scalar fields. In this paper we discuss its BRST quantization in direct analogy with that of the $2D$ (Virasoro) string. The physical operators form a BV-algebra. We model this BV-algebra on that of the polyderivations of a commutative ring on six variables with a quadratic constraint, or, equivalently, on the BV-algebra of (polynomial) polyvector fields on the base affine space of $SL(3,\CC)$. Details have appeared elsewhere. To appear in the proceedings of ``STRINGS '95: Future Perspectives in String Theory,'' USC, March 13--18, 1995
