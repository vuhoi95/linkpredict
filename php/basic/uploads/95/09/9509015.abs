Title: Supersymmetric quantization of gauge theories
Authors: Frederik G Schotlz and Sergei V. Shabanov
Abstract: We develop a new operator quantization scheme for gauge theories in which the dynamics of the ghost sector is described by an N=2 supersymmetry. In this scheme no gauge condition is imposed on the gauge fields. The corresponding path integral is explicitly Lorentz invariant and, in contrast to the BRST-BFV path integral in the Lorentz gauge, it is free of the Gribov ambiguity, i.e., it is also valid in the non-perturbative domain. The formalism can therefore be used to study the non-perturbative properties of gauge theories in the infra-red region (gluon confinement).
