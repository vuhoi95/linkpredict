Title: Entropy and topology for manifolds with boundaries
Authors: Stefano Liberati and Giuseppe Pollifrone
Abstract: In this work a deep relation between topology and thermodynamical features of manifolds with boundaries is shown. The expression for the Euler characteristic, through the Gauss- Bonnet integral, and the one for the entropy of gravitational instantons are proposed in a form which makes the relation between them self-evident. A generalization of Bekenstein-Hawking formula, in which entropy and Euler characteristic are related in the form $S=\chi A/8$, is obtained. This formula reproduces the correct result for extreme black hole, where the Bekenstein-Hawking one fails ($S=0$ but $A \neq 0$). In such a way it recovers a unified picture for the black hole entropy law. Moreover, it is proved that such a relation can be generalized to a wide class of manifolds with boundaries which are described by spherically symmetric metrics (e.g. Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m, static de Sitter).
