Title: Static spherically symmetric solutions to Einstein-Maxwell Dilaton field  equations in D dimensions
Authors: Metin Gurses and Emre Sermutlu
Abstract: We classify the spherically symmetric solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell Dilaton field equations in D dimensions and find some exact solutions of the string theory at all orders of the string tension parameter. We also show the uniqueness of the black hole solutions of this theory in static axially symmetric spacetimes.
