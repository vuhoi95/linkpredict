Title: Entropy of Extremal Black Hole Solutions of String Theory
Authors: A. Ghosh and P. Mitra
Abstract: For extremal black holes, the thermodynamic entropy is not proportional to the area. The general form allowed by thermodynamics is worked out for three classes of extremal black hole solutions of string theory and shown to be consistent with the entropy calculated from the density of elementary string states. On the other hand, the entanglement entropy does not in general agree with these results.
