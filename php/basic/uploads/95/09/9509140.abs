Title: Non-Perturbative Green's Functions in Theories with Extended  Superconformal Symmetry
Authors: Paul Howe and P. West
Abstract: The multiplets that occur in four dimensional rigidly supersymmetric theories can be described either by chiral superfields in Minkowski superspace or analytic superfields in harmonic superspace. The superconformal Ward identities for Green's functions of gauge invariant operators of these types are derived. It is shown that there are no chiral superconformal invariants. It is further shown that the Green's functions of analytic operators are severely restricted by the superconformal Ward when analyticity is taken into account.
