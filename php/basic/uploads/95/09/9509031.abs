Title: Free Differential Algebras: Their Use in Field Theory and Dual  Formulation
Authors: Leonardo Castellani and Alberto Perotto
Abstract: The gauging of free differential algebras (FDA's) produces gauge field theories containing antisymmetric tensors. The FDA's extend the Cartan-Maurer equations of ordinary Lie algebras by incorporating p-form potentials ($p > 1$). We study here the algebra of FDA transformations. To every p-form in the FDA we associate an extended Lie derivative $\ell$ generating a corresponding ``gauge" transformation. The field theory based on the FDA is invariant under these new transformations. This gives geometrical meaning to the antisymmetric tensors. The algebra of Lie derivatives is shown to close and provides the dual formulation of FDA's.
