Title: Holomorphic Quantization on the Torus and Finite Quantum Mechanics
Authors: G. G. Athanasiu and E. G. Floratos and S. Nicolis
Abstract: We construct explicitly the quantization of classical linear maps of $SL(2, R)$ on toroidal phase space, of arbitrary modulus, using the holomorphic (chiral) version of the metaplectic representation. We show that Finite Quantum Mechanics (FQM) on tori of arbitrary integer discretization, is a consistent restriction of the holomorphic quantization of $SL(2, Z)$ to the subgroup $SL(2, Z)/\Gamma_l$, $\Gamma_l$ being the principal congruent subgroup mod l, on a finite dimensional Hilbert space. The generators of the ``rotation group'' mod l, $O_{l}(2)\subset SL(2,l)$, for arbitrary values of l are determined as well as their quantum mechanical eigenvalues and eigenstates.
