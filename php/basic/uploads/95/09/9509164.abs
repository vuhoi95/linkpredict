Title: Differential Renormalization of Scalar Field Theory in the  Background-Field Method
Authors: Yaw-Hwang Chen and Min-Tsung He and Su-Long Nyeo
Abstract: We introduce an approach for calculating the quantum loop corrections in the $\phi^4$ theory. Differential regularization and background-field method are essential tools and are used to calculate the effective action of the theory to two-loop order. Our approach is considerably simpler than other known methods and can be readily extended to higher-loop calculations and to other models.
