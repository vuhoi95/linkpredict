Title: Thermal Fermionic Dispersion Relations in a Magnetic Field
Authors: Per Elmfors and David Persson and Bo-Sture Skagerstam
Abstract: The thermal self-energy of an electron in a static uniform magnetic field $B$ is calculated to first order in the fine structure constant $\alpha $ and to all orders in $eB$. We use two methods, one based on the Furry picture and another based on Schwinger's proper-time method. As external states we consider relativistic Landau levels with special emphasis on the lowest Landau level. In the high-temperature limit we derive self-consistent dispersion relations for particle and hole excitations, showing the chiral asymmetry caused by the external field. For weak fields, earlier results on the ground- state energy and the anomalous magnetic moment are discussed and compared with the present analysis. In the strong-field limit the appearance of a field-independent imaginary part of the self-energy, related to Landau damping in the $e^{+}e^{-}$ plasma, is pointed out.
