Title: Rotating Black Holes which Saturate a Bogomol'nyi Bound
Authors: Gary Horowitz and Ashoke Sen
Abstract: We construct and study the electrically charged, rotating black hole solution in heterotic string theory compactified on a $(10-D)$ dimensional torus. This black hole is characterized by its mass, angular momentum, and a $(36-2D)$ dimensional electric charge vector. One of the novel features of this solution is that for $D >5$, its extremal limit saturates the Bogomol'nyi bound. This is in contrast with the $D=4$ case where the rotating black hole solution develops a naked singularity before the Bogomol'nyi bound is reached. The extremal black holes can be superposed, and by taking a periodic array in $D>5$, one obtains effectively four dimensional solutions without naked singularities.
