Title: Two-Dimensional Higher-Derivative Supergravity and a New Mechanism for  Supersymmetry Breaking
Authors: Ahmed Hindawi and Burt A. Ovrut and Daniel Waldram
Abstract: We discuss the general form of quadratic (1,1) supergravity in two dimensions, and show that this theory is equivalent to two scalar supermultiplets coupled to non-trivial supergravity. It is demonstrated that the theory possesses stable vacua with vanishing cosmological constant which spontaneously break supersymmetry.
