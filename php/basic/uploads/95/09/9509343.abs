Title: The Colour of Quarks
Authors: Martin Lavelle and David McMullan
Abstract: It is shown that colour can only be defined on gauge invariant states. Since the ability to associate colour with constituent quarks is an integral part of the constituent quark model, this means that, if we want to extract constituent quarks from QCD, we need to dress Lagrangian quarks with gluons so that the result is gauge invariant. We further prove that gauge fixings can be used to construct such dressings. Gauge invariant dressed quark states are presented and a direct approach to the interquark potential is discussed. Some further aspects of dressing quarks are briefly discussed.
