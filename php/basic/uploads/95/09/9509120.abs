Title: Complex sine-Gordon Theory for Coherent Optical Pulse Propagation
Authors: Q-Han Park and H. J. Shin
Abstract: It is shown that the McCall-Hahn theory of self-induced transparency in coherent optical pulse propagation can be identified with the complex sine-Gordon theory in the sharp line limit. We reformulate the theory in terms of the deformed gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten sigma model and address various new aspects of self-induced transparency.
