Title: Dimensional transmutation and symmetry breaking in Maxwell- Chern-Simons  scalar QED
Authors: F. S. Nogueira and N. F. Svaiter
Abstract: The mechanism of dimensional transmutation is discussed in the context of Maxwell-Chern-Simons scalar QED. The method used is non-perturbative. The effective potential describes a broken symmetry state. It is found that the symmetry breaking vacuum is more stable when the Chern-Simons mass is different from zero.
