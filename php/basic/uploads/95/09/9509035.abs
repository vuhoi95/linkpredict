Title: The BRST--antibracket cohomology of $2d$ gravity conformally coupled to  scalar matter
Authors: Friedemann Brandt and Walter Troost and Antoine Van Proeyen
Abstract: We compute completely the BRST--antibracket cohomology on local functionals in two-dimensional Weyl invariant gravity for given classical field content (two dimensional metric and scalar matter fields) and gauge symmetries (two dimensional diffeomorphisms and local Weyl transformations). This covers the determination of all classical actions, of all their rigid symmetries, of all background charges and of all candidate gauge anomalies. In particular we show that the antifield dependence can be entirely removed from the anomalies and that, if the target space has isometries, the condition for the absence of matter field dependent Weyl anomalies is more general than the familiar `dilaton equations'.
