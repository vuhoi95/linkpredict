Title: Quantum Poisson-Lie T-duality and WZNW model
Authors: A. Yu. Alekseev and C. Klimcik and A. A. Tseytlin
Abstract: A pair of conformal sigma models related by Poisson-Lie T-duality is constructed by starting with the O(2,2) Drinfeld double. The duality relates the standard SL(2,R) WZNW model to a constrained sigma model defined on SL(2,R) group space. The quantum equivalence of the models is established by using a path integral argument.
