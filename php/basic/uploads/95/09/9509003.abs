Title: Proofs of Two Conjectures Related to the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz
Authors: Craig A. Tracy and Harold Widom
Abstract: We prove that the solution to a pair of nonlinear integral equations arising in the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz can be expressed in terms of the resolvent kernel of the linear integral operator with kernel exp(-u(theta)-u(theta'))/cosh[(1/2)(theta-theta')]
