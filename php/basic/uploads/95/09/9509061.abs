Title: Topological supergravity structure of non-critical superstring theories
Authors: A. V. Ramallo and S. Roy and J. M. Sanchez de Santos
Abstract: We obtain a bosonization prescription that allows to represent the energy-momentum tensor and supersymmetry generators of non-critical superstring theories with minimal matter as those of topological supergravity. Superstrings with $N=1$ and $N=2$ world-sheet supersymmetry are considered. The topological symmetry associated with the topological supergravity representation is studied. It is shown, in particular, that the compatibility of this topological structure with the supersymmetry enhances the superconformal symmetry of the models concerned.
