Title: One Loop Corrections to Coupling Constants in IR-regulated String Theory
Authors: Elias Kiritsis and Costas Kounnas
Abstract: Exact Superstring solutions are constructed moving in 4-D space-time with positive curvature and non-trivial dilaton and antisymmetric tensor fields. The full spectrum of string excitations is derived as a function of moduli fields $T^{i}$ and the scale $\mu^2=1/(k+2)$ which induced by the non-zero background fields. The spectrum of string excitations has a non-zero mass gap $\mu^2$ and in the weak curvature limit ($\mu$ small) $\mu^2$ plays the role of a well defined infrared regulator, consistent with modular invariance, gauge invariance, supersymmetry and chirality. The effects of a covariantly constant chomo-magnetic field $B$ as well as additional curvature can be derived exactly up to one string-loop level. Thus, the one-loop corrections to all couplings (gravitational, gauge and Yukawas) are unambiguously computed and are finite both in the Ultra-Violet and the Infra-Red regime. These corrections are necessary for quantitative string superunification predictions at low energies. Similar calculations are done in the effective field theory. The one-loop corrections to the couplings are also found to satisfy Infrared Flow Equations.
