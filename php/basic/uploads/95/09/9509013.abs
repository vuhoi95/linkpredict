Title: WZNW Models and Gauged WZNW Models Based on a Family of Solvable Lie  Algebras
Authors: Amit Giveon and Oskar Pelc and Eliezer Rabinovici
Abstract: A family of solvable self-dual Lie algebras that are not double extensions of Abelian algebras and, therefore, cannot be obtained through a Wigner contraction, is presented. We construct WZNW and gauged WZNW models based on the first two algebras in this family. We also analyze some general phenomena arising in such models.
