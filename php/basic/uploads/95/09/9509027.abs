Title: Why the overlap formula does not lead to chiral fermions
Authors: Maarten Golterman and Yigal Shamir
Abstract: We describe a conceptually simple, but important test for the overlap approach to the construction of lattice chiral gauge theories. We explain the equivalence of the overlap formula with a certain waveguide model for a simple set of gauge configurations (the trivial orbit). This equivalence is helpful in carrying out the test, and casts serious doubts on the viability of the overlap approach. A recent note by Narayanan and Neuberger which points out a mistake in our previous work is irrelevant in this context.
