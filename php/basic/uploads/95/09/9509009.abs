Title: Mirror duality and string-theoretic Hodge numbers
Authors: Victor V. Batyrev and Lev A. Borisov
Abstract: We prove in full generality the mirror duality conjecture for string-theoretic Hodge numbers of Calabi-Yau complete intersections in Gorenstein toric Fano varieties. The proof is based on properties of intersection cohomology
