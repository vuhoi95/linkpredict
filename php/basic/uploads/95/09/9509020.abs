Title: 2-dimensional Regge gravity in the conformal gauge
Authors: Pietro Menotti and Pier Paolo Peirano
Abstract: By restricting the functional integration to the Regge geometries, we give the discretized version of the well known path integral formulation of 2--dimensional quantum gravity in the conformal gauge. We analyze the role played by diffeomorphisms in the Regge framework and we give an exact expression for the Faddeev--Popov determinant related to a Regge surface; such an expression in the smooth limit goes over to the correct continuum result.
