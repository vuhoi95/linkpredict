Title: Some Applications of the Overlap Formalism
Authors: R. Narayanan and H. Neuberger and P. Vranas
Abstract: The massless vector Schwinger model with $N_f=1,2,3,4$ number of flavors is studied on the lattice using the overlap formalism. A full Monte Carlo simulation yields values for the bilinear fermion condensate that are in agreement with the exact solution of the continuum Schwinger model with an added Thirring interaction.
