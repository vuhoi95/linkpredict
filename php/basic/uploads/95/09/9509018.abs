Title: Galois Relations on Knot Invariants
Authors: T. Gannon and M. A. Walton
Abstract: We discuss the existence of Galois relations obeyed by certain link invariants. Some of these relations have recently been identified and exploited within the context of CFT and Lie/Kac-Moody representation theory. These relations should aid in computing knot invariants. They probably have an interpretation in terms of quasitriangular (quasi-)Hopf algebras. They could also have a topological interpretation, and may serve as a concrete model for related ideas of Degiovanni, Drinfeld, Grothendieck, Ihara, and others.
