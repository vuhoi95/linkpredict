Title: Space-Time Symmetries in Duality Symmetric Models
Authors: Paolo Pasti and Dmitrij Sorokin and Mario Tonin
Abstract: A way of covariantizing duality symmetric actions is proposed. As examples considered are a manifestly space-time invariant duality--symmetric action for abelian gauge fields coupled to axion-dilaton fields and gravity in D=4, and a Lorentz-invariant action for chiral bosons in D=2. The latter is shown to admit a manifestly supersymmetric generalization for describing chiral superfields in n=(1,0) D=2 superspace.
