Title: Quantum (2,2) supergravity
Authors: M. T. Grisaru and M. E. Wehlau
Abstract: We describe various aspects of two-dimensional $N=2$ supergravity in superspace. We present the solution to the constraints in terms of unconstrained prepotentials, and the different superspace measures (full and chiral) used in the construction of invariant actions. We discuss aspects of the theory in light-cone gauge, including the Ward identities for correlation functions defined with respect to the induced supergravity action.
