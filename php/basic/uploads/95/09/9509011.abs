Title: Evolution of QCD Coupling Constant at Finite Temperature in the  Background Field Method
Authors: M. Chaichian and M. Hayashi
Abstract: The evolution of QCD coupling constant at finite temperature is considered by making use of the finite temperature renormalization group equation up to the one-loop order in the background field method with the Feynman gauge and the imaginary time formalism. The results are compared with the ones obtained in the literature. We point out, in particular, the origin of the discrepancies between different calculations, such as the choice of gauge, the break-down of Lorentz invariance, imaginary versus real time formalism and the applicability of the Ward identities at finite temperature.
