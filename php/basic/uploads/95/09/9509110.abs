Title: On the Quantization of the Abelian Chern-Simons Coefficient at Finite  Temperature
Authors: N. Bralic and C. D. Fosco and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We show that when the Abelian \CS\ theory coupled to matter fields is quantized in a vacuum with non vanishing magnetic flux (or electric charge), the requirement of gauge invariance at finite temperature leads to the quantization of the \CS\ coefficient and its quantum corrections, in a manner similar to the non-Abelian case.
