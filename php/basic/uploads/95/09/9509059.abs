Title: The Quaternionic Dirac Lagrangian
Authors: Stefano De Leo and Pietro Rotelli
Abstract: We discuss the use of the variational principle within quaternionic quantum mechanics. This is non-trivial because of the non commutative nature of quaternions. We derive the Dirac Lagrangian density corresponding to the two-component Dirac equation. This Lagrangian is complex projected as anticipated in previous articles and this feature is necessary even for a classical real Lagrangian.
