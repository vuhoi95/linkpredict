Title: Whitham-Toda hierarchy and N = 2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Toshio Nakatsu and Kanehisa Takasaki
Abstract: The exact solution of $N=2$ supersymmetric $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory is studied in the framework of the Whitham hierarchies. The solution is identified with a homogeneous solution of a Whitham hierarchy. This integrable hierarchy (Whitham-Toda hierarchy) describes modulation of a quasi-periodic solution of the (generalized) Toda lattice hierarchy associated with the hyperelliptic curves over the quantum moduli space. The relation between the holomorphic pre-potential of the low energy effective action and the $\tau$ function of the (generalized) Toda lattice hierarchy is also clarified.
