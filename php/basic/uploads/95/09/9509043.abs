Title: Instabilities in Strong Magnetic Fields in String Theory
Authors: Elias Kiritsis and Costas Kounnas
Abstract: We construct groundstates of the string with non-zero mass gap and non-trivial chromo-magnetic fields as well as curvature. The exact spectrum as function of the chromo-magnetic fields and curvature is derived. We examine the behavior of the spectrum, and find that there is a maximal value for the magnetic field $H_{\rm max}\sim M_{\rm Plank}^2$. At this value all states that couple to the magnetic field become infinitely massive and decouple. We also find tachyonic instabilities for strong background fields of the order ${\cal O}(\mu M_{\rm Plank})$ where $\mu$ is the mass gap of the theory. Unlike the field theory case, we find that such ground states become stable again for magnetic fields of the order ${\cal O}(M^2_{\rm Plank})$. The implications of these results are discussed.
