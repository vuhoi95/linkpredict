Title: Exact boundary S-matrices of the supersymmetric sine-Gordon theory on a  half line
Authors: C. Ahn and W. M. Koo
Abstract: Using the boundary Yang-Baxter equations and exact results on the bulk $S$-matrices, we compute exact boundary scattering amplitudes of the supersymmetric sine-Gordon model with integrable boundary potentials.
