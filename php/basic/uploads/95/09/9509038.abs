Title: Pseudoclassical neutrino in the external electromagnetic field
Authors: G. V. Grigoryan and R. P. Grigoryan
Abstract: The problem of the passage of the neutral massless particle with anomalous magnetic moment through the external electromagnetic field is considered both in pseudoclassical and quantum mechanics. The quantum description uses the hamiltonian in the Foldy--Wouthuysen representation, obtained from the pseudoclassical hamiltonian of the massive charged particle with anomalous magnetic moment in interaction with the external electromagnetic field using Weyl quantization scheme.
