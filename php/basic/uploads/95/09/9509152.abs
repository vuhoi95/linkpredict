Title: A Labelling Scheme for Higher Dimensional Simplex Equations
Authors: L. C. Kwek and C. H. Oh
Abstract: We present a succinct way of obtaining all possible higher dimensional generalization of Quantum Yang-Baxter Equation (QYBE). Using the scheme, we could generate the two popular three-simplex equations, namely: Zamolodchikov's tetrahedron equation (ZTE) and Frenkel and Moore equation (FME).
