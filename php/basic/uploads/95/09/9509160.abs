Title: The Symplectic Structure of N=2 Supergravity and its Central Extension
Authors: A. Ceresole and R. D'Auria and S. Ferrara
Abstract: We report on the formulation of $N=2$ $D=4$ supergravity coupled to $n_V$ abelian vector multiplets in presence of electric and magnetic charges. General formulae for the (moduli dependent) electric and magnetic charges for the $n_V+1$ gauge fields are given which reflect the symplectic structure of the underlying special geometry. The specification to Type IIB strings compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds, with gauge group $U(1)^{h_{21}+1}$ is given.
