Title: The Batalin-Tyutin Formalism on the Collective Coordinates Quantisation  of the SU(2) Skyrme Model
Authors: Wilson Oliveira and Jorge Ananias Neto
Abstract: We apply The Batalin-Tyutin constraint formalism of converting a second class system into a first class system for the rotational quantisation of the SU(2) Skyrme model. We obtain the first class constraint and the Hamiltonian in the extended phase space. The vacuum functional is constructed and evaluated in the unitary gauge and a multiplier dependent gauge. Finally, we discuss the spectrum of the extended theory. The use of the BT formalism on the collective coordinates quantisation of the SU(2) Skyrme model leads an additional term in the usual quantum Hamiltonian that can improve the phenomenology predicted by the Skyrme model.
