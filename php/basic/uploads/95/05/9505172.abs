Title: The heat-kernel and the average effective potential
Authors: R. Floreanini and R. Percacci
Abstract: We discuss the definition of the average effective action in terms of the heat-kernel. As an example we examine a model describing a self-interacting scalar field, both in flat and curved background, and study the renormalization group flow of some of the parameters characterizing its effective potential. Some implications of the running of these parameters for inflationary cosmology are also briefly discussed.
