Title: Abelian Higgs Hair for Black Holes
Authors: Ana Achucarro and Ruth Gregory and Konrad Kuijken
Abstract: We find evidence for the existence of solutions of the Einstein and Abelian Higgs field equations describing a black hole pierced by a Nielsen-Olesen vortex. This situation falls outside the scope of the usual no-hair arguments due to the non-trivial topology of the vortex configuration and the special properties of its energy-momentum tensor. By a combination of numerical and perturbative techniques we conclude that the black hole horizon has no difficulty in supporting the long range fields of the Nielsen Olesen string. Moreover, the effect of the vortex can in principle be measured from infinity, thus justifying its characterization as black hole ``hair".
