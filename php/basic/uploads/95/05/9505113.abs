Title: Spontaneous Magnetization in Lorentz Invariant Theories
Authors: D. Wesolowski and Y. Hosotani
Abstract: In a class of three-dimensional Abelian gauge theories with both light and heavy fermions, heavy chiral fermions can trigger dynamical generation of a magnetic field, leading to the spontaneous breaking of the Lorentz invaiance. Finite masses of light fermions tend to restore the Lorentz invariance.
