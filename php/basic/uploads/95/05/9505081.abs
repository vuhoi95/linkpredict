Title: Quantum Numbers of Hall Effect Skyrmions
Authors: Chetan Nayak and Frank Wilczek
Abstract: By carefully considering a family of wave functions for Skyrmions in simple quantum Hall states, whose members are labelled by a non-negative integer and which properly generalizes the traditional Laughlin quasiparticle, we argue that the spin of this particle has a fractional part related in a universal fashion to the properties of the bulk state, and propose a direct experimental test of this claim. We argue directly also for the fractional charge and fractional quantum statistics of these particles. We show that certain spin-singlet quantum Hall states can be understood as arising from primary polarized states by Skyrmion condensation.
