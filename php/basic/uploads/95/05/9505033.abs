Title: Bosonization of One-Dimensional Exclusons and Characterization of  Luttinger Liquids
Authors: Yong-Shi Wu and Yue Yu
Abstract: We achieve a bosonization of one-dimensional ideal gas of exclusion statistics $\lambda$ at low temperatures, resulting in a new variant of $c=1$ conformal field theory with compactified radius $R=\sqrt{1/\lambda}$. These ideal excluson gases exactly reproduce the low-$T$ critical properties of Luttinger liquids, so they can be used to characterize the fixed points of the latter. Generalized ideal gases with mutual statistics and non-ideal gases with Luttinger-type interactions have also similar behavior, controlled by an effective statistics varying in a fixed-point line.
