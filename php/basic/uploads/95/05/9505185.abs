Title: Nonvacuum pseudoparticles, quantum tunneling and metastability
Authors: J. -Q. Liang and H. J. W. Mueller-Kirsten
Abstract: It is shown that nonvacuum pseudoparticles can account for quantum tunneling and metastability. In particular the saddle-point nature of the pseudoparticles is demonstrated, and the evaluation of path-integrals in their neighbourhood. Finally the relation between instantons and bounces is used to derive a result conjectured by Bogomolny and Fateyev.
