Title: Exact Superpotentials, Quantum Vacua and Duality in Supersymmetric  SP(N_c) Gauge Theories
Authors: K. Intriligator and P. Pouliot
Abstract: We study $N=1$ supersymmetric $SP(N_c)$ gauge theories with $N_f$ flavors of quarks in the fundamental representation. Depending on $N_f$ and $N_c$, we find exact, dynamically generated superpotentials, smooth quantum moduli spaces of vacua, quantum moduli spaces of vacua with additional massless composites at strong coupling, confinement without chiral symmetry breaking, non-trivial fixed points of the renormalization group, and massless magnetic quarks and gluons.
