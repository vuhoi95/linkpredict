Title: Superfield Form of Discrete Gauge States in $\hat c=1$ 2d Supergravity
Authors: Tze-Dan Chung and Jen-Chi Lee
Abstract: A general formula for the discrete states (Neveu-Schwarz sector) in $N=1$ $2D$ super-Liouville theory is written down in the world-sheet supersymmetric form. We then derive a set of gauge states at the discrete momenta. These discrete gauge states are shown to carry the $w_\infty$ charges and serve as the symmetry parameters in the old covariant quantization of the theory.
