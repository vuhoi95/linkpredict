Title: BV QUANTIZATION OF A VECTOR-TENSOR GAUGE THEORY WITH TOPOLOGICAL  COUPLING
Authors: R. Amorim and J. Barcelos-Neto
Abstract: We use the BV quantization method for a theory with coupled tensor and vector gauge fields through a topological term. We consider in details the reducibility of the tensorial sector as well as the appearance of a mass term in the effective vectorial theory .
