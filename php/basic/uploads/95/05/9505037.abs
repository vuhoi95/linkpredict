Title: The electrically charged BTZ black hole with self(anti-self) dual  Maxwell field
Authors: Masaru Kamata and Takao Koikawa
Abstract: The Einstein-Maxwell equations with a negative cosmological constant in 2+1 spacetime dimensions discussed by Banados, Teitelboim and Zanelli are solved by assuming a self(anti-self)dual equation. The solution describes an electrically charged extreme black hole with an angular momentum.
