Title: $N=2$ Super-$W_3^{(2)}$ Algebra in Superfields
Authors: E. Ivanov and S. Krivonos and A. Sorin
Abstract: We present a manifestly $N=2$ supersymmetric formulation of $N=2$ super-$W_3^{(2)}$ algebra (its classical version) in terms of the spin 1 unconstrained supercurrent generating a $N=2$ superconformal subalgebra and the spins 1/2, 2 bosonic and spins 1/2, 2 fermionic constrained supercurrents. We consider a superfield reduction of $N=2$ super-$W_3^{(2)}$ to $N=2$ super-$W_3$ and construct a family of evolution equations for which $N=2$ super-$W_3^{(2)}$ provides the second hamiltonian structure.
