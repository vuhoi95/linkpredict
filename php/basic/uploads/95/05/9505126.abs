Title: Costituent Quark Picture out of QCD in two dimensions - on the  Light-Cone
Authors: Matthias Heyssler and Alex C. Kalloniatis
Abstract: Using DLCQ as a nonperturbative method, we test Fock-space truncations in ${\rm QCD}_{1+1}$ by studying the mass spectra of hadrons in colour SU(2) and SU(3) at finite harmonic resolution $K$. We include $q\bar q q\bar q$ states for mesons and up to $qqq q\bar q$ states for baryons. With this truncation, we give `predictions' for the masses of the first five states where finite $K$ effects are minimal.
