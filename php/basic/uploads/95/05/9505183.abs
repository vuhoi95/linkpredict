Title: All Loop N=2 String Amplitudes
Authors: Hirosi Ooguri and Cumrun Vafa
Abstract: Using the N=4 topological reformulation of N=2 strings, we compute all loop partition function for special compactifications of N=2 strings as a function of target moduli. We also reinterpret N=4 topological amplitudes in terms of slightly modified N=2 topological amplitudes. We present some preliminary evidence for the conjecture that N=2 strings is the large N limit of Holomorphic Yang-Mills in 4 dimensions.
