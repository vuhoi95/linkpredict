Title: A Soluble Model of Four-Fermion Interactions in de Sitter Space
Authors: T. Inagaki and S. Mukaigawa and T. Muta
Abstract: We consider the theory of four-fermion interactions with N-component fermions in de Sitter space. It is found that the effective potential for a composite operator in the theory is calculable in the leading order of the 1/N expansion. The resulting effective potential is analyzed by varying both the four-fermion coupling constant and the curvature of the space-time. The critical curvature at which the dynamically generated fermion mass disappears is found to exist and is calculated analytically. The dynamical fermion mass is expressed as a function of the space-time curvature.
