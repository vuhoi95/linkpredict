Title: The Gervais-Neveu-Felder equation and the quantum Calogero-Moser systems
Authors: J. Avan and O. Babelon and E. Billey
Abstract: We quantize the spin Calogero-Moser model in the $R$-matrix formalism. The quantum $R$-matrix of the model is dynamical. This $R$-matrix has already appeared in Gervais-Neveu's quantization of Toda field theory and in Felder's quantization of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard equation.
