Title: The path integral for Chern-Simons quantum mechanics
Authors: Silvio J. Rabello and Arvind N. Vaidya
Abstract: The path integral representation for a system of N non-relativistic particles on the plane, interacting through a Chern-Simons gauge field, is obtained from the operator formalism. An effective interaction between the particles appears, generating the usual Aharonov-Bohm phases. The spin-statistics relation is also considered.
