Title: Fermionic fluctuation corrections to bubble nucleation
Authors: J. Baacke and A. Suerig
Abstract: We determine the fermionic corrections to the nucleation rate of bubbles at the electroweak phase transition. The fermion determinant is evaluated exactly and by using the gradient expansion. The gradient expansion is found to be a reliable approximation and is used to extrapolate to the large values of $\nu_n = (2n+1)\pi T$ needed in the Matsubara sum. The contribution to effective action is found to be negative and to be given, essentially, by the gradient terms, the finite part of the wave function renormalization. Only the top quark contribution is evaluated, it is of the same order as the Higgs- and W-boson contributions found previously, but of opposite sign.
