Title: Maximally Supersymmetric String Theories in D<10
Authors: Shyamoli Chaudhuri and G. Hockney and Joseph D. Lykken
Abstract: The existence of maximally supersymmetric solutions to heterotic string theory that are not toroidal compactifications of the ten-dimensional superstring is established. We construct an exact fermionic realization of an N=1 supersymmetric string theory in D=8 with non-simply-laced gauge group Sp(20). Toroidal compactification to six and four dimensions gives maximally extended supersymmetric theories with reduced rank (4,12) and (6,14) respectively.
