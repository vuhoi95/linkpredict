Title: An alternative BRST operator for topological Landau-Ginzburg models
Authors: F. De Jonghe and P. Termonia and W. Troost and S. Vandoren
Abstract: We propose a new BRST operator for the B-twist of $N=2$ Landau-Ginzburg (LG) models. It solves the problem of the fractional ghost numbers of Vafa's old BRST operator and shows how the model is obtained by gauge fixing a zero action. An essential role is played by the anti-BRST operator,which is given by one of the supersymmetries of the $N=2$ algebra. Its presence is needed in proving that the model is indeed a topological field theory. The space of physical observables, defined by taking the anti-BRST cohomology in the BRST cohomology groups, is unchanged.
