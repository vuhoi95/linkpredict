Title: Area-preserving Structure and Anomalies in 1+1-dimensional Quantum  Gravity
Authors: G. Amelino-Camelia and D. Bak and D. Seminara
Abstract: We investigate the gauge-independent Hamiltonian formulation and the anomalous Ward identities of a matter-induced 1+1-dimensional gravity theory invariant under Weyl transformations and area-preserving diffeomorphisms, and compare the results to the ones for the conventional diffeomorphism-invariant theory. We find that, in spite of several technical differences encountered in the analysis, the two theories are essentially equivalent.
