Title: $gl(n|m)$ color Calogero-Sutherland models and Super Yangian Algebra
Authors: C. Ahn and W. M. Koo
Abstract: A supersymmetric extension of the color Calogero-Sutherland model is considered based on the Yangian $Y(gl(n|m))$. The algebraic structure of the model is discussed in some details. We show that the commuting conserved quantities can be generated from the super-quantum determinant, thus establishing the integrability of the model. In addition, rational limit of the model is studied where the Yangian symmetry degenerates into a super loop algebra.
