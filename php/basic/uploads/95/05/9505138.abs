Title: Boundary Reflection Matrix for $D_4^{(1)}$ Affine Toda Field Theory
Authors: J. D. Kim and H. S. Cho
Abstract: We present one loop boundary reflection matrix for $d_4^{(1)}$ Toda field theory defined on a half line with the Neumann boundary condition. This result demonstrates a nontrivial cancellation of non-meromorphic terms which are present when the model has a particle spectrum with more than one mass. Using this result, we determine uniquely the exact boundary reflection matrix which turns out to be \lq non-minimal' if we assume the strong-weak coupling \lq duality'.
