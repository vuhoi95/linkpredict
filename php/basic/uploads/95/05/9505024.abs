Title: On critical behaviour in gravitational collapse
Authors: Viqar Husain and Erik A. Martinez and Dario Nunez
Abstract: We give an approach to studying the critical behaviour that has been observed in numerical studies of gravitational collapse. These studies suggest, among other things, that black holes initially form with infinitesimal mass. We show generally how a black hole mass formula can be extracted from a transcendental equation. Using our approach, we give an explicit one parameter set of metrics that are asymptotically flat and describe the collapse of apriori unspecified but physical matter fields. The black hole mass formula obtained from this metric exhibits a mass gap - that is, at the onset of black hole formation, the mass is finite and non-zero.
