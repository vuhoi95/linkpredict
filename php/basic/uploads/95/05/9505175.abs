Title: Towards Finite Quantum Field Theory in Non-Commutative Geometry
Authors: H. Grosse and C. Klimcik and P. Presnajder
Abstract: We describe the self-interacting scalar field on the truncated sphere and we perform the quantization using the functional (path) integral approach. The theory posseses a full symmetry with respect to the isometries of the sphere. We explicitely show that the model is finite and the UV-regularization automatically takes place.
