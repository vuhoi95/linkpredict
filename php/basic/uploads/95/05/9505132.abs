Title: Dilaton Gravity Coupled to a Nonlinear Sigma Model in $2+Îµ$  Dimensions
Authors: S. Kojima and N. Sakai and Y. Tanii
Abstract: Quantum theory of dilaton gravity coupled to a nonlinear sigma model with a maximally symmetric target space is studied in $2+\epsilon$ dimensions. The ultraviolet stable fixed point for the curvature of the nonlinear sigma model demands a new fixed point theory for the dilaton coupling function. The fixed point of the dilaton coupling is a saddle point similarly to the previous case of the flat target space.
