Title: Isometries of special manifolds
Authors: B. de Wit and A. Van Proeyen
Abstract: We describe special Ka\"hler geometry, special quaternionic manifolds, and very special real manifolds and analyze the structure of their isometries. The classification of the homogeneous manifolds of these types is presented.
