Title: Duality of Sp(2N) and SO(N) Supersymmetric Gauge Theories with Adjoint  Matter
Authors: R. G. Leigh and M. J. Strassler
Abstract: We discuss electric-magnetic duality in two new classes of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. The models have gauge group $Sp(2\nc)$ or $SO(\nc)$ with matter in both the adjoint and defining representations. By perturbing these theories with various superpotentials, we find a variety of new infrared fixed points with dual descriptions. This work is complementary to that of Kutasov and Schwimmer on $SU(\nc)$ and of Intriligator on other models involving $Sp(2\nc)$ and $SO(\nc)$.
