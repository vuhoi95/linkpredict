Title: Crystalline Spinon Basis for RSOS Models
Authors: Atsushi Nakayashiki and Yasuhiko Yamada
Abstract: The crystalline spinon basis for the RSOS models associated with $\widehat{sl_2}$ is studied. This basis gives fermionic type character formulas for the branching coefficients of the coset $(\widehat{sl_2})_l \times (\widehat{sl_2})_N/(\widehat{sl_2})_{l+N}$. In addition the path description of the parafermion characters is found as a limit of the spinon description of the string functions.
