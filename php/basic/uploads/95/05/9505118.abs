Title: Integrable Systems and W-Algebras
Authors: C. R. Fernández-Pousa and M. V. Gallas and J. L. Miramontes and J. Sánchez Guillén
Abstract: The basic concepts underlying our analysis of {\it W-algebras} as extended symmetries of integrable systems are summarized. The construction starts from the second hamiltonian structure of ``Generalized Drinfel'd-Sokolov'' hierarchies, and its correspondence with the $A_1$-embeddings is established, providing a rather simple and general scheme.
