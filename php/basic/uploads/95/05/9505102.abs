Title: Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz and Threefold Triangulations
Authors: F. Gliozzi and R. Tateo
Abstract: In the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz approach to 2D integrable, ADE-related quantum field theories one derives a set of algebraic functional equations (a Y-system) which play a prominent role. This set of equations is mapped into the problem of finding finite triangulations of certain 3D manifolds. This mapping allows us to find a general explanation of the periodicity of the Y-system. For the $A_N$ related theories and more generally for the various restrictions of the fractionally-supersymmetric sine-Gordon models, we find an explicit, surprisingly simple solution of such functional equations in terms of a single unknown function of the rapidity. The recently-found dilogarithm functional equations associated to the Y-system simply express the invariance of the volume of a manifold for deformations of its triangulations.
