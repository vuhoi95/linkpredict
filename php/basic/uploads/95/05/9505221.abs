Title: RENORMALISATION GROUP AIDED FINITE TEMPERATURE REDUCTION OF QUANTUM  FIELD THEORIES
Authors: A. Patk√≥s and P. Petreczky and J. Polonyi
Abstract: Dimensional reduction of finite temperature quantum field theories can be improved with help of continous renormalisation group steps. The method is applied to the integration of the lowest non-static ($n=\pm 1$) modes of the finite temperature $\Phi^4$-theory. A second, physically important application is the integration of the Debye-screened ${\bf A_0}(x)$ static scalar potential in the gauged SU(2) Higgs model.
