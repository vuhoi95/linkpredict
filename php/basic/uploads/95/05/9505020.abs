Title: MIRROR SYMMETRY IN THE FEW ANYON SPECTRA IN A HARMONIC OSCILLATOR  POTENTIAL
Authors: Ranjan K. Ghosh and Sumathi Rao
Abstract: We find that the energy spectra of four and five anyons in a harmonic potential exhibit some mirror symmetric (reflection symmetric about the semionic statistics point $\theta=\pi/2$) features analogous to the mirror symmetry in the two and three anyon spectra. However, since the $\ell=0$ sector remains non-mirror symmetric, the fourth and fifth virial coeffients do not reflect this symmetry.
