Title: The Conformal Spin and Statistics Theorem
Authors: Daniele Guido and Roberto Longo
Abstract: We prove the equality between the statistics phase and the conformal univalence for a superselection sector with finite index in Conformal Quantum Field Theory on $S^1$. A relevant point is the description of the PCT symmetry and the construction of the global conjugate charge.
