Title: Anyons as spinning particles
Authors: J. L. Cortes and M. S. Plyushchay
Abstract: A model-independent formulation of anyons as spinning particles is presented. The general properties of the classical theory of (2+1)-dimensional relativistic fractional spin particles and some properties of their quantum theory are investigated. The relationship between all the known approaches to anyons as spinning particles is established. Some widespread misleading notions on the general properties of (2+1)-dimensional anyons are removed.
