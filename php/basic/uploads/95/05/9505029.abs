Title: Quaternionic Monopoles
Authors: Ch. Okonek and A. Teleman
Abstract: We present the simplest non-abelian version of Seiberg-Witten theory: Quaternionic monopoles. These monopoles are associated with Spin^h(4)-structures on 4-manifolds and form finite-dimensional moduli spaces. On a Kahler surface the quaternionic monopole equations decouple and lead to the projective vortex equation for holomorphic pairs. This vortex equation comes from a moment map and gives rise to a new complex-geometric stability concept. The moduli spaces of quaternionic monopoles on Kahler surfaces have two closed subspaces, both naturally isomorphic with moduli spaces of canonically stable holomorphic pairs. These components intersect along Donaldsons instanton space and can be compactified with Seiberg-Witten moduli spaces. This should provide a link between the two corresponding theories. Notes: To appear in CMP The revised version contains more details concerning the Uhlenbeck compactfication of the moduli space of quaternionic monopoles, and possible applications are discussed. Attention ! Due to an ununderstandable mistake, the duke server had replaced all the symbols "=" by "=3D" in the tex-file of the revised version we sent on February, the 2-nd. The command "\def{\ad}" had also been damaged !
