Title: Zeta function determinant of the Laplace operator on the $D$-dimensional  ball
Authors: M. Bordag and B. Geyer and K. Kirsten and E. Elizalde
Abstract: We present a direct approach for the calculation of functional determinants of the Laplace operator on balls. Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions are considered. Using this approach, formulas for any value of the dimension, $D$, of the ball, can be obtained quite easily. Explicit results are presented here for dimensions $D=2,3,4,5$ and $6$.
