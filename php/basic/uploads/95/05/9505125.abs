Title: Structure of Primordial Gravitational Waves Spectrum in a Double  Inflationary Model
Authors: David Polarski and Alexei A. Starobinsky
Abstract: The gravitational waves (GW) background generated in a double inflationary model, with two scalar fields mutually interacting through gravity only, and its relative contribution $T/S$ to large-angle temperature fluctuations of the relic microwave background are investigated in detail. The relation between $T/S$ and the slope of the GW spectrum $n_T$ is shown to be a discriminative test between a slow-roll inflation driven by one scalar field and more complicated models. It is found that the GW amplitude is not exactly zero in minima of spectral oscillations, this property being an observational, in principle, manifestation of GW being in a squeezed vacuum state during inflation.
