Title: Integrability and Seiberg-Witten Exact Solution
Authors: A. Gorsky and I. Krichever and A. Marshakov and A. Mironov and A. Morozov
Abstract: The exact Seiberg-Witten (SW) description of the light sector in the $N=2$ SUSY $4d$ Yang-Mills theory is reformulated in terms of integrable systems and appears to be a Gurevich-Pitaevsky (GP) solution to the elliptic Whitham equations. We consider this as an implication that dynamical mechanism behind the SW solution is related to integrable systems on the moduli space of instantons. We emphasize the role of the Whitham theory as a possible substitute of the renormalization-group approach to the construction of low-energy effective actions.
