Title: ON THE EQUIVALENCE AMONG SOME CHIRAL-BOSON THEORIES
Authors: R. Amorim and J. Barcelos-Neto
Abstract: We make a comparative study of chiral-boson theories in the Florenani-Jackiw (FJ) and linear constraint formulations. A special attention is given to the case with an improved way of implementing the linear constraint. We show that it has the same spectrum of the FJ formulation.
