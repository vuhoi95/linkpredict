Title: LATTICE CONFORMAL THEORIES AND THEIR INTEGRABLE PERTURBATIONS
Authors: A. V. Antonov and A. A. Belov and K. Chaltikian
Abstract: We consider lattice analogues of some conformal theories, including WZW and Toda models. We describe discrete versions of Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction and Sugawara construction for the WZW model. We formulate perturbation theory in chiral sector. We describe the spaces of Integrals of Motion in the perturbed theories. We interpret the perturbed WZW model in terms of NLS hierarchy and obtain of this model into the lattice KP-hierarchy.
