Abstract: A level-0 action of $U_q(\widehat{sl}_2)$ is defined on the sum of level-1 irreducible highest weight modules. With the aid of the affine Hecke algebras, this action is realized on the basis created by the vertex operators. This is a $q$-analogue of the Yangian symmetry in conformal field theory.
