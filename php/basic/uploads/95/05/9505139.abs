Title: Weyl Invariance and Black Hole Evaporation
Authors: J. Navarro-Salas and M. Navarro and C. F. Talavera
Abstract: We consider the semiclassical dynamics of CGHS black holes with a Weyl-invariant effective action for conformal matter. The trace anomaly of Polyakov effective action is converted into the Virasoro anomaly thus leading to the same flux of Hawking radiation. The covariance of semiclassical equations can be restored through a non-local redefinition of the metric-dilaton fields. The resulting theory turns out to be equivalent to the RST model. This provides a mechanism to solve semiclassical equations of 2D dilaton gravity coupled to conformal matter for classically soluble models.
