Title: Entanglement Entropy of Nontrivial States
Authors: Eric Benedict and So-Young Pi
Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy arising from coherent states and one--particle states. We show that it is possible to define a finite entanglement entropy by subtracting the vacuum entropy from that of the considered states, when the unobserved region is the same.
