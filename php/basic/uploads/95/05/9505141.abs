Title: A Quasiperiodic Gibbons--Hawking Metric and Spacetime Foam
Authors: Serdar Nergiz and Cihan Saclioglu
Abstract: We present a quasiperiodic self-dual metric of the Gibbons--Hawking type with one gravitational instanton per spacetime cell. The solution, based on an adaptation of Weierstrassian $\zeta$ and $\sigma$ functions to three dimensions, conforms to a definition of spacetime foam given by Hawking.
