Title: Curves of Marginal Stability in N=2 Super-QCD
Authors: Philip C. Argyres and Alon E. Faraggi and Alfred D. Shapere
Abstract: We present a simple argument determining the shape of the curves of marginal stability in the N=2 supersymmetric SU(2) QCD with less than 4 massless flavors. The argument relies only on the modular properties of $a_D/a$ and its weak-coupling behavior.
