Title: GENERALIZED THERMAL ZETA-FUNCTIONS
Authors: H. Boschi-Filho and C. Farina
Abstract: We calculate the partition function of a harmonic oscillator with quasi-periodic boundary conditions using the zeta-function method. This work generalizes a previous one by Gibbons and contains the usual bosonic and fermionic oscillators as particular cases. We give an alternative prescription for the analytic extension of the generalized Epstein function involved in the calculation of the generalized thermal zeta-functions. We also conjecture about the relation of our calculation to anyonic systems.
