Title: (2,2) Supergravity in the Light-Cone gauge
Authors: M. T. Grisaru and M. E. Wehlau
Abstract: Starting with the prepotential description of two-dimensional $(2,2)$ supergravity we use local supersymmetry transformations to go to light-cone gauge. We discuss properties of the theory in this gauge and derive Ward identities for correlation functions defined with respect to the induced supergravity action.
