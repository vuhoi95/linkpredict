Title: Universality of the Tearing Phase in Matrix Models
Authors: Giovanni M. Cicuta and Luca Molinari and Sebastiano Stramaglia
Abstract: The spontaneous symmetry breaking associated to the tearing of a random surface, where large dynamical holes fill the surface, was recently analized obtaining a non-universal critical exponent on a border phase. Here the issue of universality is explained by an independent analysis. The one hole sector of the model is useful to manifest the origin of the (limited) non-universal behaviour, that is the existence of two inequivalent critical points.
