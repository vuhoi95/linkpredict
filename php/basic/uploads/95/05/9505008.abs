Title: Minimal Unitary Models and The Closed SU(2)-q Invariant Spin Chain
Authors: Silvio Pallua and Predrag Prester
Abstract: We consider the Hamiltonian of the closed $SU(2)_{q}$ invariant chain. We project a particular class of statistical models belonging to the unitary minimal series. A particular model corresponds to a particular value of the coupling constant. The operator content is derived. This class of models has charge-dependent boundary conditions. In simple cases (Ising, 3-state Potts) corresponding Hamiltonians are constructed. These are non-local as the original spin chain.
