Title: Lattice effective potential of massless $(λΦ^4)_4$:  `triviality' and spontaneous symmetry breaking

Abstract: We present a precise lattice computation of the slope of the effective potential for massless $(\lambda\Phi^4)_4$ theory in the region of bare parameters indicated by the Brahm's analysis of lattice data. Our results confirm the existence on the lattice of a remarkable phase of $(\lambda\Phi^4)_4$ where Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking is generated through ``dimensional transmutation''. The resulting effective potential shows no evidence for residual self-interaction effects of the shifted `Higgs' field $h(x)=\Phi(x)-\langle\Phi\rangle$, as predicted by ``triviality'', and cannot be reproduced in perturbation theory. Accordingly the mass of the Higgs particle, by itself, does not represent a measure of any observable interaction.
