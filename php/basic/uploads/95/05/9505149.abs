Title: TOPOLOGICAL MATTER, MIRROR SYMMETRY AND NON-CRITICAL (SUPER)STRINGS
Authors: A. V. Ramallo and J. M. Sanchez de Santos
Abstract: We study the realization of the (super) conformal topological symmetry in two-dimensional field theories. The mirror automorphism of the topological algebra is represented as a reflection in the space of fields. As a consequence, a double BRST structure for topological matter theories is found. It is shown that the implementation of the topological symmetry in non-critical (super)string theories depends on the matter content of the two realizations connected by the mirror transformation.
