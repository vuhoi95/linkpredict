Title: Is There Quantum Gravity in Two Dimensions?
Authors: Wolfgang Beirl and Bernd A. Berg
Abstract: A hybrid model which allows to interpolate between the (original) Regge approach and dynamical triangulations is introduced. The gained flexibility in the measure is exploited to study dynamical triangulation in a fixed geometry. Our numerical results support KPZ exponents. A critical assessment concerning the apparent lack of gravitational effects in two dimensions follows.
