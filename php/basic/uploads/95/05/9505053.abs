Title: A One-Loop Test Of String Duality
Authors: Cumrun Vafa and Edward Witten
Abstract: We test type IIA-heterotic string duality in six dimensions by showing that the sigma model anomaly of the heterotic string is generated by a combination of a tree level and a string one-loop correction on the type IIA side.
