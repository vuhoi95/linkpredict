Title: A SUPERSPACE FORMULATION FOR THE BATALIN VILKOVISKY FORMALISM WITH  EXTENDED BRST INVARIANCE
Authors: Nelson R. F. Braga and Sergio M. de Souza
Abstract: A superspace formulation for the Batalin Vilkovisky formalism (also called field-antifield quantization ) with extended BRST invariance (BRST and anti-BRST invariance ) for gauge theories with closed algebra is presented. In contrast to a recent formulation, where only BRST invariance holds off shell, two collective sets of fields are introduced and an off shell realization of the extended algebra in a superspace with two Grassmann coordinates is obtained. The example of the Yang Mills theory is also considered.
