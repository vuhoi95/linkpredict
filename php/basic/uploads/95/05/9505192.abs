Title: COMMENTS ABOUT HIGGS FIELDS, NONCOMMUTATIVE GEOMETRY AND THE STANDARD  MODEL
Authors: G. Cammarata and R. Coquereaux
Abstract: We make a short review of the formalism that describes Higgs and Yang Mills fields as two particular cases of an appropriate generalization of the notion of connection. We also comment about the several variants of this formalism, their interest, the relations with noncommutative geometry, the existence (or lack of existence) of phenomenological predictions, the relation with Lie super-algebras etc.
