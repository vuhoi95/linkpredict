Title: New Phenomena in SU(3) Supersymmetric Gauge Theory
Authors: Philip C. Argyres and Michael R. Douglas
Abstract: We show that four-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric SU(n) gauge theory for n>2 necessarily contains vacua with mutually non-local massless dyons, using only analyticity of the effective action and the weak coupling limit of the moduli space of vacua. A specific example is the Z_3 point in the exact solution for SU(3), and we study its effective Lagrangian. We propose that the low-energy theory at this point is an N=2 superconformal U(1) gauge theory containing both electrically and magnetically charged massless hypermultiplets.
