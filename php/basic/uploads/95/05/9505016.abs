Abstract: The possible cosmological effects of primordial fluctuation corrections to the evolution equation of matter obtained from the Wheeler--De Witt equation are explored. In particular, both the metric and a scalar matter field are expanded around their homogeneous values and the corrections induced on the scalar field fluctuation spectrum are perturbatively estimated. Finally, results of a preliminary numerical simulation to investigate the effects on large--scale structure formation are presented.
