Title: CLASSICAL SPLITTING OF FUNDAMENTAL STRINGS
Authors: H. J. de Vega and J. Ramírez Mittelbrunn and M. Ramón Medrano and N. Sánchez
Abstract: We find exact solutions of the string equations of motion and constraints describing the {\em classical}\ splitting of a string into two. We show that for the same Cauchy data, the strings that split have {\bf smaller} action than the string without splitting. This phenomenon is already present in flat space-time. The mass, energy and momentum carried out by the strings are computed. We show that the splitting solution describes a natural decay process of one string of mass $M$ into two strings with a smaller total mass and some kinetic energy. The standard non-splitting solution is contained as a particular case. We also describe the splitting of a closed string in the background of a singular gravitational plane wave, and show how the presence of the strong gravitational field increases (and amplifies by an overall factor) the negative difference between the action of the splitting and non-splitting solutions.
