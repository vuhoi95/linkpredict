Title: Embedding of the Bosonic String into the $W_3$ String
Authors: H. Lu and C. N. Pope and K. S. Stelle and K. W. Xu
Abstract: We investigate new realisations of the $W_3$ algebra with arbitrary central charge, making use of the fact that this algebra can be linearised by the inclusion of a spin-1 current. We use the new realisations with $c=102$ and $c=100$ to build non-critical and critical $W_3$ BRST operators. Both of these can be converted by local canonical transformations into a BRST operator for the Virasoro string with $c=28-2$, together with a Kugo-Ojima topological term. Consequently, these new realisations provide embeddings of the Virasoro string into non-critical and critical $W_3$ strings.
