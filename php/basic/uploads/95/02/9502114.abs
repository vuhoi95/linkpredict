Title: Stability Analysis of the Dilatonic Black Hole in Two Dimensions
Authors: Won T. Kim and Julian Lee and Young Jai Park
Abstract: We explicitly show that the net number of degrees of freedom in the two-dimensional dilaton gravity is zero through the Hamiltonian constraint analysis. This implies that the local space-time dependent physical excitations do not exist. From the linear perturbation around the black hole background, we explicitly prove that the exponentially growing mode with time is in fact eliminated outside the horizon. Therefore, the two-dimensional dilation gravity is essentially stable.
