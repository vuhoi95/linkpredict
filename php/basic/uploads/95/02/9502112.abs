Title: VON NEUMANN AND SHANNON-WEHRL ENTROPY FOR SQUEEZED STATES AND  COSMOLOGICAL PARTICLE PRODUCTION
Authors: M. Gasperini and M. Giovannini
Abstract: We show that the effective coarse graining of a two-mode squeezed density matrix, implicit in the Wehrl approaches to a semiclassical phase-space distribution, leads to results in agreement with previous different definitions of entropy for the process of pair production from the vacuum. We also present, in this context, a possible interpretation of the entropy growth as an amplification (due to the squeezing) of our lack of knowledge about the initial conditions, which gives rise to an effective decoherence of the squeezed density matrix.
