Title: Classical Solution of Two Dimensional $R^2$-Gravity and Cross-Over  Phenomenon
Authors: S. ICHINOSE and N. TSUDA and T. YUKAWA
Abstract: Two dimensional quantum R$^2$-gravity and its phase structure are examined in the semiclassical approach and compared with the results of the numerical simulation. Three phases are succinctly characterized by the effective action. A classical solution of R$^2$-Liouville equation is obtained by use of the solution of the ordinary Liouville equation. The partition function is obtained analytically. A toatal derivative term (surface term) plays an important role there. It is shown that the classical solution can sufficiently account for the cross-over transition of the surface property seen in the numerical simulation.
