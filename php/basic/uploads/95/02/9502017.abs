Title: LINEAR CONNECTIONS ON EXTENDED SPACE-TIME
Authors: A. Kehagias and J. Madore and J. Mourad and G. Zoupanos
Abstract: A modification of Kaluza-Klein theory is proposed which is general enough to admit an arbitrary finite noncommutative internal geometry. It is shown that the existence of a non-trival extension to the total geometry of a linear connection on space-time places severe restrictions on the structure of the noncommutative factor. A counter-example is given.
