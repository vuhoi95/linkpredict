Title: Color Confinement in Perturbation Theory from a Topological Model,
Authors: Hiroyuki Hata and Yusuke Taniguchi
Abstract: Color confinement by the mechanism of Kugo and Ojima can treat confinement of any quantized color carrying fields including dynamical quarks. However, the non-perturbative condition for this confinement has been known to be satisfied only in the pure-gauge model (PGM), which is a topological model without physical degrees of freedom. Here we analyze the Yang-Mills theory by adding physical degrees of freedom as perturbation to PGM. We find that quarks and gluons are indeed confined in this perturbation theory.
