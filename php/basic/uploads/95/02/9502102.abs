Title: Six-body Light-Front Tamm-Dancoff approximation and wave functions for  the massive Schwinger model
Authors: Koji Harada and Atsusi Okazaki and Masa-aki Taniguchi
Abstract: The spectrum of the massive Schwinger model in the strong coupling region is obtained by using the light-front Tamm-Dancoff (LFTD) approximation up to including six-body states. We numerically confirm that the two-meson bound state has a negligibly small six-body component. Emphasis is on the usefulness of the information about states (wave functions). It is used for identifying the three-meson bound state among the states below the three-meson threshold. We also show that the two-meson bound state is well described by the wave function of the relative motion.
