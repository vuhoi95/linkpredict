Title: BRST - BFV analysis of anomalies in bosonic string theory interacting  with background gravitational field
Authors: I. L. Buchbinder and B. R. Mistchuk and V. D. Pershin
Abstract: The general BRST-BFV analysis of anomaly in the string theory coupled to background fields is carried out. An exact equation for c-valued symbol of anomaly operator is found and structure of its solutions is studied.
