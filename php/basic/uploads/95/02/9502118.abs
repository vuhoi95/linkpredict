Title: Fermionic Sum Representations for the Virasoro Characters of the Unitary  Superconformal Minimal Models
Authors: Ernest Baver and Doron Gepner
Abstract: We present fermionic sum representation for the general Virasoro character of the unitary minimal superconformal series ($N=1$). Example of the corresponding ``finitizated" identities relating corner transfer matrix polynomials with fermionic companions is considered. These identities in the thermodynamic limit lead to the generalized Rogers-Ramanujan identities.
