Title: QUANTUM CORRECTIONS AND EXTREMAL BLACK HOLES
Authors: G. Alejandro and F. D. Mazzitelli and C. Núñez
Abstract: We consider static solutions of two dimensional dilaton gravity models as toy laboratories to address the question of the final fate of black holes. A non perturbative correction to the CGHS potential term is shown to lead classically to an extremal black hole geometry, thus providing a plausible solution to Hawking evaporation paradox. However, the full quantum theory does not admit an extremal solution.
