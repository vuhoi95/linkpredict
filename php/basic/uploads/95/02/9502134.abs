Title: RENORMALIZATION GROUP SOLUTION FOR THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL RANDOM BOND POTTS  MODEL WITH BROKEN REPLICA SYMMETRY
Authors: Viktor Dotsenko and Vladimir Dotsenko and Marco Picco and Pierre Pujol
Abstract: We find a new solution of the renormalization group for the Potts model with ferromagnetic random valued coupling constants. The solution exhibits universality and broken replica symmetry. It is argued that the model reaches this universality class if the replica symmetry is broken initially. Otherwise the model stays with the replica symmetric renormalization group flow and reaches the fixed point which has been considered before.
