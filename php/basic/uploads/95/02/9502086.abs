Title: Instability of the R^3\times S^1 vacuum in low-energy effective string  theory
Authors: Mariano Cadoni and Marco Cavaglia'
Abstract: We present and discuss an euclidean solution of the low-energy effective string action that can be interpreded as a semiclassical decay process of the ground state of the theory.
