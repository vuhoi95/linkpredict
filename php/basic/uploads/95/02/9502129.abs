Title: Non-diagonal solutions to reflection equations in $su(n)$ spin chains
Authors: J. Abad and M. Rios
Abstract: The reflection equations in a $su(3)$ spin chain with open boundary conditions are analyzed. We find non diagonal solutions to the boundary matrices. The corresponding hamiltonian is given. The solutions are generalized to $su(n)$.
