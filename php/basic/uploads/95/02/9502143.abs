Title: TWISTOR-LIKE SUPERPARTICLES REVISITED.
Authors: I. Bandos and A. Nurmagambetov and D. Sorokin and D. Volkov
Abstract: We consider a formulation of N=1 D=3,4 and 6 superparticle mechanics, which is manifestly supersymmetric on the worldline and in the target superspace. For the construction of the action we use only geometrical objects that characterize the embedding of the worldline superspace into the target superspace, such as target superspace coordinates of the superparticle and twistor components. The action does not contain the Lagrange multipliers which may cause the problem of infinite reducible symmetries, and, in fact, is a worldline superfield generalization of the supertwistor description of superparticle dynamics.
