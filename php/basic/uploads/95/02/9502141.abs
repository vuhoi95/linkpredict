Title: ON THE GENERALIZED ACTION PRINCIPLE FOR SUPERSTRINGS AND SUPERMEMBRANES
Authors: Igor Bandos and Dmitrij Sorokin and Dmitrij Volkov
Abstract: We revise the twistor--like superfield approach to describing super--p--branes by use of the basic principles of the group--manifold approach \cite{rheo}. A super--p--brane action is constructed solely of geometrical objects as the integral over a (p+1)--surface. The Lagrangian is the external product of supervielbein differential forms in world supersurface and target superspace without any use of Lagrange multipliers. This allows one to escape the problem of infinite irreducible symmetries and redundant propagating fields. All the constraints on the geometry of world supersurface and the conditions of its embedding into target superspace arise from the action as differential form equations.
