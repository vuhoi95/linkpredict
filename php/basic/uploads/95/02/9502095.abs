Title: Renormalization group analysis of electrons near a Van Hove singularity.
Authors: J. Gonzalez and F. Guinea and M. A. H. Vozmediano
Abstract: A model of interacting two dimensional electrons near a Van Hove singularity is studied, using renormalization group techniques. In hole doped systems, the chemical potential is found to be pinned near the singularity, when the electron-electron interactions are repulsive. The RG treatment of the leading divergences appearing in perturbation theory give rise to marginal behavior and anisotropic superconductivity.
