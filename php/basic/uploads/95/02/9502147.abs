Title: The three-dimensional BF Model with Cosmological Term in the Axial Gauge
Authors: A. Brandhuber and S. Emery and K. Landsteiner and M. Schweda
Abstract: We quantize the three-dimensional $BF$-model using axial gauge conditions. Exploiting the rich symmetry-structure of the model we show that the Green-functions correspond to tree graphs and can be obtained as the unique solution of the Ward-Identities. Furthermore, we will show that the theory can be uniquely determined by symmetry considerations without the need of an action principle.
