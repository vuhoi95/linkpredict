Title: Noncovariant Local Symmetry in Abelian Gauge Theories
Authors: Hyun Seok Yang and Bum-Hoon Lee
Abstract: We find non-covariant local symmetries in the Abelian gauge theories. The N\"other charges generating these symmetries are nilpotent as BRST charges, and they impose constraints on the physical states.
