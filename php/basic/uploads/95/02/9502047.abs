Title: $\varphif_{4}^{4}-$theory for antisymmetric tensor matter fields in  Minkowski space-time
Authors: V. Lemes and R. Renan and S. P. Sorella
Abstract: The nonabelian generalization of a recently proposed abelian axial gauge model for tensor matter fields is obtained. In both cases the model can be derived from a $\vf^{4}-$type theory for antisymmetric fields obeying a complex self-dual condition.
