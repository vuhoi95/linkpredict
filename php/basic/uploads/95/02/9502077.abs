Title: On Gauge Couplings in String Theory
Authors: Vadim Kaplunovsky and Jan Louis
Abstract: We investigate the field dependence of the gauge couplings of $N=1$ string vacua from the point of view of the low energy effective quantum field theory. We find that field-theoretical considerations severely constrain the form of the string loop corrections; in particular, the dilaton dependence of the gauge couplings is completely universal at the one-loop level. The moduli dependence of the string threshold corrections is also constrained, and we illustrate the power of such constraints with a detailed discussion of the orbifold vacua and the $(2,2)$ (Calabi-Yau) vacua of the heterotic string.
