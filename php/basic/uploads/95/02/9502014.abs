Title: A FAMILY OF NONLINEAR SCHRÃ–DINGER EQUATIONS: LINEARIZING  TRANSFORMATIONS AND RESULTING STRUCTURE
Authors: H. -D. Doebner and G. A. Goldin and P. Nattermann
Abstract: We examine a recently-proposed family of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 27:1771(1994)] with respect to a group of transformations that linearize a subfamily of them. We investigate the structure of the whole family with respect to the linearizing transformations, and propose a new, invariant parameterization.
