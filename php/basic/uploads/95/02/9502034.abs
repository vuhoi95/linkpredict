Title: QCD_3 Vacum Wave Function
Authors: Qi-Zhou Chen and Xiang-Qian Luo and Shuo-Hong Guo
Abstract: We investigate quantum chromodynamics in 2+1 dimensions ($\rm{QCD}_3$) using the Hamiltonian lattice field theory approach. The long wavelength structure of the ground state, which is closely related to the confinement phenomenon, is analyzed and its vacuum wave function is evaluated by means of the recently developed truncated eigenvalue equation method. The third order estimations show nice scaling for the physical quantities.
