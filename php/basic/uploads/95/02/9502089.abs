Title: Algebraic-geometrical formulation of two-dimensional quantum gravity
Authors: G. Bonelli and P. A. Marchetti and M. Matone
Abstract: We find a volume form on moduli space of double punctured Riemann surfaces whose integral satisfies the Painlev\'e I recursion relations of the genus expansion of the specific heat of 2D gravity. This allows us to express the asymptotic expansion of the specific heat as an integral on an infinite dimensional moduli space in the spirit of Friedan-Shenker approach. We outline a conjectural derivation of such recursion relations using the Duistermaat-Heckman theorem.
