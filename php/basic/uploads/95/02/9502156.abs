Title: Gauge theory renormalizations from the open bosonic string
Authors: P. Di Vecchia and A. Lerda and L. Magnea and R. Marotta
Abstract: We present a unified point of view on the different methods available in the literature to extract gauge theory renormalization constants from the low-energy limit of string theory. The Bern-Kosower method, based on an off-shell continuation of string theory amplitudes, and the construction of low-energy string theory effective actions for gauge particles, can both be understood in terms of strings interacting with background gauge fields, and thus reproduce, in the low-energy limit, the field theory results of the background field method. We present in particular a consistent off-shell continuation of the one-loop gluon amplitudes in the open bosonic string that reproduces exactly the results of the background field method in the Feynman gauge.
