Title: NAMBU-GOLDSTONE BOSON ON THE LIGHT-FRONT
Authors: Yoonbai Kim and Sho Tsujimaru and Koichi Yamawaki
Abstract: Spontaneous breakdown of the continuous symmetry is studied in the framework of discretized light-front quantization. We consider linear sigma model in 3+1 dimensions and show that the careful treatment of zero modes together with the regularization of the theory by introducing NG boson mass leads to the correct description of Nambu-Goldstone phase on the light-front.
