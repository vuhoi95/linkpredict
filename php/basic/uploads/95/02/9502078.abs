Title: ADM, Bondi mass, and energy conservation in two-dimensional dilaton  gravities
Authors: Won T. Kim and Julian Lee
Abstract: We show how a stress-energy pseudotensor can be constructed in two-dimensional dilatonic gravity theories (classical, CGHS and RST) and derive the expression for the ADM mass in these theories from it. We define the Bondi mass for these theories by using the pseudotensor formalism. The resulting expression is the generalization of the expression for the ADM mass. The boundary condition needed for the energy conservation is also investigated. It is shown that under appropriate boundary conditions, our definition of the Bondi mass is exactly the ADM mass minus the matter radiation energy at null infinity.
