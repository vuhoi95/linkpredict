Title: Type II Anyon Superconductivity
Authors: Jewan Kim and Jungdae Kim and Taejin Lee
Abstract: Assuming that the superconductivity which is described by the low energy effective action of the anyon system may be type II, we discuss its characteristics. We also study physical properties of the Chern-Simons vortices, which may be formed as the external magnetic field is applied to the system, such as their statistics, the free energy of single vortex and the interaction energy between two vortices.
