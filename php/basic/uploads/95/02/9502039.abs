Title: Diagonal $K$-matrices and transfer matrix eigenspectra associated with  the $G^{(1)}_2$ $R$-matrix
Authors: C. M. Yung and M. T. Batchelor
Abstract: We find all the diagonal $K$-matrices for the $R$-matrix associated with the minimal representation of the exceptional affine algebra $G^{(1)}_2$. The corresponding transfer matrices are diagonalized with a variation of the analytic Bethe ansatz. We find many similarities with the case of the Izergin-Korepin $R$-matrix associated with the affine algebra $A^{(2)}_2$.
