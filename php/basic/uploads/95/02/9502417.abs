Title: Cosmology with a TeV mass GUT Higgs
Authors: David H. Lyth and Ewan D. Stewart
Abstract: The most natural way to break the GUT gauge symmetry is with a Higgs field whose vacuum expectation value is of order $10^{16}\,\mbox{GeV}$ but whose mass is of order $10^2$ to $10^3\,\mbox{GeV}$. This can lead to a cosmological history radically different from what is usually assumed to have occurred between the standard inflationary and nucleosynthesis epochs, which may solve the gravitino and Polonyi/moduli problems in a natural way.
