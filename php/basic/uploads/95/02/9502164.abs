Title: Remarks on the structure constants of the Verlinde algebra associated to  $sl_3$
Authors: Giovanni Felder and Alexander Varchenko
Abstract: The structure constants $N_{\lambda, \mu}^{\mu+\nu}$ of the $sl_2$ Verlinde algebra as functions of $\mu$ either vanish or can be expressed after a change of variable as the weight function of an irreducible representation of $sl_2$. We give a similar formula in the $sl_3$ case.
