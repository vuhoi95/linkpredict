Abstract: We discuss bosonization in three dimensions of an $SU(N)$ massive Thirring model in the low-energy regime. We find that the bosonized theory is related (but not equal) to $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons gauge theory. For free massive fermions bosonization leads, at low energies, to the pure $SU(N)$ (level $k=1$) Chern-Simons theory.
