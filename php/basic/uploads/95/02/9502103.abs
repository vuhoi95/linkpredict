Authors: Andreas Peter and Joern M. Haeuser and Markus H. Thoma and Wolfgang Cassing
Abstract: We apply a truncated set of dynamical equations of motion for connected equal-time Green functions up to the 4-point level to the investigation of spontaneous ground state symmetry breaking in $\Phi^4_{2+1}$ quantum field theory. Within our momentum space discretization we obtain a second order phase transition as soon as the connected 3-point function is included. However, an additional inclusion of the connected 4-point function still shows a significant influence on the shape of the effective potential and the critical coupling.
