Title: Chiral Non-Fermi Liquids in 1-d
Authors: Natan Andrei and Michael R. Douglas and Andr√©s Jerez
Abstract: We study models of chiral interacting fermions by means of conformal and Bethe-Ansatz techniques, and determine their thermodynamic properties and asymptotic correlation functions. We identify a class of fixed points characterizing the infrared behavior of the models. They display {\it chirally stabilized} non Fermi-Liquid behavior characterized by universal exponents. A realization of these fluids may be found in the edge states of bilayered QHE systems. We calculate the universal temperature dependence of the staggered conductance in these systems.
