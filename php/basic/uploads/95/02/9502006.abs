Title: The Riesz-Clifford Functional Calculus for Non-Commuting Operators and  Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Vladimir V. Kisil and Enrique Ram√≠rez de Arellano
Abstract: We present a Riesz-like hyperholomorphic functional calculus for a set of non-commuting operators based on the Clifford analysis. Applications to the quantum field theory are described. Keywords: Functional calculus, Weyl calculus, Riesz calculus, Clifford analysis, quantization, quantum field theory. AMSMSC Primary:47A60, Secondary: 81T10
