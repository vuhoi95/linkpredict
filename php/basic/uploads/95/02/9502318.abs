Abstract: Motivated by four-dimensional superstring models, we consider the possibility of treating the Yukawa couplings of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) as dynamical variables of the effective theory at the electroweak scale. Assuming bottom-tau unification, we concentrate on the top and bottom Yukawa couplings, and find that minimizing the effective potential drives them close to an effective infrared fixed line. Requiring an acceptable bottom-top mass ratio leads in principle to an additional constraint on the MSSM parameter space. As a by-product, we give new approximate analytical solutions of the renormalization group equations for the MSSM parameters.
