Title: Yukawa Couplings for the Spinning Particle and the World Line Formalism
Authors: Myriam Mondragon and Lukas Nellen and Michael G. Schmidt and Christian Schubert
Abstract: We construct the world-line action for a Dirac particle coupled to a classical scalar or pseudo-scalar background field. This action can be used to compute loop diagrams and the effective action in the Yukawa model using the world-line path-integral formalism for spinning particles.
