Title: Kahler Potentials For Orbifolds With Continuous Wilson Lines And The  Symmetries Of The String Action.
Authors: M. Cvetic and B. Ovrut and W. A. Sabra
Abstract: By employing the symmetries of the underlying conformal field theory, the tree-level K\"ahler potentials for untwisted moduli of the heterotic string compactifications on orbifolds with continuous Wilson lines are derived. These symmetries act linearly on bosonic (toroidal and $E_8\times E_8$ gauge) string coordinates as well as on the untwisted (toroidal and continuous Wilson lines) moduli; they correspond to the scaling of toroidal moduli, the axionic shift of toroidal moduli and the shift of the continuous Wilson line moduli. In turn such symmetries provide sufficient constraints to determine the form of the low-energy effective action associated with the untwisted moduli up to a multiplicative factor.
