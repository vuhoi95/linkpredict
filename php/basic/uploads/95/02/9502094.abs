Title: Supergravity dressing of beta-functions in N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric  models
Authors: M. T. Grisaru and D. Zanon
Abstract: We discuss the dressing of one-loop sigma-model beta-functions by induced supergravity, for both N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric theories. We obtain exact results by a superconformal gauge argument, and verify them in the semi-classical limit by explicit perturbative calculations in the light-cone gauge. We find that for N=2 theories there is no dressing of the one-loop beta-functions.
