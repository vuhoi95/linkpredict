Title: q-NONLINEARITY, DEFORMATIONS AND PLANCK DISTRIBUTION
Authors: V. I. Man'ko and G. Marmo and F. Zaccaria
Abstract: q-deformed nonlinear field equations are constructed including Klein-Gordon and Maxwell equations. The q-deformation is interpreted as mathematical structure describing specific nonlinearity for which frequency of vibration exponentially depends on the energy
