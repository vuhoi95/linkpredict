Abstract: We study the first-order formalism of pure four-dimensional ${\rm SU}(2)$ Yang--Mills theory with theta-term. We describe the Green functions associated to electric and magnetic flux operators \`a la 't~Hooft by means of gauge-invariant non-local operators. These Green functions are related to Witten's invariants of four-manifolds.
