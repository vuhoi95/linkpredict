Authors: B. A. Faizullaev and M. M. Musakhanov and N. K. Pak
Abstract: The problem of the higher-loop contributions to the axial anomaly is reexamined by a new method. We demonstrate that these contributions depend on the order of the calculations. If the divergence of the axial current by nonperturbative Fujikawa method is calculated first and then average it over the photon field in the presence of an external photon source, a nonzero contribution is obtained. However perturbative Feynman diagram method has an uncertainty. Depending on the order of the calculations above mentioned or zero results are obtained.
