Title: Bosonization rules in $1/2 +1$ dimensions
Authors: Manuel Fuentes and Ana Lopez and Eduardo Fradkin and Enrique Moreno
Abstract: We derive the bosonization rules for free fermions on a half-line with physically sensible boundary conditions for Luttinger fermions. We use path-integral methods to calculate the bosonized fermionic currents on the half-line and derive their commutation relations for a system with a boundary. We compute the fermion determinant of the fermionic fluctuations for a system with a boundary using Forman's approach. We find that the degrees of freedom induced at the boundary do not to modify the commutation relations of the bulk. We give an explicit derivation of the bosonization rules for the fermion operators for a system with boundaries. We derive a set of bosonization rules for the Fermi operators which include the explicit effect of the boundaries and of boundary degrees of freedom. As a byproduct, we calculate the one-particle Green's function and determine the effects of the boundaries on its analytic structure.
