Abstract: We explore the use of real fermionization as a test case for understanding how specific features of phenomenological interest in the low-energy effective superpotential are realized in exact solutions to heterotic superstring theory. We present pedagogic examples of models which realize SO(10) as a level two current algebra on the world-sheet, and discuss in general how higher level current algebras can be realized in the tensor product of simple constituent conformal field theories. We describe formal developments necessary to compute couplings in models built using real fermionization. This allows us to isolate cases of spin structures where the standard prescription for real fermionization may break down.
