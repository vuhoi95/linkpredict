Title: Symmetry Breaking in the Static Coordinate System of de Sitter Spacetime
Authors: Andr√°s Kaiser and Alan Chodos
Abstract: We study symmetry breaking in the static coordinate-system of de Sitter space. This is done with the help of the functional-Schr\"odinger approach used in previous calculations by Ratra [1]. We consider a massless, minimally coupled scalar field as the parameter of a continuous symmetry (the angular component of an O(2) symmetry). Then we study the correlation function of the massless scalar field, to derive the correlation function of the original field, which finally shows the restoration of the continuous symmetry.
