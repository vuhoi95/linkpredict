Abstract: A superfield method of computing the effective potential in supersymmetric field theories is suggested. Analysis of the structure of the effective potential in the Wess-Zumino model is carried out. It is shown that the superfield effective potential is defined by three objects: kahlerian effective potential, chiral effective potential and auxiliary fields' effective potential. One-loop kahlerian effective potential is calculated using the superfield heat kernel technique. A corresponding superfield kernel is found in explicit form. Procedure for computing higher loop corrections is developed. First (two-loop) correction to chiral effective potential is found. Two-loop kahlerian effective potential is calculated.
