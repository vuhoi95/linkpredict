Title: Black Hole Formation by Sine-Gordon Solitons in Two-dimensional Dilaton  Gravity
Authors: Hak-Soo Shin and Kwang-Sup Soh
Abstract: The CGHS model of two-dimensional dilaton gravity coupled to a sine-Gordon matter field is considered. The theory is exactly solvable classically, and the solutions of a kink and two-kink type solitons are studied in connection with black hole formation.
