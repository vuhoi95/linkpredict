Title: Approximate solutions of exact renormalization group equations
Authors: D. Litim and N. Tetradis
Abstract: We study exact renormalization group equations in the framework of the effective average action. We present analytical approximate solutions for the scale dependence of the potential in a variety of models. These solutions display a rich spectrum of physical behaviour such as fixed points governing the universal behaviour near second order phase transitions, critical exponents, first order transitions (some of which are radiatively induced) and tricritical behaviour.
