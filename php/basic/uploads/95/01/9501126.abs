Title: Lagrangian description of N=2 minimal models as critical points of  Landau-Ginzburg theories.
Authors: M. T. Grisaru and D. Zanon
Abstract: We discuss a two-dimensional lagrangian model with $N=2$ supersymmetry described by a K\"{a}hler potential $K(X,\bar{X})$ and superpotential $gX^k$ which explicitly exhibits renormalization group flows to infrared fixed points where the central charge has a value equal that of the $N=2$, $A_{k-1}$ minimal model. We consider the dressing of such models by N=2 supergravity: in contradistinction to bosonic or $N=1$ models, no modification of the $\b$-function takes place.
