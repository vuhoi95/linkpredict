Title: Restricted Quantum Theory of Affine Toda Solitons
Authors: J. Underwood and B. Spence
Abstract: We quantise the reduced theory obtained by substituting the soliton solutions of affine Toda theory into its symplectic form. The semi-classical S-matrix is found to involve the classical Euler dilogarithm.
