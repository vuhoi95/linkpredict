Title: Exact Solution of Long-Range Interacting Spin Chains with Boundaries
Authors: D. Bernard. V. Pasquier and D. Serban
Abstract: We consider integrable models of the Haldane-Shastry type with open boundary conditions. We define monodromy matrices, obeying the reflection equation, which generate the symmetries of these models. Using a map to the Calogero-Sutherland Hamiltonian of BC type, we derive the spectrum and the highest weight eigenstates.
