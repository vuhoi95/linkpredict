Title: Quantum integrability in two-dimensional systems with boundary
Authors: S. Penati and D. Zanon
Abstract: In this paper we consider affine Toda systems defined on the half-plane and study the issue of integrability, i.e. the construction of higher-spin conserved currents in the presence of a boundary perturbation. First at the classical level we formulate the problem within a Lax pair approach which allows to determine the general structure of the boundary perturbation compatible with integrability. Then we analyze the situation at the quantum level and compute corrections to the classical conservation laws in specific examples. We find that, except for the sinh-Gordon model, the existence of quantum conserved currents requires a finite renormalization of the boundary potential.
