Title: Nonrelativistic Factorizable Scattering Theory of Multicomponent  Calogero-Sutherland Model
Authors: Changrim Ahn and Kong-Ju-Bock Lee and Soonkeon Nam
Abstract: We relate two integrable models in (1+1) dimensions, namely, multicomponent Calogero-Sutherland model with particles and antiparticles interacting via the hyperbolic potential and the nonrelativistic factorizable $S$-matrix theory with $SU(N)$-invariance. We find complete solutions of the Yang-Baxter equations without implementing the crossing symmetry, and one of them is identified with the scattering amplitudes derived from the Schr\"{o}dinger equation of the Calogero-Sutherland model. This particular solution is of interest in that it cannot be obtained as a nonrelativistic limit of any known relativistic solutions of the $SU(N)$-invariant Yang-Baxter equations.
