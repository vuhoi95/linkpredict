Title: A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF ALAIN CONNES' VERSION OF THE STANDARD MODEL IV
Authors: Daniel Kastler and Thomas Schucker
Abstract: We give a detailed account of the computation of the Yang-Mills action for the Connes-Lott model with general coupling constant in the commutant of the $K$-cycle. This leads to tree-approximation results amazingly compatible with experiment, yielding a first indication on the Higgs mass.
