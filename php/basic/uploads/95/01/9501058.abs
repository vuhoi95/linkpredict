Abstract: We calculate correlation functions in matrix models modified by trace-squared terms. First we study scaling operators in modified one-matrix models and find that their correlation functions satisfy modified Virasoro constraints. Then we turn to dressed order parameters in minimal models and show that their correlators satisfy Goulian-Li formulae continued to negative Liouville dressing exponents. Our calculations provide additional support for the idea that the modified matrix models contain operators with the negative branch of gravitational dressing.
