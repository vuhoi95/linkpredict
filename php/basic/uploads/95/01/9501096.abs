Title: Topological Reduction of 4D SYM to 2D $Ïƒ$--Models
Authors: M. Bershadsky and A. Johansen and V. Sadov and C. Vafa
Abstract: By considering a (partial) topological twisting of supersymmetric Yang-Mills compactified on a 2d space with `t Hooft magnetic flux turned on we obtain a supersymmetric $\sigma$-model in 2 dimensions. For N=2 SYM this maps Donaldson observables on products of two Riemann surfaces to quantum cohomology ring of moduli space of flat connections on a Riemann surface. For N=4 SYM it maps $S$-duality to $T$-duality for $\sigma$-models on moduli space of solutions to Hitchin equations.
