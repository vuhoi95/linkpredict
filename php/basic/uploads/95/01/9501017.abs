Title: Renormalisation group calculation of correlation functions for the 2D  random bond Ising and Potts models
Authors: Vladimir Dotsenko and Marco Picco and Pierre Pujol
Abstract: We find the cross-over behavior for the spin-spin correlation function for the 2D Ising and 3-states Potts model with random bonds at the critical point. The procedure employed is the renormalisation approach of the perturbation series around the conformal field theories representing the pure models. We obtain a crossover in the amplitude for the correlation function for the Ising model which doesn't change the critical exponent, and a shift in the critical exponent produced by randomness in the case of the Potts model. A comparison with numerical data is discussed briefly.
