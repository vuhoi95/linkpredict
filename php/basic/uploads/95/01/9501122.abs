Title: Connection between $Î¶$ and cutoff regularizations of Casimir  energies
Authors: C. G. Beneventano and E. M. Santangelo
Abstract: We study the connection between $\zeta $- and cutoff-regularized Casimir energies for scalar fields. We show that, in general, both regularization schemes lead to divergent contributions, and to finite parts which do not coincide. We determine the relationships among the various coefficients appearing in one approach and the other. As an application, we discuss the case of scalar fields in $d$-dimensional boxes under periodic boundary conditions.
