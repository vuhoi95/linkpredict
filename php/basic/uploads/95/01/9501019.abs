Title: Some conclusions for noncritical string theory drawn from two- and  three-point functions in the Liouville sector
Authors: H. Dorn and H. -J. Otto
Abstract: Starting from the known expression for the three-point correlation functions for Liouville exponentials with generic real coefficients at we can prove the Liouville equation of motion at the level of three-point functions. Based on the analytical structure of the correlation functions we discuss a possible mass shell condition for excitations of noncritical strings and make some observations concerning correlators of Liouville fields.
