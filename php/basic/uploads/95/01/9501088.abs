Title: A bijection which implies Melzer's polynomial identities: the  $Ï‡_{1,1}^{(p,p+1)}$ case
Authors: O. Foda and S. O. Warnaar
Abstract: We obtain a bijection between certain lattice paths and partitions. This implies a proof of polynomial identities conjectured by Melzer. In a limit, these identities reduce to Rogers--Ramanujan-type identities for the $\chi_{1,1}^{(p,p+1)}(q)$ Virasoro characters, conjectured by the Stony Brook group.
