Title: Infrared Regularization of Superstring Theory and the One-Loop  Calculation of Coupling Constants
Authors: Elias Kiritsis and Costas Kounnas
Abstract: Infrared regularized versions of 4-D N=1 superstring ground states are constructed by curving the spacetime. A similar regularization can be performed in field theory. For the IR regularized string ground states we derive the exact one-loop effective action for non-zero U(1) or chromo-magnetic fields as well as gravitational and axionic-dilatonic fields. This effective action is IR and UV finite. Thus, the one-loop corrections to all couplings (gravitational, gauge and Yukawas) are unabiguously computed. These corrections are necessary for quantitative string superunification predictions at low energies. The one-loop corrections to the couplings are also found to satisfy Infrared Flow Equations.
