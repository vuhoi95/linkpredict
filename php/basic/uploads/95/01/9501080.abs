Title: Solitons in a Bilocal Field Theory
Authors: R. J. Henderson and S. G. Rajeev
Abstract: We obtain a bilocal classical field theory as the large $N$ limit of the chiral Gross--Neveu (or non--abelian Thirring) model. Exact classical solutions that describe topological solitons are obtained. It is shown that their mass spectrum agrees with the large $N$ limit of the spectrum of the chiral Gross--Neveu model.
