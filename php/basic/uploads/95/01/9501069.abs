Title: Solitons in supersymmetric sigma-models with torsion
Authors: G. Papadopoulos and P. K. Townsend
Abstract: We derive a bound on the energy of the general (p,q)-supersymmetric two-dimensional massive sigma model with torsion, in terms of the topological and Noether charges that appear as central charges in its supersymmetry algebra.The bound is saturated by soliton solutions of first-order Bogomol'nyi-type equations. This generalizes results obtained previously for p=q models without torsion. We give examples of massive (1,1) models with torsion that have a group manifold as a target space. We show that they generically have multiple vacua and find an explicit soliton solution of an SU(2) model. We also construct a new class of zero torsion massive (4,4) models with multiple vacua and soliton solutions. In addition, we compute the metrics on the one-soliton moduli spaces for those cases for which soliton solutions are known explicitly, and discuss their interpretation.
