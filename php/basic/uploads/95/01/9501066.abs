Title: Negative dimensional operators in the disordered critical points of  Dirac fermions
Authors: Claudio de C. Chamon and Christopher Mudry and Xiao-Gang Wen
Abstract: Recently, in an attempt to study disordered criticality in Quantum Hall systems and $d$-wave superconductivity, it was found that two dimensional random Dirac fermion systems contain a line of critical points which is connected to the pure system. We use bosonization and current algebra to study properties of the critical line and calculate the exact scaling dimensions of all local operators. We find that the critical line contains an infinite number of relevant operators with negative scaling dimensions.
