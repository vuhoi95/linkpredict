Title: Lorentz Transformations as Lie-Poisson Symmetries
Authors: A. Simoni and A. Stern and I. Yakushin
Abstract: We write down the Poisson structure for a relativistic particle where the Lorentz group does not act canonically, but instead as a Poisson-Lie group. In so doing we obtain the classical limit of a particle moving on a noncommutative space possessing $SL_q(2,C)$ invariance. We show that if the standard mass shell constraint is chosen for the Hamiltonian function, then the particle interacts with the space-time. We solve for the trajectory and find that it originates and terminates at singularities.
