Title: Two dimensional supersymmetric harmonic oscillator carrying a  representation of the GL(2/1) graded Lie algebra
Authors: Ashok Das and Clovis Wotzasek
Abstract: We study a supersymmetric 2-dimensional harmonic oscillator which carries a representation of the general graded Lie algebra GL(2$\vert$1), formulate it on the superspace, and discuss its physical spectrum.
