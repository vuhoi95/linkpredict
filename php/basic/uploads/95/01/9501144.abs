Authors: M. B. Halpern and E. Kiritsis and N. Obers and K. Clubok
Abstract: This is a review of irrational conformal field theory, which includes rational conformal field theory as a small subspace. Central topics of the review include the Virasoro master equation, its solutions and the dynamics of irrational conformal field theory. Discussion of the dynamics includes the generalized Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations on the sphere, the corresponding heat-like systems on the torus and the generic world- sheet action of irrational conformal field theory.
