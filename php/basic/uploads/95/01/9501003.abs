Title: BRST quantization of gauge theories like SL(2,R) on inner product spaces
Authors: Robert Marnelius and Ulrich Quaade
Abstract: Some general formulas are derived for the solutions of a BRST quantization on inner product spaces of finite dimensional bosonic gauge theories invariant under arbitrary Lie groups. A detailed analysis is then performed of SL(2,R) invariant models and some possible geometries of the Lagrange multipliers are derived together with explicit results for a class of SL(2,R) models. Gauge models invariant under a nonunimodular gauge group are also studied in some detail.
