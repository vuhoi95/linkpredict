Title: Bose-Einstein condensation for interacting scalar fields in curved  spacetime
Authors: K. Kirsten and D. J. Toms
Abstract: We consider the model of self-interacting complex scalar fields with a rigid gauge invariance under an arbitrary gauge group $G$. In order to analyze the phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation finite temperature and the possibility of a finite background charge is included. Different approaches to derive the relevant high-temperature behaviour of the theory are presented.
