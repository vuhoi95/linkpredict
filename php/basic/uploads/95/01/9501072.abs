Title: Generalized String Functions of N=1 Space-Time Supersymmetric String  Vacua
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Andreas Wisskirchen
Abstract: We present a dual formulation of the construction of N=2 nonlinear sigma-model type conformal field theories with c=9 which are mainly used as internal sectors of Calabi-Yau heterotic string compactifications. The supercurrents and the higher components of the spectral flow superfields turn out in each case to be tensor products of two simple currents of a c=1 and a non-supersymmetric parafermionic c=8 CFT. The characters of the latter model can be regarded as string functions of the coset sigma/U(1). In particular, for the (1)^9 Gepner model we discuss these string functions in detail, realizing this model contains a broken E_8 gauge symmetry of which only the abelian subalgebra remains a symmetry of the spectrum. As an example, we construct a simple model leading to a string theory with a massless spectrum of 36 E_6 generations and an extended gauge symmetry E_6 x SU(3)^4.
