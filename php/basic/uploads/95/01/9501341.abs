Title: CPT, Strings, and Meson Factories
Authors: Alan Kostelecky and Rob Potting
Abstract: Spontaneous breaking of CPT is possible in string theory. We show that it can arise at a level within reach of experiments at meson factories currently being built or designed. For $\phi$, $B$, and $\tau$-charm factories, we discuss the likely experimental string signatures and provide estimates of the bounds that might be attained in these machines.
