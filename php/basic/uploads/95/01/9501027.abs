Title: Lie-Poisson groups and the Miura transformation
Authors: JM Figueroa-O'Farrill and S Stanciu
Abstract: We point out that the recent proof of the Kupershmidt-Wilson theorem by Cheng and Mas-Ramos is underpinned by the Lie-Poisson property of the second Gel'fand-Dickey bracket. The supersymmetric Kupershmidt-Wilson theorem is also proved along these same lines. Finally we comment on the possible repercussions in the problem of the coproduct for W-algebras.
