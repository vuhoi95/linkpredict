Title: The Constrained KP Hierarchy and the Generalised Miura Transformation
Authors: Javier Mas and Eduardo Ramos
Abstract: Recently much attention has been paid to the restriction of KP to the submanifold of operators which can be represented as a ratio of two purely differential operators L=AB^{-1}. Whereas most of the aspects concerning this reduced hierarchy, like the Lax flows and the Hamiltonians, are by now well understood, there still lacks a clear and conclusive statement about the associated Poisson structure. We fill this gap by placing the problem in a more general framework and then showing how the required result follows from an interesting property of the second Gelfand-Dickey brackets under multiplication and inversion of Lax operators. As a byproduct we give an elegant and simple proof of the generalised Kupershmidt-Wilson theorem.
