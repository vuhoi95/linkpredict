Title: Dymanics of Generalized Coherent States
Authors: S. De Martino and S. De Siena and F. Illuminati
Abstract: We show that generalized coherent states follow Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics in time-dependent potentials. The normalized wave-packets follow a classical evolution without spreading; in turn, the Schr\"{o}dinger potential depends on the state through the classical trajectory. This feedback mechanism with continuous dynamical re-adjustement allows the packets to remain coherent indefinetely.
