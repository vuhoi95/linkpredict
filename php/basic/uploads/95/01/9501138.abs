Title: Annihilation poles of a Smirnov-type integral formula for solutions to  quantum Knizhnik--Zamolodchikov equation
Authors: Takeo Kojima and Kei Miki and Yas-Hiro Quano
Abstract: We consider the recently obtained integral representation of quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation of level 0. We obtain the condition for the integral kernel such that these solutions satisfy three axioms for form factor \'{a} la Smirnov. We discuss the relation between this integral representation and the form factor of XXZ spin chain.
