Title: Classically integrable boundary conditions for affine Toda field  theories
Authors: P Bowcock and E Corrigan and PE Dorey and RH Rietdijk
Abstract: Boundary conditions compatible with classical integrability are studied both directly, using an approach based on the explicit construction of conserved quantities, and indirectly by first developing a generalisation of the Lax pair idea. The latter approach is closer to the spirit of earlier work by Sklyanin and yields a complete set of conjectures for permissible boundary conditions for any affine Toda field theory.
