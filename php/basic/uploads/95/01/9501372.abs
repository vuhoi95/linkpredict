Title: Tests of Direct and Indirect CPT Violation at a B Factory
Authors: Don Colladay and Alan Kostelecky
Abstract: The issue of testing CPT invariance at a $B$ factory is considered. We present asymmetries that permit a clean extraction of quantities parametrizing direct and indirect CPT violation, using information from $\Upsilon(4S)$ decay via coherent $B_d\overline{B_d}$ pairs into various final states. Estimates are given of the bounds on CPT violation that could be obtained in present and planned machines.
