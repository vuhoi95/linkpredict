Title: Deriving Non-decoupling Effects of Heavy Fields from the Path Integral:  a Heavy Higgs Field in an SU(2) Gauge Theory
Authors: Stefan Dittmaier and Carsten Grosse-Knetter
Abstract: We describe a method to remove non-decoupling heavy fields from a quantized field theory and to construct a low-energy one-loop effective Lagrangian by integrating out the heavy degrees of freedom in the path integral. We apply this method to the Higgs boson in a spontaneously broken SU(2) gauge theory (gauged linear sigma-model). In this context, the background-field method is generalized to the non-linear representation of the Higgs sector by applying (a generalization of) the Stueckelberg formalism. The (background) gauge-invariant renormalization is discussed. At one loop the log M_H-terms of the heavy-Higgs limit of this model coincide with the UV-divergent terms of the corresponding gauged non-linear sigma-model, but vertex functions differ in addition by finite (constant) terms in both models. These terms are also derived by our method. Diagrammatic calculations of some vertex functions are presented as consistency check.
