Title: On the Interplay of Monopoles and Chiral Symmetry Breaking in  Non-Compact Lattice QED
Authors: J. B. Kogut and K. -C. Wang
Abstract: Non-compact lattice QED is simulated for various numbers of fermion species $N_f$ ranging from 8 through 40 by the exact Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm. Over this range of $N_f$, chiral symmetry breaking is found to be strongly correlated with the effective monopoles in the theory. For $N_f$ between 8 and 16 the chiral symmetry breaking and monopole percolation transitions are second order and coincident. Assuming powerlaw critical behavior, the correlation length exponent for the chiral transition is identical to that of monopole percolation. This result supports the conjecture that monopole percolation ``drives" the nontrivial chiral transition. For $N_f$ between 20 and 32, the monopoles experience a first order condensation transition coincident with a first order chiral transition. For $N_f$ as large as 40 both transitions are strongly suppressed. The data at large $N_f (N_f \mathrel {\mathpalette \vereq >} 20)$ is interpreted in terms of a strongly interacting monopole gas-liquid transition.
