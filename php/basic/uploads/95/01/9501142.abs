Title: YANG-MILLS-HIGGS versus CONNES-LOTT
Authors: Bruno IOCHUM and Thomas SCHÃœCKER
Abstract: By a suitable choice of variables we show that every Connes-Lott model is a Yang-Mills-Higgs model. The contrary is far from being true. Necessary conditions are given. Our analysis is pedestrian and illustrated by examples.
