Title: A Relation Between the Kauffman and the HOMFLY Polynomials for Torus  Knots
Authors: J. M. F. Labastida and E. Perez
Abstract: Polynomial invariants corresponding to the fundamental representation of the gauge group $SO(N)$ are computed for arbitrary torus knots in the framework of Chern-Simons gauge theory making use of knot operators. As a result, a formula which relates the Kauffman and the HOMFLY polynomials for torus knots is presented.
