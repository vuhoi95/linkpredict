Title: Thermal Wightman Functions and Renormalized Stress Tensors in the  Rindler Wedge
Authors: Valter Moretti and Luciano Vanzo
Abstract: The Wightman functions in the Rindler portion of Minkowski space-time are presented for any value of the temperature and for massless spin fields up to s=1 and the renormalized stress tensor relative to Minkowski vacuum is discussed. A gauge ambiguity in the vector case is pointed out.
