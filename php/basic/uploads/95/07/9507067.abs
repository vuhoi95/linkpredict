Title: "Renormalization" Of Non Renormalizable Theories
Authors: J. Gegelia and G. Japaridze and N. Kiknadze and K. Turashvili
Abstract: A perturbative approach for non renormalizable theories is developed. It is shown that the introduction of an extra expansion parameter allows one to get rid of divergences and express physical quantities as series with finite coefficients. The method is demonstrated on the example of massive non abelian field coupled to a fermion field.
