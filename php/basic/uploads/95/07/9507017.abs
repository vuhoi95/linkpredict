Title: Relic Gravitational Waves from String Cosmology
Authors: R. Brustein and M. Gasperini and M. Giovannini and G. Veneziano
Abstract: A large class of string-cosmology backgrounds leads to a spectrum of relic stochastic gravitational waves, strongly tilted towards high frequencies, and characterized by two basic parameters of the cosmological model. We estimate the required sensitivity for detection of the predicted gravitational radiation and show that a region of our parameter space is within reach for some of the planned gravitational-wave detectors.
