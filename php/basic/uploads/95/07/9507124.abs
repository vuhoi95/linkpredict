Title: Matter Fields in the Lagrangian Loop Representation: Scalar QED
Authors: J. M. Aroca and M. Baig and H. Fort and R. Siri
Abstract: We present the extension of the Lagrangian loop gauge invariant representation in such a way to include matter fields. The partition function of lattice compact U(1)-Higgs model is expressed as a sum over closed as much as open surfaces. We have simulated numerically the loop action equivalent to the Villain form of the action and mapped out the beta-gamma phase diagram of this model.
