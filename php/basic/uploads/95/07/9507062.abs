Title: Matrix Model Approach to $d>2$ Non-critical Superstrings
Authors: Akikazu Hashimoto and Igor R. Klebanov
Abstract: We apply light-cone quantization to a $1+1$ dimensional supersymmetric field theory of large N matrices. We provide some preliminary numerical evidence that when the coupling constant is tuned to a critical value, this model describes a 2+1 dimensional non-critical superstring.
