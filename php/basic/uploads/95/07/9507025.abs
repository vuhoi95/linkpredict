Abstract: We give the {\it spectral decomposition} of the path space of the $U_q(\hatsl)$ vertex model with respect to the local energy functions. The result suggests the hidden Yangian module structure on the $\hatsl$ level $l$ integrable modules, which is consistent with the earlier work [1] in the level one case. Also we prove the fermionic character formula of the $\hatsl$ level $l$ integrable representations in consequence.
