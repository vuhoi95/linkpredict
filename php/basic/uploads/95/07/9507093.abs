Title: Solving non-perturbative flow equations
Authors: J. Adams and J. Berges and S. Bornholdt and F. Freire and N. Tetradis and C. Wetterich
Abstract: Non-perturbative exact flow equations describe the scale dependence of the effective average action. We present a numerical solution for an approximate form of the flow equation for the potential in a three-dimensional N-component scalar field theory. The critical behaviour, with associated critical exponents, can be inferred with good accuracy.
