Title: Batalin-Vilkovisky Formalism and Integration Theory on Manifolds
Authors: O. M. Khudaverdian and A. Nersessian
Abstract: The correspondence between the BV-formalism and integration theory on supermanifolds is established. An explicit formula for the density on a Lagrangian surface in a superspace provided with an odd symplectic structure and a volume form is proposed.
