Title: Super-Galilei Invariant Field Theories in 2+1 Dimensions
Authors: Oren Bergman and Charles B. Thorn
Abstract: We extend the Galilei group of space-time transformations by gradation, construct interacting field-theoretic representations of this algebra, and show that non-relativistic Super-Chern-Simons theory is a special case. We also study the generalization to matrix valued fields, which are relevant to the formulation of superstring theory as a $1/N_c$ expansion of a field theory. We find that in the matrix case, the field theory is much more restricted by the supersymmetry.
