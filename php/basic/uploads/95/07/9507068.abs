Title: Perturbing Conformal Turbulence
Authors: Omduth Coceal and Steven Thomas
Abstract: We consider perturbations of the non-unitary minimal model solutions of two-dimensional conformal turbulence proposed by Polyakov. Demanding the absence of non-integrable singularities in the resulting theories leads to constraints on the dimension of the perturbing operator. We give some general solutions of these constraints, illustrating with examples of specific models. We also examine the effect of such perturbations on the Hopf equation and derive the interesting result that the latter is invariant under a certain class of perturbations, to first order in perturbation theory, examples of which are given in specific cases.
