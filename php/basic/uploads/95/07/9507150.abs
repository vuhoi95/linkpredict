Title: Fuzzy Mass Relations in the Standard Model
Authors: Bruno Iochum and Daniel Kastler and Thomas Schucker
Abstract: Recently Connes has proposed a new geometric version of the standard model including a non-commutative charge conjugation. We present a systematic analysis of the relations among masses and coupling constants in this approach. In particular, for a given top mass, the Higgs mass is constrained to lie in an interval. Therefore this constraint is locally stable under renormalization flow.
