Title: Generalization of Agranovich-Toshich transformation and constraint free  bosonic representation for systems of truncated oscillators
Authors: A. V. Ilinskaia and K. N. Ilinski
Abstract: The generalization of Agranovich-Toshich representation of paulion operators in terms of bosonic ones for the case of truncated oscillators of higher ranks is represented. We use this generalization to introduce a new constraint free bosonic description of truncated oscillator systems. The corresponding functional integral representations for thermodynamic quantities are given and the application to investigations of Long Rang Order in the system is discussed.
