Title: Symplectic Quantization of the CP$^1$ Model with the Chern-Simons Term
Authors: Yong-Wan Kim and Young-Jai Park and Yongduk Kim
Abstract: The symplectic formalism is fully employed to study the gauge-invariant CP$^1$ model with the Chern-Simons term. We consistently accommodate the CP$^1$ constraint at the Lagrangian level according to this formalism.
