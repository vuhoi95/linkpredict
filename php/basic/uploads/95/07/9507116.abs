Title: A $q$-deformation of the Coulomb Problem
Authors: J. Feigenbaum and P. G. O. Freund
Abstract: The algebra of observables of $SO_{q}(3)$-symmetric quantum mechanics is extended to include the inverse $\frac{1}{R}$ of the radial coordinate and used to obtain eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a \q-deformed Coulomb Hamiltonian.
