Title: Folding transitions of the triangular lattice with defects
Authors: Emilio N. M. Cirillo and Giuseppe Gonnella and Alessandro Pelizzola
Abstract: A recently introduced model describing the folding of the triangular lattice is generalized allowing for defects in the lattice and written as an Ising model with nearest-neighbor and plaquette interactions on the honeycomb lattice. Its phase diagram is determined in the hexagon approximation of the cluster variation method and the crossover from the pure Ising to the pure folding model is investigated, obtaining a quite rich structure with several multicritical points. Our results are in very good agreement with the available exact ones and extend a previous transfer matrix study.
