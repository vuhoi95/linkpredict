Title: Convergent sequences of perturbative approximations for the anharmonic  oscillator II. Compact time approach
Authors: B. Bellet and P. Garcia and A. Neveu
Abstract: We present an alternative pathway in the application of the variation improvement of ordinary perturbation theory exposed in [1] which can preserve the internal symmetries of a model by means of a time compactification.
