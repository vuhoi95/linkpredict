Title: Black Hole Entropy and Renormalization
Authors: Jean-Guy Demers and Rene Lafrance and Robert C. Myers
Abstract: Using a new regulator, we examine 't Hooft's approach for evaluating black hole entropy through a statistical-mechanical counting of states for a scalar field propagating outside the event horizon. We find that this calculation yields precisely the one-loop renormalization of the standard Bekenstein-Hawking formula, $S={\Cal A}/(4G)$. Thus our result provides evidence confirming a suggestion by Susskind and Uglum regarding black hole entropy.
