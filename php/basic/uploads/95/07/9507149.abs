Title: Solvable Potentials from Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Dong Sup Soh and Kyung Hyun Cho and Sang Pyo Kim
Abstract: A recurrence relation of Riccati-type differential equations known in supersymmetric quantum mechanics is investigated to find exactly solvable potentials. Taking some simple {\it ans\"atze}, we find new classes of solvable potentials as well as reproducing the known shape-invariant ones.
