Title: Source Galerkin Calculations in Scalar Field Theory
Authors: John W. Lawson and G. S. Guralnik
Abstract: In this paper, we extend previous work on scalar $\phi^4$ theory using the Source Galerkin method. This approach is based on finding solutions $Z[J]$ to the lattice functional equations for field theories in the presence of an external source $J$. Using polynomial expansions for the generating functional $Z$, we calculate propagators and mass-gaps for a number of systems. These calculations are straightforward to perform and are executed rapidly compared to Monte Carlo. The bulk of the computation involves a single matrix inversion. The use of polynomial expansions illustrates in a clear and simple way the ideas of the Source Galerkin method. But at the same time, this choice has serious limitations. Even after exploiting symmetries, the size of calculations become prohibitive except for small systems. The calculations in this paper were made on a workstation of modest power using a fourth order polynomial expansion for lattices of size $8^2$,$4^3$,$2^4$ in $2D$, $3D$, and $4D$. In addition, we present an alternative to the Galerkin procedure that results in sparse matrices to invert.
