Title: Polynomial Invariants for SU(2) Monopoles
Authors: J. M. F. Labastida and M. Mari√±o
Abstract: We present an explicit expression for the topological invariants associated to $SU(2)$ monopoles in the fundamental representation on spin four-manifolds. The computation of these invariants is based on the analysis of their corresponding topological quantum field theory, and it turns out that they can be expressed in terms of Seiberg-Witten invariants. In this analysis we use recent exact results on the moduli space of vacua of the untwisted $N=1$ and $N=2$ supersymmetric counterparts of the topological quantum field theory under consideration, as well as on electric-magnetic duality for $N=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories.
