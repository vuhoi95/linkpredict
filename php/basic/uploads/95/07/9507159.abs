Title: Critical equation of state from the average action
Authors: J. Berges and N. Tetradis and C. Wetterich
Abstract: The scaling form of the critical equation of state is computed for $O(N)$-symmetric models. We employ a method based on an exact flow equation for a coarse grained free energy. A suitable truncation is solved numerically.
