Title: Field Theory on a Supersymmetric Lattice
Authors: H. Grosse and C. Klimcik and P. Presnajder
Abstract: A lattice-type regularization of the supersymmetric field theories on a supersphere is constructed by approximating the ring of scalar superfields by an integer-valued sequence of finite dimensional rings of supermatrices and by using the differencial calculus of non-commutative geometry. The regulated theory involves only finite number of degrees of freedom and is manifestly supersymmetric.
