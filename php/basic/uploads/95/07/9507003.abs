Title: Instanton Effects in Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theories on ALE  Gravitational Backgrounds
Authors: M. Bianchi and F. Fucito and G. C. Rossi and M. Martellini
Abstract: In this letter we report on the computation of instanton-dominated correlation functions in supersymmetric YM theories on ALE spaces. Following the approach of Kronheimer and Nakajima, we explicitly construct the self-dual connection on ALE spaces necessary to perform such computations. We restrict our attention to the simplest case of an $SU(2)$ connection with lowest Chern class on the Eguchi-Hanson gravitational background.
