Title: Three-body relativistic flux tube model from QCD Wilson-loop approach
Authors: N. Brambilla and G. M. Prosperi and A. Vairo
Abstract: First we review the derivation of the relativistic flux tube model for a quark-antiquark system from Wilson area law as we have given in a preceding paper. Then we extend the method to the three-quark case and obtain a Lagrangian corresponding to a star flux tube configuration. A Hamiltonian can be explicitly constructed as an expansion in $1 / m^2$ or in the string tension $\sigma$. In the first case it reproduces the Wilson loop three-quark semirelativistic potential; in the second one, very complicated in general, but it reproduces known string models for slowly rotating quarks.
