Abstract: We present a supersymmetric non-linear $\s$-model built up in the $N=1$ superspace of Atiyah-Ward space-time. A manifold of the K\"ahler type comes out that is restricted by a particular decomposition of the K\"ahler potential. The gauging of the $\s$-model isometries is also accomplished in superspace.
