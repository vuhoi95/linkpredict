Title: Baby Skyrmion Strings
Authors: T. Gisiger and M. B. Paranjape
Abstract: We provide analytical and numerical evidence of the existence of classically stable, string-like configurations in a 2+1 dimensional analog of the Skyrme model. The model contains a conserved topological charge usually called the baryon number. Our strings are non-topological solitons which have a constant baryon number per unit length. The energy per length containing one baryon is, however, less than the energy of an isolated baryon (radially symmetric ``baby Skyrmion") in a region of the parameter space, which suggests a degree of stability for our configurations. In a limiting case, our configuration saturates a Bogomolnyi-type bound and is degenerate in energy per baryon with the baby Skyrmion. In another limiting case, the energies are still degenerate but do not saturate the corresponding Bogomolnyi-type bound. Nonetheless, we expect the string to be stable here. Both limiting cases are solvable analytically.
