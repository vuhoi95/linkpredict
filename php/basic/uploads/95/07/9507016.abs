Title: Evidence for Complex Subleading Exponents from the High-Temperature  Expansion of the Hierarchical Ising Model
Authors: Y. Meurice and G. Ordaz and V. G. J. Rodgers
Abstract: Using a renormalization group method, we calculate 800 high-temperature coefficients of the magnetic susceptibility of the hierarchical Ising model. The conventional quantities obtained from differences of ratios of coefficients show unexpected smooth oscillations with a period growing logarithmically and can be fitted assuming corrections to the scaling laws with complex exponents.
