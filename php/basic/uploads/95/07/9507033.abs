Abstract: The equations of motion (e.m.'s) of the N=1, D=10 anomaly free supergravity, obtained in the framework of the superspace approach, are analyzed. The formal equivalence of the usual and dual supergravities is discussed at the level of e.m.'s. The great simplicity of the dual formulation is established. The possibillity of the lagrangian formulation of the dual supergravity is pointed out. The bosonic part of the lagrangian is constructed including anomaly compensating superstring corrections.
