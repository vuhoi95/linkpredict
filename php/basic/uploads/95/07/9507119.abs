Title: Kinetic Approach to Fractional Exclusion Statistics
Authors: G. Kaniadakis and A. Lavagno and P. Quarati
Abstract: We show that the kinetic approach to statistical mechanics permits an elegant and efficient treatment of fractional exclusion statistics. By using the exclusion-inclusion principle recently proposed [Phys. Rev. E49, 5103 (1994)] as a generalization of the Pauli exclusion principle, which is based on a proper definition of the transition probability between two states, we derive a variety of different statistical distributions interpolating between bosons and fermions. The Haldane exclusion principle and the Haldane-Wu fractional exclusion statistics are obtained in a natural way as particular cases. The thermodynamic properties of the statistical systems obeying the generalized exclusion-inclusion principle are discussed.
