Title: Folds, Bosonization and non-triviality of the classical limit of 2D  string theory
Authors: Sumit R. Das and Samir D. Mathur
Abstract: In the 1-dimensional matrix model one identifies the tachyon field in the asymptotic region with a nonlocal transform of the density of fermions. But there is a problem in relating the classical tachyon field with the surface profile of the fermi fluid if a fold forms in the fermi surface. Besides the collective field additional variables $w_j(x)$ are required to describe folds. In the quantum theory we show that the $w_j$ are the quantum dispersions of the collective field. These dispersions become $O(1)$ rather than $O(\hbar)$ precisely after fold formation, thus giving additional `classical' quantities and leading to a rather nontrivial classical limit. A coherent pulse reflecting from the potential wall turns into high energy incoherent quanta (if a fold forms), the frequency amplification being of the order of the square root of the number of quanta in the incident wave.
