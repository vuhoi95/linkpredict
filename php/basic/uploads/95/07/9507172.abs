Title: Quantum Corrections to the Semiclassical Quantization of the SU(3) Shell  Model
Authors: V. R. Manfredi and L. Salasnich
Abstract: We apply the canonical perturbation theory to the semi--quantal hamiltonian of the SU(3) shell model. Then, we use the Einstein--Brillowin--Keller quantization rule to obtain an analytical semi--quantal formula for the energy levels, which is the usual semi--classical one plus quantum corrections. Finally, a test on the numerical accuracy of the semiclassical approximation and of its quantum corrections is performed.
