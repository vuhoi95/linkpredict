Title: Polynomial Identities, Indices, and Duality for the N=1 Superconformal  Model SM(2,4Î½)
Authors: Alexander Berkovich and Barry M. McCoy and William P. Orrick
Abstract: We prove polynomial identities for the N=1 superconformal model SM(2,4\nu) which generalize and extend the known Fermi/Bose character identities. Our proof uses the q-trinomial coefficients of Andrews and Baxter on the bosonic side and a recently introduced very general method of producing recursion relations for q-series on the fermionic side. We use these polynomials to demonstrate a dual relation under q \rightarrow q^{-1} between SM(2,4\nu) and M(2\nu-1,4\nu). We also introduce a generalization of the Witten index which is expressible in terms of the Rogers false theta functions.
