Title: On the Monodromies of N=2 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory with Gauge  Group SO(2n)
Authors: A. Brandhuber and K. Landsteiner
Abstract: We present families of algebraic curves describing the moduli-space of $N\!=\!2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group $SO(2n)$. We test our curves by computing the weak coupling monodromies and the number of $N\!=\!1$ vacua.
