Title: Non-perturbative monodromies in N=2 heterotic string vacua
Authors: Gabriel Lopes Cardoso and Dieter LÃ¼st and Thomas Mohaupt
Abstract: We address non-perturbative effects and duality symmetries in $N=2$ heterotic string theories in four dimensions. Specifically, we consider how each of the four lines of enhanced gauge symmetries in the perturbative moduli space of $N=2$ $T_2$ compactifications is split into 2 lines where monopoles and dyons become massless. This amounts to considering non-perturbative effects originating from enhanced gauge symmetries at the microscopic string level. We show that the perturbative and non-perturbative monodromies consistently lead to the results of Seiberg-Witten upon identication of a consistent truncation procedure from local to rigid $N=2$ supersymmetry.
