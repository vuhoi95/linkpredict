Title: Gravitational Interactions of integrable models
Authors: E. Abdalla and M. C. B. Abdalla
Abstract: We couple non-linear $\sigma$-models to Liouville gravity, showing that integrability properties of symmetric space models still hold for the matter sector. Using similar arguments for the fermionic counterpart, namely Gross--Neveu-type models, we verify that such conclusions must also hold for them, as recently suggested.
