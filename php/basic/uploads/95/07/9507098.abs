Title: Spontaneous symmetry breaking with Wilson renormalization group
Authors: M. Bonini and M. D'Attanasio
Abstract: We study the conditions under which a symmetry is spontaneously broken in the Wilson renormalization group formulation. Both for a global and local symmetry, the result is that in perturbation theory one has to perform a fine tuning of the boundary conditions for the flow of the relevant couplings. We consider in detail the discrete $Z_2$ case and the Abelian Higgs model.
