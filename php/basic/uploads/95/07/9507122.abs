Title: The Role of Temperature in a Dimensional Approach to QCD_3
Authors: A. Ferrando and A. Jaramillo
Abstract: We analyze the role played by temperature in QCD_3 by means of a dimensional interpolating approach. Pure gauge QCD_3 is defined on a strip of finite width L, which acts as an interpolating parameter between two and three dimensions. A two-dimensional effective theory can be constructed for small enough widths giving the same longitudinal physics as QCD_3. Explicit calculations of T-dependent QCD_3 observables can thus be performed. The generation of a deconfinig phase transition, absent in QCD_2, is proven through an exact calculation of the electric or Debye mass at high T. Low and high T behaviors of relevant thermodynamic functions are also worked out. An accurate estimate of the critical temperature is given and its evolution with L is studied in detail.
