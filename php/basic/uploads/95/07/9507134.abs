Title: Time-dependent quantum scattering in 2+1 dimensional gravity
Authors: M. Alvarez and F. M. de Carvalho Filho and L. Griguolo
Abstract: The propagation of a localized wave packet in the conical space-time created by a pointlike massive source in 2+1 dimensional gravity is analyzed. The scattering amplitude is determined and shown to be finite along the classical scattering directions due to interference between the scattered and the transmitted wave functions. The analogy with diffraction theory is emphasized.
