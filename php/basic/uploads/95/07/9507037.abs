Title: Perturbative Approach For Non Renormalizable Theories
Authors: J. Gegelia and G. Japaridze and N. Kiknadze and K. Turashvili
Abstract: Renormalization procedure is generalized to be applicable for non renormalizable theories. It is shown that introduction of an extra expansion parameter allows to get rid of divergences and express physical quantities as series of finite number of interdependent expansion parameters. Suggested method is applied to quantum (Einstein's) gravity.
