Title: BRST Cohomology and Vacuum Structure of Two-Dimensional Chromodynamics
Authors: E. Abdalla and K. D. Rothe
Abstract: Using a formulation of QCD_2 as a perturbed conformally invariant theory involving fermions, ghosts, as well as positive and negative level Wess-Zumino-Witten fields, we show that the BRST conditions become restrictions on the conformally invariant sector, as described by a G/G topological theory. By solving the corresponding cohomology problem we are led to a finite set of vacua. For G=SU(2) these vacua are two-fold degenerate.
