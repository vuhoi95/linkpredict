Title: On the Sutherland's Integrability Condition for Two-Dimensional  N-Particle Systems
Authors: A. Azhari and T. T. Truong
Abstract: Following Sutherland's work on one-dimensional integrable systems we formulate and study its two-dimensional version. Physically it expresses the absence of true 3-body forces among an assembly of N particles leaving exclusively effective 2-body interactions. This criterion may be a suitable candidate for an integrability condition.
