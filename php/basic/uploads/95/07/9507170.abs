Title: Matching Conditions and Duality in N=1 SUSY Gauge Theories in the  Conformal Window
Authors: Ian I. Kogan and Mikhail Shifman and Arkady Vainshtein
Abstract: We discuss duality in $N=1$ SUSY gauge theories in Seiberg's conformal window, $(3N_c/2)<N_f<3N_c$. The 't Hooft consistency conditions -- the basic tool for establishing the infrared duality -- are considered taking into account higher order $\alpha$ corrections. The conserved (anomaly free) $R$ current is built to all orders in $\alpha$. Although this current contains all orders in $\alpha$ the 't Hooft consistency conditions for this current are shown to be one-loop. This observation thus justifies Seiberg's matching procedure. We also briefly discuss the inequivalence of the ``electric" and ``magnetic" theories at short distances.
