Title: Non-Perturbative Particle Dynamics
Authors: A. Bellini and M. Ciafaloni and P. Valtancoli
Abstract: We construct a non-perturbative, single-valued solution for the metric and the motion of two interacting particles in ($2+1$)-Gravity, by using a Coulomb gauge of conformal type. The method provides the mapping from multivalued ( minkowskian ) coordinates to single-valued ones, which solves the non-abelian monodromies due to particles's momenta and can be applied also to the general N-body case.
