Title: Can the Fundamental Theory Of Everything be Renormalizable?
Authors: J. Gegelia and N. Kiknadze
Abstract: Some considerations showing that renormalizable theories with consistent perturbative theries can not be nonperturbatively finite (in terms of bare parameters) are provided. Accordingly any fundamental unified theory has to be either non renormalizable or order by order finite.
