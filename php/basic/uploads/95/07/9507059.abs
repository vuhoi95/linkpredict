Title: A model universe with variable dimension: Expansion as decrumpling
Authors: M. Khorrami and R. Mansouri and M. Mohazzab and M. R. Ejtehadi
Abstract: We propose a model universe, in which the dimension of the space is a continuous variable, which can take any real positive number. The dynamics leads to a model in which the universe has no singularity. The difference between our model and the standard Friedman-Robertson-Walker models become effective for times much before the presently accepted age of the universe.
