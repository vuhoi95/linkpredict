Title: Electroweak Strings and Fermions
Authors: Shion Kono and Stephen Naculich
Abstract: Z-strings in the Weinberg-Salam model including fermions are unstable for all values of the parameters. The cause of this instability is the fermion vacuum energy in the Z-string background. Z-strings with non-zero fermion densities, however, may still be stable.
