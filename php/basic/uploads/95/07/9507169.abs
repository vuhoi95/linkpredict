Title: Some Examples of Chiral Moduli Spaces and Dynamical Supersymmetry  Breaking
Authors: Erich Poppitz and Sandip Trivedi
Abstract: We investigate the low-energy dynamics of $SU(N)$ gauge theories with one antisymmetric tensor field, $N - 4 + N_f$ antifundamentals and $N_f$ fundamentals, for $N_f \le 3$. For $N_f = 3$ we construct the quantum moduli space, and for $N_f < 3$ we find the exact quantum superpotentials. We find two large classes of models with dynamical supersymmetry breaking. The odd $N$ theories break supersymmetry once appropriate mass terms are added in the superpotential. The even $N$ theories break supersymmetry after gauging an extra chiral $U(1)$ symmetry.
