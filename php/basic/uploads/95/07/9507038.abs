Title: Vacuum vertices and the ghost-dilaton
Authors: Sabbir Rahman and Barton Zwiebach
Abstract: We complete the proof of the ghost-dilaton theorem in string theory by showing that the coupling constant dependence of the vacuum vertices appearing in the closed string action is given correctly by one-point functions of the ghost-dilaton. To prove this at genus one we develop the formalism required to evaluate off-shell amplitudes on tori.
