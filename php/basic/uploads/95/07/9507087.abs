Title: Algebraic aspect and construction of Lax operators in quantum integrable  systems
Authors: B Basu-Mallick and Anjan Kundu
Abstract: An algebraic construction more general and intimately connected with that of Faddeev$^1$, along with its application for generating different classes of quantum integrable models are summarised to complement the recent results of ref. 1 ( L.D. Faddeev, {\it Int. J. Mod. Phys. } {\bf A10}, 1845 (1995) ).
