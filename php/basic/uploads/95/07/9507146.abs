Title: A connection between lattice and surgery constructions of  three-dimensional topological field theories
Authors: Masako Asano and Saburo Higuchi
Abstract: We study the relation between lattice construction and surgery construction of three-dimensional topological field theories. We show that a class of the Chung-Fukuma-Shapere theory on the lattice has representation theoretic reformulation which is closely related to the Altschuler-Coste theory constructed by surgery. There is a similar relation between the Turaev-Viro theory and the Reshetikhin-Turaev theory.
