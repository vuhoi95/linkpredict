Title: Superfield formulation of the Lagrangian BRST quantization method
Authors: P. M. Lavrov and P. Yu. Moshin and A. A. Reshetnyak
Abstract: Lagragian quantization rules for general gauge theories are proposed on a basis of a superfield formulation of the standard BRST symmetry. Independence of the $S$-matrix on a choice of the gauge is proved. The Ward identities in terms of superfields are derived.
