Title: Convergent sequences of perturbative approximations for the anharmonic  oscillator I. Harmonic approach
Authors: B. Bellet and P. Garcia and and A. Neveu
Abstract: We present numerical evidence that a simple variational improvement of the ordinary perturbation theory of the quantum anharmonic oscillator can give a convergent sequence of approximations even in the extreme strong coupling limit, the purely anharmonic case. Some of the new techniques of this paper can be extended to renormalizable field theories.
