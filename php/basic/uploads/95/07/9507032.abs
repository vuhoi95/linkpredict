Title: Temperatures of extremal black holes
Authors: A. Ghosh and P. Mitra
Abstract: The temperature of an extremal Reissner - Nordstrom black hole is not restricted by the requirement of absence of a conical singularity. It is demonstrated how Kruskal-like coordinates may be constructed corresponding to any temperature whatsoever. A recently discovered stringy extremal black hole which apparently has an infinite temperature is also shown to have its temperature unrestricted by conical singularity arguments.
