Title: Representation-theoretic derivation of the Temperley-Lieb-Martin  algebras
Authors: Tomasz Brzezinski and Jacob Katriel
Abstract: Explicit expressions for the Temperley-Lieb-Martin algebras, i.e., the quotients of the Hecke algebra that admit only representations corresponding to Young diagrams with a given maximum number of columns (or rows), are obtained, making explicit use of the Hecke algebra representation theory. Similar techniques are used to construct the algebras whose representations do not contain rectangular subdiagrams of a given size.
