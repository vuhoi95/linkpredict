Title: BRST Analysis of QCD_2 as a Perturbed WZW Theory
Authors: D. C. Cabra and K. D. Rothe and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: Integrability of Quantum Chromodynamics in 1+1 dimensions has recently been suggested by formulating it as a perturbed conformal Wess-Zumino-Witten Theory. The present paper further elucidates this formulation, by presenting a detailed BRST analysis.
