Title: (2+1)-Gravity with Moving Particles in an Instantaneous Gauge
Authors: A. Bellini and M. Ciafaloni and P. Valtancoli
Abstract: By defining a regular gauge which is conformal-like and provides instantaneous field propagation, we investigate classical solutions of (2+1)-Gravity coupled to arbitrarily moving point-like particles. We show how to separate field equations from self-consistent motion and we provide a solution for the metric and the motion in the two-body case with arbitrary speed, up to second order in the mass parameters.
