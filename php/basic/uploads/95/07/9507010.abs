Title: Surface critical behaviour of the honeycomb O(n) loop model with mixed  ordinary and special boundary conditions
Authors: M T Batchelor and C M Yung
Abstract: The O(n) loop model on the honeycomb lattice with mixed ordinary and special boundary conditions is solved exactly by means of the Bethe ansatz. The calculation of the dominant finite-size corrections to the eigenspectrum yields the mixed boundary scaling index and the geometric scaling dimensions describing the universal surface critical behaviour. Exact results follow in the limit n=0 for the polymer adsorption transition with a mixed adsorbing and free boundary. These include the new configurational exponent $\gamma_1=\frac{85}{64}$.
