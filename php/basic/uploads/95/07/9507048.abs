Title: Quantum Spin Glasses in Finite Dimensions
Authors: Heiko Rieger and A. Peter Young
Abstract: The Ising spin glass model in a transverse field has a zero temperature phase transition driven solely by quantum fluctuations. This quantum phase transition occuring at a critical transverse field strength has attracted much attention recently. We report the progress that has been made via Monte Carlo simulations of the finite dimensional, short range model.
