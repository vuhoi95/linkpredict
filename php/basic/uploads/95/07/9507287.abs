Title: Effective Field Theory for a Heavy Higgs: a Manifestly Gauge Invariant  Approach
Authors: A. Nyffeler and A. Schenk
Abstract: For large values of the Higgs boson mass the low energy structure of the gauged linear sigma model in the spontaneously broken phase can adequately be described by an effective field theory. In this work we present a manifestly gauge invariant technique to explicitly evaluate the corresponding effective Lagrangian from the underlying theory. In order to demonstrate the application of this functional method, the effective field theory of the abelian Higgs model is thoroughly analyzed. We stress that this technique does not rely on any particular property of the abelian case. The application to the non-abelian theory is outlined.
