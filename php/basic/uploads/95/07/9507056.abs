Title: Baxter Equation for the QCD Odderon
Authors: Z. Maassarani and S. Wallon
Abstract: The Hamiltonian derived by Bartels, Kwiecinski and Praszalowicz for the study of high-energy QCD in the generalized logarithmic approximation was found to correspond to the Hamiltonian of an integrable $XXX$ spin chain. We study the odderon Hamiltonian corresponding to three sites by means of the Bethe Ansatz approach. We rewrite the Baxter equation, and consequently the Bethe Ansatz equations, as a linear triangular system. We derive a new expression for the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues, and discuss the quantization of the conserved quantities.
