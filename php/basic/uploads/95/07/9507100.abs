Abstract: We quantize the chiral Schwinger Model by using the Batalin-Tyutin formalism. We show that one can systematically construct the first class constraints and the desired involutive Hamiltonian, which naturally generates all secondary constraints. For $a>1$, this Hamiltonian gives the gauge invariant Lagrangian including the well-known Wess-Zumino terms, while for $a=1$ the corresponding Lagrangian has the additional new type of the Wess-Zumino terms, which are irrelevant to the gauge symmetry.
