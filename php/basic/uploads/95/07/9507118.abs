Title: Interaction-Round-a-Face Models with Fixed Boundary Conditions: The ABF  Fusion Hierarchy
Authors: Roger E. Behrend and Paul A. Pearce and David L. O'Brien
Abstract: We use boundary weights and reflection equations to obtain families of commuting double-row transfer matrices for interaction-round-a-face models with fixed boundary conditions. In particular, we consider the fusion hierarchy of the Andrews-Baxter-Forrester models, for which we find that the double-row transfer matrices satisfy functional equations with an su(2) structure.
