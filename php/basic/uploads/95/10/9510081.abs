Title: Gravitational Radiation from String Cosmology
Authors: R. Brustein and M. Gasperini and M. Giovannini and G. Veneziano
Abstract: A spectrum of relic stochastic gravitational radiation, strongly tilted towards high frequencies, and characterized by two basic parameters is shown to emerge in a class of string theory models. We estimate the required sensitivity for detection of the predicted gravitational radiation and show that a region of our parameter space is within reach for some of the plannedgravitational-wave detectors.
