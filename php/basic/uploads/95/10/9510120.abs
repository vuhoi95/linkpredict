Title: Quantum Mechanics Violating Effects to Masses of Nambu-Goldstone Bosons:  A Lesson for Majoron
Authors: YÅ«ichi Chikashige and Tadashi Kon
Abstract: We study gravitational quantum mechanics violating (QMV) effects to masses of Nambu-Goldstone bosons, taking majoron as an example. We show a supersymmetric majoron has either mass of O(keV) for the dimension five potential or smaller mass for effective potentials with higher dimensions. We extend the Dashen's formula for pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons to include possible effects of QMV.
