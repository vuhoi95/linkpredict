Title: Zero Modes for the D=11 Membrane and Five-Brane
Authors: David M. Kaplan and Jeremy Michelson
Abstract: There exist extremal p-brane solutions of $D\!=\!11$ supergravity for p=2~and~5. In this paper we investigate the zero modes of the membrane and the five-brane solutions as a first step toward understanding the full quantum theory of these objects. It is found that both solutions possess the correct number of normalizable zero modes dictated by supersymmetry.
