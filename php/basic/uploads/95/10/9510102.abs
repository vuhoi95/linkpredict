Title: BRST Symmetric Gaugeon Formalism for Yang-Mills Fields
Authors: M. Koseki and M. Sato and R. Endo
Abstract: Yokoyama's gaugeon formalism is knwon to admit $q$-number gauge transformation. We introduce BRST symmetries into the formalism for the Yang-Mills gauge field. Owing to the BRST symmetry, Yokoyama's physical subsidiary conditions are replaced by a single condition of the Kugo-Ojima type. Our physical subsidiary condition is invariant under the $q$-number gauge transformation. Thus, our physical subspace is gauge invariant.
