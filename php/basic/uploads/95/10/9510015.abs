Title: q-Schrodinger Equations for V=u^2+ 1/u^2 and Morse Potentials in terms  of the q-canonical Transformation
Authors: O. F. Dayi and I. H. Duru
Abstract: The realizations of the Lie algebra corresponding to the dynamical symmetry group SO(2,1) of the Schr\"{o}dinger equations for the Morse and the $V=u^2+1/u^2$ potentials were known to be related by a canonical transformation. q-deformed analog of this transformation connecting two different realizations of the sl_q(2) algebra is presented. By the virtue of the q-canonical transformation a q-deformed Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the Morse potential is obtained from the q-deformed $V=u^2+ 1/u^2$ Schr\"{o}dinger equation. Wave functions and eigenvalues of the q-Schr\"{o}dinger equations yielding a new definition of the q-Laguerre polynomials are studied.
