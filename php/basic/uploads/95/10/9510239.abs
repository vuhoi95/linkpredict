Title: On the $W$-algebra in the Calegero-Sutherland model using the Exchange  operators
Authors: V. Narayanan and M. Sivakumar
Abstract: We study the $W_\infty$ algebra in the Calegero-Sutherland model using the exchange operators. The presence of all the sub-algebras of $W_\infty$ is shown in this model. A simplified proof for this algebra, in the symmetric ordered basics, is given. It is pointed out that the algebra contains in general, nonlinear terms. Possible connection to the nonlinear $W_\infty$ is discussed.
