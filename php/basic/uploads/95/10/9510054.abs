Title: Exact Solutions To The Generalized Lienard Equations
Authors: B. Dey and Avinash Khare and C. N. Kumar
Abstract: Many new solitary wave solutions of the recently studied Lienard equation are obtained by mapping it to the field equation of the $\phi^6-$field theory. Further, it is shown that the exact solutions of the Lienard equation are also the exact solutions of the various perturbed soliton equations. Besides, we also consider a one parameter family of generalised Lienard equations and obtain exact solitary wave solutions of these equations and show that these are also the exact solutions of the various other generalised nonlinear equations.
