Title: Practical scheme of reduction to gauge invariant variables
Authors: G. Chechelashvili and G. Jorjadze and N. Kiknadze
Abstract: For systems with first class constraints the reduction scheme to the gauge invariant variables is considered. The method is based on the analysis of restricted 1-forms in gauge invariant variables. This scheme is applied to the models of electrodynamics and Yang-Mills theory. For the finite dimensional model with $SU(2)$ gauge group of symmetry the possible mechanism of confinement is obtained.
