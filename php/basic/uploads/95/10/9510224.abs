Title: Towards effective topological gauge theories on spectral curves
Authors: A. Gorsky and A. Marshakov
Abstract: We discuss a general approach to the nonperturbative treatment of quantum field theories based on existence of effective gauge theory on auxiliary ''spectral" Riemann curve. We propose an effective formulation for the exact solutions to some examples of $2d$ string models and $4d$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories and consider their natural generalizations.
