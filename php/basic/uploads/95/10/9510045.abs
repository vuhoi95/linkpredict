Title: Thermodynamics of N=1 supersymmetric QCD
Authors: J. Grundberg and T. H. Hansson and U. Lindstr√∂m
Abstract: We use the dual description proposed by Seiberg to calculate the pressure in the low temperature confined phase of $N=1$ supersymmetric QCD using perturbation theory to $O(g^3_m)$, where $g_m$ is the gauge coupling in the dual theory. Combining this result with the usual high temperature expansion based on asymptotic freedom, we study how the physics in the intermediate temperature regime depends on the relative size of the scale parameters in the two descriptions. In particular we explore the possibility of having a temperature range where both perturbation expansions are valid.
