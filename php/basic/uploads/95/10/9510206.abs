Title: Algorithms for the calculation of the heat kernel coefficients
Authors: Ivan G. Avramidi and Rainer Schimming
Abstract: We present a brief overview of several approaches for calculating the local asymptotic expansion of the heat kernel for Laplace-type operators. The different methods developed in the papers of both authors some time ago are described in more detail.
