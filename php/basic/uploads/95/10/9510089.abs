Title: The Antighost Equation in N=1 Super-Yang-Mills Theories
Authors: Olivier Piguet and Silvio Paolo Sorella
Abstract: The antighost equation valid for usual gauge theories in the Landau gauge, is generalized to the case of $N=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories in a supersymmetric version of the Landau gauge. This equation, which expresses the nonrenormalization of the Faddeev-Popov ghost field, plays an important role in the proof of the nonrenormalization theorems for the chiral anomalies.
