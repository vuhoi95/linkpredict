Title: On a possibility to construct gauge invariant quantum formulation for  non-gauge classical theory
Authors: I. L. Buchbinder and V. D. Pershin and G. B. Toder
Abstract: A non-gauge dynamical system depending on parameters is considered. It is shown that these parameters can have such values that corresponding canonically quantized theory will be gauge invariant. The equations allowing to find these values of parameters are derived. The prescription under consideration is applied to obtaining the equation of motion for tachyon background field in closed bosonic string theory.
