Title: Causal Propagators for Algebraic Gauges
Authors: B. M. Pimentel and A. T. Suzuki and J. L. Tomazelli
Abstract: Applying the principle of analytic extension for generalized functions we derive causal propagators for algebraic non-covariant gauges. The so generated manifestly causal gluon propagator in the light-cone gauge is used to evaluate two one-loop Feynman integrals which appear in the computation of the three-gluon vertex correction. The result is in agreement with that obtained through the usual prescriptions.
