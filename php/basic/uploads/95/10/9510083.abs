Title: Topologically nontrivial field configurations in noncommutative geometry
Authors: H. Grosse and C. Klimcik and P. Presnajder
Abstract: In the framework of noncommutative geometry we describe spinor fields with nonvanishing winding number on a truncated (fuzzy) sphere. The corresponding field theory actions conserve all basic symmetries of the standard commutative version (space isometries and global chiral symmetry), but due to the noncommutativity of the space the fields are regularized and they contain only finite number of modes.
