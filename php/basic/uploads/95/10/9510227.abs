Title: New Vacua for Type II String Theory
Authors: Joseph Polchinski and Andrew Strominger
Abstract: Lorentz-invariant expectation values for antisymmetric tensor field strengths in Calabi-Yau compactification of IIA string theory are considered. These are found to impart magnetic and/or electric charges to the dilaton hypermultiplet. This results in a potential which can have supersymmetric minima at zero coupling or at conifold points in the moduli space. The latter occurs whenever the dilaton charge is aligned with that of the light black hole at the conifold. It is shown that there is a flat direction extending from the conifold along which there is a black hole condensate whose strength is of order the string coupling $g_s$. It is speculated that these new vacua correspond to string compactification on generalized Calabi-Yau spaces which have $c_1=0$ but are not Kahler.
