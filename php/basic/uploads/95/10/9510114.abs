Title: Spinors in non-relativistic Chern-Simons electrodynamics
Authors: C. Duval and P. A. Horv√°thy and L. Palla
Abstract: It is shown that the non-relativistic `Dirac' equation of L\'evy-Leblond, we used recently to describe a spin $1/2$ field interacting non-relativistically with a Chern-Simons gauge field, can be obtained by lightlike reduction from $3+1$ dimensions. This allows us to prove that the system is Schr\"odinger symmetric. A spinor representation of the Schr\"odinger group is presented. Static, self-dual solutions, describing spinor vortices are given and shown to be the non-relativistic limits of the fermionic vortices found by Cho et al. The construction is extended to external harmonic and uniform magnetic fields.
