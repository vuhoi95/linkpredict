Title: D-Strings on D-Manifolds
Authors: M. Bershadsky and V. Sadov and C. Vafa
Abstract: We study the mechanism for appearance of massless solitons in type II string compactifications. We find that by combining $T$-duality with strong/weak duality of type IIB in 10 dimensions enhanced gauge symmetries and massless solitonic hypermultiplets encountered in Calabi-Yau compactifications can be studied perturbatively using D-strings (the strong/weak dual to type IIB string) compactified on ``D-manifolds''. In particular the nearly massless solitonic states of the type IIB compactifications correspond to elementary states of D-strings. As examples we consider the D-string description of enhanced gauge symmetries for type IIA string compactification on ALE spaces with $A_n$ singularities and type IIB on a class of singular Calabi-Yau threefolds. The class we study includes as a special case the conifold singularity in which case the perturbative spectrum of the D-string includes the expected massless hypermultiplet with degeneracy one.
