Title: Sigma models with $A_k$ singularities in Euclidean spacetime of  dimension 0<=D<4 and in the limit N->infinity
Authors: J. Maeder and W. Ruehl
Abstract: For the case of the single-O($N$)-vector linear sigma models the critical behaviour following from any $A_k$ singularity in the action is worked out in the double scaling limit $N \rightarrow \infty$, $f_r \rightarrow f_r^c$, $2 \leq r \leq k$. After an exact elimination of Gaussian degrees of freedom, the critical objects such as coupling constants, indices and susceptibility matrix are derived for all $A_k$ and spacetime dimensions $0 \leq D < 4$. There appear exceptional spacetime dimensions where the degree $k$ of the singularity $A_k$ is more strongly constrained than by the renormalizability requirement.
