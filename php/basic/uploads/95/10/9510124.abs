Title: Hawking temperature from scattering off the charged 2D black hole
Authors: Jin Young Kim and H. W. Lee and Y. S. Myung
Abstract: The charged 2D black hole is visualized as presenting an potential barrier $V^{OUT}(r^*)$ to on-coming tachyon wave. Since this takes the complicated form, an approximate form $V^{APP}(r^*)$ is used for scattering analysis. We calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients for scattering of tachyon off the charged 2D black hole. The Hawking temperature is also derived from the reflection coefficient by Bogoliubov transformation. In the limit of $Q \to 0$, we recover the Hawking temperature of the 2D dilaton black hole.
