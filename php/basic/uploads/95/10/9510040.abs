Title: Covariant double-null dynamics: $(2+2)$-splitting of the Einstein  equations
Authors: P. R. Brady and S. Droz and W. Israel and S. M. Morsink
Abstract: The paper develops a $(2+2)$-imbedding formalism adapted to a double foliation of spacetime by a net of two intersecting families of lightlike hypersurfaces. The formalism is two-dimensionally covariant, and leads to simple, geometrically transparent and tractable expressions for the Einstein field equations and the Einstein-Hilbert action, and it should find a variety of applications. It is applied here to elucidate the structure of the characteristic initial-value problem of general relativity.
