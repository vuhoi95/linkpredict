Title: Quantum boundary currents for nonsimply-laced Toda theories
Authors: Silvia Penati and Andrea Refolli and Daniela Zanon
Abstract: We study the quantum integrability of nonsimply--laced affine Toda theories defined on the half--plane and explicitly construct the first nontrivial higher--spin charges in specific examples. We find that, in contradistinction to the classical case, addition of total derivative terms to the "bulk" current plays a relevant role for the quantum boundary conservation.
