Title: String-string duality for some black hole type solutions
Authors: K. Behrndt and H. Dorn
Abstract: We apply the duality transformation relating the heterotic to the IIA string in 6D to the class of exact string solutions described by the chiral null model and derive explicit formulas for all fields after reduction to 4D. If the model is restricted to asymptotically flat black hole type solutions with well defined mass and charges the purely electric solutions on the heterotic side are mapped to dyonic ones on the IIA side. The mass remains invariant. Before and after the duality transformation the solutions belong to short $N=4$ SUSY multiplets and saturate the corresponding Bogomol'nyi bounds.
