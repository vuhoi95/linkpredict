Title: On a possible connection of non-critical strings to certain aspects of  quantum brain function
Authors: N. E. Mavromatos and D. V. Nanopoulos
Abstract: We review certain aspects of brain function which could be associated with non-critical (Liouville) string theory. In particular we simulate the physics of brain microtubules (MT) by using a (completely integrable) non-critical string, we discuss the collapse of the wave function as a result of quantum gravity effects due to abrupt conformational changes of the MT protein dimers, and we propose a new mechanism for memory coding.
