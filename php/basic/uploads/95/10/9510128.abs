Title: Instability of a two-dimensional extremal black hole
Authors: Y. S. Myung and Jin Young Kim
Abstract: We consider the perturbation of tachyon about the extremal ground state of a two-dimensional (2D) electrically charged black hole. It is found that the presenting potential to on-coming tachyonic wave takes a double-humped barrier well. This allows an exponentially growing mode with respect to time. This extremal ground state is classically unstable. We conclude that the 2D extremal electrically charged black hole cannot be a candidate for the stable endpoint of the Hawking evaporation.
