Title: A unified framework for the Kondo problem and for an impurity in a  Luttinger liquid
Authors: P. Fendley and F. Lesage and H. Saleur
Abstract: We develop a unified theoretical framework for the anisotropic Kondo model and the boundary sine-Gordon model. They are both boundary integrable quantum field theories with a quantum-group spin at the boundary which takes values, respectively, in standard or cyclic representations of the quantum group $SU(2)_q$. This unification is powerful, and allows us to find new results for both models. For the anisotropic Kondo problem, we find exact expressions (in the presence of a magnetic field) for all the coefficients in the ``Anderson-Yuval'' perturbative expansion. Our expressions hold initially in the very anisotropic regime, but we show how to continue them beyond the Toulouse point all the way to the isotropic point using an analog of dimensional regularization. For the boundary sine-Gordon model, which describes an impurity in a Luttinger liquid, we find the non-equilibrium conductance for all values of the Luttinger coupling.
