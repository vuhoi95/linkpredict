Title: Quantum evolution of scalar fields in Robertson-Walker space-time
Authors: O. J. P. Eboli and H. C. Reis
Abstract: We study the $\lambda \phi^4$ field theory in a flat Robertson-Walker space-time using the functional Sch\"odinger picture. We introduce a simple Gaussian approximation to analyze the time evolution of pure states and we establish the renormalizability of the approximation. We also show that the energy-momentum tensor in this approximation is finite once we consider the usual mass and coupling constant renormalizations.
