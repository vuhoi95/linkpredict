Title: Background field boundary conditions for affine Toda field theories
Authors: P. Bowcock and E. Corrigan and R. H. Rietdijk
Abstract: Classical integrability is investigated for affine Toda field theories in the presence of a constant background tensor field. This leads to a further set of discrete possibilities for integrable boundary conditions depending upon the time-derivative of the fields at the boundary but containing no free parameters other than the bulk coupling constant.
