Title: One-dimensional fermi liquid and symmetry breaking in the vortex core
Authors: Yu. G. Makhlin and G. E. Volovik
Abstract: Fermions localized within vortex cores can form one-dimensional Fermi liquids. The nonzero density of states in these Fermi-liquids can lead to instability of the symmetric structure of the vortex core. We consider a symmetry breaking which is obtained due to spontaneous admixture of the spin-triplet p-wave component of the order parameter in conventional s-wave vortex in the presence of magnetic field. This occurs at low enough temperature and leads to an asymmetric shape of the vortex core. Similar phenomenon of the symmetry breaking induced by the core fermions occurs in electroweak $Z$-strings (S.G. Naculich, Phys. Rev. Lett., 75 (1995), 998).
