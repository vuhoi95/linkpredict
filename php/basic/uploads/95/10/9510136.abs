Title: Phase diagram of quantum dissipative junctions
Authors: T. Strohm and F. Guinea
Abstract: Mesoscopic capacitances, in the quantum regime, are described as a quantum rotor coupled to a dissipative bath. We analyze the phase diagram of this model, as function of the capacitance, the coupling to the bath (that is, the conductance of the device), and the decay of the correlation functions in the bath, i.\ e., the strength of the many body effects within the leads. By combining Monte-Carlo and analytical techniques, we present the full phase diagram. The similarities and differences with other models of quantum junctions are discussed.
