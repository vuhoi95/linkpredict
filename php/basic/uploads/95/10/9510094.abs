Title: Natural gauge-coupling unification at the string scale
Authors: C. Bachas and C. Fabre and T. Yanagida
Abstract: We argue that moduli in the adjoint representation of the standard- model gauge group are a natural feature of superstring models, and that they can account for the apparent discrepancy between the string and unification scales.
