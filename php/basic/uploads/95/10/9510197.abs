Title: Domain Wall Fermions and the Eta Invariant
Authors: David B. Kaplan and Martin Schmaltz
Abstract: We extend work by Callan and Harvey and show how the phase of the chiral fermion determinant in four dimensions is reproduced by zeromodes bound to a domain wall in five dimensions. The analysis could shed light on the applicability of zeromode fermions and the vacuum overlap formulation of Narayanan and Neuberger for chiral gauge theories on the lattice.
