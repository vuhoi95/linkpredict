Title: Duality Symmetries in N=2 Heterotic Superstring
Authors: I. Antoniadis and S. Ferrara and E. Gava and K. S. Narain and T. R. Taylor
Abstract: We review the derivation and the basic properties of the perturbative prepotential in N=2 compactifications of the heterotic superstring. We discuss the structure of the perturbative monodromy group and the embedding of rigidly supersymmetric monodromies associated with enhanced gauge groups, at both perturbative and non-perturbative level.
