Title: New supersymmetric generalization of the Liouville equation
Authors: Igor Bandos and Dmitrij Sorokin and Dmitrij Volkov
Abstract: We present new $n=(1,1)$ and $n=(1,0)$ supersymmetric generalization of the Liouville equation, which originate from a geometrical approach to describing the classical dynamics of Green--Schwarz superstrings in $N=2,~D=3$ and $N=1,~D=3$ target superspace. Considered are a zero curvature representation and B\"acklund transformations associated with the supersymmetric non--linear equations.
