Title: Blushift of a tachyon in the charged 2D black hole
Authors: H. W. Lee and Y. S. Myung and Jin Young Kim
Abstract: We study the propagation of string fields (metric $G_{\mu\nu}$, Mawxell gauge potential $A_{\mu}$, dilaton $\Phi$, and tachyon $T$) in a two-dimensional (2D) charged black hole. It is shown that the tachyon is a propagating field both inside and outside the black hole. This becomes infinitely blueshifted at the inner horizon. We confirm that the inner horizon is unstable, whereas the outer horizon is stable.
