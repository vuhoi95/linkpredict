Title: Lowering alpha_s by flipping SU(5)
Authors: J. Ellis and J. Lopez and D. Nanopoulos
Abstract: We show that the prediction for $\alpha_s(M_Z)$ in flipped SU(5) is naturally lower than in minimal SU(5), and that the former can accommodate the full range of $\alpha_s(M_Z)$ presently allowed by experiment. Our computations include two-loop ($\delta_{\rm 2loop}$) and light ($\delta_{\rm light}$) and heavy ($\delta_{\rm heavy}$) threshold effects. Unlike minimal SU(5), in flipped SU(5) the heavy threshold effects can naturally decrease the predicted value of $\alpha_s(M_Z)$. We also show that the value of the proton lifetime into the dominant channel $p\to e^+\pi^0$ is within the observable range at SuperKamiokande, and should discriminate against minimal supersymmetric SU(5), where the dominant mode is $p\to\bar\nu K^+$.
