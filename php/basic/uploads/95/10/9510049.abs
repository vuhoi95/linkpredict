Title: Null Surfaces, Initial Values and Evolution Operators for Scalar Fields
Authors: Ronald J. Adler and Ovid C. Jacob
Abstract: We analyze the initial value problem for scalar fields obeying the Klein-Gordon equation. The standard Cauchy initial value problem for second order differential equation is to construct a solution function in a neighborhood of space and time form values of the function and its time derivative on a selected initial value surface. On the characteristic surfaces the time derivative of the solution function may be discontinuous, so the standard Cauchy construction breaks down. For the Klein-Gordon equation the characteristic surfaces are null surfaces. An alternative version of the initial data needed differs from that of the standard Cauchy problem, and in the case we discuss here the values of the function on an intersecting pair of null surfaces comprise the necessary initial value data. We also present an expression for the construction of a solution from null surface data; two analogues of the quantum mechanical Hamiltonian operator determine the evolution of the system.
