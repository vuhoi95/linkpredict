Title: Non-Trivial Directions for Scalar Fields
Authors: Ken Halpern and Kerson Huang
Abstract: We study the eigenvectors of the renormalization-group matrix for scalar fields at the Gaussian fixed point, and find that that there exist ``relevant'' directions in parameter space. They correspond to theories with exponential potentials that are nontrivial and asymptotically free. All other potentials, including polynomial potentials, are ``irrelevant,'' and lead to trivial theories. Away from the Gaussian fixed point, renormalization does not induce derivative couplings, but it generates non-local interactions.
