Title: Black hole thermodynamics from quantum gravity
Authors: Gilad Lifschytz and Miguel E. Ortiz
Abstract: The semiclassical approximation is studied on hypersurfaces approaching the union of future null infinity and the event horizon on a large class of four dimensional black hole backgrounds. Quantum fluctuations in the background geometry are shown to lead to a breakdown of the semiclassical approximation in these models. The boundary of the region where the semiclassical approximation breaks down is used to define a `stretched horizon'. It is shown that the same effect that brings about the breakdown in semiclassical evolution associates a temperature and an entropy to the region behind the stretched horizon, and identifies the microstates that underlie the thermodynamical properties. The temperature defined in this way is equal to that of the black hole and the entropy is equal to the Bekenstein entropy up to a factor of order unity.
