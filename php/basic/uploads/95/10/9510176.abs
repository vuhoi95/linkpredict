Title: Redefining B-twisted topological sigma models
Authors: F. De Jonghe and P. Termonia and W. Troost and S. Vandoren
Abstract: A recently proposed variation on the usual procedure to perform the topological B-twist in rigid $N=2$ models is applied to the case of the $\sigma $ model on a K\"ahler manifold. This leads to an alternative description of Witten's topological $\sigma $ model, which allows for a proper BRST interpretation and ghost number assignement. We also show that the auxiliary fields, which are responsible for the off shell closure of the $N=2$ algebra, play an important role in our construction.
