Title: Quasi-exactly solvable problems and random matrix theory
Authors: G. M. Cicuta and A. G. Ushveridze
Abstract: There exists an exact relationship between the quasi-exactly solvable problems of quantum mechanics and models of square and rectangular random complex matrices. This relationship enables one to reduce the problem of constructing topological ($1/N$) expansions in random matrix models to the problem of constructing semiclassical expansions for observables in quasi-exactly solvable problems. Lie algebraic aspects of this relationship are also discussed.
