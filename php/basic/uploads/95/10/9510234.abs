Title: On the Ubiquity of K3 Fibrations in String Duality
Authors: Paul S. Aspinwall and Jan Louis
Abstract: We consider the general case of N=2 dual pairs of type IIA/heterotic string theories in four dimensions. We show that if the type IIA string in this pair can be viewed as having been compactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold in the usual way then this manifold must be of the form of a K3 fibration. We also see how the bound on the rank of the gauge group of the perturbative heterotic string has a natural interpretation on the type IIA side.
