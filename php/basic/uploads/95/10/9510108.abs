Title: Local Fractional Supersymmetry for Alternative Statistics
Authors: N. Fleury and M. Rausch de Traubenberg
Abstract: A group theory justification of one dimensional fractional supersymmetry is proposed using an analogue of a coset space, just like the one introduced in $1D$ supersymmetry. This theory is then gauged to obtain a local fractional supersymmetry {\it i.e.} a fractional supergravity which is then quantized {\it \`a la Dirac} to obtain an equation of motion for a particle which is in a representation of the braid group and should describe alternative statistics. A formulation invariant under general reparametrization is given, by means of a curved fractional superline.
