Title: Classical and quasi-classical aspects of supersymmetric quantum  mechanics
Authors: Georg Junker and Stephan Matthiesen and Akira Inomata
Abstract: A recent development of the studies on classical and quasi-classical properties of supersymmetric quantum mechanics in Witten's version is reviewed. First, classical mechanics of a supersymmetric system is considered. Solutions of the classical equations of motion are given and their properties are discussed in some detail. The corresponding quantum model is constructed by canonical quantization. The quantum model is analyzed by Feynman's path integral within a stationary-phase approximation. A quasi-classical quantization rule is derived, which is applicable when supersymmetry is exact or spontaneously broken.
