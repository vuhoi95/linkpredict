Title: On Integrable Doebner-Goldin Equations
Authors: P. Nattermann and R. Zhdanov
Abstract: We suggest a method for integrating sub-families of a family of nonlinear {\sc Schr\"odinger} equations proposed by {\sc H.-D.~Doebner} and {\sc G.A.~Goldin} in the 1+1 dimensional case which have exceptional {\sc Lie} symmetries. Since the method of integration involves non-local transformations of dependent and independent variables, general solutions obtained include implicitly determined functions. By properly specifying one of the arbitrary functions contained in these solutions, we obtain broad classes of explicit square integrable solutions. The physical significance and some analytical properties of the solutions obtained are briefly discussed.
