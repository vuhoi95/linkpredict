Title: Aspects of ${}^3$He and the Standard Electroweak Model
Authors: G. E. Volovik and Tanmay Vachaspati
Abstract: We describe certain aspects of ${}^3He$ and compare them to related aspects of the standard electroweak model of particle physics. We note various similarities in the order parameter structure, defect structure, interactions with fermions and anomalies in the two systems. Many issues in the condensed matter literature that are often confusing to the particle physics reader and vice versa are clarified.
