Title: Deformed Minkowski spaces: clasification and properties
Authors: J. A. de Azcarraga and F. Rodenas
Abstract: Using general but simple covariance arguments, we classify the `quantum' Minkowski spaces for dimensionless deformation parameters. This requires a previous analysis of the associated Lorentz groups, which reproduces a previous classification by Woronowicz and Zakrzewski. As a consequence of the unified analysis presented, we give the commutation properties, the deformed (and central) length element and the metric tensor for the different spacetime algebras.
