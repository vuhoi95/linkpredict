Title: From CFT's to Graphs
Authors: V. B. Petkova and J. -B. Zuber
Abstract: In this paper, we pursue the discussion of the connections between rational conformal field theories (CFT) and graphs. We generalize our recent work on the relations of operator product algebra (OPA) structure constants of $sl(2)\,$ theories with the Pasquier algebra attached to the graph. We show that in a variety of CFT built on $sl(n)\,$ -- typically conformal embeddings and orbifolds, similar considerations enable one to write a linear system satisfied by the matrix elements of the Pasquier algebra in terms of conformal data -- quantum dimensions and fusion coefficients. In some cases, this provides a sufficient information for the determination of all the eigenvectors of an adjacency matrix, and hence of a graph.
