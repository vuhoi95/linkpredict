Title: Squeezed Neutrino Oscillations in Quantum Field Theory
Authors: E. Alfinito and M. Blasone and A. Iorio and G. Vitiello
Abstract: By resorting to recent results on fermion mixing which show that the Fock space of definite flavor states is unitarily inequivalent to the Fock space of definite mass states, we discuss the phenomenological implications on the neutrino oscillation formula. For finite momentum the oscillation amplitude is depressed, or "squeezed", by a momentum dependent factor. In the relativistic limit the conventional oscillation formula is recovered.
