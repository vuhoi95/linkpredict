Title: Light-Heavy Symmetry: Geometric Mass Hierarchy for Three Families
Authors: A. Davidson and T. Schwartz and K. C. Wali
Abstract: The Universal Seesaw pattern coupled with a Light$\leftrightarrow$Heavy symmetry principle leads to the Diophantine equation $\displaystyle N = \sum_{i=1}^Nn_i$, where $n_i\geq 0$ and distinct. Its unique non-trivial solution $(3=0+1+2)$ gives rise to the geometric mass hierarchy $m_W$, $m_W\epsilon$, $m_W\epsilon^2$ for $N=3$ fermion families. This is realized in a model where the hybrid (yet Up$\leftrightarrow$Down symmetric) quark mass relations $m_d m_t \approx m_c^2\leftrightarrow m_u m_b \approx m_s^2 $ play a crucial role in expressing the CKM mixings in terms of simple mass ratios, notably $\sin\theta_C \approx {m_c\over m_b}$.
