Title: The Status of Renormalon
Authors: S. V. Faleev and P. G. Silvestrov
Abstract: It is shown that the series of renormalon--type graphs, which consist in the chain of insertions to one soft(hard) gluon(photon) line is in fact ill defined. Each new type of insertions, which appears in the higher orders of perturbation theory, generates the correction to renormalon of the order of $\sim 1$. However, this series of the corrections to the asymptotics although have no small parameter but hopefully is not the asymptotic one. The consideration based on the use of the renormalization group equation for effective charge is supported by the direct diagrammatic picture.
