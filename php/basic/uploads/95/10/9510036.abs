Title: Axial Couplings on the World-Line
Authors: Myriam Mondragon and Lukas Nellen and Michael G. Schmidt and Christian Schubert
Abstract: We construct a world-line representation for the fermionic one-loop effective action with axial and also vector, scalar, and pseudo-scalar couplings. We use this expression to compute a few selected scattering amplitudes. These allow us to verify that our method yields the same results as standard field theory. In particular, we are able to reproduce the chiral anomaly. Our starting point is the second-order formulation for the Dirac fermion. We translate the second order expressions into a world-line action.
