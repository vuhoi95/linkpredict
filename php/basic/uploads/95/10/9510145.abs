Title: Energy-Momentum Tensor Improvements in Two Dimensions
Authors: S. Deser and R. Jackiw
Abstract: We discuss some aspects of the two-dimensional scalar field, considering particularly the action for the conformal anomaly as an ``improved'' gravitational coupling, and the possibility of introducing a dual coupling, which provides a ``chiral'' energy-momentum tensor improvement.
