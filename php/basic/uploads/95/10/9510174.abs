Title: A Note on the Symplectic Structure on the Dressing Group in the  sinh--Gordon Model
Authors: G. Cuba and R. Paunov
Abstract: We analyze the symplectic structure on the dressing group in the \shG\, model by calculating explicitly the Poisson bracket $\{g\x g\}$ where $g$ is the \dg\, element which creates a generic one soliton solution from the vacuum. Our result is that this bracket does not coincide with the Semenov--Tian--Shansky one. The last induces a Lie--Poisson structure on the \dg . To get the bracket obtained by us from the Semenov--Tian--Shansky bracket we apply the formalism of the constrained Hamiltonian systems. The constraints on the \dg\, appear since the element which generates one solitons from the vacuum has a specific form.
