Title: Evidence for Heterotic - Type I String Duality
Authors: Joseph Polchinski and Edward Witten
Abstract: A study is made of the implications of heterotic string $T$-duality and extended gauge symmetry for the conjectured equivalence of heterotic and Type I superstrings. While at first sight heterotic string world-sheet dynamics appears to conflict with Type I perturbation theory, a closer look shows that Type I perturbation theory ``miraculously'' breaks down, in some cases via novel mechanisms, whenever the heterotic string has massless particles not present in Type I perturbation theory. This strongly suggests that the two theories actually are equivalent. As further evidence in the same direction, we show that the Dirichlet one-brane of type I string theory has the same world-sheet structure as the heterotic string.
