Title: Unstable two-dimensional extremal black holes
Authors: H. W. Lee and Y. S. Myung and Jin Young Kim
Abstract: We obtain the $\epsilon<2$ new extremal ground states of a two-dimensional (2D) charged black hole where $\epsilon$ is the dilaton coupling parameter for the Maxwell term. The stability analysis is carried out for all these extremal black holes. It is found that the shape of potentials to an on-coming tachyon (as a spectator) take all barrier-well types. These provide the bound state solutions, which imply that they are unstable. We conclude that the 2D, $\epsilon<2$ extremal black holes should not be considered as a toy model for the stable endpoint of the Hawking evaporation.
