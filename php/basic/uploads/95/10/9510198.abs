Title: Quantum Mechanical Anomalies and the De Witt Effective Action
Authors: Topi KÃ¤rki and Antti J. Niemi
Abstract: We study the partition function of N=1 supersymmetric De Rham quantum mechanics on a Riemannian manifold, with a nontrivial chemical potential $\mu$ for the fermions. General arguments suggest that when $\mu \to \infty$ we should get the partition function of a free point particle. We investigate this limit by exact evaluation of the fermionic path integral. In even dimensions we find the De Witt term with a definite numerical factor. However, in odd dimensions our result is pestered by a quantum mechanical anomaly and the numerical factor in the De Witt term remains ambiquous.
