Title: Geometry of the Quantum Complex Projective Space $CP_q(N)$
Authors: Chong-Sun Chu and Pei-Ming Ho and Bruno Zumino
Abstract: The quantum deformation $CP_q(N)$ of complex projective space is discussed. Many of the features present in the case of the quantum sphere can be extended. The differential and integral calculus is studied and $CP_q(N)$ appears as a quantum K\"{a}hler manifold. The braiding of several copies of $CP_q(N)$ is introduced and the anharmonic ratios of four collinear points are shown to be invariant under quantum projective transformations. They provide the building blocks of all projective invariants. The Poisson limit is also described.
