Title: Connection Between q-Deformed Anharmonic Oscillators and Quasi-Exactly  Soluble Potentials
Authors: Dennis Bonatsos and C. Daskaloyannis and Harry A. Mavromatis
Abstract: It is proved that quasi-exactly soluble potentials (QESPs) corresponding to an oscillator with harmonic, quartic and sextic terms, for which the $n+1$ lowest levels of a given parity can be determined exactly, may be approximated by WKB equivalent potentials corresponding to deformed anharmonic oscillators of SU$_q$(1,1) symmetry, which have been used for the description of vibrational spectra of diatomic molecules. This connection allows for the immediate approximate determination of all levels of the QESPs.
