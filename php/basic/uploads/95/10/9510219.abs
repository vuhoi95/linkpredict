Title: Singular Perturbations in Quantum Field Theory
Authors: V. E. Rochev and P. A. Saponov
Abstract: In this talk we discuss a new approximation scheme for non-perturbative calculations in a quantum field theory which is based on the fact that the Schwinger equation of a quantum field model belongs to the class of singularly perturbed equations. The self-interacting scalar field and the Gross-Neveu model are taken as the examples and some non-perturbative solutions of an equation for the propagator are found for these models. The application to QCD is also discussed.
