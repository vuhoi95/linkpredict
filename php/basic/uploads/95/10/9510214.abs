Title: On the Meissner effect in the Relativistic Anyon superconductors
Authors: M. Eliashvili and G. Tsitsishvili
Abstract: The relativistic model with two types of planar fermions interacting with the Chern-Simons and Maxwell fields is applied to the study of anyon superconductor. It is demonstrated, that the Meissner effect can be realized in the case of the simultaneous presence of the fermions with a different magnetic moment interactions. Under the certain conditions there occures an extra plateau at the magnetization curve. In the order under consideration the spectrum of the electromagnetic field excitations contains the long-range interaction and one massive "photon" state.
