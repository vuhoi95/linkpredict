Title: Character States and Generator Matrix Elements for $Sp(4) \supset SU(2)  \times U(1)$
Authors: N. Hambli and J. Michelson and R. T. Sharp
Abstract: A new set of polynomial states (to be called character states) are derived for $Sp(4)$ reduced to its $SU(2) \times U(1)$ subgroup, and the relevant generator matrix elements are evaluated. The group--subgroup in question is that of the seniority model of nuclear physics.
