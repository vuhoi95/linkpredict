Title: Anyonic Bogomol'nyi Solitons in a Gauged O(3) Sigma Model
Authors: Kyoungtae Kimm and Kimyeong Lee and Taejin Lee
Abstract: We introduce the self-dual abelian gauged $O(3)$ sigma models where the Maxwell and Chern-Simons terms constitute the kinetic terms for the gauge field. These models have quite rich structures and various limits. Our models are found to exhibit both symmetric and broken phases of the gauge group. We discuss the pure Chern-Simons limit in some detail and study rotationally symmetric solitons.
