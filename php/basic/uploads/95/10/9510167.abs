Title: On the renormalizability and unitarity of the Curci-Ferrari model for  massive vector bosons
Authors: Jan de Boer and Kostas Skenderis and Peter van Nieuwenhuizen and Andrew Waldron
Abstract: We prove the renormalizability of the Curci-Ferrari model with and without auxiliary fields using BRST methods. In both cases we find 5 $Z$ factors instead of 3. We verify our results by explicit one loop calculations. We determine a set of generators for the ``physical states'', many of which have negative norm. Supersymmetrization is considered.
