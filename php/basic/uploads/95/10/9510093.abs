Title: Chains of N=2, D=4 heterotic/type II duals
Authors: G. Aldazabal and L. E. Ibanez and A. Font and F. Quevedo
Abstract: We report on a search for $N=2$ heterotic strings that are dual candidates of type II compactifications on Calabi-Yau threefolds described as $K3$ fibrations. We find many new heterotic duals by using standard orbifold techniques. The associated type II compactifications fall into chains in which the proposed duals are heterotic compactifications related one another by a sequential Higgs mechanism. This breaking in the heterotic side typically involves the sequence $SU(4)\rightarrow SU(3)\rightarrow $ $SU(2)\rightarrow 0$, while in the type II side the weights of the complex hypersurfaces and the structure of the $K3$ quotient singularities also follow specific patterns.
