Title: How to Reach the Correct sin^2θ_W and α_S in String Theory
Authors: H. P. Nilles and S. Stieberger
Abstract: Effective theories with the matter content of the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model below the string scale M_string predict a wrong value for the weak--mixing angle sin^2\theta_W and strong coupling constant \alpha_S at the scale M_Z. To resolve this problem one needs large threshold corrections. At the same time one would like to avoid introducing new intermediate scales that are small compared to M_string. Two requests which seem to be incompatible. We show how both requirements can be satisfied in a class of (0,2) heterotic superstring compactifications with a natural choice of the vevs of the moduli fields entering the moduli dependent string threshold corrections.
