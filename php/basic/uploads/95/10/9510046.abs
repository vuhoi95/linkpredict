Title: The dynamics of cosmological perturbations in thermal $λφ^4$  theory
Authors: Herbert Nachbagauer and Anton K. Rebhan and Dominik J. Schwarz
Abstract: Using a recent thermal-field-theory approach to cosmological perturbations, the exact solutions that were found for collisionless ultrarelativistic matter are generalized to include the effects from weak self-interactions in a $\lambda\phi^4$ model through order $\lambda^{3/2}$. This includes the effects of a resummation of thermal masses and associated nonlocal gravitational vertices, thus going far beyond classical kinetic theory. Explicit solutions for all the scalar, vector, and tensor modes are obtained for a radiation-dominated Einstein-de Sitter model containing a weakly interacting scalar plasma with or without the admixture of an independent component of perfect radiation fluid.
