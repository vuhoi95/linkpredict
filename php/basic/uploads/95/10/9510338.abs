Title: On the tensor formulation of effective vector Lagrangians and duality  transformations
Authors: Johan Bijnens and Elisabetta Pallante
Abstract: Using two different methods inspired by duality transformations we present the equivalence between effective Lagrangians for massive vector mesons using a vector field and an antisymmetric tensor field. This completes the list of explicit field transformations between the various effective Lagrangian methods to describe massive vector and axial vector mesons.
