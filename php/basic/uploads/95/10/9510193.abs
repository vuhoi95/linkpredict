Title: Positronium as an example of algebraic composite calculations
Authors: Bertfried Fauser and Harald Stumpf
Abstract: The functional quantum field theory, developed by Stumpf, provides the possibility to derive the quantum dynamics of a positronium gas from Coulomb interacting electrons and positrons. By this example, the method will be brought in a Clifford algebraic light, through identifying the functional space with an infinite dimensional Euclidean Clifford algebra.
