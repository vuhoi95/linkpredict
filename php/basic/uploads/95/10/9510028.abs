Title: Supersymmetry and Dualities
Authors: E. Alvarez and L. Alvarez-Gaume and I. Bakas
Abstract: Duality transformations with respect to rotational isometries relate supersymmetric with non-supersymmetric backgrounds in string theory. We find that non-local world-sheet effects have to be taken into account in order to restore supersymmetry at the string level. The underlying superconformal algebra remains the same, but in this case T-duality relates local with non-local realizations of the algebra in terms of parafermions. This is another example where stringy effects resolve paradoxes of the effective field theory.
