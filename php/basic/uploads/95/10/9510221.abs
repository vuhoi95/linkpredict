Title: Quark mass correction to the string potential
Authors: G. Lambiase and V. V. Nesterenko
Abstract: A consistent method for calculating the interquark potential generated by the relativistic string with massive ends is proposed. In this approach the interquark potential in the model of the Nambu--Goto string with point--like masses at its ends is calculated. At first the calculation is done in the one--loop approximation and then the variational estimation is performed. The quark mass correction results in decreasing the critical distance (deconfinement radius). When quark mass decreases the critical distance also decreases. For obtaining a finite result under summation over eigenfrequencies of the Nambu--Goto string with massive ends a suitable mode--by--mode subtraction is proposed. This renormalization procedure proves to be completely unique. In the framework of the developed approach the one--loop interquark potential in the model of the relativistic string with rigidity is also calculated.
