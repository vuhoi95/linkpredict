Title: A gauge-invariant Hamiltonian analysis for non-Abelian gauge theories in  (2+1) dimensions
Authors: Dimitra Karabali and V. P. Nair
Abstract: The Hamiltonian formulation for a non-Abelian gauge theory in two spatial dimensions is carried out in terms of a gauge-invariant matrix parametrization of the fields. The Jacobian for the relevant transformation of variables is given in terms of the WZW-action for a hermitian matrix field. Some gauge-invariant eigenstates of the kinetic term of the Hamiltonian are given; these have zero charge and exhibit a mass gap.
