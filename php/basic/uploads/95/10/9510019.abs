Title: Width of Long Colour Flux Tubes in Lattice Gauge Systems
Authors: M. Caselle and F. Gliozzi and U. Magnea and S. Vinti
Abstract: In the confining phase of any gauge system the mean squared width of the colour flux tube joining a pair of quarks should grow logarithmically as a function of their distance, according to the effective string description of its infrared properties. New data on 3D Z_2 gauge theory, combined with high precision data on the interface physics of the 3D Ising model fit nicely this behaviour over a range of more than two orders of magnitude.
