Title: Conformal Linearization Versus Nonlinearity of $W$-Algebras
Authors: S. Krivonos and A. Sorin
Abstract: We review the new approach to the theory of nonlinear $W$-algebras which is developed recently and called {\it conformal linearization}. In this approach $W$-algebras are embedded as subalgebras into some {\it linear conformal} algebras with a finite set of currents and most of their properties could be understood in a much simpler way by studing their linear counterpart. The general construction is illustrated by the examples of $u(N)$-superconformal, $W(sl(N),sl(2))$, $W(sl(N),sl(N))$ as well as $W(sl(N),sl(3))$ algebras. Applications to the construction of realizations (included modulo null fields realizations) as well as central charge spectrum for minimal models of nonlinear algebras are discussed.
