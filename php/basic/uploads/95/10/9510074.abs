Title: On Quantum Groups in the Hubbard Model with Phonons
Authors: Bianca L. Cerchiai and Peter Schupp
Abstract: The correct Hamiltonian for an extended Hubbard model with quantum group symmetry as introduced by A. Montorsi and M. Rasetti is derived for a D-dimensional lattice. It is shown that the superconducting SUq(2) holds as a true quantum symmetry only for D = 1 and that terms of higher order in the fermionic operators in addition to phonons are required for a quantum symmetric hamiltonian. The condition for quantum symmetry is "half filling" and there is no local electron-phonon coupling. A discussion of Quantum symmetries in general is given in a formalism that should be readily accessible to non Hopf-algebraists.
