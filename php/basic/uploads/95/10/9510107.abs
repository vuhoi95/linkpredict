Title: Strings as a Model for Parent and Baby Universes: Total Splitting Rates
Authors: Khazret S. Nirov and Valery A. Rubakov
Abstract: Emission of hard microscopic string (graviton) by an excited macroscopic string may be viewed as a model of branching of a $(1+1)$-dimensional baby universe off large parent one. We show that, apart from a trivial factor, the total emission rate is not suppressed by the size of the macroscopic string. This implies unsuppressed loss of quantum coherence in $(1+1)$-dimensional parent universe.
