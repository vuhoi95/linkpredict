Title: One-loop effective action around de Sitter space
Authors: I. Antoniadis and J. Iliopoulos and T. N. Tomaras
Abstract: The non-local one-loop contribution to the gravitational effective action around de Sitter space is computed using the background field method with pure trace external gravitational fields and it is shown to vanish. The calculation is performed in a generic covariant gauge and the result is verified to be gauge invariant.
