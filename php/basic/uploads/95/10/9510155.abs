Title: The Master Field For 2D QCD On The Sphere
Authors: J. P. Nunes and H. J. Schnitzer
Abstract: We continue our analysis of the field strength correlation functions of two-dimensional QCD on Riemann surfaces by studying the large $N$ limit of these correlation functions on the sphere for gauge group $U(N)$. Our results allow us to exhibit an explicit master field for the field strength $F_{\mu\nu}$ in a ``topological gauge'', given by a single master matrix in the Lie algebra of the maximal torus of the gauge group. Field correlators are obtained from traces of products of the master field. We also obtain a master field for the gauge potential $A_{\mu}$ on the sphere, consistent with the master field for the field strength.
