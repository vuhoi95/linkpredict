Title: Relativistic Dynamics and Space-Time Structure of Few-Body Processes
Authors: Mladen Damjanović and Zvonko Marić
Abstract: The space-time features of the relativistic dynamics are analyzed in the framework of the time dependent propagator theory. The adiabatic hypothesis is substituted by the disturbative adiabatic hypothesis, resulting with the corresponding space-time regionalization of scattering processes. The other kind of generalization introduces forms of the propagator theory for the particle systems whose propagation is based on the family of spacelike surfaces. The mathematical basis is established allowing the definition of the corresponding, generalized propagators and amplitudes.
