Title: A Theory of Spinning Particles for Large N_extended Supersymmetry (II)
Authors: S. James Gates, Jr. and Lubna Rana
Abstract: Extending our prior investigation, we give a new off-shell construction of theories of spinning particles propagating in Minkowski spaces with arbitrary $N$-extended supersymmetry on the world-line. The basis of the new off-shell formulation is provided by realizations of new algebraic structures ${\cal G}{\cal R}$(${\rm d}, N$) that are certain generalizations of Pauli algebras.
