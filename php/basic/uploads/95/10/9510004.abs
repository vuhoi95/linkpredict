Title: Quantum Lie algebras of type A_n
Authors: Volodimir Lyubashenko and Anthony Sudbery
Abstract: It is shown that the quantised enveloping algebra of sl(n) contains a quantum Lie algebra, defined by means of axioms similar to Woronowicz's., This gives rise to Lie algebra-like generators and relations for the locally finite part of the quantised enveloping algebra, and suggests a canonical Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt basis.
