Title: Aspects of hairy black holes in spontaneously-broken Einstein-Yang-Mills  systems: Stability analysis and Entropy considerations
Authors: N. E. Mavromatos and Elizabeth Winstanley
Abstract: We analyze (3+1)-dimensional black-hole space-times in spontaneously broken Yang-Mills gauge theories that have been recently presented as candidates for an evasion of the scalar-no-hair theorem. Although we show that in principle the conditions for the no-hair theorem do not apply to this case, however we prove that the `spirit' of the theorem is not violated, in the sense that there exist instabilities, in both the sphaleron and gravitational sectors. The instability analysis of the sphaleron sector, which was expected to be unstable for topological reasons, is performed by means of a variational method. As shown, there exist modes in this sector that are unstable against linear perturbations. Instabilities exist also in the gravitational sector. A method for counting the gravitational unstable modes, which utilizes a catastrophe-theoretic approach is presented. The r\^ole of the catastrophe functional is played by the mass functional of the black hole. The Higgs vacuum expectation value (v.e.v.) is used as a control parameter, having a critical value beyond which instabilities are turned on. The (stable) Schwarzschild solution is then understood from this point of view. The catastrophe-theory appproach facilitates enormously a universal stability study of non-Abelian black holes, which goes beyond linearized perturbations. Some elementary entropy considerations are also presented...
