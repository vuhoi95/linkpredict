Title: Magnetic Solutions to 2+1 Gravity
Authors: Eric W. Hirschmann and Dean L. Welch
Abstract: We report on a new solution to the Einstein-Maxwell equations in 2+1 dimensions with a negative cosmological constant. The solution is static, rotationally symmetric and has a non-zero magnetic field. The solution can be interpreted as a monopole with an everywhere finite energy density.
