Title: Nonsupersymmetric String Solitons
Authors: Shamit Kachru and Eva Silverstein
Abstract: We begin a search for nonsupersymmetric/supersymmetric dual string pairs by constructing candidate critical nonsupersymmetric strings as solitons in supersymmetric string theories. Using orbifold techniques, one can construct cosmic string solutions which lie in supersymmetric vacua but which do not fall in supermultiplets. We discuss two three-dimensional examples in detail. The effective worldsheet actions for the soliton strings have (0,2) and (1,1) supersymmetry and the correct numbers of massless bosons and fermions to be critical heterotic and type II strings, respectively.
