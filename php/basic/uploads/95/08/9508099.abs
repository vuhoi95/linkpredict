Title: On Ising Correlation Functions with Boundary Magnetic Field
Authors: R. Konik and A. LeClair and G. Mussardo
Abstract: Exact expressions of the boundary state and the form factors of the Ising model are used to derive differential equations for the one-point functions of the energy and magnetization operators of the model in the presence of a boundary magnetic field. We also obtain explicit formulas for the massless limit of the one-point and two-point functions of the energy operator.
