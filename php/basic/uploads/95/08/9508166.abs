Title: On the Phenomenology of Tachyon Radiation
Authors: Ron Folman and Erasmo Recami
Abstract: We present a brief overview of the different kinds of electromagnetic radiations expected to come from (or to be induced by) space-like sources (tachyons). New domains of radiation are here considered; and the possibility of experimental observation of tachyons via electromagnetic radiation is discussed.
