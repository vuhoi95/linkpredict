Title: Generalized Thirring Models
Authors: I. Sachs and A. Wipf
Abstract: The Thirring model and various generalizations of it are analyzed in detail. The four-Fermi interaction modifies the equation of state. Chemical potentials and twisted boundary conditions both result in complex fermionic determinants which are analyzed. The non-minimal coupling to gravity does deform the conformal algebra which in particular contains the minimal models. We compute the central charges, conformal weights and finite size effects. For the gauged model we derive the partition functions and the explicit expression for the chiral condensate at finite temperature and curvature. The Bosonization in compact curved space-times is also investigated.
