Title: Relation between space-time inversion and particle-antiparticle symmetry  and the microscopic essence of special relativity
Authors: Guang-jiong Ni and Su-qing Chen
Abstract: After analyzing the implication of investigations on the C, P and T transformations since 1956, we propose that there is a basic symmetry in particle physics. The combined space-time inversion is equivalent to particle-antiparticle transformation, denoted by ${\cal PT=C}$. It is shown that the relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum field theory do contain this invariance explicitly or implicitly. In particular, (a) the appearance of negative energy or negative probability density in single particle theory -- corresponding to the fact of existence of antiparticle, (b) spin- statistics connection, (c) CPT theorem, (d) the Feynman propagator are linked together via this symmetry. Furthermore, we try to derive the main results of special relativity, especially, (e) the mass-energy relation, (f) the Lorentz transformation by this one ``relativistic'' postulate and some ``nonrelativistic'' knowledge.
