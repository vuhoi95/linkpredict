Abstract: Using heterotic/type II string duality, we obtain exact nonperturbative results for the point particle limit (alpha' -> 0) of some particular four dimensional, N=2 supersymmetric compactifications of heterotic strings. This allows us to recover recent exact nonperturbative results on N=2 gauge theory directly from tree-level type II string theory, which provides a highly non-trivial, quantitative check on the proposed string duality. We also investigate to what extent the relevant singular limits of Calabi-Yau manifolds are related to the Riemann surfaces that underlie rigid N=2 gauge theory.
