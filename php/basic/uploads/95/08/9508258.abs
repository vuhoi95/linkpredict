Abstract: We study the structure of the soft SUSY-breaking terms obtained from some classes of 4-D strings under the assumption of dilaton/moduli dominance in the process of SUSY-breaking. We generalize previous analysis in several ways and in particular consider the new features appearing when several moduli fields contribute to SUSY breaking (instead of an overall modulus $T$). Some qualitative features indeed change in the multimoduli case.A general discussion for symmetric Abelian orbifolds as well as explicit examples are given. Certain general sum-rules involving soft terms of different particles are shown to apply to large classes of models. Unlike in the overall modulus $T$ case, gauginos may be lighter than scalars even at the tree-level. However, if one insists in getting that pattern of soft terms, these sum rules force some of the scalars to get negative mass$^2$. These tachyonic masses could be a problem for standard model 4-D strings but an advantage in the case of string-GUTs.We also discuss the possible effects of off-diagonal metrics for the matter fields which may give rise to flavour-changing neutral currents. Different sources for the bilinear $B$ soft term are studied. It is found that the Giudice-Masiero mechanism for generating a ``$\mu $-term'', as naturally implemented in orbifolds, leads to the prediction $|tg\beta |=1$ at the string scale, independently of the Goldstino direction.
