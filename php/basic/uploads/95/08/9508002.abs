Title: Exact Results And Soft Breaking Masses In Supersymmetric Gauge Theory
Authors: Nick Evans and Stephen D. H. Hsu and Myckola Schwetz and Stephen B. Selipsky
Abstract: We give an explicit formalism connecting softly broken supersymmetric gauge theories (with QCD as one limit) to $N=2$ and $N=1$ supersymmetric theories possessing exact solutions, using spurion fields to embed these models in an enlarged $N=1$ model. The functional forms of effective Lagrangian terms resulting from soft supersymmetry breaking are constrained by the symmetries of the enlarged model, although not well enough to fully determine the vacuum structure of generic softly broken models. Nevertheless by perturbing the exact $N=1$ model results with sufficiently small soft breaking masses, we show that there exist nonsupersymmetric models that exhibit monopole condensation and confinement in the same modes as the $N=1$ case.
