Title: Vortex Filament in Three-manifold and the Duistermaat-Heckman Formula
Authors: Yukinori Yasui and Waichi Ogura
Abstract: Symplectic geometry of the vortex filament in a curved three-manifold is investigated. There appears an infinite sequence of constants of motion in involution in the case of constant curvature. The Duistermaat-Heckman formula is examined perturbatively for the classical partition function in our model and verified up to the 3-loop order.
