Title: Single particle Green's function in the Calogero-Sutherland model for  rational couplings $Î²=p/q$
Authors: D. Serban and F. Lesage and V. Pasquier
Abstract: We derive an exact expression for the single particle Green function in the Calogero-Sutherland model for all rational values of the coupling $\beta$. The calculation is based on Jack polynomial techniques and the results are given in the thermodynamical limit. Two type of intermediate states contribute. The firts one consists of a particle propagating out of the Fermi sea and the second one consists of a particle propagating in one direction, q particles in the opposite direction and p holes.
