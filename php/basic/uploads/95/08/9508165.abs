Title: Induced Gauge Fields in the Path Integral
Authors: Shogo Tanimura and Izumi Tsutsui
Abstract: The path integral on a homogeneous space $ G/H $ is constructed, based on the guiding principle `first lift to $ G $ and then project to $ G/H $'. It is then shown that this principle admits inequivalent quantizations inducing a gauge field (the canonical connection) on the homogeneous space, and thereby reproduces the result obtained earlier by algebraic approaches.
