Title: The Causal Phase in $QED_{3}$
Authors: J. L. Boldo and B. M. Pimentel and J. L. Tomazelli
Abstract: The operator ${\bf S}$ in Fock space which describes the scattering and particle production processes in an external time-dependent electromagnetic potential $A$ can be constructed from the one-particle S-matrix up to a physical phase $\lambda [A]$. In this work we determine this phase for $QED$ in (2+1) dimensions, by means of causality, and show that no ultraviolet divergences arise, in contrast to the usual formalism of $QED$.
