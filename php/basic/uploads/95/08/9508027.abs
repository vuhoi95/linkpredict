Title: Hawking Radiation and Unitary evolution
Authors: Sukanta Bose and Leonard Parker and Yoav Peleg
Abstract: We find a family of exact solutions to the semi-classical equations (including back-reaction) of two-dimensional dilaton gravity, describing infalling null matter that becomes outgoing and returns to infinity without forming a black hole. When a black hole almost forms, the radiation reaching infinity in advance of the original outgoing null matter has the properties of Hawking radiation. The radiation reaching infinity after the null matter consists of a brief burst of negative energy that preserves unitarity and transfers information faster than the theoretical bound for positive energy.
