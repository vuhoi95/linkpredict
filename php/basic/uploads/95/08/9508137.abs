Title: Quantum oscillator and a bound system of two dyons
Authors: V. M. Ter--Antonyan and A. Nersessian
Abstract: It is shown that $U(1)$--Hamiltonian reduction of a four--dimensional isotropic quantum oscillator results in a bound system of two spinless Schwinger's dyons. Its wavefunctions and spectrum are constructed.
