Title: Mesonic Spectra of Bosonized QCD_2 Models
Authors: A. Armoni and J. Sonnenschein
Abstract: We discuss bosonized two-dimensional QCD with massless fermions in the adjoint and multi-flavor fundamental representations. We evaluate the massive mesonic spectra of several models by using the light-front quantization and diagonalizing the mass operator $M^2=2P^+P^- $. We recover previous results in the case of one flavor adjoint fermions and we find the exact massive spectrum of multi flavor QCD in the limit of large number of flavors.
