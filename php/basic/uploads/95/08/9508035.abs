Title: Non-commutative Geometry and Kinetic Theory of Open Systems
Authors: A. Dimakis and C. Tzanakis
Abstract: The basic mathematical assumptions for autonomous linear kinetic equations for a classical system are formulated, leading to the conclusion that if they are differential equations on its phase space $M$, they are at most of the 2nd order. For open systems interacting with a bath at canonical equilibrium they have a particular form of an equation of a generalized Fokker-Planck type. We show that it is possible to obtain them as Liouville equations of Hamiltonian dynamics on $M$ with a particular non-commutative differential structure, provided certain geometric in character, conditions are fulfilled. To this end, symplectic geometry on $M$ is developped in this context, and an outline of the required tensor analysis and differential geometry is given. Certain questions for the possible mathematical interpretation of this structure are also discussed.
