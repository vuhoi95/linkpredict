Title: Four Dimensional Black Holes and Duality in Superstring Theory
Authors: C. P. Burgess and R. C. Myers and F. Quevedo
Abstract: Some recent results on the applications of duality (and related) transformations to general four-dimensional, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat and time-independent string configurations are summarized. Two classes of results have been obtained. First, these transformations are used to generate the general such solution to the lowest-order field equations in the alpha' expansion. Second, the action and implications of duality (based on time-translation) on the general configuration is determined. It is found to interchange two pairs of the six parameters which label these configurations, namely: (1) the mass with the dilaton charge, and (2) the axion charge with the Taub-NUT parameter. For the special case of the Schwarzshild black hole this implies the relation M -> - k/M, where k is a known, positive, quantity. It is argued that, in some circumstances, dual theories need not be equivalent in the simplest sense.
