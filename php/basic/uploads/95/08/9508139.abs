Title: Superspace Measures, Invariant Actions, and Component Projection  Formulae for (2,2) Supergravity
Authors: M. T. Grisaru and M. E. Wehlau
Abstract: In the framework of the prepotential description of superspace two-dimensional $(2,2)$ supergravity, we discuss the construction of invariant integrals. In addition to the full superspace measure, we derive the measure for chiral superspace, and obtain the explicit expressions for going from superspace actions to component actions. We consider both the minimal $U_A(1)$ and the extended $U_V(1) \otimes U_A(1)$ theories.
