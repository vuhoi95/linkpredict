Title: Effective Actions and Gauge Field Stability
Authors: Amit Giveon and Martin Roƒçek
Abstract: By studying an effective action description of the coupling of charged gauge fields in N=2 SU(n) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories, we can describe regions of moduli space where one or more of these fields becomes unphysical. We discuss subtleties in the structure of the moduli space for SU(3).
