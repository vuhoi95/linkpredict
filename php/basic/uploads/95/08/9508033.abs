Abstract: We study in detail the structure of Grand Unified Theories derived as the low-energy limit of orbifold four-dimensional strings. To this aim, new techniques for building level-two symmetric orbifold theories are presented. New classes of GUTs in the context of symmetric orbifolds are then constructed. The method of permutation modding is further explored and SO(10) GUTs with both $45$ or $54$-plets are obtained. SU(5) models are also found through this method. It is shown that, in the context of symmetric orbifold $SO(10)$ GUTs, only a single GUT-Higgs, either a $54$ or a $45$, can be present and it always resides in an order-two untwisted sector. Very restrictive results also hold in the case of $SU(5)$. General properties and selection rules for string GUTs are described. Some of these selection rules forbid the presence of some particular GUT-Higgs couplings which are sometimes used in SUSY-GUT model building. Some semi-realistic string GUT examples are presented and their properties briefly discussed.
