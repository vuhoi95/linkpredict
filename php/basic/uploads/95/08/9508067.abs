Title: Topological Sigma-model, Hamiltonian Dynamics and Loop Space Lefschetz  Number
Authors: Antti J. Niemi and Pirjo Pasanen
Abstract: We use path integral methods and topological quantum field theory techniques to investigate a generic classical Hamiltonian system. In particular, we show that Floer's instanton equation is related to a functional Euler character in the quantum cohomology defined by the topological nonlinear $\sigma$--model. This relation is an infinite dimensional analog of the relation between Poincar\'e--Hopf and Gauss--Bonnet--Chern formul\ae$~$ in classical Morse theory, and can also be viewed as a loop space generalization of the Lefschetz fixed point theorem. By applying localization techniques to path integrals we then show that for a K\"ahler manifold our functional Euler character coincides with the Euler character determined by the finite dimensional de Rham cohomology of the phase space. Our results are consistent with the Arnold conjecture which estimates periodic solutions to classical Hamilton's equations in terms of de Rham cohomology of the phase space.
