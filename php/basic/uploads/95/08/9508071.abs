Title: Quantum Moduli Spaces of $N=1$ String Theories
Authors: Tom Banks and Michael Dine
Abstract: Generically, string models with $N=1$ supersymmetry are not expected to have moduli beyond perturbation theory; stringy non-perturbative effects as well as low energy field-theoretic phenomena such as gluino condensation will lift any flat directions. In this note, we describe models where some subspace of the moduli space survives non-perturbatively. Discrete $R$ symmetries forbid any inherently stringy effects, and dynamical considerations control the field-theoretic effects. The surviving subspace is a space of high symmetry; the system is attracted to this subspace by a potential which we compute. Models of this type may be useful for considerations of duality and raise troubling cosmological questions about string theory. Our considerations also suggest a mechanism for fixing the expectation value of the dilaton.
