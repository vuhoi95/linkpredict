Title: Monopole and Dyon Bound States in N=2 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theories
Authors: S. Sethi and M. Stern and E. Zaslow
Abstract: We study the existence of monopole bound states saturating the BPS bound in N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. We describe how the existence of such bound states relates to the topology of index bundles over the moduli space of BPS solutions. Using an $L^2$ index theorem, we prove the existence of certain BPS states predicted by Seiberg and Witten based on their study of the vacuum structure of N=2 Yang-Mills theories.
