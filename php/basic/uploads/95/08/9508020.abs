Title: The Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture for W-algebras
Authors: Koos de Vos and Peter van Driel
Abstract: The main result in this paper is the character formula for arbitrary irreducible highest weight modules of W algebras. The key ingredient is the functor provided by quantum Hamiltonian reduction, that constructs the W algebras from affine Kac-Moody algebras and in a similar fashion W modules from KM modules. Assuming certain properties of this functor, the W characters are subsequently derived from the Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture for KM algebras. The result can be formulated in terms of a double coset of the Weyl group of the KM algebra: the Hasse diagrams give the embedding diagrams of the Verma modules and the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials give the multiplicities in the characters.
