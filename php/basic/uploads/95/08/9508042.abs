Title: Stainless super p-branes
Authors: H. Lu and C. N. Pope and E. Sezgin and K. S. Stelle
Abstract: The elementary and solitonic supersymmetric $p$-brane solutions to supergravity theories form families related by dimensional reduction, each headed by a maximal (`stainless') member that cannot be isotropically dimensionally oxidized into higher dimensions. We find several new families, headed by stainless solutions in various dimensions $D\le 9$. In some cases, these occur with dimensions $(D,p)$ that coincide with those of descendants of known families, but since the new solutions are stainless, they are necessarily distinct. The new stainless supersymmetric solutions include a 6-brane and a 5-brane in $D=9$, a string in $D=5$, and particles in all dimensions $5\le D\le 9$.
