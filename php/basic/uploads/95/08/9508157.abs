Title: Quantum Mechanical Breaking of Local GL(4) Invariance
Authors: R. Floreanini and R. Percacci
Abstract: We consider the gravitational coupling of a scalar field, in a reformulation of General Relativity exhibiting local GL(4) invariance at the classical level. We compute the one-loop contribution of the scalar to the quantum effective potential of the vierbein and find that it does not have GL(4) invariance. The minima of the effective potential occur for a vierbein which is proportional to the unit matrix.
