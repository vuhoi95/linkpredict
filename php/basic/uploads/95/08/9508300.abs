Title: Gravitational Perturbations of Relativistic Membranes and Strings
Authors: R. A. Battye and B. Carter
Abstract: We consider gravitationally induced perturbations of relativistic Dirac--Goto--Nambu membranes and strings (or {\it p}-branes). The dynamics are described by the first and second fundamental tensors, and related curvature tensors in an {\it n}-dimensional spacetime. We show how equations of motion can be derived for the perturbations within a general gauge and then discuss how various simple gauge choices can be used to simplify the equations of motion for specific applications. We also show how the same equations of motion can be derived from an effective action by a variational principle. Finally, we compare these equations of motion to those using more familiar notation for brane dynamics, which involves the induced metric on the worldsheet. This work sets up a general formalism for understanding the effects of backreaction on brane dynamics and the background curvature.
