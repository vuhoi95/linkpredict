Title: Type IIA-Heterotic Duals With Maximal Supersymmetry
Authors: S. Chaudhuri and D. A. Lowe
Abstract: Using finite abelian automorphism groups of $K3$ we construct orbifold candidates for Type IIA-heterotic dual pairs with maximal supersymmetry in six and lower dimensions. On the heterotic side, these results extend the series of known reduced rank theories with maximal supersymmetry. The corresponding Type IIA theories generalize the Schwarz and Sen proposal for the dual of the simplest of the reduced rank theories constructed as a novel Type IIA $\IZ_2$ orbifold.
