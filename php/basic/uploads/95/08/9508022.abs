Title: (T*B)_q, q-analogue of model space and CGC generating matrices
Authors: A. G. Bytsko and L. D. Faddeev
Abstract: We study relations between the deformed cotangent bundle (T*B)_q for the Borel subgroup B of a given simple Lie group G, the quantum Lie algebra J_q associated with the corresponding quantum group G_q and the matrices generating Clebsch-Gordan coefficients (CGC) for J_q. We reveal the connection of these objects to quantum analogue of the model space M and q-tensor operators.
