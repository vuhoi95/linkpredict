Title: Heat-kernel coefficients and functional determinants for higher-spin  fields on the ball
Authors: Klaus Kirstem and Guido Cognola
Abstract: The zeta function associated with higher-spin fields on the Euclidean $4$-ball is investigated. The leading coefficients of the corresponding heat-kernel expansion are given explicitly and the zeta functional determinant is calculated. For fermionic fields the determinant is shown to differ for local and spectral boundary conditions.
