Title: Fractional Quantum Hall Effect, Composite Fermions and Exotic Spinors
Authors: Torsten Asselmeyer and Georg He√ü
Abstract: A topological interpretation of the electron--electron interaction under FQHE conditions gives rise to the existence of some kind of composite fermions. The interaction term is similar to the Coulomb interaction and produces punctures in the configuration space which change its topology. Now the relevant configuration space is not simply connected and as a consequence, ``new'' fermions, so called ``exotic spinors'', appear. We argue that composite fermions may be interpreted as exotic spinors. The denominator of the filling factor is calculated to be an odd number. We point out further possible relevance of exotic spinors.
