Title: N=2 Supersymmetric QCD and Four Manifolds; (I) the Donaldson and the  Seiberg-Witten Invariants
Authors: Seungjoon Hyun and Jaemo Park and Jae-Suk Park
Abstract: We study the path integral of a twisted $N=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory coupled with hypermultiplet having the bare mass. We explicitly compute the topological correlation functions for the $SU(2)$ theory on a compact oriented simply connected simple type Riemann manifold with $b_2^+ \geq 3$. As the corollaries, we determine the topological correlation functions of the theory without the bare mass and those of the theory without coupling to the hypermultiplet. This includes a concrete field theoretic proof of the relation between the Donaldson and the Seiberg-Witten invariants.
