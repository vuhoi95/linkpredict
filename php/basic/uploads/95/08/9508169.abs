Title: QCD Heat Kernel in Covariant Gauge

Abstract: We report the calculation of the fourth coefficient in an expansion of the heat kernel of a non-minimal, non-abelian kinetic operator in an arbitrary background gauge in arbitrary space-time dimension. The fourth coefficient is shown to bring a nontrivial gauge dependence due to the contribution of the lowest order off-shell gauge invariant structure.
