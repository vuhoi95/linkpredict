Title: Static spherically symmetric monopole solutions in the presence of a  dilaton field
Authors: Peter Forgacs and Jozsef Gyurusi
Abstract: A numerical study of static spherically symmetric monople solutions of a spontaneously broken SU(2) gauge theory coupled to a dilaton field is presented. Regular solutions seem to exist only up to a maximal value of the dilaton coupling. In addition to the generalization of the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole a discrete family of regular solutions is found, corresponding to radial excitations, absent in the theory without dilaton.
