Title: Gaugino Condensation and the Vacuum Expectation Value of the Dilaton
Authors: A. Niemeyer and H. P. Nilles
Abstract: The mechanism of gaugino condensation has emerged as a prime candidate for supersymmetry breakdown in low energy effective supergravity (string) models. One of the open questions in this approach concerns the size of the gauge coupling constant which is dynamically fixed through the vev of the dilaton. We argue that a nontrivial gauge kinetic function $f(S)$ could solve the potential problem of a runaway dilaton. The actual form of $f(S)$ might be constrained by symmetry arguments.
