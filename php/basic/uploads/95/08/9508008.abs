Title: Critical Properties of the Calogero-Sutherland Model with Boundaries
Authors: Takashi Yamamoto and Norio Kawakami and Sung-Kil Yang
Abstract: Critical properties of the Calogero-Sutherland model of $BC_N$-type ($BC_N$-CS model) are studied. Using the asymptotic Bethe-ansatz spectrum of the $BC_N$-CS model, we calculate finite-size corrections in the energy spectrum. Since the $BC_N$-CS model does not possess translational invariance, the finite-size spectrum acquires the contributions coming from ``boundaries''. We show that the low-energy critical behavior of the model is described by $c=1$ boundary conformal field theory. Thus the universality class of the model is identified as a chiral Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid.
