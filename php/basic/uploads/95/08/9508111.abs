Title: An SU(2) Analog of the Azbel--Hofstadter Hamiltonian
Authors: E. G. Floratos and S. Nicolis
Abstract: Motivated by recent findings due to Wiegmann and Zabrodin, Faddeev and Kashaev concerning the appearence of the quantum U_q(sl(2)) symmetry in the problem of a Bloch electron on a two-dimensional magnetic lattice, we introduce a modification of the tight binding Azbel--Hofstadter Hamiltonian that is a specific spin-S Euler top and can be considered as its ``classical'' analog. The eigenvalue problem for the proposed model, in the coherent state representation, is described by the S-gap Lam\'e equation and, thus, is completely solvable. We observe a striking similarity between the shapes of the spectra of the two models for various values of the spin S.
