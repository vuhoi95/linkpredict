Title: Collective Motion of Micro-organisms from Field Theoretical Viewpoint
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Masako Kawamura and Akio Sugamoto
Abstract: We analyze the collective motion of micro-organisms in the fluid and consider the problem of the red tide. The red tide is produced by the condensation of the micro-organisms, which might be a similar phenomenon to the condensation of the strings. We propose a model of the generation of the red tide. By considering the interaction between the micro- organisms mediated by the velocity fields in the fluid, we derive the Van der Waals type equation of state, where the generation of the red tide can be regarded as a phase transition from the gas of micro-organisms to the liquid. (The number density of micro-organisms which generates the red tide is order estimated.)
