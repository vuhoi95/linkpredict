Title: Duality and the Legendre Transform
Authors: C. Ford and I. Sachs
Abstract: We define a weak-strong coupling transformation based on the Legendre transformation of the effective action. In the case of $N\es 2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, this coincides with the duality transform on the low energy effective action considered by Seiberg and Witten. This Legendre transform interpretation of duality generalizes directly to the full effective action, and in principle to other theories.
