Title: Exact Results for Integrable Asymptotically-free Field Theories
Authors: Jonathan M. Evans and Timothy J. Hollowood
Abstract: An account is given of a technique for testing the equivalence between an exact factorizable S-matrix and an asymptotically-free Lagrangian field theory in two space-time dimensions. The method provides a way of resolving CDD ambiguities in the S-matrix and it also allows for an exact determination of the physical mass in terms of the Lambda parameter of perturbation theory. The results for various specific examples are summarized.
