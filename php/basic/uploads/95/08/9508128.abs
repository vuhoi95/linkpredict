Title: A Relation Between Gravity in $(3+1)$--Dimensions and Pontrjagin  Topological Invariant
Authors: M. Medina and J. A. Nieto
Abstract: A relation between the MacDowell-Mansouri theory of gravity and the Pontrjagin toplogical invariant in $(3+1)$ dimensions is discussed. This relation may be of especial interest in the quest of finding a mechanism to go from non-dynamical to dynamical gravity.
