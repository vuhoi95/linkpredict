Title: Low Energy Dynamics of Monopoles in N=2 SYM with Matter
Authors: Martin Cederwall and Gabriele Ferretti and Bengt E. W. Nilsson and Per Salomonson
Abstract: We derive, for $N\is2$ super-Yang--Mills with gauge group $SU(2)$ and massless matter, the supersymmetric quantum mechanical models describing the time evolution of multi-monopole configurations in the low energy approximation. This is a first step towards identifying the solitonic states mapped to fundamental excitations by duality in the model with four hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation.
