Title: Boundary Yang-Baxter equation in the RSOS/SOS representation
Authors: C. Ahn and W. M. Koo
Abstract: We construct and solve the boundary Yang-Baxter equation in the RSOS/SOS representation. We find two classes of trigonometric solutions; diagonal and non-diagonal. As a lattice model, these two classes of solutions correspond to RSOS/SOS models with fixed and free boundary spins respectively. Applied to (1+1)-dimenional quantum field theory, these solutions give the boundary scattering amplitudes of the particles. For the diagonal solution, we propose an algebraic Bethe ansatz method to diagonalize the SOS-type transfer matrix with boundary and obtain the Bethe ansatz equations.
