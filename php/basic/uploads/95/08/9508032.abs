Title: A Discretized Version of Kaluza-Klein Theory with Torsion and Massive  Fields
Authors: Nguyen Ai Viet and Kameshwar C. Wali
Abstract: We consider an internal space of two discrete points in the fifth dimension of the Kaluza-Klein theory by using the formalism of noncommutative geometry developed in a previous paper \cite{VIWA} of a spacetime supplemented by two discrete points. With the nonvanishing internal torsion 2-form there are no constraints implied on the vielbeins. The theory contains a pair of tensor, a pair of vector and a pair of scalar fields. Using the generalized Cartan structure equation we are able not only to determine uniquely the hermitian and metric compatible connection 1-forms, but also the nonvanishing internal torsion 2-form in terms of vielbeins. The resulting action has a rich and complex structure, a particular feature being the existence of massive modes. Thus the nonvanishing internal torsion generates a Kaluza-Klein type model with zero and massive modes.
