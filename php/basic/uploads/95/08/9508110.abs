Title: Generalizations of the Andrews-Bressoud Identities for the $N=1$  Superconformal Model $SM(2,4Î½)$
Authors: Alexander Berkovich and Barry M. McCoy
Abstract: We present generalized Rogers-Ramanujan identities which relate the fermi and bose forms of all the characters of the superconformal model $SM(2,4\nu).$ In particular we show that to each bosonic form of the character there is an infinite family of distinct fermionic $q-$ series representations.
