Title: Membranes in the two-Higgs standard model
Authors: C. Bachas and T. N. Tomaras
Abstract: We present some non-topological static wall solutions in two-Higgs extensions of the standard model. They are classically stable in a large region of parameter space, compatible with perturbative unitarity and with present phenomenological bounds.
