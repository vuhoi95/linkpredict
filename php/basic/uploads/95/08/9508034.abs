Title: Sp(2)-Symmetric Lagrangian BRST Quantization
Authors: P. H. Damgaard and F. De Jonghe and K. Bering
Abstract: One Lagrangian BRST quantization principle is that of imposing correct Schwinger-Dyson equations through the BRST Ward identities. In this paper we show how to derive the analogous $Sp(2)$-symmetric quantization condition in flat coordinates from an underlying $Sp(2)$-symmetric Schwinger-Dyson BRST symmetry. We also show under what conditions this can be recast in the language of triplectic quantization.
