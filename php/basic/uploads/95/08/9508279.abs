Title: A Simple Description of Strange Dibaryons in the Skyrme Model
Authors: Igor R. Klebanov and Karl M. Westerberg
Abstract: We study strange dibaryons based on the SU(2)-embedded B=2 toroidal soliton. Treating the excursions of the soliton into strange directions as small rigid oscillations, we obtain a good approximation to the bound state approach. We calculate the dibaryon mass formula to order 1/N and find that the doubly strange I=J=0 dibaryon is bound by about 90 MeV.
