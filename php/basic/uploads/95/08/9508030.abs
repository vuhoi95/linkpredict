Title: The BRST Symmetry of Affine Lie Superalgebras and Non-Critical Strings
Authors: I. P. Ennes and J. M. Isidro and A. V. Ramallo
Abstract: The topological field theories associated with affine Lie superalgebras are constructed. Their BRST symmetry is characterised by a Kazama algebra containing spin 1, 2 and 3 operators and closes linearly. Under this symmetry all operators are grouped into BRST doublets. The relation between the models constructed and non-critical string theories is explored.
