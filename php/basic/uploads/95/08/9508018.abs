Title: Aharonov-Bohm Type Forces Between Magnetic Fluxons
Authors: Y. Aharonov and S. Nussinov and S. Popescu and B. Reznik
Abstract: Forces related to A-B phases between fluxons with $\Phi=\alpha\Phi_0\ \ \ $ $\alpha\ne integer$ are discussed. We find a $\alpha^2\ln(r)$ type interaction screened on a scale $\lambda_s$. The forces exist only when the fluxons are actually immersed in the region with non vanishing charge density and are periodic in $\alpha$. We briefly comment on the problem of observing such forces.
