Title: Identical Particles and Quantum Symmetries
Authors: Gaetano Fiore and Peter Schupp
Abstract: We propose a solution to the problem of compatibility of Bose-Fermi statistics with symmetry transformations implemented by compact quantum groups of Drinfel'd type. We use unitary transformations to conjugate multi-particle symmetry postulates, so as to obtain a twisted realization of the symmetric groups S_n.
