Title: MINBU Distribution of Two Dimensional Quantum Gravity: Simulation Result  and Semiclassical Analysis
Authors: S. Ichinose and N. Tsuda and T. Yukawa
Abstract: We analyse MINBU distribution of 2 dimensional quantum gravity. New data of R$^2$-gravity by the Monte Carlo simulation and its theoretical analysis by the semiclassical approach are presented. The cross-over phenomenon takes place at some size of the baby universe where the randomness competes with the smoothing force of $R^2$-term. The dependence on the central charge $c_m$\ and on the $R^2$-coupling are explained for the ordinary 2d quantum gravity and for $R^2$-gravity. The $R^2$-Liouville solution plays the central role in the semiclassical analysis. A total derivative term (surface term) and the infrared regularization play important roles . The surface topology is that of a sphere.
