Title: Non-minimal coupling, boundary terms and renormalization of the  Einstein-Hilbert action
Authors: A. O. Barvinsky and S. N. Solodukhin
Abstract: A consistent variational procedure applied to the gravitational action requires according to Gibbons and Hawking a certain balance between the volume and boundary parts of the action. We consider the problem of preserving this balance in the quantum effective action for the matter non-minimally coupled to metric. It is shown that one has to add a special boundary term to the matter action analogous to the Gibbons-Hawking one. This boundary term modifies the one-loop quantum corrections to give a correct balance for the effective action as well. This means that the boundary UV divergences do not require independent renormalization and are automatically renormalized simultaneously with their volume part. This result is derived for arbitrary non-minimally coupled matter. The example of 2D Maxwell field is considered in much detail. The relevance of the results obtained to the problem of the renormalization of the black hole entropy is discussed.
