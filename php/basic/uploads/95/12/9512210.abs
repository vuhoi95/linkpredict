Title: World-Sheet Logarithmic Operators and Target Space Symmetries in String  Theory
Authors: Ian I. Kogan and Nick E. Mavromatos
Abstract: We discuss the target-space interpretation of the world-sheet logarithmic operators in string theory. These operators generate the normalizable zero modes (discrete states) in target space, which restore the symmetries of the theory broken by the background. The problem of the recoil in string theory is considered, as well as some general properties of string amplitudes containing logarithmic operators.
