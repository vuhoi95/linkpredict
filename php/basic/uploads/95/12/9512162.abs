Title: Scale Anomaly and Quantum Chaos in the Billiards with Pointlike  Scatterers
Authors: Taksu Cheon and Takaomi Shigehara
Abstract: We argue that the random-matrix like energy spectra found in pseudointegrable billiards with pointlike scatterers are related to the quantum violation of scale invariance of classical analogue system. It is shown that the behavior of the running coupling constant explains the key characteristics of the level statistics of pseudointegrable billiards.
