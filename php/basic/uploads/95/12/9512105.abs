Abstract: We investigate higher grading integrable generalizations of the affine Toda systems. The extra fields, associated to non zero grade generators, obey field equations of the Dirac type and are regarded as matter fields. The models possess soliton configurations, which can be interpreted as particles of the theory, on the same footing as those associated to fundamental fields. A special subclass of these models is remarkable. They possess a $U(1)$ Noether current which, after a special gauge fixing of the conformal symmetry, is proportional to a topological current. This leads to the confinement of the matter field inside the solitons, which can be regarded as a one dimensional bag model for QCD. These models are also relevent to the study of electron self--localization in (quasi)-one-dimensional electron--phonon systems.
