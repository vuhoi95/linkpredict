Title: Chiral Symmetry Breaking by a Magnetic Field in Weak-coupling QED
Authors: C. N. Leung and Y. J. Ng and A. W. Ackley
Abstract: Using the nonperturbative Schwinger-Dyson equation, we show that chiral symmetry in weak-coupling massless QED is dynamically broken by a constant but arbitrarily strong external magnetic field.
