Authors: Dileep P. Jatkar and Sudipta Mukherji and Sudhakar Panda
Abstract: We study some features of dyonic Black hole solution in heterotic string theory on a six torus. This solution has 58 parameters. Of these, 28 parameters denote the electric charge of the black hole, another 28 correspond to the magnetic charge, and the other two parameters being the mass and the angular momentum of the black hole. We discuss the extremal limit and show that in various limits, it reduces to the known black hole solutions. The solutions saturating the Bogomolnyi bound are identified. Explicit solution is presented for the non-rotating dyonic black hole.
