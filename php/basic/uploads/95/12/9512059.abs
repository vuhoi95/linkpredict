Title: Exact Finite-Size Spectra in the Kondo Problem and Boundary Conformal  Field Theory
Authors: S. Fujimoto and N. Kawakami and S. -K. Yang
Abstract: The exact finite-size spectra for several quantum impurity models related to the Kondo problem are obtained from the Bethe ansatz solutions. Using the finite-size scaling in boundary conformal field theory, we determine various surface critical exponents from the exact spectrum, which accord with those obtained by Affleck and Ludwig with Kac-Moody fusion rules. Some applications to critical phenomena observed in connection with the orthogonality catastrophe are also discussed.
