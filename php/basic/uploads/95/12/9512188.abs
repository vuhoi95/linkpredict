Title: Massless BPS-Saturated States on the Two-Torus Moduli Sub-Space of  Heterotic String
Authors: Kwan-Leung Chan and Mirjam Cvetic
Abstract: Within a four-dimensional, toroidally compactified heterotic string, we identify (quantized) charge vectors of electrically charged BPS-saturated states (along with the tower of SL(2,Z) related dyonic states), which preserve 1/2 of N=4 supersymmetry and become massless along the hyper-surfaces of enhanced gauge symmetry of the two-torus moduli sub-space. In addition, we identify charge vectors of the dyonic BPS-saturated states (along with the tower of SL(2,Z) related states), which preserve 1/4 of N=4 supersymmetry, and become massless at two points with the maximal gauge symmetry enhancement.
