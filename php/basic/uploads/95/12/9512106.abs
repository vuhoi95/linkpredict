Title: A (1+1)-Dimensional Reduced Model of Mesons
Authors: F. Antonuccio and S. Dalley
Abstract: We propose an extension of 't Hooft's large-$N_c$ light-front QCD in two dimensions to include helicity and physical gluon degrees of freedom, modelled on a classical dimensional reduction of four dimensional QCD. A non-perturbative renormalisation of the infinite set of coupled integral equations describing boundstates is performed. These equations are then solved, both analytically in a phase space wavefunction approximation and numerically by discretising momenta, for (hybrid) meson masses and (polarized) parton structure functions.
