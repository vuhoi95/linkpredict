Title: Some properties of unstable monopoles in Super-QCD
Authors: J. L. F. Barbon and S. Ramgoolam
Abstract: We study embeddings of the Prasad-Sommerfield monopole solution in SU(N) Super-QCD (N>2), where the role of the Higgs field is played by the squarks in the fundamental representation. Classically, the resulting configurations live in a phase with unbroken SU(k) subgroups of SU(N) (as a result they are not topologically stable). The structure of zero modes is such that they can be naturally interpreted as massive chiral superfields with R charge one and baryon number zero, transforming in the adjoint representation of a dual gauge group defined using the Goddard-Nuyts-Olive (GNO) framework. We discuss the possible applications of these monopoles to N=1 duality, and more generally the possibility of relating GNO-type dual gauge groups to those appearing in N=1 duality.
