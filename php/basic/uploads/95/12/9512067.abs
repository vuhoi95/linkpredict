Title: Four Dimensional Orbit Spaces of Compact Coregular Linear Groups
Authors: G. Sartori and V. Talamini
Abstract: All four dimensional orbit spaces of compact coregular linear groups have been determined. The results are obtained through the integration of a universal differential equation, that only requires as input the number of elements of an integrity basis of the ideal of polynomial invariants of the linear group. Our results are relevant and lead to universality properties in the physics of spontaneous symmetry breaking at the classical level.
