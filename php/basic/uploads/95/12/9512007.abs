Title: Folded Bifurcation in Coupled Asymmetric Logistic Maps
Authors: Shoichi Midorikawa and Takayuki Kubo and Taksu Cheon
Abstract: A system of coupled two logistic maps, one periodic and the other chaotic, is studied. It is found that with the variation of the coupling strength, the system displays several curious features such as the appearance of quadrupling of period, occurrence of isolated period three attractor and the coexistence of the Hopf and pitchfork bifurcations. Possible applications and extensions are discussed.
