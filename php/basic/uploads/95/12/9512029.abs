Title: A Mathematica Package for Computing N=2 Superfield Operator Product  Expansions
Authors: Sergey Krivonos and Kris Thielemans
Abstract: We describe a general purpose Mathematica package for computing Superfield Operator Product Expansions in meromorphic $N=2$ superconformal field theory. Given the SOPEs for a set of ``basic" superfields, SOPEs of arbitrarily complicated composites can be computed automatically. Normal ordered products are always reduced to a standard form. It is possible to check the Jacobi identities, and to compute Poisson brackets (``classical SOPEs''). We present two explicit examples: a construction of the ``small'' $N=4$ superconformal algebra in terms of $N=2$ superfields, and a realisation of the $N=2$ superconformal algebra in terms of chiral and antichiral fermionic superfields.
