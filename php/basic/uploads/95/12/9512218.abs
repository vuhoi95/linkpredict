Title: A Construction of Solutions to Reflection Equations for  Interaction-Round-a-Face Models
Authors: Roger E. Behrend and Paul A. Pearce
Abstract: We present a procedure in which known solutions to reflection equations for interaction-round-a-face lattice models are used to construct new solutions. The procedure is particularly well-suited to models which have a known fusion hierarchy and which are based on graphs containing a node of valency $1$. Among such models are the Andrews-Baxter-Forrester models, for which we construct reflection equation solutions for fixed and free boundary conditions.
