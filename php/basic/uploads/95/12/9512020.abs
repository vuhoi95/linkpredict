Title: Higher-Order Differential Operators on a Lie Group and Quantization
Authors: V. Aldaya and J. Guerrero and G. Marmo
Abstract: This talk is devoted mainly to the concept of higher-order polarization on a group, which is introduced in the framework of a Group Approach to Quantization, as a powerful tool to guarantee the irreducibility of quantizations and/or representations of Lie groups in those anomalous cases where the Kostant-Kirilov co-adjoint method or the Borel-Weyl-Bott representation algorithm do not succeed.
