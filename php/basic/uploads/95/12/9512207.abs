Title: The Post-Newtonian Limit of Dilaton Gravity
Authors: Rue-Ron Hsu and Bokai Yang and Chin-Rong Lee
Abstract: We study the post-Newtonian limit of a generalized dilaton gravity in which gravity is coupled to dilaton and eletromagnetic fields. The field equations are derived using the post-Newtonian scheme, and the approximate solution is presented for a point mass with electric and dilaton charges. The result indicates that the dilaton effect can be detected, in post-Newtonian level, using a charged test particle but not a neutral one. We have also checked that the approximate solution is indeed consistent with the weak field expansion of charged dilaton black hole solution in the harmonic coordinate.
