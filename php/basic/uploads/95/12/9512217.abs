Title: Infinite series solutions of the symmetry equation for the $1 +2$  dimensional continuous Toda chain
Authors: D. B. Fairlie and A. N. Leznov
Abstract: A sequence of solutions to the equation of symmetry for the continuous Toda chain in $1+2$ dimensions is represented in explicit form. This fact leads to the supposition that this equation is completely integrable.
