Title: Collective Field Description of Spin Calogero-Sutherland Models
Authors: H. Awata and Y. Matsuo and T. Yamamoto
Abstract: Using the collective field technique, we give the description of the spin Calogero-Sutherland Model (CSM) in terms of free bosons. This approach can be applicable for arbitrary coupling constant and provides the bosonized Hamiltonian of the spin CSM. The boson Fock space can be identified with the Hilbert space of the spin CSM in the large $N$ limit. We show that the eigenstates corresponding to the Young diagram with a single row or column are represented by the vertex operators. We also derive a dual description of the Hamiltonian and comment on the construction of the general eigenstates.
