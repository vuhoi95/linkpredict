Title: Valley Instanton versus Constrained Instanton
Authors: Hideaki Aoyama and Toshiyuki Harano and Masatoshi Sato and Shinya Wada
Abstract: Based on the new valley equation, we propose the most plausible method for constructing instanton-like configurations in the theory where the presence of a mass scale prevents the existence of the classical solution with a finite radius. We call the resulting instanton-like configuration as valley instanton. The detail comparison between the valley instanton and the constrained instanton in $\phi^4$ theory and the gauge-Higgs system are carried out. For instanton-like configurations with large radii, there appear remarkable differences between them. These differences are essential in calculating the baryon number violating processes with multi bosons.
