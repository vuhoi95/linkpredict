Title: BRST Quantization of Gauge Theory in Noncommutative Geometry: Matrix  Derivative Approach
Authors: Chang-Yeong Lee and Dae Sung Hwang and Yuval Ne'eman
Abstract: The BRST quantization of a gauge theory in noncommutative geometry is carried out in the ``matrix derivative" approach. BRST/anti-BRST transformation rules are obtained by applying the horizontality condition, in the superconnection formalism. A BRST/anti-BRST invariant quantum action is then constructed, using an adaptation of the method devised by Baulieu and Thierry-Mieg for the Yang-Mills case. The resulting quantum action turns out to be the same as that of a gauge theory in the 't Hooft gauge with spontaneously broken symmetry. Our result shows that only the even part of the supergroup acts as a gauge symmetry, while the odd part effectively provides a global symmetry. We treat the general formalism first, then work out the $SU(2/1)$ and $SU(2/2)$ cases explicitly.
