Title: Positronium States in QED3
Authors: T. W. Allen and C. J. Burden
Abstract: The $e^-$-$e^+$ bound state spectrum of QED3 is investigated in the quenched ladder approximation to the homogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation with fermion propagators from a rainbow approximation Schwinger-Dyson equation. A detailed analysis of the analytic structure of the fermion propagator is performed so as to test the appropriateness of the methods employed. The large fermion mass limit of the Bethe-Salpeter equation is also considered, including a derivation of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, and comparisons made with existing non-relativistic calculations.
