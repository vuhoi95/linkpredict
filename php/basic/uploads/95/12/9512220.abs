Title: Gauge invariant formulation of $N=2$ Toda and KdV systems in extended  superspace
Authors: F. Delduc and M. Magro
Abstract: We give a gauge invariant formulation of $N=2$ supersymmetric abelian Toda field equations in \n2 superspace. Superconformal invariance is studied. The conserved currents are shown to be associated with Drinfeld-Sokolov type gauges. The extension to non-abelian \n2 Toda equations is discussed. Very similar methods are then applied to a matrix formulation in \n2 superspace of one of the \n2 KdV hierarchies.
