Title: On the Problem of Chaos Conservation in Quantum Physics
Authors: V. P. Maslov and O. Yu. Shvedov
Abstract: We develop a new method of constructing a large N asymptotic series in powers of $N^{-1/2}$ for the function of N arguments which is a solution to the Cauchy problem for the equation of a special type. Many-particle Wigner, Schr\"{o}dinger and Liouville equations for a system of a large number of particles are of this type, when the external potential is of order O(1), while the coefficient of the particle interaction potential is 1/N; the potentials can be arbitrary smooth bounded functions. We apply this method to equations for N-particle states corresponding to the N-th tensor power of an abstract Hamiltonian algebra of observables. In particular, we show for the case of multiparticle Schr\"{o}dinger-like equations that the property of N-particle wave function to be approximately equal at large N to the product of one-particle wave functions does not conserve under time evolution, while the same property for the correlation functions of the finite order is known to conserve(such hypothesis being the quantum analog of the chaos conservation hypothesis put forward by M.Kac in 1956 was proved by the analysis of the BBGKY-like hierarchy of equations). In order to find a leading asymptotics for the N-particle wave function, one should use not only the solution to the well- known Hartree equation being derivable from the BBGKY approach but also the solution to another (Riccati-type) equation presented in this paper. We also consider another interesting case when one adds to the N-particle system under consideration one more particle interacting with the system with the coefficient of the interaction potential of order O(1).It happens that in this case one should investigate not a single Hartree-like equation but a set of such equations, and the chaos will not conserve even for the correlators.
