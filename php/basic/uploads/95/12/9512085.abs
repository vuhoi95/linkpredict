Title: Integrable Four-Fermi Models with a Boundary and Boson-Fermion Duality
Authors: Takeo Inami and Hitoshi Konno and Yao-Zhong Zhang
Abstract: Construction of integrable field theories in space with a boundary is extended to fermionic models. We obtain general forms of boundary interactions consistent with integrability of the massive Thirring model and study the duality equivalence of the MT model and the sine-Gordon model with boundary terms. We find a variety of integrable boundary interactions in the $O(3)$ Gross-Neveu model from the boundary supersymmetric sine-Gordon theory by using boson-fermion duality.
