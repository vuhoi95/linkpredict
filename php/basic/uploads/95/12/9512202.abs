Title: Dynamical Symmetry Breaking in Einstein Universe
Authors: K. Ishikawa and T. Inagaki and T. Muta
Abstract: We investigate four-fermion interactions with $N$-component fermion in Einstein universe for arbitrary space-time dimensions ($2 \leq D<4$). It is found that the effective potential for composite operator $\overline{\psi}\psi$ is calculable in the leading order of the $1/N$ expansion. The resulting effective potential is analyzed by varying the curvature of the space-time and is found to exhibit the symmetry restoration through the second-order phase transition. The critical curvature at which the dynamical fermion mass disappears is analytically calculated.
