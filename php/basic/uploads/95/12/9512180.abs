Title: Spontaneous Breaking of N=2 to N=1 in Rigid and Local Supersymmetric  Theories
Authors: S. Ferrara and L. Girardello and M. Porrati
Abstract: We analyze the relation between rigid and local supersymmetric N=2 field theories, when half of the supersymmetries are spontaneously broken. In particular, we show that the recently found partial supersymmety breaking induced by electric and magnetic Fayet-Iliopoulos terms in rigid theories can be obtained by a suitable flat limit of previously constructed N=2 supergravity models with partial super-Higgs in the observable sector.
