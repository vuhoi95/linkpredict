Title: The Master Field for the Half-Planar Approximation for Large $N$ Matrix  Models and Boltzmann Field Theory
Authors: I. Ya. Arefeva and A. P. Zubarev
Abstract: In this talk results of study in various dimensions of the Boltzmann master field for a subclass of planar diagrams, so called half-planar diagrams, found in the recent work by Accardi, Volovich and one of us (I.A.) are presented.
