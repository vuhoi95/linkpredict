Abstract: The charge screening, confinement of fermion quantum numbers and the chiral condensate formation in two-dimensional QED is studied in details. It is shown that charge screening and confinement of fermion number in two-dimensional QED is due to an appearance of gauge fields which nullify the Dirac determinant. An appearance of the fields of another type but with the same property yield the chiral condensate formation. In addition, these second type fields ensure the "softness" of the charge screening in a process which is analogous to the $e^+e^-$ annihilation.
