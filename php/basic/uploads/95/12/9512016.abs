Title: Sugawara Construction and Casimir Operators for Krichever-Novikov  Algebras
Authors: Martin Schlichenmaier and Oleg K. Sheinman
Abstract: We show how to obtain from highest weight representations of Krichever-Novikov algebras of affine type (also called higher genus affine Kac-Moody algebras) representations of centrally extended Krichever-Novikov vector field algebras via the Sugawara construction. This generalizes classical results where one obtains representations of the Virasoro algebra. Relations between the weights of the corresponding representations are given and Casimir operators are constructed. In an appendix the Sugawara construction for the multi-point situation is done.
