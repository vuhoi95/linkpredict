Title: Solitonic Black Holes in Gauged N=2 Supergravity
Authors: Alan Kostelecky and Malcolm Perry
Abstract: A sequence of zero-temperature black-hole spacetimes with angular momentum and electric and magnetic charges is shown to exist in gauged $N=2$ supergravity. Stability of a subset of these spacetimes is demonstrated by saturation of the Bogomol'nyi bound arising from the supersymmetry algebra. The mass of the resulting solitonic black holes is given in terms of the cosmological constant and the angular momentum. We conjecture that at the quantum level these solitons are dyons with angular momentum determined by the electric and magnetic charges.
