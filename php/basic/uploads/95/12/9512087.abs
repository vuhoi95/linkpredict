Title: Time correlations in 1D quantum impurity problems
Authors: F. Lesage and H. Saleur and S. Skorik
Abstract: We develop in this letter an analytical approach using form- factors to compute time dependent correlations in integrable quantum impurity problems. As an example, we obtain for the first time the frequency dependent conductivity $G(\omega)$ for the tunneling between the edges in the $\nu=1/3$ fractional quantum Hall effect, and the spectrum $S(w)$ of the spin-spin correlation in the anisotropic Kondo model and equivalently in the double well system of dissipative quantum mechanics, both at vanishing temperature.
