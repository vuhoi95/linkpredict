Title: Aspect ratio analysis for ground states of bosons in anisotropic traps
Authors: Kirill Ilinski and Alexander Moroz
Abstract: Characteristics of the initial condensate in the recent experiment on Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of ${}^{87}$Rb atoms in an anisotropic magnetic trap is discussed. Given the aspect ratio $R$, the quality of BEC is estimated. A simple analytical Ansatz for the initial condensate wave function is proposed as a function of the aspect ratio which, in contrast to the Baym-Pethick trial wave function, reproduces both the weak and the strong intaraction limits and which is in better agreement with numerical results than the latter.
