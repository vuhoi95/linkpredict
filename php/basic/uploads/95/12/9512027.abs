Title: Kostka Polynomials and Energy Functions in Solvable Lattice Models
Authors: Atsushi Nakayashiki and Yasuhiko Yamada
Abstract: The relation between the charge of Lascoux-Schuzenberger and the energy function in solvable lattice models is clarified. As an application, A.N.Kirillov's conjecture on the expression of the branching coefficient of ${\widehat {sl_n}}/{sl_n}$ as a limit of Kostka polynomials is proved.
