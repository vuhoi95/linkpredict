Title: Scalar and Spinor Two-Point Functions in Einstein Universe
Authors: T. Inagaki and K. Ishikawa and T. Muta
Abstract: Two-point functions for scalar and spinor fields are investigated in Einstein universe ($R \otimes S^{\sN-1}$). Equations for massive scalar and spinor two-point functions are solved and the explicit expressions for the two-point functions are given. The simpler expressions for massless cases are obtained both for the scalar and spinor cases.
