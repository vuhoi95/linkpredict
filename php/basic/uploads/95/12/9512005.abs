Authors: M. Alishahiha and F. Ardalan and F. Mansouri
Abstract: We present the hyper-elliptic curve describing the moduli space of the N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with the $G_2$ gauge group. The exact monodromies and the dyon spectrum of the theory are determined. It is verified that the recently proposed solitonic equation is also satisfied by our solution.
