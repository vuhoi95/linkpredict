Title: $N=2$ chiral WZNW model in superspace
Authors: F. Delduc and M. Magro
Abstract: We study the Poisson bracket algebra of the $N=2$ supersymmetric chiral WZNW model in superspace. It involves two classical r-matrices, one of which comes from the geometrical constraints implied by $N=2$ supersymmetry. The phase space itself consists of superfields satisfying constraints involving this r-matrix. An attempt is made to relax these constraints. The symmetries of the model are investigated.
