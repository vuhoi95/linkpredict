Title: Low-Energy Scattering of Black Holes and p-branes in String Theory
Authors: R. R. Khuri and R. C. Myers
Abstract: We discuss the low-energy dynamics of generalized extremal higher membrane black hole solutions of string theory and higher membrane theories following Manton's prescription for multi-soliton solutions. A flat metric is found for those solutions which possess $\kappa$-symmetry on the worldvolume.
