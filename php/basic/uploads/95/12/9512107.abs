Title: Universality and Clustering in 1+1 Dimensional Superstring-Bit Models
Authors: Oren Bergman and Charles B. Thorn
Abstract: We construct a 1+1 dimensional superstring-bit model for D=3 Type IIB superstring. This low dimension model escapes the problems encountered in higher dimension models: (1) It possesses full Galilean supersymmetry; (2) For noninteracting polymers of bits, the exactly soluble linear superpotential describing bit interactions is in a large universality class of superpotentials which includes ones bounded at spatial infinity; (3) The latter are used to construct a superstring-bit model with the clustering properties needed to define an $S$-matrix for closed polymers of superstring-bits.
