Title: Integrable Models of the CFT on Hyper-Elliptic Surfaces
Authors: S. A. Apikyan and C. J. Efthimiou
Abstract: In this letter, we continue the work we started at a previous paper and we propose new series of integrable models in quantum field theory. These models are obtained as perturbed models of the minimal conformal field theories on the hyper-elliptic surfaces by particular relevant operators of the untwisted sector. The quantum group symmetry of the models is also discussed.
