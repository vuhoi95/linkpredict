Title: Local BRS Transformations and Osp(3,1|2) Symmetry of Yang-Mills Theories
Authors: Satish D. Joglekar and Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: We consider a certain local generalization of BRS transformations of Yang-Mills theory in which the anti-commuting parameter is space time dependent. While these are not exact symmetries, they do lead to a new nontrivial WT identity. We make a precise connection between the ``local BRS "and the broken orthosymplectic symmetry recently found in superspace formulation of Yang-Mills theory by showing that the local BRS WT identity is precisely the WT identity obtained in the superspace formulation via a superrotation. This ``local BRS " WT identity could lead to new consequences not contained in the usual BRS WT identity.
