Title: Nonabelian Topological Mass Generation in 4 Dimensions
Authors: Dae Sung Hwang and Chang-Yeong Lee
Abstract: We study the topological mass generation in the 4 dimensional nonabelian gauge theory, which is the extension of the Allen $et$ $al.$'s work in the abelian theory. It is crucial to introduce a one form auxiliary field in constructing the gauge invariant nonabelian action which contains both the one form vector gauge field $A$ and the two form antisymmetric tensor field $B$. As in the abelian case, the topological coupling $m B\wedge F$, where $F$ is the field strength of $A$, makes the transmutation among $A$ and $B$ possible, and consequently we see that the gauge field becomes massive. We find the BRST/anti-BRST transformation rule using the horizontality condition, and construct a BRST/anti-BRST invariant quantum action.
