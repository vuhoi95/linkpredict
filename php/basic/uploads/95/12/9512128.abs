Title: Instantons in Burgers Equation
Authors: V. Gurarie and A. Migdal
Abstract: The instanton solution for the forced Burgers equation is found. This solution describes the exponential tail of the probability distribution function of velocity differences in the region where shock waves are absent. The results agree with the one found recently by Polyakov, who used the operator product conjecture. If this conjecture is true, then our WKB asymptotics of the Wyld functional integral is exact to all orders of the perturbative expansion around the instanton solution. We explicitly checked this in the first order. We also generalized our solution for the arbitrary dimension of Burgers (=KPZ) equation. As a result we found the angular dependence of the velocity difference PDF.
