Title: Orbifolds of M-theory
Authors: Keshav Dasgupta and Sunil Mukhi
Abstract: We study Z2-orbifolds of 11-dimensional M-theory on tori of various dimensions. The most interesting model (besides the known S1/Z2 case) corresponds to T5/Z2, for which we argue that the resulting six-dimensional theory is equivalent to the type IIB string compactified on K3. Gravitational anomaly cancellation plays a crucial role in determining what states appear in the twisted sector. Most of the other models appear to break spacetime supersymmetry. We observe that M-theory tends to produce chiral compactifications on orbifolds, and that our results may provide an insight into the mechanism by which twisted-sector states arise in this hypothetical theory.
