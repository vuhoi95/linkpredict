Title: Bubbles with an O(3) Symmetric Scalar Field in Curved Spacetime
Authors: Nobuyuki Sakai and Yoonbai Kim and Kei-ichi Maeda
Abstract: We study the first-order phase transition in a model of scalar field with $O(3)$ symmetry coupled to gravity, and, in high temperature limit, discuss the existence of new bubble solution with a global monopole at the center of the bubble.
