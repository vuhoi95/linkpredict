Title: BFV-BRST Quantization of the Proca Model based on the Batalin-Tyutin  formalism
Authors: Sean J. Yoon and Yong-Wan Kim and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: We apply the Batalin-Tyutin Hamiltonian method to the Abelian Proca model in order to convert a second class constraint system into a first class one systematically by introducing the new fields. Then, according to the BFV formalism we obtain that the desired resulting Lagrangian preserving standard BRST symmetry naturally includes the well-known St\"ukelberg scalar related to the explicit gauge-breaking effect due to the presence of the mass term. Furthermore, we also discuss the nonlocal symmetry structure of this model in the context of the nonstandard BRST symmetry.
