Title: Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation and one-particle relativistic approach
Authors: A. Della Selva and J. Magnin and L. Masperi
Abstract: A reexamination of the semiclassical approach of the relativistic electron indicates a possible variation of its helicity for electric and magnetic static fields applied along its global motion due to zitterbewegung effects, proportional to the anomalous part of the magnetic moment.
