Title: BPS States, String Duality, and Nodal Curves on K3
Authors: Shing-Tung Yau and Eric Zaslow
Abstract: We describe the counting of BPS states of Type II strings on K3 by relating the supersymmetric cycles of genus $g$ to the number of rational curves with $g$ double points on K3. The generating function for the number of such curves is the left-moving partition function of the bosonic string.
