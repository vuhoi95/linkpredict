Title: The Physical Propagator of a Slowly Moving Charge
Authors: Emili Bagan and Martin Lavelle and David McMullan
Abstract: We consider an electron which is electromagnetically dressed in such a way that it is both gauge invariant and that it has the associated electric and magnetic fields expected of a moving charge. We study the propagator of this dressed electron and, for small velocities, show explicitly at one loop that at the natural (on-shell) renormalisation point, $p_0=m$, ${\bold p}= m{\bold v}$, one can renormalise the propagator multiplicatively. Furthermore the renormalisation constants are infra-red finite. This shows that the dressing we use corresponds to a slowly moving, physical asymptotic field.
