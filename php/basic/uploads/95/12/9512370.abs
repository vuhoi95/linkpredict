Title: Jets and Quantum Field Theory
Authors: N. A. Sveshnikov and F. V. Tkachov
Abstract: We discuss quantum-field-theoretic interpretation of the family of observables (the so-called C-algebra) introduced in [ F.V.Tkachov: Preprint FERMILAB-PUB-95/191-T] for a systematic description of multijet structure of multiparticle final states at high energies. We argue that from the point of view of general quantum field theory, all information about the multijet structure is contained in the values of a family of multiparticle quantum correlators that can be expressed in terms of the energy-momentum tensor.
