Title: The Yangian Symmetry of the Hubbard Models with Variable Range Hopping
Authors: Frank GÃ¶hmann and Vladimir Inozemtsev
Abstract: We present two pairs of Y($sl_2$) Yangian symmetries for the trigonometric and hyperbolic versions of the Hubbard model with non-nearest-neighbour hopping. In both cases the Yangians are mutually commuting, hence can be combined into a Y($sl_2$)$\oplus$Y($sl_2$) Yangian. Their mutual commutativity is of dynamical origin. The known Yangians of the Haldane-Shastry spin chain and the nearest neighbour Hubbard model are contained as limiting cases of our new representations.
