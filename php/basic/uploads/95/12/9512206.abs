Title: String Field Theory in Rindler Space-Time and String Thermalization
Authors: Hiroyuki Hata and Hajime Oda and Shigeaki Yahikozawa
Abstract: Quantization of free string field theory in the Rindler space-time is studied by using the covariant formulation and taking the center-of-mass value of the Rindler string time-coordinate $\eta(\sigma)$ as the time variable for quantization. We construct the string Rindler modes which vanish in either of the Rindler wedges $\pm$ defined by the Minkowski center-of-mass coordinate of the string. We then evaluate the Bogoliubov coefficients between the Rindler string creation/annihilation operators and the Minkowski ones, and analyze the string thermalization. An approach to the construction of the string Rindler modes corresponding to different definitions of the wedges is also presented toward a thorough understanding of the structure of the Hilbert space of the string field theory on the Rindler space-time.
