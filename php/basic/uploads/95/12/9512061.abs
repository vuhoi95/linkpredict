Title: Rusty Scatter Branes
Authors: R. R. Khuri and R. C. Myers
Abstract: We derive double dimensional reduction/oxidation in a framework where it is applicable to describe general non-static (and anisotropic) $p$-brane solutions. Given this procedure, we are able to relate the dynamical interaction potential for parallel extremal $p$-branes in $D$ dimensions to that for extremal black holes in $D-p$ dimensions. In particular, we find that to leading order the potential vanishes for all $\kappa$-symmetric $p$-branes.
