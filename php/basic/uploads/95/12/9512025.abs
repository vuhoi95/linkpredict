Title: Poisson-Lie T-Duality: the Path-Integral Derivation
Authors: Eugene Tyurin and Rikard von Unge
Abstract: We formulate Poisson-Lie T-duality in a path-integral manner that allows us to analyze the quantum corrections. Using the path-integral, we rederive the most general form of a Poisson-Lie dualizeable background and the generalized Buscher transformation rules it has to satisfy.
