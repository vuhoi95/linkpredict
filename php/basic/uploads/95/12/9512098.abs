Title: Supersymmetric Wilson Loops, Superstring-Like Observables, and the  Natural Coupling of Superstrings to Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
Authors: M. Awada and F. Mansouri
Abstract: We obtain an explicit expression for the supersymmetric Wilson loop in terms of chiral superfields and supercurrents in superspace. The result turns out to be different from what one would expect from the simple replacement of Lie algebra valued connection in the exponent with the corresponding super-Lie algebraic one. Genralizing the super particle coupling represented by the supersymmetric Wilson loop, we show that there exists a unique dimensionless coupling of the superstring to abelian supersymmetric gauge theories that respects all the known symmetries. The coupling is expressed in terms of chiral currents in superspace. The natural superstring coupling gives rise to a new observable that is "stringy" in nature and has no analogue in non-supersymmetric gauge theories.
