Title: Canonical Gauges in the Path Integral for Parametrized Systems
Authors: Rafael Ferraro and Claudio Simeone
Abstract: It is well known that --differing from ordinary gauge systems-- canonical gauges are not admissible in the path integral for parametrized systems. This is the case for the relativistic particle and gravitation. However, a time dependent canonical transformation can turn a parametrized system into an ordinary gauge system. It is shown how to build a canonical transformation such that the fixation of the new coordinates is equivalent to the fixation of the original ones; this aim can be achieved only if the Hamiltonian constraint allows for an intrinsic global time. Thus the resulting action, describing an ordinary gauge system and allowing for canonical gauges, can be used in the path integral for the quantum propagator associated with the original variables.
