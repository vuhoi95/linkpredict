Authors: Dennis Bonatsos and C. Daskaloyannis and P. Kolokotronis and D. Lenis
Abstract: Quantum algebras are a mathematical tool which provides us with a class of symmetries wider than that of Lie algebras, which are contained in the former as a special case. After a self-contained introduction to the necessary mathematical tools ($q$-numbers, $q$-analysis, $q$-oscillators, $q$-algebras), the su$_q$(2) rotator model and its extensions, the construction of deformed exactly soluble models (Interacting Boson Model, Moszkowski model), the use of deformed bosons in the description of pairing correlations, and the symmetries of the anisotropic quantum harmonic oscillator with rational ratios of frequencies, which underly the structure of superdeformed and hyperdeformed nuclei, are discussed in some detail. A brief description of similar applications to molecular structure and an outlook are also given.
