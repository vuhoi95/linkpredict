Title: On Black Hole Creation in Planckian Energy Scattering
Authors: I. Ya. Arefeva and K. S. Viswanathan and I. V. Volovich
Abstract: In a series of papers Amati, Ciafaloni and Veneziano and 't Hooft conjectured that black holes occur in the collision of two light particles at planckian energies. In this talk based on \cite {AVV} we discuss a possible scenario for such a process by using the Chandrasekhar-Ferrari-Xanthopoulos duality between the Kerr black hole solution and colliding plane gravitational waves.
