Title: From String Backgrounds to Topological Field Theories
Authors: Bong H. Lian and Gregg J. Zuckerman
Abstract: The BRST formalism has played a fundamental role in the construction of bosonic closed string backgrounds, ie. the stringy analogs of classical solutions to the field equations of general relativity. The concept of a string background has been extended to the notion of $W$-strings, where the BRST symmetry is still largely conjectural. More recently, the BRST formalism has entered the construction of two dimensional topological conformal quantum field theories, such as those that arise from Calabi-Yau varieties. In this lecture, we focus on common features of the BRST cohomology algebras of string backgrounds and topological field theories. In this context, we present some new evidence for a remarkable relationship that transports us from bosonic and $W$-string backgrounds to the B-model topological conformal field theories associated to certain noncompact Calabi-Yau varieties. This paper will appear in the proceedings of the {\it Symposium on BRS Symmetry} held at RIMS, September 18-22, 1995.
