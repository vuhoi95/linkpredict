Title: Hamilton-Jacobi formulation for singular systems with second order  Lagrangians
Authors: B. M. Pimentel and R. G. Teixeira
Abstract: Recently the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation for first order constrained systems has been developed. In such formalism the equations of motion are written as total differential equations in many variables. We generalize the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation for singular systems with second order Lagrangians and apply this new formulation to Podolsky electrodynamics, comparing with the results obtained through Dirac's method.
