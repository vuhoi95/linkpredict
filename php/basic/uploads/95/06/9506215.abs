Title: Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz and Dilogarithm Identities I
Authors: Edward Frenkel and Andras Szenes
Abstract: We consider the (A_n,A_1) Y-system arising in the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz. We prove the periodicity of solutions of this Y-system conjectured by Al.B. Zamolodchikov, and the dilogarithm identities conjectured by F. Gliozzi and R. Tateo.
