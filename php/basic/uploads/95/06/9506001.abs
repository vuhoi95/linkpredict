Title: SUPERTRACES IN STRING THEORY
Authors: Keith R. Dienes and Moshe Moshe and Robert C. Myers
Abstract: We demonstrate that the spectrum of any consistent string theory in $D$ dimensions must satisfy a number of supertrace constraints: $ Str~M^{2n}=0 $ for $0 \leq n < D/2-1$, integer $n$. These results hold for a large class of string theories, including critical heterotic strings. For strings lacking spacetime supersymmetry, these supertrace constraints will be satisfied as a consequence of a hidden ``misaligned supersymmetry'' in the string spectrum.
