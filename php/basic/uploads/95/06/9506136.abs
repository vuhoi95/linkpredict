Title: Structure Constants and Conformal Bootstrap in Liouville Field Theory
Authors: A. B. Zamolodchikov and Al. B. Zamolodchikov
Abstract: An analytic expression is proposed for the three-point function of the exponential fields in the Liouville field theory on a sphere. In the classical limit it coincides with what the classical Liouville theory predicts. Using this function as the structure constant of the operator algebra we construct the four-point function of the exponential fields and verify numerically that it satisfies the conformal bootstrap equations, i.e., that the operator algebra thus defined is associative. We consider also the Liouville reflection amplitude which follows explicitly from the structure constants.
