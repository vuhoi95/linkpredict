Title: Quantum Jacobi-Trudi and Giambelli Formulae for $U_q(B_r^{(1)})$ from  Analytic Bethe Ansatz
Authors: Atsuo Kuniba and Yasuhiro Ohta and Junji Suzuki
Abstract: Analytic Bethe ansatz is executed for a wide class of finite dimensional $U_q(B^{(1)}_r)$ modules. They are labeled by skew-Young diagrams which, in general, contain a fragment corresponding to the spin representation. For the transfer matrix spectra of the relevant vertex models, we establish a number of formulae, which are $U_q(B^{(1)}_r)$ analogues of the classical ones due to Jacobi-Trudi and Giambelli on Schur functions. They yield a full solution to the previously proposed functional relation ($T$-system), which is a Toda equation
