Title: Quantum Fields a la Sylvester and Witt
Authors: H. Saller and R. Breuninger and M. Haft
Abstract: A structural explanation of the coupling constants in the standard model, i.e the fine structure constant and the Weinberg angle, and of the gauge fixing contributions is given in terms of symmetries and representation theory. The coupling constants are normalizations of Lorentz invariantly embedded little groups (spin and polarization) arising in a harmonic analysis of quantum vector fields. It is shown that the harmonic analysis of massless fields requires an extension of the familiar Fourier decomposition, containing also indefinite unitary nondecomposable time representations. This is illustrated by the nonprobabilistic contributions in the electromagnetic field.
