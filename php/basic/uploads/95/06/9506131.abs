Title: Anti-gravitating BPS monopoles and dyons
Authors: G. W. Gibbons and P. K. Townsend
Abstract: We show that the exact static, i.e. `anti-gravitating', magnetic multi monopole solutions of the Einstein/Maxwell/dilaton-YM/Higgs equations found by Kastor, London, Traschen, and the authors, for arbitrary non-zero dilaton coupling constant $a$, are equivalent to the string theory BPS magnetic monopole solutions of Harvey and Liu when $a=\sqrt{3}$. For this value of $a$, the monopole solutions also solve the equations of five-dimensional supergravity/YM theory. We also discuss some features of the dyon solutions obtained by boosting in the fifth dimension and some features of the moduli space of anti-gravitating multi-monopoles.
