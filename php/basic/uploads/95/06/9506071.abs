Title: Theory of arbitrarily polarized quantum Hall states
Authors: Sudhansu S. Mandal and V. Ravishankar
Abstract: We propose a global model which accounts for all the observed quantum Hall states in terms of an abelian doublet of Chern-Simons gauge fields, with the strength of the Chern-Simons term given by a coupling matrix. The model is employed within the composite fermion picture.
