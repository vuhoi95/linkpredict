Title: Interaction Hierarchy. Gonihedric String and Quantum Gravity
Authors: G. K. Savvidy and K. G. Savvidy
Abstract: We have found that the Regge gravity \cite{regge,sorkin}, can be represented as a $superposition$ of less complicated theory of random surfaces with $Euler~character$ as an action. This extends to Regge gravity our previous result \cite{savvidy}, which allows to represent the gonihedric string \cite{savvidy1} as a superposition of less complicated theory of random paths with $curvature$ action. We propose also an alternative linear action $A(M_{4})$ for the four and high dimensional quantum gravity. From these representations it follows that the corresponding partition functions are equal to the product of Feynman path integrals evaluated on time slices with curvature and length action for the gonihedric string and with Euler character and gonihedric action for the Regge gravity. In both cases the interaction is proportional to the overlapping sizes of the paths or surfaces on the neighboring time slices. On the lattice we constructed spin system with local interaction, which have the same partition function as the quantum gravity. The scaling limit is discussed.
