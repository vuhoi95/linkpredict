Title: Fuzzy Mass Relations for the Higgs
Authors: Bruno IOCHUM and Daniel KASTLER and Thomas SCHÃœCKER
Abstract: The non-commutative approach of the standard model produces a relation between the top and the Higgs masses. We show that, for a given top mass, the Higgs mass is constrained to lie in an interval. The length of this interval is of the order of $m_\tau^2/m_t$.
