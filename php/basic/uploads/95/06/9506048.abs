Title: Moduli Space of CHL Strings
Authors: S. Chaudhuri and J. Polchinski
Abstract: We discuss an orbifold of the toroidally compactified heterotic string which gives a global reduction of the dimension of the moduli space while preserving the supersymmetry. This construction yields the moduli space of the first of a series of reduced rank theories with maximal supersymmetry discovered recently by Chaudhuri, Hockney, and Lykken. Such moduli spaces contain non-simply-laced enhanced symmetry points in any spacetime dimension D<10. Precisely in D=4 the set of allowed gauge groups is invariant under electric-magnetic duality, providing further evidence for S-duality of the D=4 heterotic string.
