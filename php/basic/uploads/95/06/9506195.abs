Title: Spin Chain Hamiltonians with Affine $U_q g$ symmetry
Authors: T. Hakobyan and A. Sedrakyan
Abstract: We construct the family of spin chain Hamiltonians, which have affine $U_q g$ guantum group symmetry. Their eigenvalues coincides with the eigenvalues of the usual spin chain Hamiltonians which have non-affine $U_q g_0$ quantum group symmetry, but have the degeneracy of levels, corresponding to affine $U_q g$. The space of states of these chaines are formed by the tensor product of the fully reducible representations.
