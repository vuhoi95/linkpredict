Title: 1+1 dimensional QCD with fundamental bosons and fermions
Authors: Kenichiro Aoki and Tomoyasu Ichihara
Abstract: We analyze the properties of mesons in 1+1 dimensional QCD with bosonic and fermionic ``quarks'' in the large $\nc$ limit. We study the spectrum in detail and show that it is impossible to obtain massless mesons including boson constituents in this model. We quantitatively show how the QCD mass inequality is realized in two dimensional QCD. We find that the mass inequality is close to being an equality even when the quarks are light. Methods for obtaining the properties of ``mesons'' formed from boson and/or fermion constituents are formulated in an explicit manner convenient for further study. We also analyze how the physical properties of the mesons such as confinement and asymptotic freedom are realized.
