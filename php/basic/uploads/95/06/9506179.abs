Title: Quaternion Higgs and the Electroweak Gauge Group
Authors: Stefano De Leo and Pietro Rotelli
Abstract: We show that, in quaternion quantum mechanics with a complex geometry, the minimal four Higgs of the unbroken electroweak theory naturally determine the quaternion invariance group which corresponds to the Glashow group. Consequently, we are able to identify the physical significance of the anomalous Higgs scalar solutions. We introduce and discuss the complex projection of the Lagrangian density.
