Title: Excitation Spectra of Spin Models constructed from Quantized Affine  Algebras of type $B_n^{(1)}$, $D_n^{(1)}$
Authors: Brian Davies and Masato Okado
Abstract: The energy and momentum spectrum of the spin models constructed from the vector representation of the quantized affine algebras of type $\B$ and $\D$ are computed using the approach of Davies et al. \cite{DFJMN92}. The results are for the anti-ferromagnetic (massive) regime, and they agree with the mass spectrum found from the factorized S--matrix theory by Ogievetsky et al. \cite{ORW87}. The other new result is the explicit realization of the fusion construction for the quantized affine algebras of type $\B$ and $\D$.}
