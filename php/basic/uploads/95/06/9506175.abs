Title: Spins and Charges, the Algebra and Subalgebras of the Group SO(1,14) and  Grassmann Space
Authors: Norma Mankoč Borštnik and Svjetlana Fajfer
Abstract: In a space of $d=15 $ Grassmann coordinates, two types of generators of the Lorentz transformations, one of spinorial and the other of vectorial character, both linear operators in Grassmann space, forming the group $ SO(1,14) $ which contains as subgroups $ SO(1,4) $ and $ SO(10) $ ${\supset SU(3)} { \times SU(2)} { \times U(1)} $, define the fundamental and the adjoint representations of the group, respectively. The eigenvalues of the commuting operators can be identified with spins of fermionic and bosonic fields $ (SO(1,4)) $, as well as with their Yang-Mills charges $ (SU(3)$, $ SU(2)$, $ U(1)) $, offering the unification of not only all Yang - Mills charges but of all the internal degrees of freedom of fermionic and bosonic fields - Yang - Mills charges and spins - and accordingly of all interactions - gauge fields and gravity. The theory suggests that elementary particles are either in the "spinorial" representations with respect to spins and all charges, or they are in the "vectorial" representations with respect to spins and all charges, which indeed is the case with the quarks, the leptons and the gauge bosons. The algebras of the two kinds of generators of Lorentz transformations in Grassmann space were studied and the representations are commented on.
