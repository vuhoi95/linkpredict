Title: A local and integrable lattice regularization of the massive Thirring  model
Authors: C. Destri and T. Segalini
Abstract: The light--cone lattice approach to the massive Thirring model is reformulated using a local and integrable lattice Hamiltonian written in terms of discrete fermi fields. Several subtle points concerning boundary conditions, normal--ordering, continuum limit, finite renormalizations and decoupling of fermion doublers are elucidated. The relations connecting the six--vertex anisotropy and the various coupling constants of the continuum are analyzed in detail.
