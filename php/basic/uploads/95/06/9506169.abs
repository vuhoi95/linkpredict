Title: Exact S-matrices for d_{n+1}^{(2)} affine Toda solitons and their bound  states
Authors: G. M. Gandenberger and N. J. MacKay
Abstract: We conjecture an exact S-matrix for the scattering of solitons in $d_{n+1}^{(2)}$ affine Toda field theory in terms of the R-matrix of the quantum group $U_q(c_n^{(1)})$. From this we construct the scattering amplitudes for all scalar bound states (breathers) of the theory. This S-matrix conjecture is justified by detailed examination of its pole structure. We show that a breather-particle identification holds by comparing the S-matrix elements for the lowest breathers with the S-matrix for the quantum particles in real affine Toda field theory, and discuss the implications for various forms of duality.
