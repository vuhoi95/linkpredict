Title: Quantum Mechanics with Event Dynamics
Authors: Ph. Blanchard and A. Jadczyk
Abstract: Event generating algorithm corresponding to a linear master equation of Lindblad's type is described and illustrated on two examples: that of a particle detector and of a fuzzy clock. Relation to other approaches to foundations of quantum theory and to description of quantum measurements is briefly discussed.
