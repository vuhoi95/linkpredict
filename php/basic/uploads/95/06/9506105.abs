Title: Exact Solvability of the Calogero and Sutherland Models
Authors: Werner Ruhl and Alexander Turbiner
Abstract: Translationally invariant symmetric polynomials as coordinates for $N$-body problems with identical particles are proposed. It is shown that in those coordinates the Calogero and Sutherland $N$-body Hamiltonians, after appropriate gauge transformations, can be presented as a {\it quadratic} polynomial in the generators of the algebra $sl_N$ in finite-dimensional degenerate representation. The exact solvability of these models follows from the existence of the infinite flag of such representation spaces, preserved by the above Hamiltonians. A connection with Jack polynomials is discussed.
