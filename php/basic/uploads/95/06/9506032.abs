Title: Haldane's Fractional Statistics and the Lowest Landau Level on a Torus
Authors: Ansar Fayyazuddin and Dingping Li
Abstract: The Lowest Landau Level on a torus is studied. The dimension of the many-body Hilbert space is obtained and is found to be different from the formula given by Haldane. Our result can be tested in numerical investigations of the low-energy spectrum of fractional quantum Hall states on a torus.
