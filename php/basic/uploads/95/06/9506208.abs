Title: Five-Dimensional BF Theory and Four-Dimensional Current Algebra
Authors: S. Emery and H. Jirari and O. Piguet
Abstract: We consider the relation between the five-dimensional BF model and a four-dimensional local current algebra from the point of view of perturbative local quantum field theory. We use an axial gauge fixing procedure and show that it allows for a well defined theory which actually can be solved exactly.
