Title: String Bit Models for Superstring
Authors: Oren Bergman and Charles B. Thorn
Abstract: We extend the model of string as a polymer of string bits to the case of superstring. We mainly concentrate on type II-B superstring, with some discussion of the obstacles presented by not II-B superstring, together with possible strategies for surmounting them. As with previous work on bosonic string we work within the light-cone gauge. The bit model possesses a good deal less symmetry than the continuous string theory. For one thing, the bit model is formulated as a Galilei invariant theory in $(D-2)+1$ dimensional space-time. This means that Poincar\'e invariance is reduced to the Galilei subgroup in $D-2$ space dimensions. Naturally the supersymmetry present in the bit model is likewise dramatically reduced. Continuous string can arise in the bit models with the formation of infinitely long polymers of string bits. Under the right circumstances (at the critical dimension) these polymers can behave as string moving in $D$ dimensional space-time enjoying the full $N=2$ Poincar\'e supersymmetric dynamics of type II-B superstring.
