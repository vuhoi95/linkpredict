Title: On W_3-morphisms and the Geometry of Plane Curves
Authors: E. Ramos and J. Roca
Abstract: We provide a description of W_3 transformations in terms of deformations of convex curves in two dimensional Euclidean space. This geometrical interpretation sheds some light on the nature of finite W_3-morphisms. We also comment on how this construction can be extended to the case of W_n and ``nicely curved'' curves in $\reals^{n-1}$.
