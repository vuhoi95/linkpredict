Title: Supergravity and a Bogomol'nyi Bound in Three Dimensions
Authors: Jose D. Edelstein and Carlos Núñez and Fidel A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We discuss the $2+1$ dimensional Abelian Higgs model coupled to $N=2$ supergravity. We construct the supercharge algebra and, from it, we show that the mass of classical static solutions is bounded from below by the topological charge. As it happens in the global case, half of the supersymmetry is broken when the bound is attained and Bogomol'nyi equations, resulting from the unbroken supersymmetry, hold. These equations, which correspond to gravitating vortices, include a first order self-duality equation whose integrability condition reproduces the Einstein equation.
