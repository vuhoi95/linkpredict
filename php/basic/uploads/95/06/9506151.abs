Title: Nonreductive WZW models and their CFTs
Authors: JM Figueroa-O'Farrill and S Stanciu
Abstract: We study two-dimensional WZW models with target space a nonreductive Lie group. Such models exist whenever the Lie group possesses a bi-invariant metric. We show that such WZW models provide a lagrangian description of the nonreductive (affine) Sugawara construction. We investigate the gauged WZW models and we prove that gauging a diagonal subgroup results in a conformal field theory which can be identified with a coset construction. A large class of exact four-dimensional string backgrounds arise in this fashion. We then study the topological conformal field theory resulting from the $G/G$ coset. We identify the Kazama algebra extending the BRST algebra, and the BV algebra structure in BRST cohomology which it induces.
