Title: The Supersymmetric Two Boson Hierarchy
Authors: J. C. Brunelli and Ashok Das
Abstract: We summarize all the known properties of the supersymmetric integrable Two Boson equation. We present its nonstandard Lax formulation and tri-Hamiltonian structure, its reduction to the supersymmetric nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and the local as well as nonlocal conserved charges. We also present the algebra of the conserved charges and identify its second Hamiltonian structure with the twisted $N=2$ superconformal algebra.
