Title: Einstein and Yang-Mills theories in hyperbolic form without gauge-fixing
Authors: A. Abrahams and A. Anderson and Y. Choquet-Bruhat and J. W. York, Jr
Abstract: The evolution of physical and gauge degrees of freedom in the Einstein and Yang-Mills theories are separated in a gauge-invariant manner. We show that the equations of motion of these theories can always be written in flux-conservative first-order symmetric hyperbolic form. This dynamical form is ideal for global analysis, analytic approximation methods such as gauge-invariant perturbation theory, and numerical solution.
