Abstract: The level-$1$ integrable highest weight modules of $U_q(\widehat{sl}_2)$ admit a level-$0$ action of the same algebra. This action is defined using the affine Hecke algebra and the basis of the level-$1$ module generated by components of vertex operators. Each level-$1$ module is a direct sum of finite-dimensional irreducible level-$0$ modules, whose highest weight vector is expressed in terms of Macdonald polynomials. This decomposition leads to the fermionic character formula for the level-$1$ modules.
