Title: Covariant scalar representation of $iosp(d,2/2)$ quantization of the  scalar relativistic particle
Authors: P D Jarvis and I Tsohantjis
Abstract: A covariant scalar representation of $iosp(d,2/2)$ is constructed and analysed in comparison with existing methods for the quantization of the scalar relativistic particle. It is found that, with appropriately defined wavefunctions, this $iosp(d,2/2)$ produced representation can be identified with the state space arising from the canonical BFV-BRST quantization of the modular invariant, unoriented scalar particle (or antiparticle) with admissible gauge fixing conditions. For this model, the cohomological determination of physical states can thus be obtained purely from the representation theory of the $iosp(d,2/2)$ algebra.
