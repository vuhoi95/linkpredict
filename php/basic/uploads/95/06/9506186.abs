Title: Mapping Class Group Representations and Generalized Verlinde Formula
Authors: P. Bantay and P. Vecsernyes
Abstract: Unitary representations of centrally extended mapping class groups $\tilde M_{g,1}, g\geq 1$ are given in terms of a rational Hopf algebra $H$, and a related generalization of the Verlinde formula is presented. Formulae expressing the traces of mapping class group elements in terms of the fusion rules, quantum dimensions and statistics phases are proposed.
