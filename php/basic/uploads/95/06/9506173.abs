Title: Higher-Derivative Gravitation in Bosonic and Superstring Theories
Authors: Ahmed Hindawi and Burt A. Ovrut and Daniel Waldram
Abstract: A discussion of the number of degrees of freedom, and their dynamical properties, in higher-derivative gravitational theories is presented. The complete non-linear sigma model for these degrees of freedom is exhibited using the method of auxiliary fields. As a by-product we present a consistent non-linear coupling of a spin-2 tensor to gravitation. It is shown that non-vanishing $(C_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta})^{2}$ terms arise in $N=1$, $D=4$ superstring Lagrangians due to one-loop radiative corrections with light field internal lines.
