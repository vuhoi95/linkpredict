Title: Black Hole Radiation (with and) without Weyl Anomaly
Authors: G. Amelino-Camelia and D. Seminara
Abstract: In the semiclassical analysis of black hole radiation in matter-coupled dilaton gravity, a one-parameter ``$k$"-family of measures for the path integral quantization of the matter fields is considered. The Weyl anomaly is proportional to the parameter $k$, but the black hole radiation seen by minkowskian observers at future null infinity is $k$-independent.
