Title: A note on inverse-square exchange models
Authors: Frank GÃ¶hmann and Miki Wadati
Abstract: The su(1$|$1) symmetric version of the Haldane-Shastry spin chain is diagonalized by means of a linear transformation. The same transformation applied to the original su(2) model yields simple expressions for the Hamiltonian and the generators of the Yangian symmetry of the model in terms of spin wave operators.
