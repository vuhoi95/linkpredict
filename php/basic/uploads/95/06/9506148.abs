Title: New Examples of Duality in Chiral and Non-Chiral Supersymmetric Gauge  Theories
Authors: K. Intriligator and R. G. Leigh and M. J. Strassler
Abstract: We present evidence for renormalization group fixed points with dual magnetic descriptions in fourteen new classes of four-dimensional $N=1$ supersymmetric models. Nine of these classes are chiral and many involve two or three gauge groups. These theories are generalizations of models presented earlier by Seiberg, by Kutasov and Schwimmer, and by the present authors. The different classes are interrelated; one can flow from one class to another using confinement or symmetry breaking.
