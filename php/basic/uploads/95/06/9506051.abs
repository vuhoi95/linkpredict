Title: Anomalous Supersymmetry Breaking by Instantons
Authors: A. Casher and V. Elkonin and Y. Shamir
Abstract: We show that instantons violate a supersymmetric identity in a classically supersymmetric Higgs model with no massless fermions. This anomalous breaking arises because the correct perturbative expansion in the instanton sector is not supersymmetric. The attempt to construct a manifestly supersymmetric expansion generates infra-red divergences.
