Title: Integrable Electron Model with Correlated Hopping and Quantum  Supersymmetry
Authors: Mark D. Gould and Katrina E. Hibberd and Jon R. Links and Yao-Zhong Zhang
Abstract: We give the quantum analogue of a recently introduced electron model which generalizes the Hubbard model with additional correlated hopping terms and electron pair hopping. The model contains two independent parameters and is invariant with respect to the quantum superalgebra $U_q(gl(2|1))$. It is integrable in one dimension by means of the quantum inverse scattering method.
