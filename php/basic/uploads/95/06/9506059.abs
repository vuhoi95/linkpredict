Abstract: We quantize the tachyon field in a static two dimensional dilaton gravity black hole background,and we calculate the Hawking radiation rate. We find that the thermal radiation flux, due to the tachyon field, is larger than the conformal matter one. We also find that massive scalar fields which do not couple to the dilaton, do not give any contribution to the thermal radiation, up to terms quadratic in the scalar curvature.
