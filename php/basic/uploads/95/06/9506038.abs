Title: Induced Spin from the $ISO(2,1)$ Gauge Theory with the Gravitational  Chern-Simons Term
Authors: Jin-Ho Cho and Hyuk-jae Lee
Abstract: In the context of $ISO(2,1)$ gauge theory, we consider $(2+1)$-dimensional gravity with the gravitational Chern-Simons term (CST). This formulation allows the `exact' solution for the system coupled to a massive point particle (which is not the case in the conventional Chern-Simons gravity). The solution exhibits locally trivial structure even with the CST, although still shows globally nontrivialness such as the conical space and the helical time structure. Since the solution is exact, we can say the CST induces spin even for noncritical case of $\s+\al m\ne 0$.
