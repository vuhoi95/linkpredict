Title: Superspace Formulation of Yang- Mills Theory II: Inclusion of Gauge  Invariant Operators and Scalars
Authors: Satish D. Joglekar and Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: In a superspace formulation of Yang-Mills theory previously proposed, we show how gauge-invariant operators and scalars can be incorporated keeping intact the (broken) $Osp(3,1|2)$ symmetry of the superspace action. We show in both cases, that the WT identities can be cast in a simple form $\frac{\partial\bar{W}}{\partial\theta}=0$.
