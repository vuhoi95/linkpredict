Title: Non-Abelian, Self-Dual Chern-Simons Vortices Coupled to Gravity
Authors: M. E. X. Guimar√£es and L. A. J. London
Abstract: In this article we consider $SU(2)$ Chern-Simons/Higgs theory coupled to gravity in three-dimensions. It is shown that for a cylindrically symmetric vortex both the Einstein equations and the field equations can be reduced to a set of first-order Bogomol'nyi equations provided that we choose a specific eighth-order potential.
