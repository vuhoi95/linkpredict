Title: S-Duality Constraints On Effective Potentials For Gaugino Condensation
Authors: Pierre Binetruy and Mary K. Gaillard
Abstract: We clarify the role of approximate S-duality in effective supergravity theories that are the low energy limits of string theories, and show how this partial symmetry may be used to constrain effective lagrangians for gaugino condensation.
