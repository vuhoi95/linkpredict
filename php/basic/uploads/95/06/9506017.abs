Title: Events and Piecewise Deterministic Dynamics in Event-Enhanced Quantum  Theory
Authors: Ph. Blanchard and A. Jadczyk
Abstract: We enhance the standard formalism of quantum theory to enable events. The concepts of experiment and of measurement are defined. Dynamics is given by Liouville's equation that couples quantum system to a classical one. It implies a unique Markov process involving quantum jumps, classical events and describing sample histories of individual systems.
