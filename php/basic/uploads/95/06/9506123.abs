Title: Correlations between Quarks, Monopoles and Instantons
Authors: St. Thurner and H. Markum and W. Sakuler
Abstract: We analyze topological objects in pure QCD in the presence of external quarks by calculating the distributions of instanton and monopole densities around static color sources. We find a suppression of the densities close to external sources and the formation of a flux tube between a static quark--antiquark pair. The similarity in the behavior of instantons and monopoles around static sources might be due to a local correlation between these topological objects. On an $8^{3} \times 4$ lattice at $\beta=5.6$, it turns out that topological quantities are correlated approximately two lattice spacings.
