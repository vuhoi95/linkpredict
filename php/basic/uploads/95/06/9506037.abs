Title: Symmetries of Heterotic String Theory
Authors: Anindya K. Biswas and Alok Kumar and Koushik Ray
Abstract: We study the symmetries of the two dimensional Heterotic string theory by following the approach of Kinnersley et al for the study of stationary-axially symmetric Einstein-Maxwell equations. We identify the finite dimensional groups $G'$ and $H'$ for the Einstein-Maxwell equations. We also give the constructions for the infinite number of conserved currents and the affine $\hat{o}(8, 24)$ symmetry algebra in this formulation. The generalized Ehlers and Harrison transformations are identified and a parallel between the infinite dimensional symmetry algebra for the heterotic string case with $\hat{sl}(3, R)$ that arise in the case of Einstein-Maxwell equations is pointed out.
