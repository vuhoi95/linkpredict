Title: Topological Yang-Mills Theory with Two Fermionic Charges. A Superfield  Approach on KÃ¤hler Manifolds
Authors: H. D. Dahmen and S. Marculescu and T. Portmann
Abstract: The four-dimensional topological Yang-Mills theory with two anticommuting charges is naturally formulated on K\"ahler manifolds. By using a superspace approach we clarify the structure of the Faddeev-Popov sector and determine the total action. This enables us to perform perturbation theory around any given instanton configuration by manifestly maintaining all the symmetries of the topological theory. The superspace formulation is very useful for recognizing a trivial observable (i.e. having vanishing correlation functions only) as the highest component of a gauge invariant superfield. As an example of non-trivial observables we construct the complete solution to the simultaneous cohomology problem of both fermionic charges. We also show how this solution has to be used in order to make Donaldson's interpretation possible.
