Title: Electric-Magnetic Duality Rotations in Non-Linear Electrodynamics
Authors: G W Gibbons and D A Rasheed
Abstract: We show that there is a function of one variable's worth of Lagrangians for a single Maxwell field coupled to gravity whose equations of motion admit electric-magnetic duality. Such Lagrangians are given by solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for timelike geodesics in Witten's two-dimensional black hole. Among them are the Born-Infeld Lagrangian which arises in open string theory. We investigate the effect of the axion and the dilaton in the open superstring case and we show that this theory loses its electric-magnetic duality invariance when one considers the higher order electromagnetic field terms. We discuss some implications for black holes in string theory and an extension to $2k$-forms in $4k$ spacetime dimensions.
