Title: Type-I Quantum Superalgebras, $q$-Supertrace and Two-variable Link  Polynomials
Authors: Mark D. Gould and Jon R. Links and Yao-Zhong Zhang
Abstract: A new general eigenvalue formula for the eigenvalues of Casimir invariants, for the type-I quantum superalgebras, is applied to the construction of link polynomials associated with {\em any} finite dimensional unitary irrep for these algebras. This affords a systematic construction of new two-variable link polynomials asociated with any finite dimensional irrep (with a real highest weight) for the type-I quantum superalgebras. In particular infinite families of non-equivalent two-variable link polynomials are determined in fully explicit form.
