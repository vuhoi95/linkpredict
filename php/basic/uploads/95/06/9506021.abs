Title: Radiation from Excited Vortex in the Abelian Higgs Model
Authors: H. Arodz and L. Hadasz
Abstract: Excitation of a vortex in the Abelian Higgs model is investigated with the help of a polynomial approximation. The excitation can be regarded as a longitudinal component of the vector field trapped by the vortex. The energy and profile of the excitation are found. Back-reaction of the excitation on the vortex is calculated in the small $\kappa$ limit. It turns out that in the presence of the excitation the vortex effectively becomes much wider - its radius oscillates in time and for all times it is not smaller than the radius of the unexcited vortex. Moreover, we find that the vector field of the excited vortex has long range radiative component. Bound on the amplitude of the excitation is also found.
