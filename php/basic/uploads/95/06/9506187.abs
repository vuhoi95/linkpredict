Title: The local degrees of freedom of higher dimensional pure Chern-Simons  theories
Authors: Maximo Banados and Luis J. Garay and Marc Henneaux
Abstract: The canonical structure of higher dimensional pure Chern-Simons theories is analysed. It is shown that these theories have generically a non-vanishing number of local degrees of freedom, even though they are obtained by means of a topological construction. This number of local degrees of freedom is computed as a function of the spacetime dimension and the dimension of the gauge group.
