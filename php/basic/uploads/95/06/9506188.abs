Title: Variational Solution of the Gross-Neveu model I. the Large-$N$ Limit
Authors: C. Arvanitis and F. Geniet and A. Neveu
Abstract: In this first paper we begin the application of variational methods to renormalisable asymptotically free field theories, using the Gross-Neveu model as a laboratory. This variational method has been shown to lead to a numerically convergent sequence of approximations for the anharmonic oscillator. Here we perform a sample calculation in lowest orders, which shows the superficially disastrous situation of variational calculations in quantum field theory, and how in the large-$N$ limit all difficulties go away, as a warm up exercise for the finite-$N$ case and for QCD.
