Title: Iso-spectral deformations of general matrix and their reductions on Lie  algebras
Authors: Yuji Kodama and Jian Ye
Abstract: We study an iso-spectral deformation of general matrix which is a natural generalization of the Toda lattice equation. We prove the integrability of the deformation, and give an explicit formula for the solution to the initial value problem. The formula is obtained by generalizing the orthogonalization procedure of Szeg\"{o}. Based on the root spaces for simple Lie algebras, we consider several reductions of the hierarchy. These include not only the integrable systems studied by Bogoyavlensky and Kostant, but also their generalizations which were not known to be integrable before. The behaviors of the solutions are also studied. Generically, there are two types of solutions, having either sorting property or blowing up to infinity in finite time.
