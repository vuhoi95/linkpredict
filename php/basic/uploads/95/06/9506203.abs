Title: On the Perturbative Equivalence Between the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian  Quantizations
Authors: I. A. Batalin and I. V. Tyutin
Abstract: The Hamiltonian (BFV) and Lagrangian (BV) quantization schemes are proved to be equivalent perturbatively to each other. It is shown in particular that the quantum master equation being treated perturbatively possesses a local formal solution.
