Title: States in the BRST cohomology for G/H WZNW models
Authors: Stephen Hwang and Henric Rhedin
Abstract: WZNW models, especially gauged WZNW models, are important in the study of conformal field theories. Karabali and Schnitzer initiated the study of the BRST cohomology of a WZNW model gauged by an anomaly free vector sub-group and results were given for abelian sub-groups. This result was generalized to non-abelian sub-groups for a specific set of representations \cite{HR1}. The subject of this talk is the analysis of arbitrary representations \cite{HR2,Hw}.
