Title: Topologically Massive Gauge Theory with O(2) Symmetry
Authors: Ian I. Kogan and Kai-Ming Lee
Abstract: We discuss the structure of the vacua in $O(2)$ topologically massive gauge theory on a torus. Since $O(2)$ has two connected components, there are four classical vacua. The different vacua impose different boundary conditions on the gauge potentials. We also discuss the non-perturbative transitions between the vacua induced by vortices of the theory.
