Title: Effective Energy for QED$_{2+1}$ with Semi-Localized Static Magnetic  Fields: A Solvable Model
Authors: Daniel Cangemi and Gerald Dunne and Eric D'Hoker
Abstract: We evaluate the exact ${\rm QED}_{2+1}$ effective energy for charged spin zero and spin half fields in the presence of a family of static magnetic field profiles localized in a strip of width $\lambda$. The exact result yields an infinite set of relations between the terms in the derivative expansion of the effective energy for a general magnetic field. Upon addition of the standard Maxwell magneto-static energy, the minimum energy configuration at fixed flux corresponds to a uniform magnetic field.
