Title: Solution of the dispersionless Hirota equations
Authors: R. Carroll and Y. Kodama
Abstract: The dispersionless differential Fay identity is shown to be equivalent to a kernel expansion providing a universal algebraic characterization and solution of the dispersionless Hirota equations. Some calculations based on D-bar data of the action are also indicated.
