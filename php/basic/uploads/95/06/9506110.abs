Title: Aspects of Duality in N=2 String Vacua
Authors: Vadim Kaplunovsky and Jan Louis and Stefan Theisen
Abstract: We collect further evidence for the proposed duality between $N=2$ heterotic and type II string vacua in a specific model suggested by Kachru and Vafa. In the gauge sector the previous analysis is extended; it is further shown that the duality also holds for the one--loop gravitational couplings to the vector multiplets.
