Title: Instantons and Monopoles in Maximal Abelian Projection of SU(2)  Gluodynamics
Authors: M. N. Chernodub and F. V. Gubarev
Abstract: We show that the instantons induce the abelian monopoles in the Maximal Abelian Projection of $SU(2)$ gluodynamics. As an example we consider the case of one instanton and the case of a set of instantons arranged along a straight line. The abelian monopoles which are induced by instantons may play some role in the confinement scenario.
