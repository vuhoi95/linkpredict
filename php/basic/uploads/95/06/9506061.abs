Title: Bosonic string with antisymmetric fields and a non-local Casimir effect
Authors: E. Elizalde and S. D. Odintsov
Abstract: The coupling, in a non-standard way, of a bosonic string theory with a dilaton and antisymmetric fields is investigated. By integrating over the antisymmetric fields, a Coulomb-like interaction term is generated. The static potential of a theory of this kind is obtained from the corresponding non-local zeta function, in some approximation. An interpretation of the static potential as a type of non-local Casimir effect is given.
