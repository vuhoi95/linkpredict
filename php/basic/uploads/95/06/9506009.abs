Title: Vassiliev Invariants for Torus Knots
Authors: M. Alvarez and J. M. F. Labastida
Abstract: Vassiliev invariants up to order six for arbitrary torus knots $\{ n , m \}$, with $n$ and $m$ coprime integers, are computed. These invariants are polynomials in $n$ and $m$ whose degree coincide with their order. Furthermore, they turn out to be integer-valued in a normalization previously proposed by the authors.
