Title: Duality in Complex sine-Gordon Theory
Authors: Q-Han Park and H. J. Shin
Abstract: New aspects of the complex sine-Gordon theory are addressed through the reformulation of the theory in terms of the gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten action. A dual transformation between the theory for the coupling constant $\b > 0$ and the theory for $\b < 0$ is given which agrees with the Krammers-Wannier duality in the context of perturbed conformal field theory. The B\"{a}cklund transform and the nonlinear superposition rule for the complex sine-Gordon theory are presented and from which, exact solutions, solitons and breathers with U(1) charge, are derived. We clarify topological and nontopological nature of neutral and charged solitons respectively, and discuss about the duality between the vector and the axial U(1) charges.
