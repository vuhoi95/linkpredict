Title: A Dual Description of the Four Dimensional Non-Linear Sigma Model
Authors: N. Mohammedi and R. T. Moss and R. D. Simmons
Abstract: The dual of the four dimensional non-linear sigma model is constructed using techniques familiar to string theory. This construction necessitates the introduction of a rank two antisymmetric tensor field whose properties are examined. The physics of the dual theory and that of the original model are compared. As an illustration we study in detail the SU(2) chiral model. We find that the scattering amplitudes of the charged Goldstone bosons in the two theories are in complete agreement at the one loop level.
