Title: Nonlinear Gauge Transformations and Exact Solutions of the  Doebner-Goldin Equation
Authors: P. Nattermann and W. Scherer
Abstract: Invariants of nonlinear gauge transformations of a family of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations proposed by Doebner and Goldin are used to characterize the behaviour of exact solutions of these equations.
