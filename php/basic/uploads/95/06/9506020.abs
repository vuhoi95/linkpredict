Title: Pair production of black holes on cosmic strings
Authors: S. W. Hawking and Simon F. Ross
Abstract: We discuss the pair creation of black holes by the breaking of a cosmic string. We obtain an instanton describing this process from the $C$ metric, and calculate its probability. This is very low for the strings that have been suggested for galaxy formation.
