Title: Quark Confinement in a Constituent Quark Model
Authors: Kurt Langfeld and Mannque Rho
Abstract: On the level of an effective quark theory, we define confinement by the absence of quark anti-quark thresholds in correlation functions. We then propose a confining Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-type model. The confinement is implemented in analogy to Anderson localization in condensed matter systems. We study the model's phase structure as well as its behavior under extreme conditions, i.e.\ high temperature and/or high density.
