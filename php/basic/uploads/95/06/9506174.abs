Abstract: We continue our study of matrix models of dually weighted graphs. Among the attractive features of these models is the possibility to interpolate between ensembles of regular and random two-dimensional lattices, relevant for the study of the crossover from two-dimensional flat space to two-dimensional quantum gravity. We further develop the formalism of large $N$ character expansions. In particular, a general method for determining the large $N$ limit of a character is derived. This method, aside from being potentially useful for a far greater class of problems, allows us to exactly solve the matrix models of dually weighted graphs, reducing them to a well-posed Cauchy-Riemann problem. The power of the method is illustrated by explicitly solving a new model in which only positive curvature defects are permitted on the surface, an arbitrary amount of negative curvature being introduced at a single insertion.
