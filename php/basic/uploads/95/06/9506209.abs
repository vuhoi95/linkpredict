Title: Anomalous commutator corrections to sum rules
Authors: Javier P. Muniain and J. Wudka
Abstract: In this paper we consider the contributions of anomalous commutators to various QCD sum rules. Using a combination of the BJL limit with the operator product expansion the results are presented in terms of the vacuum condensates of gauge invariant operators. It is demonstrated that the anomalous contributions are no negligible and reconcile various apparently contradictory calculations.
