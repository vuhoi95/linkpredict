Title: Towards a Singularity-Free Inflationary Universe?
Authors: Nemanja Kaloper and Richard Madden and Keith A. Olive
Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing a non-singular inflationary universe in stringy gravity via branch changing, from a previously superexponentially expanding phase to an FRW-like phase. Our approach is based on the phase space analysis of the dynamics, and we obtain a no-go theorem which rules out the efficient scenario of branch changing catalyzed by dilaton potential and stringy fluid sources. We furthermore consider the effects of string-loop corrections to the gravitational action in the form recently suggested by Damour and Polyakov. These corrections also fail to produce the desired branch change. However, focusing on the possibility that these corrections may decouple the dilaton, we deduce that they may lead to an inflationary expansion in the presence of a cosmological constant, which asymptotically approaches Einstein-deSitter solution.
