Title: Phase and Scaling Properties of Determinants Arising in Topological  Field Theories
Authors: David H. Adams and Siddhartha Sen
Abstract: In topological field theories determinants of maps with negative as well as positive eigenvalues arise. We give a generalisation of the zeta-regularisation technique to derive expressions for the phase and scaling-dependence of these determinants. For theories on odd-dimensional manifolds a simple formula for the scaling dependence is obtained in terms of the dimensions of certain cohomology spaces. This enables a non-perturbative feature of Chern-Simons gauge theory to be reproduced by path-integral methods.
