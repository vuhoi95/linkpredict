Title: D-branes and the Conifold Singularity
Authors: E. Gava and T. Jayaraman and K. S. Narain and M. H. Sarmadi
Abstract: We analyze in detail the description of type IIB theory on a Calabi-Yau three-fold near a conifold singularity in terms of intersecting D-branes. In particular we study the singularity structure of higher derivative $F$-terms of the form $F_g W^{2g}$ where $W$ is the gravitational superfield. This singularity is expected to be due to a one -loop contribution from a charged soliton hypermultiplet becoming massless at the conifold point. In the intersecting D-brane description this soliton is described by an open string stretched between the two D-branes. After identifying the graviphoton vertex as a closed string operator we show that $F_g$'s have the expected singularity structure in the limit of vanishing soliton mass.
