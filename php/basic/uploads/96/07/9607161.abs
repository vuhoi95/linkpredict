Title: Dictionary on Lie Superalgebras
Authors: L. Frappat and A. Sciarrino and P. Sorba
Abstract: The main definitions and properties of Lie superalgebras are proposed a la facon de a short dictionary, the different items following the alphabetical order. The main topics deal with the structure of simple Lie superalgebras and their finite dimensional representations; rather naturally, a few pages are devoted to supersymmetry. This modest booklet has two ambitious goals: to be elementary and easy to use. The beginner is supposed to find out here the main concepts on superalgebras, while a more experimented theorist should recognize the necessary tools and informations for a specific use.
