Title: Two-Loop Finiteness of Chern-Simons Field Theory in Background Field  Method
Authors: M. Chaichian and W. F. Chen
Abstract: We perform two-loop calculation of Chern-Simons in background field method using the hybrid regularization of higher-covariant derivative and dimensional regularization. It is explicitly shown that Chern-Simons field theory is finite at the two-loop level. This finiteness plays an important role in the relation of Chern-Simons theory with two-dimensional conformal field theory and the description of link invariant.
