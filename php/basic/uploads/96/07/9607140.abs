Title: Octonionic Representations of GL(8,R) and GL(4,C)
Authors: Stefano De Leo and Khaled Abdel-Khalek
Abstract: Octonionic algebra being nonassociative is difficult to manipulate. We introduce left-right octonionic barred operators which enable us to reproduce the associative GL(8,R) group. Extracting the basis of GL(4,C), we establish an interesting connection between the structure of left-right octonionic barred operators and generic 4x4 complex matrices. As an application we give an octonionic representation of the 4-dimensional Clifford algebra.
