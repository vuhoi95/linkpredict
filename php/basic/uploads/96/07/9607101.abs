Title: A Calculus for $SU(3)$ Leading to an Algebraic Formula for  Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients
Authors: J. S. Prakash and H. S. Sharatchandra
Abstract: We develop a simple computational tool for $SU(3)$ analogous to Bargmann's calculus for $SU(2)$. Crucial new inputs are, (i) explicit representation of the Gelfand-Zetlin basis in terms of polynomials in four variables and positive or negative integral powers of a fifth variable (ii) an auxiliary Gaussian measure with respect to which the Gelfand-Zetlin states are orthogonal but not normalized (iii) simple generating functions for generating all basis states and also all invariants. As an illustration of our techniques, an algebraic formula for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is obtained for the first time. This involves only Gaussian integrations. Thus $SU(3)$ is made as accessible for computations as $SU(2)$ is.
