Title: Quantum dynamics of $N=1$, $D=4$ supergravity compensator
Authors: I. L. Buchbinder and A. Yu. Petrov
Abstract: A new $N=1$ superfield theory in $D=4$ flat superspace is suggested. It describes dynamics of supergravity compensator and can be considered as a low-energy limit for $N=1$, $D=4$ superfield supergravity. The theory is shown to be renormalizable in infrared limit and infrared free. A quantum effective action is investigated in infrared domain.
