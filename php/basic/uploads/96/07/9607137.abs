Title: Asymmetric Non-Abelian Orbifolds and Model Building
Authors: Zurab Kakushadze and Gary Shiu and S. -H. Henry Tye
Abstract: The rules for the free fermionic string model construction are extended to include general non-abelian orbifold constructions that go beyond the real fermionic approach. This generalization is also applied to the asymmetric orbifold rules recently introduced. These non-abelian orbifold rules are quite easy to use. Examples are given to illustrate their applications.
