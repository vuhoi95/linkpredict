Title: A Non-Perturbative Superpotential With $E_8$ Symmetry
Authors: R. Donagi and A. Grassi and E. Witten
Abstract: We compute the non-perturbative superpotential in $F$-theory compactification to four dimensions on a complex three-fold $\P^1\times S$, where $S$ is a rational elliptic surface. In contrast to examples considered previously, the superpotential in this case has interesting modular properties; it is essentially an $E_8$ theta function.
