Title: Exact Results and Duality for SP(2N) SUSY Gauge Theories with an  Antisymmetric Tensor
Authors: Csaba Csaki and Witold Skiba and Martin Schmaltz
Abstract: We study supersymmetric Sp(2N) gauge theories with matter in the antisymmetric tensor representation and F fundamentals. For F=6 we solve the theory exactly in terms of confined degrees of freedom and a superpotential. By adding mass terms we obtain the theories with F<6 which we find to exhibit a host of interesting non-perturbative phenomena: quantum deformed moduli spaces with N constraints, instanton-induced superpotentials and non-equivalent disjoint branches of moduli spaces. We find a simple dual for F=8 and no superpotential. We show how the F=4 and F=2 theories can be modified to break supersymmetry spontaneously and point out that the Sp(6) theory with F=6 may be very interesting for model builders.
