Title: Quarkonia in Hamiltonian Light-Front QCD
Authors: Martina M. Brisudova and Robert J. Perry and Kenneth G. Wilson
Abstract: A constituent parton picture of hadrons with logarithmic confinement naturally arises in weak coupling light-front QCD. Confinement provides a mass gap that allows the constituent picture to emerge. The effective renormalized Hamiltonian is computed to ${\cal O}(g^2)$, and used to study charmonium and bottomonium. Radial and angular excitations can be used to fix the coupling $\alpha$, the quark mass $M$, and the cutoff $\Lambda$. The resultant hyperfine structure is very close to experiment.
