Title: Classical and quantum N=1 super $W_\infty$-algebras
Authors: L. O. Buffon and D. Dalmazi and A. Zadra
Abstract: We construct higher-spin N=1 super algebras as extensions of the super Virasoro algebra containing generators for all spins $s\ge 3/2$. We find two distinct classical (Poisson) algebras on the phase super space. Our results indicate that only one of them can be consistently quantized.
