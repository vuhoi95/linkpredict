Title: Complete Positivity and the K K-bar system
Authors: F. Benatti and R. Floreanini
Abstract: Models that provide experimentally testable violations of ordinary Quantum Mechanics have been recently proposed. These models are based on non-unitary time evolutions of density matrices that are generated by linear positive maps. We discuss the consequences of imposing a stronger condition on those maps, known as complete positivity. It turns out that experimental data on the neutral kaon system giving upper bounds to the parameters characterizing positive maps, also give bounds to those determining completely positive ones.
