Title: On structure of effective action in four-dimensional quantum dilaton  supergravity
Authors: I. L. Buchbinder and A. Yu. Petrov
Abstract: A general structure of effective action in new chiral superfield model associated with $N=1$, $D=4$ supergravity is investigated. This model corresponds to finite quantum field theory and does not demand the regularization and renormalization at effective action calculation. It is shown that in local approximation the effective action is defined by two objects called general superfield effective lagrangian and chiral superfield effective lagrangian. A proper-time method is generalized for calculation of these two effective lagrangians in superfield manner. Power expansion of the effective action in supercovariant derivatives is formulated and the lower terms of such an expansion are calculated in explicit superfield form.
