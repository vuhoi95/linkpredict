Title: The Schrodinger Wave Functional and Vacuum State in Curved Spacetime II.  Boundaries and Foliations
Authors: D. V. Long and G. M. Shore
Abstract: In a recent paper, general solutions for the vacuum wave functionals in the Schrodinger picture were given for a variety of classes of curved spacetimes. Here, we describe a number of simple examples which illustrate how the presence of spacetime boundaries influences the vacuum wave functional and how physical quantities are independent of the choice of spacetime foliation used in the Schrodinger approach despite the foliation dependence of the wave functionals themselves.
