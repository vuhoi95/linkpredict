Title: Yangian-invariant field theory of matrix-vector models
Authors: J. Avan and A. Jevicki and J. Lee
Abstract: We extend our study of the field-theoretic description of matrix-vector models and the associated many-body problems of one dimensional particles with spin. We construct their Yangian-su(R) invariant Hamiltonian. It describes an interacting theory of a c=1 collective boson and a k=1 su(R) current algebra. When $R \geq 3$ cubic-current terms arise. Their coupling is determined by the requirement of the Yangian symmetry. The Hamiltonian can be consistently reduced to finite-dimensional subspaces of states, enabling an explicit computation of the spectrum which we illustrate in the simplest case.
