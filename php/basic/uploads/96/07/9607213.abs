Title: About the kinematics of spinning particles
Authors: Giovanni Salesi and Erasmo Recami
Abstract: Inserting the correct Lorentz factor into the definition of the 4-velocity v^mu for spinning particles entails new kinematical properties for v^2. The well-known constraint (identically true for scalar particles, but entering also the Dirac theory, and assumed a priori in all spinning particle models) p_mu v^mu = m is here derived in a self-consistent way.
