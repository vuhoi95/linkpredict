Title: Asymptotic factorisation of form factors in two-dimensional quantum  field theory
Authors: G. Delfino and P. Simonetti and J. L. Cardy
Abstract: It is shown that the scaling operators in the conformal limit of a two-dimensional field theory have massive form factors which obey a simple factorisation property in rapidity space. This has been used to identify such operators within the form factor bootstrap approach. A sum rule which yields the scaling dimension of such operators is also derived.
