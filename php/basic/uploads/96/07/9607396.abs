Title: Supersymmetry Breaking and Fermi Balls
Authors: J. R. Morris and D. Bazeia
Abstract: A simple model is presented where the disappearance of domain walls and the associated production of ``Fermi balls'', which have been proposed as candidates for cold dark matter, are features which arise rather naturally in response to softly broken supersymmetry.
