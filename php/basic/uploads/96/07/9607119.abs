Title: On a Possibility of Membrane Cosmology
Authors: S. N. Roshchupkin and A. A. Zheltukhin
Abstract: Tensionless null p-branes in arbitrary cosmological backgrounds are considered and their motion equations are solved. It is shown that an ideal fluid of null p-branes may be considered as a source of gravity for D-dimensional Friedmann- Robertson-Walker universes.
