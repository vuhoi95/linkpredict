Title: Higher Loop Anomalies and their Consistency Conditions in Nonlocal  Regularization
Authors: Jordi Par√≠s and Walter Troost
Abstract: An algebraic program of computation and characterization of higher loop BRST anomalies is presented. We propose a procedure for disentangling a genuine{\it local} higher loop anomaly from the quantum dressings of lower loop anomalies. For such higher loop anomalies we derive a local consistency condition, which is the generalisation of the Wess-Zumino condition for the one-loop anomaly. The development is presented in the framework of the field-antifield formalism, making use of a nonlocal regularization method. The theoretical construction is exemplified by explicitly computing the two-loop anomaly of chiral $W_3$ gravity. We also give, for the first time, an explicit check of the local two--loop consistency condition that is associated with this anomaly.
