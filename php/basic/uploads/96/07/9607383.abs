Title: Anomalous U(1) as a mediator of Supersymmetry Breaking
Authors: Gia Dvali and Alex Pomarol
Abstract: We point out that an anomalous gauge U(1) symmetry is a natural candidate for being the mediator and messenger of supersymmetry breaking. It facilitates dynamical supersymmetry breaking even in the flat limit. Soft masses are induced by both gravity and the U(1) gauge interactions giving an unusual mass hierarchy in the sparticle spectrum which suppresses flavor violations. This scenario does not suffer from the Polonyi problem.
