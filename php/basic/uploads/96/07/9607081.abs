Title: Branched polymers on branched polymers
Authors: Bergfinnur Durhuus and Thordur Jonsson
Abstract: We study an ensemble of branched polymers which are embedded on other branched polymers. This is a toy model which allows us to study explicitly the reaction of a statistical system on an underlying geometrical structure, a problem of interest in the study of the interaction of matter and quantized gravity. We find a phase transition at which the embedded polymers begin to cover the basis polymers. At the phase transition point the susceptibility exponent $\gamma$ takes the value 3/4 and the two-point function develops an anomalous dimension 1/2.
