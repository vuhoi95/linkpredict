Title: Interpolation Parameter and Expansion for the Three Dimensional  Non-Trivial Scalar Infrared Fixed Point
Authors: Christian Wieczerkowski and Juri Rolf
Abstract: We compute the non--trivial infrared $\phi^4_3$--fixed point by means of an interpolation expansion in fixed dimension. The expansion is formulated for an infinitesimal momentum space renormalization group. We choose a coordinate representation for the fixed point interaction in derivative expansion, and compute its coordinates to high orders by means of computer algebra. We compute the series for the critical exponent $\nu$ up to order twenty five of interpolation expansion in this representation, and evaluate it using \pade, Borel--\pade, Borel--conformal--\pade, and Dlog--\pade resummation. The resummation returns $0.6262(13)$ as the value of $\nu$.
