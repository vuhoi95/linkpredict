Title: Supersymmetry from a braided point of view
Authors: R. S. Dunne and A. J. Macfarlane and J. A. de Azcárraga and J. C. Pérez Bueno
Abstract: We show that one-dimensional superspace is isomorphic to a non-trivial but consistent limit as $q\to-1$ of the braided line. Supersymmetry is identified as translational invariance along this line. The supertranslation generator and covariant derivative are obtained in the limit in question as the left and right derivatives of the calculus on the braided line.
