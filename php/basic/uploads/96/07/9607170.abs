Title: Analytic calculations of trial wave functions of the fractional quantum  Hall effect on the sphere
Authors: Carmem Lucia de Souza Batista and Dingping Li
Abstract: We present a framework for the analytic calculations of the hierarchical wave functions and the composite fermion wave functions in the fractional quantum Hall effect on the sphere by using projective coordinates. Then we calculate the overlaps between these two wave functions at various fillings and small numbers of electrons. We find that the overlaps are all most equal to one. This gives a further evidence that two theories of the fractional quantum Hall effect, the hierarchical theory and the composite fermion theory, are physically equivalent.
