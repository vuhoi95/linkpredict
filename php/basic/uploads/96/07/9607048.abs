Title: Gauge Dressing of 2D Field Theories
Authors: Ian I. Kogan and Alex Lewis and Oleg A. Soloviev
Abstract: By using the gauge Ward identities, we study correlation functions of gauged WZNW models. We show that the gauge dressing of the correlation functions can be taken into account as a solution of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation. Our method is analogous to the analysis of the gravitational dressing of 2D field theories.
