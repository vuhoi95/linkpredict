Title: An Orientifold from F Theory
Authors: Julie D. Blum and Alberto Zaffaroni
Abstract: The massless spectrum of an orientifold of the IIB string theory is computed and shown to be identical to F theory on the Calabi-Yau threefold with $h_{11}=51$ and $h_{21}=3$. Target space duality is also considered in this model.
