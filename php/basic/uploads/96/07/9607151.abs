Title: Microscopic Oscillations in the Quantum Nucleation of Vortices Subject  to Periodic Pinning Potential in a Thin Superconductor
Authors: Roberto Iengo and Giancarlo Jug
Abstract: We present a theory for the decay of a supercurrent through nucleation of vortex-antivortex pairs in a two-dimensional superconductor in the presence of dissipation and of a periodic pinning potential. Through a powerful quantum electrodynamics formulation of the problem we show that the nucleation rate develops oscillations in its current-density dependence which are connected to the pinning periodicity. A remnant of the dissipation-driven localization transition is present, and an estimate of the nucleation rate suggests that these effects might be observable in real thin superconductors.
