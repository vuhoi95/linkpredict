Title: On a Canonical Formulation of String Theory in Massive Background Fields
Authors: I. L. Buchbinder and V. D. Pershin and G. B. Toder
Abstract: We propose a method of constructing a gauge invariant canonical formulation for non-gauge classical theory which depends on a set of parameters. Requirement of closure for algebra of operators generating quantum gauge transformations leads to restrictions on parameters of the theory. This approach is then applied to bosonic string theory coupled to massive background fields. It is shown that within the proposed canonical formulation the correct linear equations of motion for background fields arise.
