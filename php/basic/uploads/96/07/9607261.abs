Title: A New Mechanism to Solve the Small Scale Problem of Local Supersymmetry
Authors: A. Chamseddine and H. Dreiner
Abstract: We extend the Standard Model gauge group by a a gauged $U(1)_R$ R-Symmetry or a gauged $U(1)'$. The requirement of cancellation of anomalies is very constraining but can be achieved by adding three or four hidden-sector fields which are Standrad Model singlets. The $U(1)_R$ or $U(1)'$ quantum numbers of these singlets are usually large producing a non-renormalisable superpotential with a high power in the singelt fields. We have minimized the supergravity scalar potential and have found solutions where the vacuum expectation values of all hidden-sector singlet fields are less than the Planck mass $<{z_m}>=O(M_{Pl}/10)$. This produces the small supersymmetry scale of order the weak scale from only the Planck scale. The mu problem is simultaneously solved in this manner.
