Title: BPS States of Exceptional Non-Critical Strings
Authors: A. Klemm and P. Mayr and C. Vafa
Abstract: We study the BPS states of non-critical strings which arise for zero size instantons of exceptional groups. This is accomplished by using F-theory and M-theory duals and by employing mirror symmetry to compute the degeneracy of membranes wrapped around 2-cycles of the Calabi-Yau threefold. We find evidence for a number of novel physical phenomena, including having infinitely many light states with the first lightest state including a nearly massless gravitino.
