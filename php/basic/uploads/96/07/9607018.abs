Title: Integrable Generalized Thirring Model
Authors: K. Bardakci and L. M. Bernardo and N. Sochen
Abstract: We derive the conditions that the coupling constants of the Generalized Thirring Model have to satisfy in order for the model to admit an infinite number of commuting classical conserved quantities. Our treatment uses the bosonized version of the model, with periodic boundary conditions imposed on the space coordinate. Some explicit examples that satisfy these conditions are discussed. We show that, with a different set of boundary conditions, there exist additional conserved quantities, and we find the Poisson Bracket algebra satisfied by them.
