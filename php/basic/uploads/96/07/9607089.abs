Title: On N=2 low energy effective actions
Authors: F. Gonzalez-Rey and U. Lindstrom and M. Rocek and R. von Unge
Abstract: We propose a Wilsonian action compatible with special geometry and higher dimension N=2 corrections, and show that the holomorphic contribution F to the low energy effective action is independent of the infrared cutoff. We further show that for asymptotically free SU(2) super Yang-Mills theories, the infrared cutoff can be tuned to cancel leading corrections to F. We also classify all local higher-dimensional contributions to the N=2 superspace effective action that produce corrections to the Kahler potential when reduced to N=1 superspace.
