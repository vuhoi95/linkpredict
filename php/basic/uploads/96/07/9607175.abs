Title: Non-parallel Electric and Magnectic Fields in a Gravitational  Background, Stationary Gravitational Waves and Gravitons
Authors: Carlos Pinheiro and J. A. Helayel-Neto and Gilmar S. Dias
Abstract: The existence of an electromagnectic field with parallel electric and magnetic components is readdressed in the presence of a gravitational field. A non-parallel solution is shown to exist. Next, we analyse the possibility of finding stationary gravitational waves in de nature. Finaly, We construct a D=4 effective quantum gravity model. Tree-level unitarity is verified.
