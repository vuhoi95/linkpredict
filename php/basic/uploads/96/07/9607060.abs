Title: Quantum Space-time and Classical Gravity
Authors: J. Madore and J. Mourad
Abstract: A method has been recently proposed for defining an arbitrary number of differential calculi over a given noncommutative associative algebra. As an example a version of quantized space-time is considered here. It is found that there is a natural differential calculus using which the space-time is necessarily flat Minkowski space-time. Perturbations of this calculus are shown to give rise to non-trivial gravitational fields.
