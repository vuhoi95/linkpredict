Title: Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Equations in 10+2 Dimensions
Authors: Hitoshi Nishino and Ergin Sezgin
Abstract: We present a model for supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in 10+2 dimensions. Our construction uses a constant null vector, and leads to a consistent set of field equations and constraints. The model is invariant under generalized translations and an extra gauge transformation. Ordinary dimensional reduction to ten dimensions yields the usual supersymmetric Yang-Mills equations, while dimensional reduction to 2+2 yields supersymmetric Yang-Mills equations in which the Poincar\'e supersymmetry is reduced by a null vector. We also give the corresponding formulation in superspace.
