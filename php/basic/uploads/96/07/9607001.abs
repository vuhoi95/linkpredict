Title: Propagating waves in an extremal black string
Authors: H. W. Lee and Y. S. Myung and Jin Young Kim and D. K. Park
Abstract: We investigate the black string in the context of the string theories. It is shown that the graviton is the only propagating mode in the (2+1)--dimensional extremal black string background. Both the dilation and axion turn out to be non-propagating modes.
