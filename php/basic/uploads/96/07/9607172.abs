Title: Gaugino condensation and the anomalous $U(1)$
Authors: P. Binetruy and E. A. Dudas
Abstract: We study gaugino condensation in presence of an anomalous $U(1)$ gauge group and find that global supersymmetry is dynamically broken. An example of particular interest is provided by effective string models with 4-dimensional Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism. The structure of the hidden sector is constrained by the anomaly cancellation conditions and the scale of gaugino condensation is shifted compared with the usual case. We explicitly compute the resulting soft supersymmetry breaking terms.
