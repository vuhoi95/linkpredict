Title: Bosonization and even Grassmann variables
Authors: M. B. Barbaro and A. Molinari and F. Palumbo
Abstract: A new approach to bosonization in relativistic field theories and many-body systems, based on the use of fermionic composites as integration variables in the Berezin integral defining the partition function of the system, is tested. The method is applied to the study of a simplified version of the BCS model.
