Title: Absence of second order phase transition in $ λφ^4$ theory
Authors: S. Mallik and K. Mukherjee
Abstract: We calculate the self-energy at finite temperature in scalar $\lambda\phi ^4$ theory to second order in a modified perturbation expansion. Using the renormalisation group equation to tame the logarithms in momentum, it gives an equation to determine the critical temperature. Due to the infrared freedom of the theory, this equation is satisfied, irrespective of the value of the temperature. We conclude that there is no second order phase transition in this theory.
