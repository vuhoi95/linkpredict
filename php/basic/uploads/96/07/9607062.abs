Title: Functional Schroedinger and BRST Quantization of (1+1)--Dimensional  Gravity
Authors: E. Benedict and R. Jackiw and H. -J. Lee
Abstract: We discuss the quantization of pure string--inspired dilaton--gravity in $(1+1)$--dimensions, and of the same theory coupled to scalar matter. We perform the quantization using the functional Schroedinger and BRST formalisms. We find, both for pure gravity and the matter--coupled theory, that the two quantization procedures give inequivalent ``physical'' results.
