Title: A Comment on the Spectrum of H-Monopoles
Authors: S. Sethi and M. Stern
Abstract: We consider the question of ground states in the supersymmetric system that arises in the search for the missing H-monopole states. By studying the effective theory near certain singularities in the five-brane moduli space, we find the remaining BPS states required by the conjectured S-duality of the toroidally compactified heterotic string.
