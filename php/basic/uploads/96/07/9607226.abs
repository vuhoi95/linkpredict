Title: Classical and Quantum Gravity in 1+1 Dimensions, Part III: Solutions of  Arbitrary Topology
Authors: T. Kloesch and T. Strobl
Abstract: All global solutions of arbitrary topology of the most general 1+1 dimensional dilaton gravity models are obtained. We show that for a generic model there are globally smooth solutions on any non-compact 2-surface. The solution space is parametrized explicitly and the geometrical significance of continuous and discrete labels is elucidated. As a corollary we gain insight into the (in general non-trivial) topology of the reduced phase space. The classification covers basically all 2D metrics of Lorentzian signature with a (local) Killing symmetry.
