Title: Non abelian bosonisation in three dimensional field theory
Authors: N. Banerjee and R. Banerjee and S. Ghosh
Abstract: We develop a method based on the generalised St\"uckelberg prescription for discussing bosonisation in the low energy regime of the SU(2) massive Thirring model in 2+1 dimensions. For arbitrary values of the coupling parameter the bosonised theory is found to be a nonabelian gauge theory whose physical sector is explicitly obtained. In the case of vanishing coupling this gauge theory can be identified with the SU(2) Yang-Mills Chern-Simons theory in the limit when the Yang-Mills term vanishes. Bosonisation identities for the fermionic current are derived.
