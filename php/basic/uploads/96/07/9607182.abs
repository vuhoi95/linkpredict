Title: Electric-Magnetic Black Hole Duality
Authors: S. Deser and M. Henneaux and C. Teitelboim
Abstract: We generalize duality invariance for the free Maxwell action in an arbitrary background geometry to include the presence of electric and magnetic charges. In particular, it follows that the actions of equally charged electric and magnetic black holes are equal.
