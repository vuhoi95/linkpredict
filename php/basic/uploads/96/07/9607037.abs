Abstract: Some interesting nonperturbative properties of the strongly coupled 4D compact U(1) lattice gauge theories, both without and with matter fields, are pointed out. We demonstrate that the pure gauge theory has a non-Gaussian fixed point with $\nu = 0.365(8)$ at the second order confinement-Coulomb phase transition. Thus a non-asymptotic free and nontrivial continuum limit of this theory, and of its various dual equivalents, in particular of a special case of the effective string theory, can be constructed. Including a scalar matter field (compact scalar QED), we confirm the Gaussian behavior at the endpoint of the Higgs phase transition line. In the theory with both scalar and fermion matter fields, we demonstrate the existence of a tricritical point. Here, the chiral symmetry is broken, and the mass of unconfined composite fermions is generated dynamically. Appart from the Goldstone bosons, the spectrum contains also a massive scalar. This resembles the Higgs-Yukawa sector of the SM, albeit of dynamical origin, like the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. However, the scaling behavior is different from that in the NJL model and the nonperturbative renormalizability might thus be possible.
