Title: Functional integration on Regge geometries
Authors: Pietro Menotti and Pier Paolo Peirano
Abstract: We adopt the standard definition of diffeomorphism for Regge gravity in D=2 and give an exact expression of the Liouville action in the discretized case. We also give the exact form of the integration measure for the conformal factor. In D>2 we extend the approach to any family of geometries described by a finite number of parameters. The ensuing measure is a geometric invariant and it is also invariant in form under an arbitrary change of parameters.
