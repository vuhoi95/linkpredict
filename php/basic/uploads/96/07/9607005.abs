Title: Towards a $Z'$ Gauge Boson in Noncommutative Geometry
Authors: Thomas Krajewski and Igor Pris
Abstract: We study all possible $U(1)$-extensions of the standard model (SM) in the framework of noncommutative geometry (NCG) with the algebra $\hhh\op\cc\op\cc\op M_3(\cc)$. Comparison to experimental data about the mass of a hypothetical $Z'$ gauge boson leads to the necessity of introducing at least one new family of heavy fermions.
