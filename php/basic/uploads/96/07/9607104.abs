Title: Statistical Origin of Black Hole Entropy in Induced Gravity
Authors: V. P. Frolov and D. V. Fursaev and A. I. Zelnikov
Abstract: The statistical-mechanical origin of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy $S^{BH}$ in the induced gravity is discussed. In the framework of the induced gravity models the Einstein action arises as the low energy limit of the effective action of quantum fields. The induced gravitational constant is determined by the masses of the heavy constituents. We established the explicit relation between statistical entropy of constituent fields and black hole entropy $S^{BH}$.
