Title: On the Minimal Model of Anyons
Authors: I. V. Gorbunov and S. M. Kuzenko and S. L. Lyakhovich
Abstract: We present new geometric formulations for the fractional spin particle models on the minimal phase spaces. New consistent couplings of the anyon to background fields are constructed. The relationship between our approach and previously developed anyon models is discussed.
