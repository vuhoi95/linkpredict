Title: Soft Supersymmetry Breaking Induced by Higher-Derivative  Supergravitation in the Electroweak Standard Model
Authors: Ahmed Hindawi and Burt A. Ovrut and Daniel Waldram
Abstract: We show how spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in the vacuum state of higher-derivative supergravity is transmitted, as explicit soft supersymmetry-breaking terms, to the effective Lagrangian of the standard electroweak model. The general structure of the soft supersymmetry breaking terms is presented and a new scenario for understanding the gauge hierarchy problem, based on the functional form of these terms, is discussed.
