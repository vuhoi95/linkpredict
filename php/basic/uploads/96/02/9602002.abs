Title: Exact Solution of an Octagonal Random Tiling Model
Authors: Jan de Gier and Bernard Nienhuis
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional random tiling model introduced by Cockayne, i.e. the ensemble of all possible coverings of the plane without gaps or overlaps with squares and various hexagons. At the appropriate relative densities the correlations have eight-fold rotational symmetry. We reformulate the model in terms of a random tiling ensemble with identical rectangles and isosceles triangles. The partition function of this model can be calculated by diagonalizing a transfer matrix using the Bethe Ansatz (BA). The BA equations can be solved providing {\em exact} values of the entropy and elastic constants.
