Title: The Moduli Space of Many BPS Monopoles for Arbitrary Gauge Groups
Authors: Kimyeong Lee and Erick J. Weinberg and Piljin Yi
Abstract: We study the moduli space for an arbitrary number of BPS monopoles in a gauge theory with an arbitrary gauge group that is maximally broken to $U(1)^k$. From the low energy dynamics of well-separated dyons we infer the asymptotic form of the metric for the moduli space. For a pair of distinct fundamental monopoles, the space thus obtained is $R^3 \times(R^1\times {\cal M}_0)/Z$ where ${\cal M}_0$ is the Euclidean Taub-NUT manifold. Following the methods of Atiyah and Hitchin, we demonstrate that this is actually the exact moduli space for this case. For any number of such objects, we show that the asymptotic form remains nonsingular for all values of the intermonopole distances and that it has the symmetries and other characteristics required of the exact metric. We therefore conjecture that the asymptotic form is exact for these cases also.
