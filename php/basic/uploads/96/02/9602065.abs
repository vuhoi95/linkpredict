Title: D--branes and Spinning Black Holes
Authors: J. C. Breckenridge and R. C. Myers and A. W. Peet and C. Vafa
Abstract: We obtain a new class of spinning charged extremal black holes in five dimensions, considered both as classical configurations and in the Dirichlet(D)--brane representation. The degeneracy of states is computed from the D--brane side and the entropy agrees perfectly with that obtained from the black hole side.
