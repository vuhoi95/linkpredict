Title: Pseudoclassical description of higher spins in $2+1$ dimensions
Authors: D. M. Gitman and I. V. Tyutin
Abstract: Pseudoclassical supersymmetric model to describe massive particles with higher spins (integer and half-integer) in $2+1$ dimensions is proposed. The quantization of the model leads to the minimal (with only one polarization state) quantum theory. In particular, the Bargmann-Wigner type equations for higher spins arise in course of the canonical quantization. The cases of spin one-half and one are considered in detail. Here one gets Dirac particles and Chern-Simons particles respectively. A relation with the field theory is discussed. On the basis of the model proposed, and using dimensional reduction considerations, a model to describe Weyl particles with higher spins in $3+1$ dimensions is constructed.
