Title: Demazure modules and vertex models: the affine sl(2) case
Authors: Omar Foda and Kailash C. Misra and Masato Okado
Abstract: We characterize, in the case of affine sl(2), the crystal base of the Demazure module E_w(\La) in terms of extended Young diagrams or paths for any dominant integral weight \La and Weyl group element w. Its character is evaluated via two expressions, 'bosonic' and 'fermionic'.
