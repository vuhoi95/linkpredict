Title: Causal Propagators for the Second Order Wilson Loop
Authors: B. M. Pimentel and J. L. Tomazelli
Abstract: We evaluate the Wilson loop at second order in general non-covariant gauges by means of the causal principal-value prescription for the gauge- dependent poles in the gauge-boson propagator and show that the result agrees with the usual causal prescriptions.
