Title: A geometrical approach to super W-induced gravities in two dimensions
Authors: J. P. Ader and F. Biet and Y. Noirot
Abstract: A geometrical study of supergravity defined on (1|1) complex superspace is presented. This approach is based on the introduction of generalized superprojective structures extending the notions of super Riemann geometry to a kind of super W-Riemann surfaces. On these surfaces a connection is constructed. The zero curvature condition leads to the super Ward identities of the underlying supergravity. This is accomplished through the symplectic form linked to the (super)symplectic manifold of all super gauge connections. The BRST algebra is also derived from the knowledge of the super W-symmetries which are the gauge transformations of the vector bundle canonically associated to the generalized superprojective structures. We obtain the possible consistent BRST (super)anomalies and their cocycles related by the descent equations. Finally we apply our considerations to the case of supergravity.
