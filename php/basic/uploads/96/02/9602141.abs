Title: Ward-Takahashi Identities in Large N Field Theories
Authors: M. Araki and Y. Tanii
Abstract: The Ward-Takahashi identities in large N field theories are expressed in a simple form using master fields. Operators appearing in these expressions are found to be generators of symmetry transformations acting on the master fields.
