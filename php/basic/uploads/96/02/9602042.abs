Title: High-Temperature Anyon Superconductivity
Authors: Efrain J. Ferrer and Rene Hurka and Vivian de la Incera
Abstract: The screening of an applied magnetic field in the charged anyon fluid at finite density and temperature is investigated. For densities typical of high-temperature superconducting materials we find that the anyon fluid exhibits a superconducting behavior at any temperature. The total Meissner screening is characterized by two penetration lengths corresponding to two short-range eigenmodes of propagation within the anyon fluid.
