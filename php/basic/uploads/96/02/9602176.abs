Title: Overlap formulation of Majorana--Weyl fermions
Authors: Patrick Huet and Rajamani Narayanan and Herbert Neuberger
Abstract: An overlap method for regularizing Majorana--Weyl fermions interacting with gauge fields is presented. A mod(2) index is introduced in relation to the anomalous violation of a discrete global chiral symmetry. Most of the paper is restricted to 2 dimensions but generalizations to 2+8k dimensions should be straightforward.
