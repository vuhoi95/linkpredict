Title: The Barton Expansion and the Path Integral Approach in Thermal Field  Theory
Authors: F T Brandt and D G C McKeon
Abstract: It has been shown how on-shell forward scattering amplitudes (the ``Barton expansion'') and quantum mechanical path integral (QMPI) can both be used to compute temperature dependent effects in thermal field theory. We demonstrate the equivalence of these two approaches and then apply the QMPI to compute the high temperature expansion for the four-point function in QED, obtaining results consistent with those previously obtained from the Barton expansion.
