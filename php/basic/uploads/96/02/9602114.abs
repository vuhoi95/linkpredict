Title: Compactifications of F-Theory on Calabi--Yau Threefolds -- I
Authors: David R. Morrison and Cumrun Vafa
Abstract: We study compactifications of F-theory on certain Calabi--Yau threefolds. We find that $N=2$ dualities of type II/heterotic strings in 4 dimensions get promoted to $N=1$ dualities between heterotic string and F-theory in 6 dimensions. The six dimensional heterotic/heterotic duality becomes a classical geometric symmetry of the Calabi--Yau in the F-theory setup. Moreover the F-theory compactification sheds light on the nature of the strong coupling transition and what lies beyond the transition at finite values of heterotic string coupling constant.
