Title: The Yang--Mills gauge field theory in the context of a generalized  BRST--formalism including translations
Authors: O. Moritsch and M. Schweda and T. Sommer
Abstract: We discuss the algebraic renormalization of the Yang--Mills gauge field theory in the presence of translations. Due to the translations the algebra between Sorella's $\d$--operator, the exterior derivative and the BRST--operator closes. Therefore, we are able to derive an integrated parameter formula collecting in an elegant and compact way all nontrivial solutions of the descent equations.
