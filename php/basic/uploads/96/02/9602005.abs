Title: Energy of a spherically symmetric charged dilaton black hole
Authors: A. Chamorro and K. S. Virbhadra
Abstract: The energy associated with a static and spherically symmetric charged dilaton black hole is obtained for arbitrary value of the coupling parameter (which regulates the strength of the coupling of the dilaton to the Maxwell field) $\beta$. The energy distribution depends on $\beta$, whereas the total energy is independent of this and is given by the mass parameter of the black hole.
