Title: Fermion Condensates of massless $QED_2$ at Finite Density in non-trivial  Topological Sectors
Authors: H. R. Christiansen and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: Vacuum expectation values of products of local bilinears $\bar\psi\psi$ are computed in massless $QED_2$ at finite density. It is shown that chiral condensates exhibit an oscillatory inhomogeneous behaviour depending on the chemical potential. The use of a path-integral approach clarifies the connection of this phenomenon with the topological structure of the theory.
