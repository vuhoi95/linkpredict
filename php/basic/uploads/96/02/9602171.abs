Title: The third virial coefficient of anyons revisited
Authors: Stefan Mashkevich and Jan Myrheim and KÃ¥re Olaussen
Abstract: We use the method of solving the three-anyon problem developed in our earlier publication to evaluate numerically the third virial coefficient of free anyons. In order to improve precision, we explicitly correct for truncation effects. The present calculation is about three orders of magnitude more precise than the previous Monte Carlo calculation and indicates the presence of a term $a sin^4 \pi\nu$ with a very small coefficient $a \simeq -1.65 10^{-5}$.
