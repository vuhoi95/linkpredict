Title: Gauge Invariance, the Quantum Action Principle, and the Renormalization  Group
Authors: Marco D'Attanasio and Tim R. Morris
Abstract: If the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) is formulated with a cutoff that breaks gauge invariance, then gauge invariance may be recovered only once the cutoff is removed and only once a set of effective Ward identities is imposed. We show that an effective Quantum Action Principle can be formulated in perturbation theory which enables the effective Ward identities to be solved order by order, even if the theory requires non-vanishing subtraction points. The difficulties encountered with non-perturbative approximations are briefly discussed.
