Title: Counting States of Near-Extremal Black Holes
Authors: Gary Horowitz and Andrew Strominger
Abstract: A six-dimensional black string is considered and its Bekenstein-Hawking entropy computed. It is shown that to leading order above extremality, this entropy precisely counts the number of string states with the given energy and charges. This identification implies that Hawking decay of the near-extremal black string can be analyzed in string perturbation theory and is perturbatively unitary.
