Title: Anti-Ferromagnetic Condensate in Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Jochen Fingberg and Janos Polonyi
Abstract: SU(2) gauge theory with competing interactions is shown to possess a rich phase structure with anti-ferromagnetic vacua. It is argued that the phase boundaries persist in the weak coupling limit suggesting the existence of different renormalized continuum theories for QCD.
