Title: Integrable $1/r^2$ Spin Chain with Reflecting End
Authors: Takashi Yamamoto and Osamu Tsuchiya
Abstract: A new integrable spin chain of the Haldane-Shastry type is introduced. It is interpreted as the inverse-square interacting spin chain with a {\it reflecting end}. The lattice points of this model consist of the square roots of the zeros of the Laguerre polynomial. Using the ``exchange operator formalism'', the integrals of motion for the model are explicitly constructed.
