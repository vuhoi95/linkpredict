Title: The Quantum Gravitational Back-Reaction On Inflation
Authors: N. C. Tsamis and R. P. Woodard
Abstract: We describe our recent calculation of two-loop corrections to the expansion rate of an initially inflating universe on the manifold $T^3 \times \Re$. If correct, our result proves that quantum gravitational effects slow the rate of inflation by an amount which becomes non-perturbatively large at late times. In a preliminary discussion of basic issues we show that the expansion rate is a gauge invariant, and that our ultraviolet regulator does not introduce spurious time dependence. We also derive a sharp bound on the maximum strength of higher loop effects.
