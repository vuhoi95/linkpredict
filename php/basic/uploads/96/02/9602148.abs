Title: Three-point correlation functions in N=1 Super Lioville Theory
Authors: R. C. Rashkov and M. Stanishkov
Abstract: In this letter we propose exact three-point correlation functions for N=1 supersymmetric Liouville theory. Along the lines of Zamolodchikov and Zamolodchikov paper (hep-th/9506136) we propose a generalized special function which describe the three-point amplitudes. We consider briefly the so called reflection amplitudes in the supersymmetric case.
