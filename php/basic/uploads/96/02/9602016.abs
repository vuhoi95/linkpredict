Title: Modified Relativity from the kappa-deformed Poincare Algebra
Authors: J. P. Bowes and P. D. Jarvis
Abstract: The theory of the $\kappa$-deformed Poincare algebra is applied to the analysis of various phenomena in special relativity, quantum mechanics and field theory. The method relies on the development of series expansions in $\kappa^{-1}$ of the generalised Lorentz transformations, about the special-relativistic limit. Emphasis is placed on the underlying assumptions needed in each part of the discussion, and on in principle limits for the deformation parameter, rather than on rigorous numerical bounds. In the case of the relativistic Doppler effect, and the Michelson-Morley experiment, comparisons with recent experiemntal tests yield the relatively weak lower bounds on $\kappa c$ of 90eV and 250 keV, respectively. Corrections to the Casimir effect and the Thomas precession are also discussed.
