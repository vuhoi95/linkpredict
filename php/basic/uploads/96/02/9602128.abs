Title: Supersymmetric electrodynamics of charged and neutral fermions in the  extended Wheeler-Feynman approach
Authors: V. V. Tugai and A. A. Zheltukhin
Abstract: A supersymmetric formulation of the classical action of interacting charged and neutral fermions with arbitrary anomalous magnetic moment is considered. This formulation generalizes the known action for scalar charged particles investigated in papers by Fokker, Schwarzschild, Tetrode, Wheeler and Feynman. The superfield formulation of the electrodynamics of the Maxwell supermultiplet, constructed from the world coordinates of charged or neutral fermions is carried out basing on the proposed action.
