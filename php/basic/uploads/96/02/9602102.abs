Title: M-Theory on a Calabi-Yau Manifold
Authors: Sergio Ferrara and Ramzi R. Khuri and Ruben Minasian
Abstract: We compactify $M$-theory on a Calabi-Yau manifold to five dimensions by wrapping the membrane and fivebrane solitons of the eleven-dimensional supergravity limit around Calabi-Yau two-cycles and four-cycles respectively. We identify the perturbative and non-perturbative BPS states thus obtained with those of heterotic string theory compactified on $K3\times S^1$. Quantum aspects of the five-dimensional theory are discussed.
