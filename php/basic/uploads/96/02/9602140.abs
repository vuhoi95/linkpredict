Title: Weyl Group Invariance and p-brane Multiplets
Authors: H. Lu and C. N. Pope and K. S. Stelle
Abstract: In this paper, we study the actions of the Weyl groups of the U duality groups for type IIA string theory toroidally compactified to all dimensions $D\ge 3$. We show how these Weyl groups implement permutations of the field strengths, and we discuss the Weyl group multiplets of all supersymmetric $p$-brane solitons.
