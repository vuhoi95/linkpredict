Title: Multi-point Local Height Probabilities in the Integrable RSOS Model
Authors: S. Lukyanov and Ya. Pugai
Abstract: By using the bosonization technique, we derive an integral representation for multi-point Local Hight Probabilities for the Andrews-Baxter-Forrester model in the regime III. We argue that the dynamical symmetry of the model is provided by the deformed Virasoro algebra.
