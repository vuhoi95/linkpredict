Title: Intertwining Operators for the Central Extension of the Yangian Double
Authors: S. Khoroshkin and D. Lebedev and S. Pakuliak
Abstract: We continue the investigation of the central extended Yangian double [S. Khoroshkin, q-alg/9602031]. In this paper we study the intertwining operators for certain infinite dimensional representations of $\Yd$, which are deformed analogs of the highest weight representations of the affine algebra $\aff$ at level 1. We give bosonized expressions for intertwining operators, verify that they generate an algebra isomorphic to Zamolodchikov--Faddeev algebra for the $SU(2)$-invariant Thirring model. We compose from them $L$-operators by Miki's prescription and verify that they coincide with $L$-operators constructed from universal ${\cal R}$-matrix.
