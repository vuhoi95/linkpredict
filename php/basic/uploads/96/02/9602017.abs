Title: Current Algebra and Bosonization in Three Dimensions
Authors: J. C. Le Guillou and C. Núñez and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We consider the fermion-boson mapping in three dimensional space-time, in the Abelian case, from the current algebra point of view. We show that in a path-integral framework one can derive a general bosonization recipe leading, in the bosonic language, to the correct equal-time current commutators of the original free fermionic theory.
