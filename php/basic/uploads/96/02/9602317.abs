Title: One Loop Graviton Self-Energy In A Locally De Sitter Background
Authors: N. C. Tsamis and R. P. Woodard
Abstract: The graviton tadpole has recently been computed at two loops in a locally de Sitter background. We apply intermediate results of this work to exhibit the graviton self-energy at one loop. This quantity is interesting both to check the accuracy of the first calculation and to understand the relaxation effect it reveals. In the former context we show that the self-energy obeys the appropriate Ward identity. We also show that its flat space limit agrees with the flat space result obtained by Capper in what should be the same gauge.
