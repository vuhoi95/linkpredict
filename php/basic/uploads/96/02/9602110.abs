Title: Chiral symmetry breaking in gauged ${\bf NJL}$ model in curved spacetime
Authors: B. Geyer and S. D. Odintsov
Abstract: Using the renormalization group (RG) approach and the equivalency between the class of gauge-Higgs-Yukawa models and the gauged Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model, we study the gauged NJL model in curved space-time. The behaviour of the scalar-gravitational coupling constant $\xi(t)$ in both theories is discussed. The RG improved effective potential of gauged NJL model in curved spacetime is found. The curvature at which chiral symmetry in the gauged NJL model is broken is obtained explicitly in a remarkably simple form. The powerful RG improved effective potential formalizm leads to the same results as ladder Schwinger-Dyson equations which have not been formulated yet in curved spacetime what opens new possibilities in the study of GUTs and NJL-like models in curved spacetime.
