Title: On the Completeness of the Black Hole Singularity in 2d Dilaton Theories
Authors: M. O. Katanaev and W. Kummer and H. Liebl
Abstract: The black hole of the widely used ordinary 2d--dilaton model (DBH) deviates from the Schwarzschild black hole (SBH) of General Relativity in one important feature: Whereas non-null extremals or geodesics show the expected incompleteness this turns out {\it not to be the case for the null extremals}. After a simple analysis in Kruskal coordinates for singularities with power behavior of this -- apparently till now overlooked -- property we discuss the global structure of a large family of generalized dilaton theories which does not only contain the DBH and SBH but also other proposed dilaton theories as special cases. For large ranges of the parameters such theories are found to be free from this defect and exhibit global SBH behavior.
