Title: Progress in One-Loop QCD Computations
Authors: Z. Bern and L. Dixon and D. A. Kosower
Abstract: We review progress in calculating one-loop scattering amplitudes required for next-to-leading-order corrections to QCD processes. The underlying technical developments include the spinor helicity formalism, color decompositions, supersymmetry, string theory, factorization and unitarity. We provide explicit examples illustrating these techniques.
