Title: Wilsonian vs. 1PI renormalization group flow irreversibility
Authors: Jordi Comellas and Jose I. Latorre
Abstract: We present a line of reasoning based on the analysis of scale variations of the Wilsonian partition function and the trace of the stress tensor in a curved manifold which results in a statement of irreversibility of Wilsonian renormalization group flow for unitary theories. We also analyze subtleties related to subtractions in the case of the 1PI effective action flow.
