Title: Small $E_8$ Instantons and Tensionless Non-critical Strings
Authors: Ori J. Ganor and Amihay Hanany
Abstract: T-duality is used to extract information on an instanton of zero size in the $E_8\times E_8$ heterotic string. We discuss the possibility of the appearance of a tensionless anti-self-dual non-critical string through an implementation of the mechanism suggested by Strominger of two coincident 5-branes. It is argued that when an instanton shrinks to zero size a tensionless non-critical string appears at the core of the instanton. It is further conjectured that appearance of tensionless strings in the spectrum leads to new phase transitions in six dimensions in much the same way as massless particles do in four dimensions.
