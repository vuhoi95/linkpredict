Title: Polymer Statistics and Fermionic Vector Models
Authors: Gordon W. Semenoff and Richard J. Szabo
Abstract: We consider a variation of $O(N)$-symmetric vector models in which the vector components are Grassmann numbers. We show that these theories generate the same sort of random polymer models as the $O(N)$ vector models and that they lie in the same universality class in the large-$N$ limit. We explicitly construct the double-scaling limit of the theory and show that the genus expansion is an alternating Borel summable series that otherwise coincides with the topological expansion of the bosonic models. We also show how the fermionic nature of these models leads to an explicit solution even at finite-$N$ for the generating functions of the number of random polymer configurations.
