Authors: Reto Eggenschwiler and David Scialom and Norbert Straumann
Abstract: We study the coupled Einstein-Yang-Mills-Dilaton (EYMD) equations for a Fried\-mann-Le\-mai\-tre universe with constant curvature $k=1$. Our detailed analysis is restricted to the case where the dilaton potential and the cosmological constant vanish. Also assuming a static gauge field, we present analytical and numerical results on the behavior of solutions of the EYMD equations. For different values of the dilaton coupling constant we analyze the phase portrait for the time evolution of the dilaton field and give the behavior of the scale factor. It turns out that there are no inflationary stages in this model.
