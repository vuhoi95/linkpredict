Title: Unravelling the On-shell Constraints of Self-dual Supergravity Theories
Authors: Ch. Devchand and V. Ogievetsky
Abstract: We review a construction, using the harmonic space method, of solutions to the superfield equations of motion for N-extended self-dual supergravity theories. A superspace gauge condition suitable for the performance of a component analysis is discussed.
