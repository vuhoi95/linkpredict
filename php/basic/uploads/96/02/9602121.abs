Title: On the power counting of loop diagrams in general relativity
Authors: J. F. Donoghue and T. Torma
Abstract: A class of loop diagrams in general relativity appears to have a behavior which would upset the utility of the energy expansion for quantum effects. We show through the study of specific diagrams that cancellations occur which restore the expected behaviour of the energy expansion. By considering the power counting in a physical gauge we show that the apparent bad behavior is a gauge artifact, and that the quantum loops enter with a well behaved energy expansion.
