Title: Dimerization and Incommensurate Spiral Spin Correlations in the Zigzag  Spin Chain: Analogies to the Kondo Lattice
Authors: Steven R. White and Ian Affleck
Abstract: Using the density matrix renormalization group and a bosonization approach, we study a spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain with near-neighbor coupling $J_1$ and frustrating second-neighbor coupling $J_2$, particularly in the limit $J_2 >> J_1$. This system exhibits both dimerization and incommensurate spiral spin correlations. We argue that this system is closely related to a doped, spin-gapped phase of the one-dimensional Kondo lattice.
