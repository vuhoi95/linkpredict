Title: Liouville Vortex And $\varphi^{4}$ Kink Solutions Of The Seiberg--Witten  Equations
Authors: Serdar Nergiz and Cihan Saclioglu
Abstract: The Seiberg--Witten equations, when dimensionally reduced to $\bf R^{2}\mit$, naturally yield the Liouville equation, whose solutions are parametrized by an arbitrary analytic function $g(z)$. The magnetic flux $\Phi$ is the integral of a singular Kaehler form involving $g(z)$; for an appropriate choice of $g(z)$ , $N$ coaxial or separated vortex configurations with $\Phi=\frac{2\pi N}{e}$ are obtained when the integral is regularized. The regularized connection in the $\bf R^{1}\mit$ case coincides with the kink solution of $\varphi^{4}$ theory.
