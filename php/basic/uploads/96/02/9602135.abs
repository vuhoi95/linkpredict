Title: Entropy and Temperature of Black 3-Branes
Authors: S. S. Gubser and I. R. Klebanov and A. W. Peet
Abstract: We consider slightly non-extremal black 3-branes of type IIB supergravity and show that their Bekenstein-Hawking entropy agrees, up to a mysterious factor, with an entropy derived by counting non-BPS excitations of the Dirichlet 3-brane. These excitations are described in terms of the statistical mechanics of a 3+1 dimensional gas of massless open string states. This is essentially the classic problem of blackbody radiation. The blackbody temperature is related to the temperature of the Hawking radiation. We also construct a solution of type IIB supergravity describing a 3-brane with a finite density of longitudinal momentum. For extremal momentum-carrying 3-branes the horizon area vanishes. This is in agreement with the fact that the BPS entropy of the momentum-carrying Dirichlet 3-branes is not an extensive quantity.
