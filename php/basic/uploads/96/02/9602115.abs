Title: On Finite 4D Quantum Field Theory in Non-Commutative Geometry
Authors: H. Grosse and C. Klimcik and P. Presnajder
Abstract: The truncated 4-dimensional sphere $S^4$ and the action of the self-interacting scalar field on it are constructed. The path integral quantization is performed while simultaneously keeping the SO(5) symmetry and the finite number of degrees of freedom. The usual field theory UV-divergences are manifestly absent.
