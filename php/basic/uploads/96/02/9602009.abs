Title: Homotopy Gerstenhaber algebras and topological field theory
Authors: Takashi Kimura and Alexander A. Voronov and Gregg J. Zuckerman
Abstract: We prove that the BRST complex of a topological conformal field theory is a homotopy Gerstenhaber algebra, as conjectured by Lian and Zuckerman in 1992. We also suggest a refinement of the original conjecture for topological vertex operator algebras. We illustrate the usefulness of our main tools, operads and "string vertices" by obtaining new results on Vassiliev invariants of knots and double loop spaces.
