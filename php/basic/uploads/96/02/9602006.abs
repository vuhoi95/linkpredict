Title: Theta Vacua in the Light-Cone Schwinger Model
Authors: Alex C. Kalloniatis and David G. Robertson
Abstract: We discuss the bosonized Schwinger model in light-cone quantization, using discretization as an infrared regulator. We consider both the light-cone Coulomb gauge, in which all gauge freedom can be removed and a physical Hilbert space employed, and the light-cone Weyl (temporal) gauge, in which the Hilbert space is unphysical and a Gauss law operator is used to select a physical subspace. We describe the different ways in which the theta vacuum is manifested depending on this choice of gauge, and compute the theta-dependence of the chiral condensate in each case.
