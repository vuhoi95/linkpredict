Title: Generalized Killing equations and Taub-NUT spinning space
Authors: Diana Vaman and Mihai Visinescu
Abstract: The generalized Killing equations for the configuration space of spinning particles (spinning space) are analysed. Simple solutions of the homogeneous part of these equations are expressed in terms of Killing-Yano tensors. The general results are applied to the case of the four-dimensional euclidean Taub-NUT manifold.
