Title: Quaternionic Formulation of the Exact Parity Model
Authors: S. P. Brumby and R. Foot and R. R. Volkas
Abstract: The exact parity model (EPM) is a simple extension of the Standard Model which reinstates parity invariance as an unbroken symmetry of nature. The mirror matter sector of the model can interact with ordinary matter through gauge boson mixing, Higgs boson mixing and, if neutrinos are massive, through neutrino mixing. The last effect has experimental support through the observed solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies. In this paper we show that the exact parity model can be formulated in a quaternionic framework. This suggests that the idea of mirror matter and exact parity may have profound implications for the mathematical formulation of quantum theory.
