Title: Scaling of Selfavoiding Tethered Membranes: 2-Loop Renormalization Group  Results
Authors: Francois David and Kay J. Wiese
Abstract: The scaling properties of selfavoiding polymerized membranes are studied using renormalization group methods. The scaling exponent \nu is calculated for the first time at two loop order. \nu is found to agree with the Gaussian variational estimate for large space dimension d and to be close to the Flory estimate for d=3.
