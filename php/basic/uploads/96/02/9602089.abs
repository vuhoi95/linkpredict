Title: Heat-kernels and functional determinants on the generalized cone
Authors: M. Bordag and K. Kirsten and J. S. Dowker
Abstract: We consider zeta functions and heat-kernel expansions on the bounded, generalized cone in arbitrary dimensions using an improved calculational technique. The specific case of a global monopole is analysed in detail and some restrictions thereby placed on the $A_{5/2}$ coefficient. The computation of functional determinants is also addressed. General formulas are given and known results are incidentally, and rapidly, reproduced.
