Title: Extension of the Virasoro and Neveu-Schwartz algebras and generalized  Sturm-Liouville operators
Authors: P. Marcel and V. Ovsienko and C. Roger
Abstract: We consider the universal central extension of the Lie algebra $\Vect (S^1)${\math \s}$ C^{\infty}(S^1)$. The coadjoint representation of this Lie algebra has a natural geometric interpretation by matrix analogues of the Sturm-Liouville operators. This approach leads to new Lie superalgebras generalizing the well-known Neveu-Schwartz algebra.
