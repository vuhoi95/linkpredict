Title: GKZ Hypergeometric Systems and Applications to Mirror Symmetry
Authors: S. Hosono and B. H. Lian
Abstract: We analyze GKZ(Gel'fand, Kapranov and Zelevinski) hypergeometric systems and apply them to study the quantum cohomology rings of Calabi-Yau manifolds. We will relate properties of the local solutions near the large radius limit to the intersection rings of a toric variety and of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface.
