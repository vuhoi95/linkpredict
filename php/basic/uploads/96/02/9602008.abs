Title: Polynomial Algebras and Higher Spins
Authors: M. Chaichian and A. P. Demichev
Abstract: Polynomial relations for generators of $su(2)$ Lie algebra in arbitrary representations are found. They generalize usual relation for Pauli operators in spin 1/2 case and permit to construct modified Holstein-Primakoff transformations in finite dimensional Fock spaces. The connection between $su(2)$ Lie algebra and q-oscillators with a root of unity q-parameter is considered. The meaning of the polynomial relations from the point of view of quantum mechanics on a sphere are discussed.
