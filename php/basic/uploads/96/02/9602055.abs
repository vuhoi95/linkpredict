Title: Renormalization constants from string theory
Authors: Paolo Di Vecchia and Alberto Lerda and Lorenzo Magnea and Raffaele Marotta and Rodolfo Russo
Abstract: We review some recent results on the calculation of renormalization constants in Yang-Mills theory using open bosonic strings. The technology of string amplitudes, supplemented with an appropriate continuation off the mass shell, can be used to compute the ultraviolet divergences of dimensionally regularized gauge theories. The results show that the infinite tension limit of string amplitudes corresponds to the background field method in field theory.
