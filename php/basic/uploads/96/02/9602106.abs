Title: Comment on ``New pseudoclassical model for Weyl particles"
Authors: Jose L. Cortes and Mikhail S. Plyushchay
Abstract: It is demonstrated that the recently proposed pseudoclassical model for Weyl particles [1] (D.M. Gitman, A.E. Goncalves and I.V. Tyutin, Phys. Rev. D 50 (1994) 5439) is classically inconsistent. A possible way of removing the classical inconsistency of the model is proposed.
