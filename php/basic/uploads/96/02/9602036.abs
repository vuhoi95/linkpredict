Title: On the symplectic structures arising in Optics
Authors: Jose F. Cari√±ena and J. Nasarre
Abstract: Geometric optics is analysed using the techniques of Presymplectic Geometry. We obtain the symplectic structure of the space of light rays in a medium of a non constant refractive index by reduction from a presymplectic structure, and using adapted coordinates, we find Darboux coordinates. The theory is illustrated with some examples and we point out some simple physical applications
