Title: Gauge Coupling Constant Unification With Planck Scale Values Of Moduli
Authors: D. Bailin and A. Love and W. A. Sabra and S. Thomas
Abstract: Convergence of the standard model gauge coupling constants to a common value at around $2\times 10^{16}$ GeV is studied in the context of orbifold theories where the modular symmetry groups for $T$ and $U$ moduli are broken to subgroups of $PSL(2, Z)$. The values of the moduli required for this unification of coupling constants are studied for this case and also for the case where string unification is accompanied by unification to a gauge group larger then $SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1).$
