Title: Supersymmetry and Noncommutative Geometry
Authors: W. Kalau and M. Walze
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to apply the concept of the spectral triple, the starting point for the analysis of noncommutative spaces in the sense of A.~Connes, to the case where the algebra $\cA$ contains both bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. The operator $\cD$ of the spectral triple under consideration is the square root of the Dirac operator und thus the forms of the generalized differential algebra constructed out of the spectral triple are in a representation of the Lorentz group with integer spin if the form degree is even and they are in a representation with half-integer spin if the form degree is odd. However, we find that the 2-forms, obtained by squaring the connection, contains exactly the components of the vector multiplet representation of the supersymmetry algebra. This allows to construct an action for supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in the framework of noncommutative geometry.
