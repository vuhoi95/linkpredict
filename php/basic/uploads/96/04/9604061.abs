Authors: P. M. Lavrov and S. D. Odintsov and A. A. Reshetnyak
Abstract: The gauge dependence of the effective action of composite fields for general gauge theories in the framework of the quantization method by Batalin, Lavrov and Tyutin is studied. The corresponding Ward identities are obtained. The variation of composite fields effective action is found in terms of new set of operators depending on composite field. The theorem of the on-shell gauge fixing independence for the effective action of composite fields in such formalism is proved. brief discussion of gravitational-vector induced interaction for Maxwell theory with composite fields is given.
