Title: On quantum model of supergravity compensator
Authors: I. L. Buchbinder and A. Yu. Petrov
Abstract: A new $N=1$ superfield model in $D=4$ flat superspace is suggested. This model describes dynamics of chiral compensator and can be treated as a low-energy limit of $D=4$, $N=1$ quantum superfield supergravity. Renormalization structure of this model is studied and one-loop counterterms are calculated. It is shown that the theory is infrared free. An effective action for the model under consideration is investigated in infrared domain. The lower contributions to the one-loop effective action are computed in explicit form.
