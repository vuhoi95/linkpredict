Title: Comment on Path Integral Derivation of Schr√∂dinger Equation in Spaces  with Curvature and Torsion
Authors: P. Fiziev and H. Kleinert
Abstract: We present a derivation of the Schr\"odinger equation for a path integral of a point particle in a space with curvature and torsion which is considerably shorter and more elegant than what is commonly found in the literature.
