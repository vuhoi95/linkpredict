Title: On the integrable geometry of soliton equations and N=2 supersymmetric  gauge theories
Authors: I. M. Krichever and D. H. Phong
Abstract: We provide a unified construction of the symplectic forms which arise in the solution of both N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories and soliton equations. Their phase spaces are Jacobian-type bundles over the leaves of a foliation in a universal configuration space. On one hand, imbedded into finite-gap solutions of soliton equations, these symplectic forms assume explicit expressions in terms of the auxiliary Lax pair, expressions which generalize the well-known Gardner-Faddeev-Zakharov bracket for KdV to a vast class of 2D integrable models; on the other hand, they determine completely the effective Lagrangian and BPS spectrum when the leaves are identified with the moduli space of vacua of an N=2 supersymmetric gauge theory. For SU($N_c$) with $N_f\leq N_c+1$ flavors, the spectral curves we obtain this way agree with the ones derived by Hanany and Oz and others from physical considerations.
