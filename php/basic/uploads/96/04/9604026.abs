Abstract: We consider the possibility of discriminating different theories of gravity using a recently proposed gravitational wave detector of spherical shape. We argue that the spin content of different theories can be extracted relating the measurements of the excited spheroidal vibrational eigenmodes to the Newman-Penrose parameters. The sphere toroidal modes cannot be excited by any metric GW and can be thus used as a veto.
