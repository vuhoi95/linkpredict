Title: Strings on Orientifolds
Authors: Atish Dabholkar and Jaemo Park
Abstract: We construct several examples of compactification of Type IIB theory on orientifolds and discuss their duals. In six dimensions we obtain models with $N=1$ supersymmetry, multiple tensor multiplets, and different gauge groups. In nine dimensions we obtain a model that is dual to M-theory compactified on a Klein bottle.
