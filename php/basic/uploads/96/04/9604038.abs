Title: A Negative Mode About Euclidean Wormhole
Authors: V. A. Rubakov and O. Yu. Shvedov
Abstract: Wormholes -- solutions to the euclidean Einstein equations with non-trivial topology -- are usually assumed to make real contributions to amplitudes in quantum gravity. However, we find a negative mode among fluctuations about the Giddings-Strominger wormhole solution. Hence, the wormhole contribution to the euclidean functional integral is argued to be purely imaginary rather than real, which suggests the interpretation of the wormhole as describing the instability of a large universe against the emission of baby universes.
