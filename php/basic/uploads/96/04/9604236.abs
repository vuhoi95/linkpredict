Abstract: We present a model based on the gauge group SU(2)$_L\times$SU(2)$_R\times$SU(4)$_C$ with gauge couplings that are found to be unified at a scale $M_G$ near the string unification scale. The model breaks to the minimal supersymmetric standard model at a scale $M_I\sim 10^{12}$ GeV, which is instrumental in producing a neutrino in a mass range that can serve as hot dark matter and this scale can also solve the strong CP problem via Peccei-Quinn (PQ) mechanism with an invisible harmless invisible axion. We show how this model can accommodate low and high values of $\tan\beta$ and ``exotic" representations that often occur in string derived models. We show that this model has lepton flavor violation which can lead to processes which are one or two orders of magnitude below the current experimental limits.
