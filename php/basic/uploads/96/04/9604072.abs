Title: One parameter family of an integrable $spl(2|1)$ vertex model :  Algebraic Bethe ansatz approach and ground state structure
Authors: P. B. Ramos and M. J. Martins
Abstract: We formulate in terms of the quantum inverse scattering method the exact solution of a $spl(2|1)$ invariant vertex model recently introduced in the literature. The corresponding transfer matrix is diagonalized by using the algebraic (nested) Bethe ansatz approach. The ground state structure is investigated and we argue that a Pokrovsky-Talapov transition is favored for certain value of the 4-dimensional $spl(2|1)$ parameter.
