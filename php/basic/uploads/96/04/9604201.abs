Title: Magnetic Charge in a Nonassociative Field Theory
Authors: C. C. Lassig and G. C. Joshi
Abstract: The violation of the Jacobi identity by the presence of magnetic charge is accomodated by using an explicitly nonassociative theory of octonionic fields. It is found that the dynamics of this theory is simplified if the Lagrangian contains only dyonic charges, but certain problems in the constrained quantisation remain. The extension of these concepts to string theory may however resolve these difficulties.
