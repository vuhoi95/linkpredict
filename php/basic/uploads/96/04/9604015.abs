Title: A Higher-level Bailey Lemma
Authors: Anne Schilling and S. Ole Warnaar
Abstract: We propose a generalization of Bailey's lemma, useful for proving $q$-series identities. As an application, generalizations of Euler's identity, the Rogers-Ramanujan identities, and the Andrews-Gordon identities are derived. This generalized Bailey lemma also allows one to derive identities for the branching functions of higher-level $A^{(1)}_1$ cosets.
