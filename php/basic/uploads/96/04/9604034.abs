Abstract: We show how the Riemann surface $\Sigma$ of $N=2$ Yang-Mills field theory arises in type II string compactifications on Calabi-Yau threefolds. The relevant local geometry is given by fibrations of ALE spaces. The $3$-branes that give rise to BPS multiplets in the string descend to self-dual strings on the Riemann surface, with tension determined by a canonically fixed Seiberg-Witten differential $\lambda$. This gives, effectively, a dual formulation of Yang-Mills theory in which gauge bosons and monopoles are treated on equal footing, and represents the rigid analog of type II-heterotic string duality. The existence of BPS states is essentially reduced to a geodesic problem on the Riemann surface with metric $|\lambda|^2$. This allows us, in particular, to easily determine the spectrum of {\it stable} BPS states in field theory. Moreover, we identify the six-dimensional space $\IR^4\times \Sigma$ as the world-volume of a five-brane and show that BPS states correspond to two-branes ending on this five-brane.
