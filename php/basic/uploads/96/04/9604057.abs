Title: Integrability, Jacobians and Calabi-Yau Threefolds
Authors: C. Gomez and R. Hernandez and E. Lopez
Abstract: The integrable systems associated with Seiberg-Witten geometry are considered both from the Hitchin-Donagi-Witten gauge model and in terms of intermediate Jacobians of Calabi-Yau threefolds. Dual pairs and enhancement of gauge symmetries are discussed on the basis of a map from the Donagi-Witten ``moduli'' into the moduli of complex structures of the Calabi-Yau threefold.
