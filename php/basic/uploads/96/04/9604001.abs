Title: C-theorem for two dimensional chiral theories
Authors: Fiorenzo Bastianelli and Ulf Lindstrom
Abstract: We discuss an extension of the $C$-theorem to chiral theories. We show that two monotonically decreasing $C$-functions can be introduced. However, their difference is a constant of the renormalization group flow. This constant reproduces the 't Hooft anomaly matching conditions.
