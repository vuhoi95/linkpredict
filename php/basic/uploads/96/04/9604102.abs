Title: Real Lie Algebras of Differential Operators and Quasi-Exactly Solvable  Potentials
Authors: Artemio Gonzalez-Lopez and Niky Kamran and Peter J. Olver
Abstract: We first establish some general results connecting real and complex Lie algebras of first-order differential operators. These are applied to completely classify all finite-dimensional real Lie algebras of first-order differential operators in $R^2$. Furthermore, we find all algebras which are quasi-exactly solvable, along with the associated finite-dimensional modules of analytic functions. The resulting real Lie algebras are used to construct new quasi-exactly solvable Schroedinger operators on $R^2$.
