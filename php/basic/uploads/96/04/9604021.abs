Title: Asymptotic Limits and Sum Rules for the Quark Propagator
Authors: Reinhard Oehme and Wentao Xu
Abstract: For the structure functions of the quark propagator, the asymptotic behavior is obtained for general, linear, covariant gauges, and in all directions of the complex $k^2$-plane. Asymptotic freedom is assumed. Corresponding previous results for the gauge field propagator are important in the derivation. Except for coefficients, the leading asymptotic terms are determined by one-loop or by two-loop information, and are gauge independent. Various sum rules are derived.
