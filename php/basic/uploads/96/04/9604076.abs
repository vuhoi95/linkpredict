Title: Effective Field Theory of pure Gravity and the Renormalization Group
Authors: Mario Atance and Jose Luis Cortes
Abstract: The general structure of the renormalization group equations for the low energy effective field theory formulation of pure gravity is presented. The solution of these equations takes a particular simple form if the mass scale of the effective theory is much smaller than the Planck mass (a possibility compatible with the renormalization of the effective theory). A theory with just one free renormalized parameter is obtained when contributions suppressed by inverse powers of the Planck mass are neglected.
