Title: Conformal Solutions Of Duality Invariant 2D Magnetohydrodynamic  Turbulence
Authors: O. Coceal and W. A. Sabra and S. Thomas
Abstract: We consider possible conformal field theory (CFT) descriptions of the various inertial ranges that exist in $2d$ duality invariant Magnetohydrodynamics. Such models arise as effective theories of dyonic plasmas in 3 dimensions in which all fields are independent of the third coordinate. We find new constraints on the allowed CFT's compared to those that may describe turbulence in $2d$ plasmas of electric charges only. The predictions from CFT concerning equipartition of energy amongst the electric and magnetic fields are discussed, and quantities exhibiting universal scaling are derived.
