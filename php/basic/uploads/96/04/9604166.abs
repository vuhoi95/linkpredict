Title: Intersecting M-branes as Four-Dimensional Black Holes
Authors: I. R. Klebanov and A. A. Tseytlin
Abstract: We present two 1/8 supersymmetric intersecting p-brane solutions of 11-dimensional supergravity which upon compactification to four dimensions reduce to extremal dyonic black holes with finite area of horizon. The first solution is a configuration of three intersecting 5-branes with an extra momentum flow along the common string. The second describes a system of two 2-branes and two 5-branes. Related (by compactification and T-duality) solution of type IIB theory corresponds to a completely symmetric configuration of four intersecting 3-branes. We suggest methods for counting the BPS degeneracy of three intersecting 5-branes which, in the macroscopic limit, reproduce the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
