Abstract: Representations of the quantum q-oscillator algebra are studied with particular attention to local Hamiltonian representations of the Schroedinger type. In contrast to the standard harmonic oscillators such systems exhibit a continuous spectrum. The general scheme of realization of the q-oscillator algebra on the space of wave functions for a one-dimensional Schroedinger Hamiltonian shows the existence of non-Fock irreducible representations associated to the continuous part of the spectrum and directly related to the deformation. An algorithm for the mapping of energy levels is described.
