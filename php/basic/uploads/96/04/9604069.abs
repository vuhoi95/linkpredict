Title: Effective Theory for Parity Conserving $QED_3$
Authors: I. J. R. Aitchison and C. D. Fosco and F. D. Mazzitelli
Abstract: We consider a higher derivative effective theory for an Abelian gauge field in three dimensions, which represents the result of integrating out heavy matter fields interacting with a classical gauge field in a parity-conserving way. We retain terms containing up to two derivatives of $F_{\mu\nu}$, but make no assumption about the strength of this field. We then quantize the gauge field, and compute the one-loop effective action for a constant $\fmn$. The result is explicitly evaluated for the case of a constant magnetic field.
