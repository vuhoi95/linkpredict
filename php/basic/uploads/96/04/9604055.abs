Title: Conserved masses in GHS Einstein and string black holes
Authors: K. C. K. Chan and J. D. E. Creighton and R. B. Mann
Abstract: We analyze the relationship between quasilocal masses calculated for solutions of conformally related theories. We show that the ADM mass of a static, spherically symmetric solution is conformally invariant (up to a constant factor) only if the background action functional is conformally invariant. Thus, the requirement of conformal invariance places restrictions on the choice of reference spacetimes. We calculate the mass of the black hole solutions obtained by Garfinkle, Horowitz, and Strominger (GHS) for both the string and the Einstein metrics. In addition, the quasilocal thermodynamic quantities in the string metrics are computed and discussed.
