Title: Dual N=2 SUSY Breaking
Authors: I. Antoniadis and T. R. Taylor
Abstract: We discuss spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in $N=2$ globally supersymmetric theories describing abelian vector multiplets. The most general form of the action admits, in addition to the usual Fayet-Iliopoulos term, a magnetic Fayet-Iliopoulos term for the auxiliary components of dual vector multiplets. In a generic case, this leads to a spontaneous breakdown of one of the two supersymmetries. In some cases however, dyon condensation restores $N=2$ SUSY vacuum. This talk is based on the work done in collaboration with H. Partouche \cite{apt}.
