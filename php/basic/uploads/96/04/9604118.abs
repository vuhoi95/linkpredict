Title: Conical geometry and quantum entropy of a charged Kerr black hole
Authors: Robert B. Mann and Sergey N. Solodukhin
Abstract: We apply the method of conical singularities to calculate the tree-level entropy and its one-loop quantum corrections for a charged Kerr black hole. The Euclidean geometry for the Kerr-Newman metric is considered. We show that for an arbitrary periodization in Euclidean space there exists a conical singularity at the horizon. Its $\delta$-function like curvatures are calculated and are shown to behave similar to the static case. The heat kernel expansion for a scalar field on this conical space background is derived and the (divergent) quantum correction to the entropy is obtained. It is argued that these divergences can be removed by renormalization of couplings in the tree-level gravitational action in a manner similar to that for a static black hole.
