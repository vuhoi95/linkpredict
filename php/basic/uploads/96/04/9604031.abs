Title: More on Generalized Heisenberg Ferromagnet Models
Authors: Phillial Oh and Q-Han Park
Abstract: We generalize the integrable Heisenberg ferromagnet model according to each Hermitian symmetric spaces and address various new aspects of the generalized model. Using the first order formalism of generalized spins which are defined on the coadjoint orbits of arbitrary groups, we construct a Lagrangian of the generalized model from which we obtain the Hamiltonian structure explicitly in the case of $CP(N-1)$ orbit. The gauge equivalence between the generalized Heisenberg ferromagnet and the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger models is given. Using the equivalence, we find infinitely many conserved integrals of both models.
