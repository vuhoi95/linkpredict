Title: The Noncommutative Constraints on the Standard Model Ã  la Connes
Authors: Lionel Carminati and Bruno Iochum and Thomas Schucker
Abstract: Noncommutative geometry applied to the standard model of electroweak and strong interactions was shown to produce fuzzy relations among masses and gauge couplings. We refine these relations and show then that they are exhaustive.
