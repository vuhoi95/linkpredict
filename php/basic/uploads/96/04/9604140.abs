Title: Exploring the Moduli Space of (0,2) Strings
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Andreas Wisskirchen
Abstract: We use an exactly solvable (0,2) supersymmetric conformal field theory with gauge group SO(10) to investigate the superpotential of the corresponding classical string vacuum. We provide evidence that the rational point lies in the Landau-Ginzburg phase of the linear sigma-model and calculate exactly all three- and four-point functions of the gauge singlets. These couplings already put severe constraints on the possible flat directions of the superpotential. Finally, we contemplate about the flat direction related to Kahler deformations of the underlying linear sigma-model.
