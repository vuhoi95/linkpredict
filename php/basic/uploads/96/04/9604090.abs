Title: Supergravity Domain Walls
Authors: Mirjam Cvetic and Harald H. Soleng
Abstract: We review the status of domain walls in $N=1$ supergravity theories for both the vacuum domain walls as well as dilatonic domain walls. We concentrate on a systematic analysis of the nature of the space-time in such domain wall backgrounds and the special role that supersymmetry is playing in determining the nature of such configurations.
