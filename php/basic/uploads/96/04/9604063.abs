Title: Screening in Two-dimensional QCD
Authors: E. Abdalla and R. Mohayaee and A. Zadra
Abstract: We discuss the issue of screening and confinement of external colour charges in bosonised two-dimensional quantum chromodynamics. Our computation relies on the static solutions of the semi-classical equations of motion. The significance of the different representations of the matter field is explicitly studied. We arrive at the conclusion that the screening phase prevails, even in the presence of a small mass term for the fermions. To confirm this result further, we outline the construction of operators corresponding to screened quarks.
