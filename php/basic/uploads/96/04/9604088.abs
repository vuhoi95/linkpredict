Title: BRST Cohomology of the Superstring in Super-Beltrami Parametrization
Authors: Liviu TÄƒtaru and Ion V. Vancea
Abstract: A method for the calculation of the BRST cohomology, recently developed for 2D gravity theory and the bosonic string in the Beltrami parametrization,is generalised to the superstring theories quantized in super-Beltrami parametrization.
