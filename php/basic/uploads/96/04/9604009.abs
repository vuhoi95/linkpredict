Authors: R. Caracciolo and M. Frau and A. Lerda and S. Sciuto and G. R. Zemba
Abstract: We describe the recently introduced method of Algebraic Bosonization of (1+1)-dimensional fermionic systems by discussing the specific case of the Calogero-Sutherland model. A comparison with the Bethe Ansatz results is also presented.
