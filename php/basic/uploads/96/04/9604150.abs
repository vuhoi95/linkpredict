Title: Strong Coupling Quantum Gravity and Physics beyond the Planck Scale
Authors: Kayoko Maeda and Makoto Sakamoto
Abstract: We propose a renormalization prescription for the Wheeler-DeWitt equation of (3+1)-dimensional Einstein gravity and also propose a strong coupling expansion as an approximation scheme to probe quantum geometry at length scales much smaller than the Planck length. We solve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation to the second order in the expansion in a class of local solutions and discuss problems arising in our approach.
