Title: On D-Branes and Black Holes in Four Dimensions
Authors: Vijay Balasubramanian and Finn Larsen
Abstract: We find extremal four dimensional black holes with finite area constructed entirely from intersecting D-branes. We argue that the microscopic degeneracy of these configurations agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula. The absence of solitonic objects in these configurations may make them useful for dynamical studies of black holes.
