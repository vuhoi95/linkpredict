Title: Logarithmic Operators in Conformal Field Theory and The  $\W_\infty$-algebra
Authors: A. Shafiekhani and M. R. Rahimi Tabar
Abstract: It is shown explicitly that the correlation functions of Conformal Field Theories (CFT) with the logarithmic operators are invariant under the differential realization of Borel subalgebra of $\W_\infty$-algebra. This algebra is constructed by tensor-operator algebra of differential representation of ordinary $sl(2,C)$. This method allows us to write differential equations which can be used to find general expression for three and four-point correlation functions possessing logarithmic operators. The operator product expansion (OPE) coefficients of general logarithmic CFT are given up to third level.
