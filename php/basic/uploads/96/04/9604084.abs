Title: Peak and end point of the relic graviton background in string cosmology
Authors: R. Brustein and M. Gasperini and G. Veneziano
Abstract: Using general arguments we determine the allowed region for the end point frequency and the peak energy density of the stochastic background of gravity waves expected in string cosmology. We provide an accurate estimate of the minimal experimental sensitivity required to detect a signal in the Hz to GHz range.
