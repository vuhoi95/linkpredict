Title: Anomalous thresholds and edge singularities in Electrical Impedance  Tomography
Authors: S. Ciulli and S. Ispas and M. K. Pidcock
Abstract: Studies of models of current flow behaviour in Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) have shown that the current density distribution varies extremely rapidly near the edge of the electrodes used in the technique. This behaviour imposes severe restrictions on the numerical techniques used in image reconstruction algorithms. In this paper we have considered a simple two dimensional case and we have shown how the theory of end point/pinch singularities which was developed for studying the anomalous thresholds encountered in elementary particle physics can be used to give a complete description of the analytic structure of the current density near to the edge of the electrodes. As a byproduct of this study it was possible to give a complete description of the Riemann sheet manifold of the eigenfunctions of the logarithmic kernel. These methods can be readily extended to other weakly singular kernels.
