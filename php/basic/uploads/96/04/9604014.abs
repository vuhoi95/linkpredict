Title: Collective coordinates for D-branes
Authors: Willy Fischler and Sonia Paban and Moshe Rozali
Abstract: We develope a formalism for the scattering off D-branes that includes collective coordinates. This allows a systematic expansion in the string coupling constant for such processes, including a worldsheet calculation for the D-brane's mass.
