Title: All-order Finiteness in N=1 SYM Theories: Criteria and Applications
Authors: C. Lucchesi and G. Zoupanos
Abstract: As a motivation, we first recall the possible connection of electric-magnetic duality to finiteness in N=1 super-Yang-Mills theories (SYM). Then, we present the criterion for all-order finiteness (i.e., vanishing of the beta-functions at all orders) in N=1 SYM. Finally, we apply this finiteness criterion to an SU(5) SGUT. The latter turns out to be all-order finite if one imposes additional symmetries.
