Title: Duality and Massive Gauge Invariant Theories
Authors: E. Harikumar and M. Sivakumar
Abstract: Two different massive gauge invariant spin-one theories in $3+1$ dimensions, one Stuckelberg formulation and the other `$B^{\wedge}F$' theory, with Kalb-Ramond field are shown to be related by duality. This is demonstrated by gauging the global symmetry in the model and constraining the corresponding dual field strength to be zero by a Lagrange multiplier, which becomes a field in the dual theory. Implication of this equivalence to the $5$ dimensional theories from which these theories can be obtained is discussed. The self-dual Deser-Jackiw model in $2+1$ dimensions, is also shown to result by applying this procedure to Maxwell-Chern-Simon theory.
