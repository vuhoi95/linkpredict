Title: The One Loop Effective Super-Potential and Non-Holomorphicity
Authors: Austin Pickering and Peter West
Abstract: We calculate the Kahlerian and the lowest order non-Kahlerian contributions to the one loop effective superpotential using super-Feynman graphs in the massless Wess-Zumino Model, the massive Wess-Zumino Model and N=1, U(1) gauge theory. We also calculate the Kahlerian term in Yang-Mills Theory for a general gauge group. Using this latter result we find the one loop Kahlerian contribution for N=2 Yang-Mills Theory in terms of N=1 superfields and we show that it can only come from non-holomorphic contributions to the N=2 effective potential.
