Title: Differential calculus on `non-standard' ($h$-deformed) Minkowski spaces
Authors: J. A. de Azc√°rraga and F. Rodenas
Abstract: The differential calculus on `non-standard' $h$-Minkowski spaces is given. In particular it is shown that, for them, it is possible to introduce coordinates and derivatives which are simultaneously hermitian.
