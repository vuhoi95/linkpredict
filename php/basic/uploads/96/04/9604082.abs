Title: Algebraic Bethe Ansatz for gl(2,1) Invariant 36-Vertex Models
Authors: Markus P. Pfannm√ºller and Holger Frahm
Abstract: Four dimensional irreducible representations of the superalgebra gl(2,1) carry a free parameter. We compute the spectra of the corresponding transfer matrices by means of the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz together with a generalized fusion procedure.
