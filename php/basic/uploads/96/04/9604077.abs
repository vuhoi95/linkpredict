Title: Topological Amplitudes in Heterotic Superstring Theory
Authors: I. Antoniadis and E. Gava and K. S. Narain and T. R. Taylor
Abstract: We show that certain heterotic string amplitudes are given in terms of correlators of the twisted topological (2,0) SCFT, corresponding to the internal sector of the N=1 spacetime supersymmetric background. The genus g topological partition function $F^g$ corresponds to a term in the effective action of the form $W^{2g}$, where W is the gauge or gravitational superfield. We study also recursion relations related to holomorphic anomalies, showing that, contrary to the type II case, they involve correlators of anti-chiral superfields. The corresponding terms in the effective action are of the form $W^{2g}\Pi^n$, where $\Pi$ is a chiral superfield obtained by chiral projection of a general superfield. We observe that the structure of the recursion relations is that of N=1 spacetime supersymmetry Ward identity. We give also a solution of the tree level recursion relations and discuss orbifold examples.
