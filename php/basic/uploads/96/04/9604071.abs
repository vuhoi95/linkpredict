Title: Sp(4,R)/GL(2,R) Matrix Structure of Geodesic Solutions for  Einstein--Maxwell--Dilaton--Axion Theory
Authors: O. Kechkin and M. Yurova
Abstract: The constructed $Sp(4,R)/GL(2,R)$ matrix operator defines the family of isotropic geodesic containing vacuum point lines in the target space of the stationary D=4 Einstein--Maxwell--dilaton--axion theory. This operator is used to derive a class of solutions which describes a point center system with nontrivial values of mass, parameter NUT, as well as electric, magnetic, dilaton and axion charges. It is shown that this class contains both particular solutions Majumdar--Papapetrou--like black holes and massless asymptotically nonflat naked singularities.
