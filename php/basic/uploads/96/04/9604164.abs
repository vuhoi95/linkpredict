Title: Compactification of $M$-Theory to Two Dimensions
Authors: Alok Kumar and Koushik Ray
Abstract: Compactifications of M-theory to two dimensional space-time on ${(K3\times \T^5)}/ \Z_2$ and ${(K3\times K3\times \S^1)}/ \Z_2$ orientifolds are presented. These orientifolds provide examples of anomaly free chiral supergravity models in two dimensions with (8, 0) and (4, 0) supersymmetries. Anomaly free spectra at the enhanced symmetry points are also obtained. The results confirm the twisted sector contribution to the spectrum in the case of $\T^9/ \Z_2$ discussed earlier.
