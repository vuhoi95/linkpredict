Title: Comments on the Links between su(3) Modular Invariants, Simple Factors  in the Jacobian of Fermat Curves, and Rational Triangular Billiards
Authors: M. Bauer and A. Coste and C. Itzykson and P. Ruelle
Abstract: We examine the proposal made recently that the su(3) modular invariant partition functions could be related to the geometry of the complex Fermat curves. Although a number of coincidences and similarities emerge between them and certain algebraic curves related to triangular billiards, their meaning remains obscure. In an attempt to go beyond the su(3) case, we show that any rational conformal field theory determines canonically a Riemann surface.
