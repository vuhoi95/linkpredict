Title: Monopole-Bubble in Early Universe
Authors: Yoonbai Kim and Kei-ichi Maeda and Nobuyuki Sakai
Abstract: The nucleation and evolution of bubbles are investigated in the model of an $O(3)$-symmetric scalar field coupled to gravity in the high temperature limit. It is shown that, in addition to the well-known bubble of which the inside region is true vacuum, there exists another decay channel at high temperature which is described by a new solution such that a false vacuum region like a global monopole remains at the center of a bubble. The value of the Euclidean action of this bubble is higher than that of the ordinary bubble; however, the production rate of it can be considerable for a certain range of scalar potentials.
