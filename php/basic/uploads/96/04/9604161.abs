Title: Perturbative versus Non-perturbative QFT -- Lessons from the O(3) NLS  Model
Authors: J. Balog and M. Niedermaier and T. Hauer
Abstract: The two-point functions of the energy-momentum tensor and the Noether current are used to probe the O(3) nonlinear sigma model in an energy range below 10^4 in units of the mass gap $m$. We argue that the form factor approach, with the form factor series trunctated at the 6-particle level, provides an almost exact solution of the model in this energy range. The onset of the (2-loop) perturbative regime is found to occur only at energies around $100m$.
