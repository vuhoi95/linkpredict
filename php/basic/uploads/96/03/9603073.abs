Title: Picard-Fuchs Equations and Prepotentials in $N=2$ Supersymmetric QCD
Authors: Katsushi Ito and Sung-Kil Yang
Abstract: The Picard-Fuchs equations for $N=2$ supersymmetric $SU(N_{c})$ Yang-Mills theories with massless hypermultiplets are obtained for $N_{c}=2$ and $3$. For $SU(2)$ we derive the non-linear differential equations for the prepotentials and calculate full non-perturbative corrections to the effective gauge coupling constant in the weak and strong coupling regions.
