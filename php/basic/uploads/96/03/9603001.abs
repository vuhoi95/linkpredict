Title: Darboux Coordinates on Coadjoint Orbits of Lie Algebras
Authors: M. R. Adams and J. Harnad and J. Hurtubise
Abstract: The method of constructing spectral Darboux coordinates on finite dimensional coadjoint orbits in duals of loop algebras is applied to the one pole case, where the orbit is identified with a coadjoint orbit in the dual of a finite dimensional Lie algebra. The constructions are carried out explicitly when the Lie algebra is $\frak{sl}(2,\bold R),\ \frak{sl}(3, \bold R),$ and $\frak{so}(3, \bold R)$, and for rank two orbits in $\frak{so}(n, \bold R)$. A new feature that appears is the possibility of identifying spectral Darboux coordinates associated to ``dynamical" choices of sections of the associated eigenvector line bundles; i.e. sections that depend on the point within the given orbit.
