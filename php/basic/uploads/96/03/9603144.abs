Title: The WZ Term of the Spinning String and its On-shell Structure
Authors: J. Gomis and K. Kamimura and R. Kuriki
Abstract: The Wess-Zumino term of the spinning string is constructed in terms of their anomalies using an extended field-antifield formalism. A new feature appears from a fact that the non-anomalous transformations do not form a sub-group. The algebra of the extended variables closes only using the equations of motion derived from the WZ term.
