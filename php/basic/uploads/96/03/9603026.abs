Title: The radiative corrections of the triangular anomaly
Authors: Hung cheng and S. P. Li
Abstract: We calculate the triangular anomaly in the next order in the Abelian-Higgs theory with an appropriate number of families of chiral fermions and with Yukawa couplings. The calculation is performed with the method of subtraction aided by the Ward- Takahashi identities. This anomaly amplitude is performed without any regularization and is found to vanish.
