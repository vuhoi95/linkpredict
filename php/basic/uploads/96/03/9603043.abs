Title: Form factors approach to current correlations in one dimensional systems  with impurities
Authors: F. Lesage and H. Saleur and S. Skorik
Abstract: We show how to compute analytically time and space dependent correlations in one dimensional quantum integrable systems with an impurity. Our approach is based on a description of these systems in terms of massless scattering of quasiparticles. Correlators follow then from matrix elements of local operators between multiparticle states, the ``massless form factors''. Although an infinite sum of these form factors has to be considered in principle, we find that for current, spin, and energy operators, only a few (typically two or three) are necessary to obtain an accuracy of more than $1\%$, for {\bf arbitrary coupling strength}, that is all the way from short to large distances. As examples we compute, at zero temperature, the frequency dependent conductance in a Luttinger liquid with impurity, the spectral function in the double well problem of dissipative quantum mechanics and part of the space dependent succeptibility in the Kondo model .
