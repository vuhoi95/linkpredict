Title: String Equation From Field Equation
Authors: V. Ts. Gurovich and V. D. Dzhunushaliev
Abstract: It is shown that the string equation can be obtain from field equations. Such work is performed to scalar field. The equation obtained in nonrelativistic limit describes the nonlinear string. Such string has the effective elasticity connencted with the local string curvature. Some examples of the movement such nonlinear elastic string are considered.
