Title: S-duality and Canonical Transformations in String Theory
Authors: J. Maharana and H. Singh
Abstract: The symmetries of the tree level string effective action are discussed. An appropriate effective action is constructed starting from the manifestly SL(2,R) invarint form of string effective action introduced by Schwarz and Sen. The conserved charges are derived and generators of infinitesimal transformations are obtained in the Hamiltonian formalism. Some interesting consequences of the canonical transformations are explored.
