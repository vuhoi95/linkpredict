Title: General Rotating Five Dimensional Black Holes of Toroidally Compactified  Heterotic String
Authors: Mirjam Cvetic and Donam Youm
Abstract: We present the most general rotating black hole solution of five-dimensional N=4 superstring vacua that conforms to the ``no hair theorem''. It is chosen to be parameterized in terms of massless fields of the toroidally compactified heterotic string. The solutions are obtained by performing a subset of O(8,24) transformations, i.e., symmetry transformations of the effective three-dimensional action for stationary solutions, on the five-dimensional (neutral) rotating solution parameterized by the mass m and two rotational parameters $l_1$ and $l_2$. The explicit form of the generating solution is determined by three $SO(1,1)\subset O(8,24)$ boosts, which specify two electric charges $Q_1^{(1)}, Q_{2}^{(2)}$ of the Kaluza-Klein and two-form U(1) gauge fields associated with the same compactified direction, and the charge Q (electric charge of the vector field, whose field strength is dual to the field strength of the five-dimensional two-form field). The general solution, parameterized by 27 charges, two rotational parameters and the ADM mass compatible with the Bogomol'nyi bound, is obtained by imposing $[SO(5)\times SO(21)]/[SO(4)\times SO(20)]\subset O(5,21)$ transformations, which do not affect the five-dimensional space-time. We also analyze the deviations from the BPS-saturated limit.
