Title: Superstring Scattering from D-Branes
Authors: Mohammad R. Garousi and Robert C. Myers
Abstract: We derive fully covariant expressions for all two-point scattering amplitudes of two massless closed strings from a Dirichlet $p$-brane. This construction relies on the observation that there is a simple relation between these D-brane amplitudes in type II superstring theory and four-point scattering amplitudes for type I open superstrings. From the two-point amplitudes, we derive the long range background fields for the D-branes, and verify that as expected they correspond to those of extremally charged $p$-brane solutions of the low energy effective action.
