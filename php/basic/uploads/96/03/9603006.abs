Title: Dynamical r-matrix for the elliptic Ruijsenaars-Schneider system
Authors: F. W. Nijhoff and V. B. Kuznetsov and E. K. Sklyanin and O. Ragnisco
Abstract: The classical r-matrix structure for the generic elliptic Ruijsenaars-Schneider model is presented. It makes the integrability of this model as well as of its discrete-time version that was constructed in a recent paper manifest.
