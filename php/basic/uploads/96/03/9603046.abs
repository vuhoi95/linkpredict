Title: A method for solve integrable $A_2$ spin chains combining different  representations
Authors: Julio Abad and Miguel Rios
Abstract: A non homogeneous spin chain in the representations $ \{3 \}$ and $ \{3^*\}$ of $A_2$ is analyzed. We find that the naive nested Bethe ansatz is not applicable to this case. A method inspired in the nested Bethe ansatz, that can be applied to more general cases, is developed for that chain. The solution for the eigenvalues of the trace of the monodromy matrix is given as two coupled Bethe equations different from that for a homogeneous chain. A conjecture about the form of the solutions for more general chains is presented. PACS: 75.10.Jm, 05.50+q 02.20 Sv
