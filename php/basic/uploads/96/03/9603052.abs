Title: Pseudoclassical description of the massive Dirac particles in odd  dimensions
Authors: D. M. Gitman and A. E. Goncalves
Abstract: A pseudoclassical model is proposed to describe massive Dirac (spin one-half) particles in arbitrary odd dimensions. The quantization of the model reproduces the minimal quantum theory of spinning particles in such dimensions. A dimensional duality between the model proposed and the pseudoclassical description of Weyl particles in even dimensions is discussed.
