Title: The general solution of the quantum Einstein equations?
Authors: Rodolfo Gambini and Jorge Pullin
Abstract: We suggest how to interpret the action of the quantum Hamiltonian constraint of general relativity in the loop representation as a skein relation on the space of knots. Therefore, by considering knot polynomials that are compatible with that skein relation, one guarantees that all the quantum Einstein equations are solved. We give a particular example of such invariant and discuss the consistency of the constraint algebra in this approach.
