Title: D-particle Dynamics and Bound States
Authors: Ulf H. Danielsson and Gabriele Ferretti and Bo Sundborg
Abstract: We study the low energy effective theory describing the dynamics of D-particles. This corresponds to the quantum mechanical system obtained by dimensional reduction of $9+1$ dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory to $0+1$ dimensions and can be interpreted as the non relativistic limit of the Born-Infeld action. We study the system of two like-charged D-particles and find evidence for the existence of non-BPS states whose mass grows like $\lambda^{1/3}$ over the BPS mass. We give a string interpretation of this phenomenon in terms of a linear potential generated by strings stretching from the two D-particles. Some comments on the possible relations to black hole entropy and eleven dimensional supergravity are also given.
