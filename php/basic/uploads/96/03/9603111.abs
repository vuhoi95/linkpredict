Title: Root Systems and Boundary Bootstrap
Authors: J. D. Kim and Y. Yoon
Abstract: The principle of boundary bootstrap plays a significant role in the algebraic study of the purely elastic boundary reflection matrix $K_a(\theta)$ for integrable quantum field theory defined on a space-time with a boundary. However, general structure of that principle in the form as was originally introduced by Fring and K\"oberle has remained unclear. In terms of a new matrix $J_a(\theta)=\sqrt{K_a(\theta)/K_{\bar{a}}(i\pi +\theta)}$, the boundary bootstrap takes a simple form. Incidentally, a hypothesised expression of the boundary reflection matrix for simply-laced $ADE$ affine Toda field theory defined on a half line with the Neumann boundary condition is obtained in terms of geometrical quantities of root systems \`a la Dorey.
