Title: The Schwinger Mechanism, the Unruh Effect and the Production of  Accelerated Black Holes
Authors: R. Parentani and S. Massar
Abstract: We compute the corrections to the transition amplitudes of an accelerated Unruh ``box'' that arise when the accelerated box is replaced by a ``two level ion'' immersed in a constant electric field and treated in second quantization. There are two kinds of corrections, those due to recoil effects induced by the momentum transfers and those due to pair creation. Taken together, these corrections show that there is a direct relationship between pair creation amplitudes described by the Heisenberg-Euler-Schwinger mechanism and the Unruh effect, i.e. the thermalisation of accelerated systems at temperature $a/ 2 \pi$ where $a$ is the acceleration. In particular, there is a thermodynamical consistency between both effects whose origin is that the euclidean action governing pair creation rates acts as an entropy in delivering the Unruh temperature. Upon considering pair creation of charged black holes in an electric field, these relationships explain why black holes are created from vacuum in thermal equilibrium, i.e. with their Hawking temperature equal to their Unruh temperature.
