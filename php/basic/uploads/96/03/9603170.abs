Title: Duality Between the Webs of Heterotic and Type II Vacua
Authors: Philip Candelas and Anamaria Font
Abstract: We discuss how transitions in the space of heterotic K3*T^2 compactifications are mapped by duality into transitions in the space of Type II compactifications on Calabi-Yau manifolds. We observe that perturbative symmetry restoration, as well as non-perturbative processes such as changes in the number of tensor multiplets, have at least in many cases a simple description in terms of the reflexive polyhedra of the Calabi-Yau manifolds. Our results suggest that to many, perhaps all, four-dimensional N=2 heterotic vacua there are corresponding type II vacua.
