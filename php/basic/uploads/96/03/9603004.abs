Title: Non Abelian Sugawara Construction and the q-deformed N=2 Superconformal  Algebra
Authors: E. Batista and J. F. Gomes and I. J. Lautenschleguer
Abstract: The construction of a q-deformed N=2 superconformal algebra is proposed in terms of level 1 currents of ${\cal{U}}_{q} ({\widehat{su}}(2))$ quantum affine Lie algebra and a single real Fermi field. In particular, it suggests the expression for the q-deformed Energy-Momentum tensor in the Sugawara form. Its constituents generate two isomorphic quadratic algebraic structures. The generalization to ${\cal{U}}_{q} ({\widehat{su}}(N+1))$ is also proposed.
