Abstract: We quantize the tachyon field in the two-dimensional (2D), $\epsilon<2$ charged black holes where $\epsilon$ is the dilaton coupling parameter for the Maxwell term. Especially the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor $\langle T_{ab}\rangle$, observed by a freely falling observer, is computed. This shows that new divergences such as $\ln f$ and ${1 \over f}$ arises near the horizon ($f \to 0$), compared with conformal matter case.
