Title: Stochastic Behavior of Effective Field Theories Across Threshold
Authors: E. Calzetta and B-L. Hu
Abstract: We explore how the existence of a field with a heavy mass influences the low energy dynamics of a quantum field with a light mass by expounding the stochastic characters of their interactions which take on the form of fluctuations in the number of (heavy field) particles created at the threshold, and dissipation in the dynamics of the light fields, arising from the backreaction of produced heavy particles. We claim that the stochastic nature of effective field theories is intrinsic, in that dissipation and fluctuations are present both above and below the threshold. Stochasticity builds up exponentially quickly as the heavy threshold is approached from below, becoming dominant once the threshold is crossed. But it also exists below the threshold and is in principle detectable, albeit strongly suppressed at low energies. The results derived here can be used to give a quantitative definition of the `effectiveness' of a theory in terms of the relative weight of the deterministic versus the stochastic behavior at different energy scales.
