Title: Dynamical Supersymmetry Breaking on Quantum Moduli Spaces
Authors: Kenneth Intriligator and Scott Thomas
Abstract: Supersymmetry breaking by the quantum deformation of a classical moduli space is considered. A simple, non-chiral, renormalizable model is presented to illustrate this mechanism. The well known, chiral, $SU(3) \times SU(2)$ model and its generalizations are shown to break supersymmetry by this mechanism in the limit $\Lambda_2 \gg \Lambda_3$. Other supersymmetry breaking models, with classical flat directions that are only lifted quantum mechanically, are presented. Finally, by integrating in vector matter, the strongly coupled region of chiral models with a dynamically generated superpotential is shown to be continuously connected to a weakly coupled description in terms of confined degrees of freedom, with supersymmetry broken at tree level.
