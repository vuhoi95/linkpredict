Title: Generalized Gross--Perry--Sorkin--Like Solitons
Authors: Alfredo Macias and Tonatiuh Matos
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new solution for the effective theory of Maxwell--Einstein--Dilaton, Low energy string and Kaluza--Klein theories, which contains among other solutions the well known Kaluza--Klein monopole solution of Gross--Perry--Sorkin as special case. We show also the magnetic and electric dipole solutions contained in the general one.
