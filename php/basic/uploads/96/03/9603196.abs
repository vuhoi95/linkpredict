Title: Transverse force on a quantized vortex in a superfluid
Authors: D. J. Thouless and P. Ao and Q. Niu
Abstract: We have derived an exact expression for the total nondissipative transverse force acting on a quantized vortex moving in a uniform background. The derivation is valid for neutral boson or fermion superfluids, provided the order parameter is a complex scalar quantity. This force is determined by the one-particle density matrix far away from the vortex core, and is found to be the Magnus force proportional to the superfluid density. We conclude that contributions of the localized core states do not change this force.
