Title: Study of $N=2$ Superconformal Field Theories in $4$ Dimensions
Authors: Tohru Eguchi and Kentaro Hori and Katsushi Ito and Sung-Kil Yang
Abstract: Making use of the exact solutions of the $N=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories we construct new classes of superconformal field theories (SCFTs) by fine-tuning the moduli parameters and bringing the theories to critical points. SCFTs we have constructed represent universality classes of the 4-dimensional $N=2$ SCFTs.
