Title: Hamiltonian Poincaré Gauge Theory of Gravitation
Authors: A. López--Pinto and A. Tiemblo and R. Tresguerres
Abstract: We develop a Hamiltonian formalism suitable to be applied to gauge theories in the presence of Gravitation, and to Gravity itself when considered as a gauge theory. It is based on a nonlinear realization of the Poincar\'e group, taken as the local spacetime group of the gravitational gauge theory, with $SO(3)$ as the classification subgroup. The Wigner--like rotation induced by the nonlinear approach singularizes out the role of time and allows to deal with ordinary $SO(3)$ vectors. We apply the general results to the Einstein--Cartan action. We study the constraints and we obtain Einstein's classical equations in the extremely simple form of time evolution equations of the coframe. As a consequence of our approach, we identify the gauge--theoretical origin of the Ashtekar variables.
