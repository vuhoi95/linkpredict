Title: A Comment on Zero-brane Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Daniel Kabat and Philippe Pouliot
Abstract: We consider low energy, non-relativistic scattering of two Dirichlet zero-branes as an exercise in quantum mechanics. For weak string coupling and sufficiently small velocity, the dynamics is governed by an effective U(2) gauge theory in 0+1 dimensions. At low energies, D-brane scattering can reliably probe distances much shorter than the string scale. The only length scale in the quantum mechanics problem is the eleven dimensional Planck length. This provides evidence for the role of scales shorter than the string length in the weakly coupled dynamics of type IIA strings.
