Title: Casimir Terms and Shape Instabilities for Two-Dimensional Critical  Systems
Authors: Peter Kleban and Ingo Peschel
Abstract: We calculate the universal part of the free energy of certain finite two- dimensional regions at criticality by use of conformal field theory. Two geometries are considered: a section of a circle ("pie slice") of angle \phi and a helical staircase of finite angular (and radial) extent. We derive some consequences for certain matrix elements of the transfer matrix and corner transfer matrix. We examine the total free energy, including non- universal edge free energy terms, in both cases. A new, general, Casimir instability toward sharp corners on the boundary is found; other new instability behavior is investigated. We show that at constant area and edge length, the rectangle is unstable against small curvature.
