Title: The Moduli Space of N=2 SUSY QCD and Duality in N=1 SUSY QCD
Authors: P. C. Argyres and M. R. Plesser and N. Seiberg
Abstract: We analyze in detail the moduli space of vacua of N=2 SUSY QCD with n_c colors and n_f flavors. The Coulomb branch has submanifolds with non-Abelian gauge symmetry. The massless quarks and gluons at these vacua are smoothly connected to the underlying elementary quarks and gluons. Upon breaking N=2 by an N=1 preserving mass term for the adjoint field the theory flows to N=1 SUSY QCD. Some of the massless quarks and gluons on the moduli space of the N=2 theory become the magnetic quarks and gluons of the N=1 theory. In this way we derive the duality in N=1 SUSY QCD by identifying its crucial building blocks---the magnetic degrees of freedom---using only semiclassical physics and the non-renormalization theorem.
