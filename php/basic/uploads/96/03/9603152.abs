Title: Vacuum instability in external fields
Authors: S. P. Gavrilov and D. M. Gitman
Abstract: We study particles creation in arbitrary space-time dimensions by external electric fields, in particular, by fields, which are acting for a finite time. The time and dimensional analysis of the vacuum instability is presented. It is shown that the distributions of particles created by quasiconstant electric fields can be written in a form which has a thermal character and seems to be universal. Its application, for example, to the particles creation in external constant gravitational field reproduces the Hawking temperature exactly.
