Title: Intersecting M-branes
Authors: G. Papadopoulos and P. K. Townsend
Abstract: We present the magnetic duals of G\"uven's electric-type solutions of D=11 supergravity preserving $1/4$ or $1/8$ of the D=11 supersymmetry. We interpret the electric solutions as $n$ orthogonal intersecting membranes and the magnetic solutions as $n$ orthogonal intersecting 5-branes, with $n=2,3$; these cases obey the general rule that $p$-branes can self-intersect on $(p-2)$-branes. On reduction to $D=4$ these solutions become electric or magnetic dilaton black holes with dilaton coupling constant $a=1$ (for $n=2$) or $a=1/\sqrt{3}$ (for $n=3$). We also discuss the reduction to D=10.
