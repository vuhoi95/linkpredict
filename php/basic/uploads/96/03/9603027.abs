Title: Gravitating BPS Dyons witout a Dilaton
Authors: Choonkyu Lee and Q-Han Park
Abstract: We describe curved-space BPS dyon solutions, the ADM mass of which saturates the gravitational version of the Bogomol'nyi bound. This generalizes self-gravitating BPS monopole solutions of Gibbons et al. when there is no dilaton.
