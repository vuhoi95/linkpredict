Title: Interactions of strings and D-branes from M theory
Authors: Ofer Aharony and Jacob Sonnenschein and Shimon Yankielowicz
Abstract: We discuss the relation between M theory and type II string theories. We show that, assuming ``natural'' interactions between membranes and fivebranes in M theory, the known interactions between strings and D-branes in type II string theories arise in appropriate limits. Our discussion of the interactions is purely at the classical level. We remark on issues associated with the M theory approach to enhanced gauge symmetries, which deserve further investigation.
