Title: Comment on the ``$θ$-term renormalization in the (2+1)-dimensional  $CP^{N-1}$ model with $θ$ term''
Authors: I. N. Kondrashuk and A. V. Kotikov
Abstract: It is found that the recently published first coefficient of nonzero $\beta$-function for the Chern-Simons term in the $1/N$ expansion of the $CP^{N-1}$ model is untrue numerically. The correct result is given. The main conclusions of Park's paper are not changed.
