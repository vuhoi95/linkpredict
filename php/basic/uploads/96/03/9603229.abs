Title: Colour: A Computer Program for QCD Colour Factor Calculations
Authors: Jari Hakkinen and Hamid Kharraziha
Abstract: A computer program for evaluating colour factors of QCD Feynman diagrams is presented, and illustrative examples on how to use the program to calculate non trivial colour factors are given. The program and the discussion in this paper is based on a diagrammatic approach to colour factors.
