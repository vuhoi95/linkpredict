Title: The Igusa modular forms and ``the simplest'' Lorentzian Kac--Moody  algebras
Authors: Valeri A. Gritsenko and Viacheslav V. Nikulin
Abstract: We find automorphic corrections for the Lorentzian Kac--Moody algebras with the simplest generalized Cartan matrices of rank 3: A_{1,0} = 2 0 -1 0 2 -2 -1 -2 2 and A_{1,I} = 2 -2 -1 -2 2 -1 -1 -1 2 For A_{1,0} this correction is given by the Igusa Sp_4(Z)-modular form \chi_{35} of weight 35, and for A_{1,I} by a Siege modular form of weight 30 with respect to a 2-congruence subgroup. We find infinite product or sum expansions for these forms. Our method of construction of \chi_{35} leads to the direct construction of Siegel modular forms by infinite product expansions, whose divisors are the Humbert surfaces with fixed discriminants. Existence of these forms was proved by van der Geer in 1982 using some geometrical consideration. We announce a list of all hyperbolic symmetric generalized Cartan matrices A of rank 3 such that A has elliptic or parabolic type, A has a lattice Weyl vector, and A contains the affine submatrix \tilde{A}_1.
