Title: BRST operator quantization of generally covariant gauge systems
Authors: Rafael Ferraro and Daniel M. Sforza
Abstract: The BRST generator is realized as a Hermitian nilpotent operator for a finite-dimensional gauge system featuring a quadratic super-Hamiltonian and linear supermomentum constraints. As a result, the emerging ordering for the Hamiltonian constraint is not trivial, because the potential must enter the kinetic term in order to obtain a quantization invariant under scaling. Namely, BRST quantization does not lead to the curvature term used in the literature as a means to get that invariance. The inclusion of the potential in the kinetic term, far from being unnatural, is beautifully justified in light of the Jacobi's principle.
