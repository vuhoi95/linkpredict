Title: A comment on free-fermion conditions for lattice models in two and more  dimensions
Authors: J. M. Maillard and C. M. Viallet
Abstract: We analyze free-fermion conditions on vertex models. We show --by examining examples of vertex models on square, triangular, and cubic lattices-- how they amount to degeneration conditions for known symmetries of the Boltzmann weights, and propose a general scheme for such a process in two and more dimensions.
