Title: Twisted N=2 Supersymmetry with Central Charge and Equivariant Cohomology
Authors: J. M. F. Labastida and M. Mari√±o
Abstract: We present an equivariant extension of the Thom form with respect to a vector field action, in the framework of the Mathai-Quillen formalism. The associated Topological Quantum Field Theories correspond to twisted $N=2$ supersymmetric theories with a central charge. We analyze in detail two different cases: topological sigma models and non-abelian monopoles on four-manifolds.
