Title: The 3-Form Multiplet in Supergravity
Authors: P. Bin√©truy and F. Pillon and G. Girardi and R. Grimm
Abstract: We derive the couplings of the 3-form supermultiplet to the general supergravity-matter-Yang-Mills system. Based on the methods of superspace geometry, we identify component fields, establish their supergravity transformations and construct invariant component field actions. Two specific applications are adressed: the appearance of fundamental 3-forms in the context of strong-weak duality and the use of the 3-form supermultiplets to describe effective degrees of freedom relevant to the mechanism of gaugino condensation.
