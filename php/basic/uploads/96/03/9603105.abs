Title: Quantum Group Representations and Baxter Equation
Authors: Alexander Antonov and Boris Feigin
Abstract: In this paper we propose algebraic universal procedure for deriving "fusion rules" and Baxter equation for any integrable model with $U_q(\widehat{sl}_2)$ symmetry of Quantum Inverse Scattering Method. Universal Baxter Q- operator is got from the certain infinite dimensional representation called q-oscillator one of the Universal R- matrix for $U_q(\widehat{sl}_2)$ affine algebra (first proposed by V. Bazhanov, S.Lukyanov and A.Zamolodchikov for quantum KdV case). We also examine the algebraic properties of Q-operator.
