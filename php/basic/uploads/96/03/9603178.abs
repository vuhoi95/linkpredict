Title: Affine Toda Solitons and Systems of Calogero-Moser Type
Authors: H. W. Braden and Andrew N. W. Hone
Abstract: The solitons of affine Toda field theory are related to the spin-generalised Ruijsenaars-Schneider (or relativistic Calogero-Moser) models. This provides the sought after extension of the correspondence between the sine-Gordon solitons and the Ruijsenaars-Schneider model.
