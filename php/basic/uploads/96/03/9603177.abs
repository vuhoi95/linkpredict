Title: Dynamics of the Light-Cone Zero Modes: Theta Vacuum of the Massive  Schwinger Model
Authors: Koji Harada and Atsushi Okazaki and Masa-aki Taniguchi
Abstract: The massive Schwinger model is quantized on the light cone with great care on the bosonic zero modes by putting the system in a finite (light-cone) spatial box. The zero mode of $A_{-}$ survives Dirac's procedure for the constrained system as a dynamical degree of freedom. After regularization and quantization, we show that the physical space condition is consistently imposed and relates the fermion Fock states to the zero mode of the gauge field. The vacuum is obtained by solving a Schr\"odinger equation in a periodic potential, so that the theta is understood as the Bloch momentum. We also construct a one-meson state in the fermion-antifermion sector and obtained the Schr\"odinger equation for it.
