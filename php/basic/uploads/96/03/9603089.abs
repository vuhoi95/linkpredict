Title: T-duality for open strings
Authors: E. Alvarez and J. L. F. Barbon and J. Borlaf
Abstract: The T-duality transformations between open and closed superstrings in different D-manifolds are generalized to curved backgrounds with commuting isometries. We address some global aspects like the occurrence of orientifold boundaries in general sigma models, higher genus world sheets, and the case of non-compact isometries. The various world volume effective actions are shown to transform properly under T-duality. We also include a brief discussion of the canonical transformations of boundary states in the operator formalism.
