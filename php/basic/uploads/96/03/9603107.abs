Title: Multidimensional Extremal Dilatonic Black Holes in String-like Model  with Cosmological Term
Authors: V. D. Ivashchuk and V. N. Melnikov
Abstract: A string-like model with the "cosmological constant" $\Lambda$ is considered. The Maki-Shiraishi multi-black-hole solution \cite{MS1} is generalized to space-times with a Ricci-flat internal space. For $\Lambda = 0$ the obtained solution in the one-black-hole case is shown to coincide with the extreme limit of the charged dilatonic black hole solution \cite{BI,BM}. The Hawking temperature $T_H$ for the solution \cite{BI,BM} is presented and its extreme limit is considered. For the string value of dilatonic coupling the temperature $T_H$ does not depend upon the internal space dimension.
