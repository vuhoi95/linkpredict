Title: Ghost decoupling in 't Hooft spectrum for mesons
Authors: A. Bassetto and L. Griguolo
Abstract: We show that the replacement of the ``instantaneous'' 't Hooft's potential with the causal form suggested by equal time canonical quantization in light-cone gauge, which entails the occurrence of negative probability states, does not change the bound state spectrum when the difference is treated as a single insertion in the kernel.
