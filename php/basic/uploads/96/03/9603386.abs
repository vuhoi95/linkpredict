Title: $N=1$ supersymmetry and the three loop anomalous dimension for the  chiral superfield
Authors: I. Jack and D. R. T. Jones and C. G. North
Abstract: We calculate the three loop anomalous dimension for a general $N=1$ supersymmetric gauge theory. The result is used to probe the possible existence of renormalisation invariant relationships between the Yukawa and gauge couplings.
