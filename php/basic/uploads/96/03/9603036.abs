Title: Physical masses and the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field
Authors: Hung Cheng and S. P. Li
Abstract: By using the Ward-Takahashi identities in the Landau gauge, we derive exact relations between particle masses and the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field in the Abelian gauge field theory with a Higgs meson.
