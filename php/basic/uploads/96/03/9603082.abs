Title: Notes on Equivalences and Higgs Branches in N=2 Supersymmetric  Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Ulf H. Danielsson and PÃ¤r Stjernberg
Abstract: In this paper we investigate how various equivalences between effective field theories of $N=2$ SUSY Yang-Mills theory with matter can be understood through Higgs breaking, i.e. by giving expectation values to squarks. We give explicit expressions for the flat directions for a wide class of examples.
