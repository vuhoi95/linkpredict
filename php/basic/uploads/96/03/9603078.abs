Title: On a Renormalization Group Approach to Dimensional Crossover
Authors: Ian Affleck and Bertrand I. Halperin
Abstract: A recently proposed renormalization group approach to dimensional crossover in quasi-one-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets is improved and then shown to give identical results, in some cases, to those obtained earlier.
