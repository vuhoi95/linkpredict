Title: Electron-pair condensation in parity-preserving QED3
Authors: M. A. De Andrade and O. M. Del Cima and J. A. HelayÃ«l-Neto
Abstract: In this paper, we present a parity-preserving QED3 with spontaneous breaking of a local U(1)-symmetry. The breaking is accomplished by a potential of the \vf^6-type. It is shown that a net attractive interaction appears in the M{\o}ller scattering (s and p-wave scattering between two electrons) as mediated by the gauge field and a Higgs scalar. This might favour a pair-condensation mechanism.
