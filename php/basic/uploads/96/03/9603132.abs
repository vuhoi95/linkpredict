Title: Generalized Fractional Statistics
Authors: G. Kaniadakis and A. Lavagno and P. Quarati
Abstract: We link, by means of a semiclassical approach, the fractional statistics of particles obeying the Haldane exclusion principle to the Tsallis statistics and derive a generalized quantum entropy and its associated statistics.
