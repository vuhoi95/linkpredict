Title: On the Electric Charge of Monopoles at Finite Temperature
Authors: J. C. Le Guillou and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We calculate the electric charge at finite temperature $T$ for non-Abelian monopoles in spontaneously broken gauge theories with a CP violating $\theta$-term. A careful treatment of dyon's gauge degrees of freedom shows that Witten formula for the dyon charge at $T=0$, $ Q = e(n - \theta/2\pi) $, remains valid at $T \ne 0$.
