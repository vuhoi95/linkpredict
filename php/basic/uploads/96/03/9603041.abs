Title: Lagrangian Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin treatment of collective coordinates
Authors: Juan P. Garrahan and Martin Kruczenski and Daniel R. Bes
Abstract: The Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) treatment for the quantization of collective coordinates is considered in the Lagrangian formalism. The motion of a particle in a Riemannian manifold is studied in the case when the classical solutions break a non-abelian global invariance of the action. Collective coordinates are introduced, and the resulting gauge theory is quantized in the BRST antifield formalism. The partition function is computed perturbatively to two-loops, and it is shown that the results are independent of gauge-fixing parameters.
