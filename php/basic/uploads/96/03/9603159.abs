Title: Path Integral Evaluation of Non-Abelian Anomaly and  Pauli--Villars--Gupta Regularization
Authors: Kiyoshi Okuyama and Hiroshi Suzuki
Abstract: When the path integral method of anomaly evaluation is applied to chiral gauge theories, two different types of gauge anomaly, i.e., the consistent form and the covariant form, appear depending on the regularization scheme for the Jacobian factor. We clarify the relation between the regularization scheme and the Pauli--Villars--Gupta (PVG) type Lagrangian level regularization. The conventional PVG, being non-gauge invariant for chiral gauge theories, in general corresponds to the consistent regularization scheme. The covariant regularization scheme, on the other hand, is realized by the generalized PVG Lagrangian recently proposed by Frolov and Slavnov. These correspondences are clarified by reformulating the PVG method as a regularization of the composite gauge current operator.
