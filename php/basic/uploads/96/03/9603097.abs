Title: Completeness Conditions for Boundary Operators in 2D Conformal Field  Theory
Authors: Gianfranco Pradisi and Augusto Sagnotti and Yassen S. Stanev
Abstract: In non-diagonal conformal models, the boundary fields are not directly related to the bulk spectrum. We illustrate some of their features by completing previous work of Lewellen on sewing constraints for conformal theories in the presence of boundaries. As a result, we include additional open sectors in the descendants of $D_{odd}$ $SU(2)$ WZW models. A new phenomenon emerges, the appearance of multiplicities and fixed-point ambiguities in the boundary algebra not inherited from the closed sector. We conclude by deriving a set of polynomial equations, similar to those satisfied by the fusion-rule coefficients $N_{ij}^k$, for a new tensor $A_{a b}^i$ that determines the open spectrum.
