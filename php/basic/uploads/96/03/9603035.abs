Title: Magnetic monopoles over topologically non trivial Riemann Surfaces
Authors: I. Martin and A. Restuccia
Abstract: An explicit canonical construction of monopole connections on non trivial U(1) bundles over Riemann surfaces of any genus is given. The class of monopole solutions depend on the conformal class of the given Riemann surface and a set of integer weights. The reduction of Seiberg-Witten 4-monopole equations to Riemann surfaces is performed. It is shown then that the monopole connections constructed are solutions to these equations.
