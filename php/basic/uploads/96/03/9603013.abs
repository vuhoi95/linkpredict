Title: Non Abelian BF theories with sources and 2-D gravity
Authors: J. P. Lupi and A. Restuccia and J. Stephany
Abstract: We study the interaction of non-Abelian topological $BF$ theories defined on two dimensional manifolds with point sources carrying non-Abelian charges. We identify the most general solution for the field equations on simply and multiply connected two-manifolds. Taking the particular choice of the so-called extended Poincar\'e group as the gauge group we discuss how recent discussions of two dimensional gravity models do fit in this formalism.
