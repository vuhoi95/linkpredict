Title: New matrix model solutions to the Kac-Schwarz problem
Authors: M. Adler and A. Morozov and T. Shiota and P. van Moerbeke
Abstract: We examine the Kac-Schwarz problem of specification of point in Grassmannian in the restricted case of gap-one first-order differential Kac-Schwarz operators. While the pair of constraints satisfying $[{\cal K}_1,W] = 1$ always leads to Kontsevich type models, in the case of $[{\cal K}_1,W] = W$ the corresponding KP $\tau$-functions are represented as more sophisticated matrix integrals.
