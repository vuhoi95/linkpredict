Title: Statistical Entropy of Four-Dimensional Extremal Black Holes
Authors: Juan Maldacena and Andrew Strominger
Abstract: String theory is used to count microstates of four-dimensional extremal black holes in compactifications with $N=4$ and $N=8$ supersymmetry. The result agrees for large charges with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
