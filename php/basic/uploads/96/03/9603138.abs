Title: Duality in deformed coset fermionic models
Authors: D. C. Cabra and E. F. Moreno
Abstract: We study the $SU(2)_k/U(1)$-parafermion model perturbed by its first thermal operator. By formulating the theory in terms of a (perturbed) fermionic coset model we show that the model is equivalent to interacting WZW fields modulo free fields. In this scheme, the order and disorder operators of the $Z_k$ parafermion theory are constructed as gauge invariant composites. We find that the theory presents a duality symmetry that interchanges the roles of the spin and dual spin operators. For two particular values of the coupling constant we find that the theory recovers conformal invariance and the gauge symmetry is enlarged. We also find a novel self-dual point.
