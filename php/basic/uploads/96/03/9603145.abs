Title: Tadpole Summation by Dyson-Schwinger Equations
Authors: Jens Kuester and Gernot Muenster
Abstract: In quantum field theory with three-point and four-point couplings the Feynman diagrams of perturbation theory contain momentum independent subdiagrams, the ``tadpoles'' and ``snails''. With the help of Dyson-Schwinger equations we show how these can be summed up completely by a suitable modification of the mass and coupling parameters. This reduces the number of diagrams significantly. The method is useful for the organisation of perturbative calculations in higher orders.
