Title: A Sequence of Duals for Sp(2N) Supersymmetric Gauge Theories with  Adjoint Matter
Authors: Markus A. Luty and Martin Schmaltz and John Terning
Abstract: We consider supersymmetric Sp(2N) gauge theories with F matter fields in the defining representation, one matter field in the adjoint representation, and no superpotential. We construct a sequence of dual descriptions of this theory using the dualities of Seiberg combined with the ``deconfinement'' method introduced by Berkooz. Our duals hint at a new non-perturbative phenomenon that seems to be taking place at asymptotically low energies in these theories: for small F some of the degrees of freedom form massless, non-interacting bound states while the theory remains in an interacting non-Abelian Coulomb phase. This phenomenon is the result of strong coupling gauge dynamics in the original description, but has a simple classical origin in the dual descriptions. The methods used for constructing these duals can be generalized to any model involving arbitrary 2-index tensor representations of Sp(2N), SO(N), or SU(N) groups.
