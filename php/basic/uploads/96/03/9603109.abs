Title: Nonextremal Black Hole Microstates and U-duality
Authors: Gary Horowitz and Juan Maldacena and Andrew Strominger
Abstract: A six-parameter family of five-dimensional black hole solutions is constructed which are labeled by their mass, two asymptotic scalar fields and three charges. It is shown that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is exactly matched, arbitrarily far from extremality, by a simple but mysterious duality-invariant extension of previously derived formulae for the number of D-brane states in string theory.
