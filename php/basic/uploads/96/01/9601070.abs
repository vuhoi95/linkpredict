Title: Semi-Classical Blocks and Correlators in Rational and Irrational  Conformal Field Theory
Authors: M. B. Halpern and N. A. Obers
Abstract: The generalized Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations of irrational conformal field theory provide a uniform description of rational and irrational conformal field theory. Starting from the known high-level solution of these equations, we first construct the high-level conformal blocks and correlators of all the affine-Sugawara and coset constructions on simple g. Using intuition gained from these cases, we then identify a simple class of irrational processes whose high-level blocks and correlators we are also able to construct.
