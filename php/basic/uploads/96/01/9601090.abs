Title: Heat kernel for non-minimal operators on a Kahler manifold
Authors: Sergei Alexandrov and Dmitri Vassilevich
Abstract: The heat kernel expansion for a general non--minimal operator on the spaces $C^\infty (\Lambda^k)$ and $C^\infty (\Lambda^{p,q})$ is studied. The coefficients of the heat kernel asymptotics for this operator are expressed in terms of the Seeley coefficients for the Hodge--de Rham Laplacian.
