Title: Bicovariant Calculus on Twisted ISO(N), Quantum Poincare' Group and  Quantum Minkowski Space
Authors: Paolo Aschieri and Leonardo Castellani
Abstract: A bicovariant calculus on the twisted inhomogeneous multiparametric $q$-groups of the $B_n,C_n,D_n$ type, and on the corresponding quantum planes, is found by means of a projection from the bicovariant calculus on $B_{n+1}$, $C_{n+1}$, $D_{n+1}$. In particular we obtain the bicovariant calculus on a dilatation-free $q$-Poincar\'e group $ISO_q (3,1)$, and on the corresponding quantum Minkowski space. The classical limit of the $B_n,C_n,D_n$ bicovariant calculus is discussed in detail.
