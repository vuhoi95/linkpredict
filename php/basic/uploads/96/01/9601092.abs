Title: Higher covariant derivative regularization revisited
Authors: T. D. Bakeyev and A. A. Slavnov
Abstract: The method of higher covariant derivative regularization of gauge theories is reviewed. The objections raised in the literature last years are discussed and the consistency of the method is proven. New approach to regularization of overlapping divergencies is developped.
