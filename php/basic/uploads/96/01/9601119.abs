Title: Spinning Relativistic Particle in an External Electromagnetic Field
Authors: M. Chaichian and R. Gonzalez Felipe and D. Louis Martinez
Abstract: The Hamiltonian formulation of the motion of a spinning relativistic particle in an external electromagnetic field is considered. The approach is based on the introduction of new coordinates and their conjugated momenta to describe the spin degrees of freedom together with an appropriate set of constraints in the Dirac formulation. For particles with gyromagnetic ratio $g=2$, the equations of motion do not predict any deviation from the standard Lorentz force, while for $g \neq 2$ an additional force, which corresponds to the magnetic dipole force, is obtained.
