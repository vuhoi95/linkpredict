Title: Non-Commutative Geometry and Chiral Perturbation Lagrangian
Authors: M. Alishahiha and A. H. Fatollahi and K. Kaviani
Abstract: Chiral perturbation lagrangian in the framework of non-commutative geometry is considered in full detail. It is found that the explicit symmetry breaking terms appear and some relations between the coupling constants of the theory come out naturally. The WZW term also turns up on the same footing as the other terms of the chiral lagrangian.
