Abstract: The solutions of Heisenberg equations and two-particles eigenvalue problems for nonrelativistic models of current-current fermion interaction and $N, \Theta $ model are obtained in the frameworks of dynamical mapping method. The equivalence of different types of dynamical mapping is shown. The connection between renormalization procedure and theory of selfadjoint extensions is elucidated.
