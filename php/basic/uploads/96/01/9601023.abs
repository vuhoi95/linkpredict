Title: Extensible Black Hole Embeddings for Apparently Forbidden Periodicities
Authors: Aharon Davidson and Uzi Paz
Abstract: Imposing extendibility on Kasner-Fronsdal black hole local isometric embedding is equivalent to removing conic singularities in Kruskal representation. Allowing for globally non-trivial (living in $M_{5}\times S_{1}$) embeddings, parameterized by $k$, extendibility can be achieved for apparently forbidden frequencies $\omega_{1}(k)\le\omega (k)\le \omega_{2}(k)$. The Hawking-Gibbons limit, say $\displaystyle{\omega_{1,2}(0)= {1\over{4M}}}$ for Schwarzschild geometry, is respected. The corresponding Kruskal sheets are viewed as slices in some Kaluza-Klein background. Euclidean $k$ discreteness, dictated by imaginary time periodicity, is correlated with twistor flux quantization.
