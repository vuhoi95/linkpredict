Title: Explicit gauge invariant quantization of the Schwinger model on a circle  in the functional Schr√∂dinger representation
Authors: Joakim Hallin and Per Liljenberg
Abstract: We solve the Schwinger model on a circle by first finding the explicit groundstate functional(s). Having done this, we give the structure of the Hilbert space and derive bosonization formulae in this formalism.
