Title: Asymptotic properties of the solutions of a differential equation  appearing in QCD
Authors: K. Chadan and Andr√© Martin and J. Stubbe
Abstract: We establish the asymptotic behaviour of the ratio $h^\prime(0)/h(0)$ for $\lambda\rightarrow\infty$, where $h(r)$ is a solution, vanishing at infinity, of the differential equation $h^{\prime\prime}(r) = i\lambda \omega (r) h(r)$ on the domain $0 \leq r <\infty$ and $\omega (r) = (1-\sqrt{r} K_1(\sqrt{r}))/r$. Some results are valid for more general $\omega$'s.
