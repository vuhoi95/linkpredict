Title: A possible description of the quantum numbers in a hadronic string model
Authors: V. A. Kudryavtsev and G. Weidl
Abstract: We consider a critical composite superconformal string model to desribe hadronic interactions. We present a new approach of introducing hadronic quantum numbers in the scattering amplitudes. The physical states carry the quantum numbers and form a common system of eigenfunctions of the operators in this string model. We give explicit constructions of the quantum number operators.
