Title: Introducing spin to classical phase space
Authors: J. Leon and J. M. Martin
Abstract: The kinematic degrees of freedom of spinning particles are analyzed and an explicit construction of the phase space and the simplectic structure that accomodates them is presented. A Poincare invariant theory of classical spinning particles that generalizes the work of Proca and Barut to arbitrary spin is given using spinor variables. Second quantization is naturally connected to the unphysical nature of zitterbewegung. Position variables can not be disentangled from spin in a canonical way, nor can the phase space be reduced to the usual description $(x,p)$ and a vector spin.
