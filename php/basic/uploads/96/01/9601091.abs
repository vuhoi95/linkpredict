Title: Perturbative Quantum (In)equivalence of Dual $σ$ Models in $2$  dimensions
Authors: J. Balog and P. Forgács and Z. Horváth and L. Palla
Abstract: Various examples of target space duality transformations are investigated up to two loop order in perturbation theory. Our results show that when using the tree level (`naive') transformation rules the dual theories are in general {\it inequivalent} at two loops to the original ones, (both for the Abelian and the non Abelian duality).
