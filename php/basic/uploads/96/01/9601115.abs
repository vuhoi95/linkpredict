Title: Nonholomorphic Corrections to the One-Loop N=2 Super Yang-Mills Action
Authors: B. de Wit and M. T. Grisaru and M. Rocek
Abstract: In addition to the familiar contribution from a holomorphic function $\FF$, the K\"ahler potential of the scalars in the nonabelian $N=2$ vector multiplet receives contributions from a real function $\HH$. We determine the latter at the one-loop level, taking into account both supersymmetric matter and gauge loops. The function $\HH$ characterizes the four-point coupling of the $N=2$ vector-multiplet vectors for constant values of their scalar superpartners. We discuss the consequences of our results.
