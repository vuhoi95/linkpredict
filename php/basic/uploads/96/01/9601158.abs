Title: String effects and field theory puzzles with supersymmetry
Authors: I. Bakas and K. Sfetsos
Abstract: We investigate field theory puzzles occuring in the interplay between supersymmetry and duality in the presense of rotational isometries (also known as non-triholomorphic in hyper-Kahler geometry). We show that T-duality is always compatible with supersymmetry, provided that non-local world-sheet effects are properly taken into account. The underlying superconformal algebra remains the same, and T-duality simply relates local with non-local realizations of it. The non-local realizations have a natural description using parafermion variables of the corresponding conformal field theory. We also comment on the relevance of these ideas to a possible resolution of long standing problems in the quantum theory of black holes.
