Title: Faddeev-Jackiw formalism for a topological-like oscillator in planar  dimensions
Authors: C. P. Natividade and H. Boschi-Filho
Abstract: The problem of a harmonic oscillator coupling to an electromagnetic potential plus a topological-like (Chern-Simons) massive term, in two-dimensional space, is studied in the light of the symplectic formalism proposed by Faddeev and Jackiw for constrained systems.
