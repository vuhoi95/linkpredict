Title: Asymptotic symmetry and conservation laws in 2d Poincar√© gauge theory  of gravity
Authors: M. Blagojevic and M. Vasilic and T. Vukasinac
Abstract: The structure of the asymptotic symmetry in the Poincar\'e gauge theory of gravity in 2d is clarified by using the Hamiltonian formalism. The improved form of the generator of the asymptotic symmetry is found for very general asymptotic behaviour of phase space variables, and the related conserved quantities are explicitly constructed.
