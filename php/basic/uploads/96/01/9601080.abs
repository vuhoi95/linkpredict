Abstract: The multicritical points of the $O(N)$ invariant $N$ vector model in the large $N$ limit are reexamined. Of particular interest are the subtleties involved in the stability of the phase structure at critical dimensions. In the limit $N \to \infty$ while the coupling $g \to g_c$ in a correlated manner (the double scaling limit) a massless bound state $O(N)$ singlet is formed and powers of $1/N$ are compensated by IR singularities. The persistence of the $N \to \infty$ results beyond the leading order is then studied with particular interest in the possible existence of a phase with propagating small mass vector fields and a massless singlet bound state. We point out that under certain conditions the double scaled theory of the singlet field is non-interacting in critical dimensions.
