Title: A Low-Density Closed Universe
Authors: Marc Kamionkowski and Nicolaos Toumbas
Abstract: Matter with an equation of state $p=-\rho/3$ may arise in certain scalar field theories, and the energy density of this matter decreases as $a^{-2}$ with the scale factor $a$ of the Universe. In this case, the Universe could be closed but still have a nonrelativistic-matter density $\Omega_0<1$. Furthermore, the cosmic microwave background could come from a causally-connected region at the other side of the Universe. This model is currently viable and might be tested by a host of forthcoming observations.
