Title: A New Hypothesis on the Origin of the Three Generations
Authors: S. D. Bass and A. W. Thomas
Abstract: We suggest that the Standard Model may undergo a supercritical transition near the Landau scale, where the U(1) gauge boson couples to the left and right handed states of any given fermion with different charges. This scenario naturally gives rise to three generations of fermion, corresponding to the three critical scales for the right-right, right-left and left-left fermion interactions going supercritical, as well as CP violation in the quark sector.
