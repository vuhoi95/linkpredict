Title: The Effective Lagrangian of QED with a Magnetic Charge
Authors: V. G. Kovalevich and P. Osland and Ya. M. Shnir and E. A. Tolkachev
Abstract: The effective Lagrangian of QED coupled to dyons is calculated. The resulting generalization of the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian contains non-linear $P$- and $T$-nonivariant (but $C$ invariant) terms corresponding to the virtual pair creation of dyons. As examples, the amplitudes for photon splitting and photon coalescence are calculated.
