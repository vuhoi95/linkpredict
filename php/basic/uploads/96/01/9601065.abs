Title: Pseudoclassical supersymmetrical model for 2+1 Dirac particle
Authors: D. M. Gitman and A. E. Gon√ßalves and I. V. Tyutin
Abstract: A new pseudoclassical supersymmetrical model of a spinning particle in 2+1 dimensions is proposed. Different ways of its quantization are discussed. They all reproduce the minimal quantum theory of the particle.
