Title: Seven-Sphere and the Exceptional N=7 and N=8 Superconformal Algebras
Authors: Murat Gunaydin and Sergei V. Ketov
Abstract: We study realizations of the exceptional non-linear (quadratically generated, or W-type) N=8 and N=7 superconformal algebras with Spin(7) and G_2 affine symmetry currents, respectively. Both the N=8 and N=7 algebras admit unitary highest-weight representations in terms of a single boson and free fermions in 8 of Spin(7) and 7 of G_2, with the central charges c_8=26/5 and c_7=5, respectively. Furthermore, we show that the general coset Ans"atze for the N=8 and N=7 algebras naturally lead to the coset spaces SO(8)xU(1)/SO(7) and SO(7)xU(1)/G_2, respectively, as the additional consistent solutions for certain values of the central charge. The coset space SO(8)/SO(7) is the seven-sphere S^7, whereas the space SO(7)/G_2 represents the seven-sphere with torsion, S^7_T. The division algebra of octonions and the associated triality properties of SO(8) play an essential role in all these realizations. We also comment on some possible applications of our results to string theory.
