Title: Dimensional Crossover in the Large N Limit
Authors: Denjoe O'Connor and C. R. Stephens and A. J. Bray
Abstract: We consider dimensional crossover for an $O(N)$ Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson model on a $d$-dimensional film geometry of thickness $L$ in the large $N$-limit. We calculate the full universal crossover scaling forms for the free energy and the equation of state. We compare the results obtained using ``environmentally friendly'' renormalization with those found using a direct, non-renormalization group approach. A set of effective critical exponents are calculated and scaling laws for these exponents are shown to hold exactly, thereby yielding non-trivial relations between the various thermodynamic scaling functions.
