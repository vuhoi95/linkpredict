Title: Problems for Supersymmetry Breaking by the Dilaton in Strings from  Charge and Color Breaking
Authors: J. A. Casas and A. Lleyda and C. Mu√±oz
Abstract: The general constraints on the parameter space of soft-breaking terms, in order to avoid dangerous charge and color breaking minima, are applied to the four-dimensional string scenario where the dilaton is the source of supersymmetry breaking (dilaton-dominated limit). The results indicate that the whole parameter space is excluded on these grounds after imposing the present experimental data on the top mass. The inclusion of a non-vanishing cosmological constant does not improve essentially the prospects. Possible way-outs to this situation are briefly discussed.
