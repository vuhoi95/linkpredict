Title: On Nonlinear Angular Momentum Theories, Their Representations and  Associated Hopf Structures
Authors: B. Abdesselam and J. Beckers and A. Chakrabarti and N. Debergh
Abstract: Nonlinear $sl(2)$ algebras subtending generalized angular momentum theories are studied in terms of undeformed generators and bases. We construct their unitary irreducible representations in such a general context. The linear $sl(2)$-case as well as its $q$-deformation are easily recovered as specific examples. Two other physically interesting applications corresponding to the so-called Higgs and quadratic algebras are also considered. We show that these two nonlinear algebras can be equipped with a Hopf structure.
