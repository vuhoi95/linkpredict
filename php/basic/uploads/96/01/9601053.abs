Title: SO(3) Gauged Soliton of an O(4) Sigma Model on $R_3$
Authors: K. Arthur and D. H. Tchrakian
Abstract: Vector $SO(3)$ gauged $O(4)$ sigma models on $\R_3$ are presented. The topological charge supplying the lower bound on the energy and rendering the soliton stable coincides with the Baryon number of the Skyrmion. These solitons have vanishing magnetic monopole flux. To exhibit the existence of such solitons, the equations of motion of one of these models is integrated numerically. The structure of the conserved Baryon current is briefly discussed.
