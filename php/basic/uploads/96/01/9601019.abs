Title: Real Interquark Potential Between a Heavy and a Light Quark at All  Distances
Authors: H. Kleinert and G. Lambiase and V. V. Nesterenko
Abstract: We point out that in infinite spacetime dimensions, the singularity in the interquark potential at small distances disappears if the string is anchored at one end to a heavy quark, at the other end to a light quark. This suggests that if quarks are placed at the end of strings some unphysical features such as tachyon states may be absent also in in finite dimensions.
