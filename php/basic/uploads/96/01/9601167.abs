Title: D-strings and F-strings from string loops
Authors: S. P. de Alwis and K. Sato
Abstract: Since the background fields of the string low energy action are supposed to be the long range manifestation of a condensate of strings, the addition of world sheet actions to the low energy effective action needs some string theoretic explanation. In this paper we suggest that this may be understood, as being due to string loop effects. We first present arguments using an equation due to Tseytlin and then more rigorously in the particular case of type IIB theory by invoking the Fischler-Susskind effect. The argument provides further justification for ${\rm SL}(2,Z)$ duality between D-strings and F(fundamental)-strings. In an appendix we comment on recent attempts to relate the type IIA membrane to the 11-dimensional membrane.
