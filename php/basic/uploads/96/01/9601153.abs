Title: Advances in Large N Group Theory and the Solution of Two-Dimensional R^2  Gravity
Authors: V. A. Kazakov and M. Staudacher and T. Wynter
Abstract: We review the recent exact solution of a matrix model which interpolates between flat and random lattices. The importance of the results is twofold: Firstly, we have developed a new large N technique capable of treating a class of matrix models previously thought to be unsolvable. Secondly, we are able to make a first precise statement about two-dimensional R^2 gravity. These notes are based on a lecture given at the Cargese summer school 1995. They contain some previously unpublished results.
