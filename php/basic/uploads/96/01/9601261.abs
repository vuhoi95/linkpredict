Title: Experimental constraints on a stringy SU(5)$\times$U(1) model
Authors: J. Lopez and D. Nanopoulos and A. Zichichi
Abstract: We re-examine the phenomenological aspects of a recently proposed string-derived SU(5)$\times$U(1) one-parameter supergravity model, and explore the sensitivity of the model predictions to variations in the strong coupling and the string unification scale. We also perform an analysis of the constraints on the parameter space of the model in light of the recent Tevatron trilepton data and the LEP~1.5 chargino and slepton data. We obtain $m_{\chi^\pm_1}\gsim70\GeV$, which excludes one-third of the parameter space of the model. The remainder of the parameter space should be probed by ongoing analyses of the Tevatron trilepton data and forthcoming LEP~2 runs.
