Abstract: It has been suggested that quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field could give rise in the lowest approximation to an effective noncommutative version of Kaluza-Klein theory which has as extra hidden structure a noncommutative geometry. It would seem however from the Standard Model, at least as far as the weak interactions are concerned, that a double-sheeted structure is the phenomenologically appropriate one at present accelerator energies. We examine here to what extent this latter structure can be considered as a singular limit of the former.
