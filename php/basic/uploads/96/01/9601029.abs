Title: Microscopic Origin of the Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy
Authors: A. Strominger and C. Vafa
Abstract: The Bekenstein-Hawking area-entropy relation $S_{BH}=A/4$ is derived for a class of five-dimensional extremal black holes in string theory by counting the degeneracy of BPS soliton bound states.
