Title: Exact Type IIB Superstring Backgrounds
Authors: Supriya Kar and Alok Kumar and Gautam Sengupta
Abstract: We obtain a family of type IIB superstring backgrounds involving Ramond-Ramond fields in ten dimensions starting from a heterotic string background with vanishing gauge fields. To this end the global $SL(2,R)$ symmetry of the type IIB equations of motion is implemented as a solution generating transformation. Using a geometrical analysis we show that the type IIB backgrounds obtained are solutions to all orders in $\alpha^{\prime}$.
