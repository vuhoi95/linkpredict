Title: Perturbative and non-perturbative monodromies in N=2 heterotic string  vacua
Authors: Gabriel Lopes Cardoso and Dieter LÃ¼st and Thomas Mohaupt
Abstract: In this talk we summarise our recent results on perturbative and non-perturbative monodromies in four-dimensional heterotic strings with $N=2$ space-time supersymmetry, and we compare our results with the rigid $SU(2)$ $N=2$ Yang-Mills monodromies.
