Abstract: We present new diagonal solutions of the reflection equation for elliptic solutions of the star-triangle relation. The models considered are related to the affine Lie algebras $A_n^{(1)},B_n^{(1)},C_n^{(1)},D_n^{(1)}$ and $A_n^{(2)}$. We recover all known diagonal solutions associated with these algebras and find how these solutions are related in the elliptic regime. Furthermore, new solutions of the reflection equation follow for the associated vertex models in the trigonometric limit.
