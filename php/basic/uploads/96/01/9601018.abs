Title: Anomalous Scaling in the N-Point Functions of Passive Scalar
Authors: Denis Bernard and Krzysztof Gawedzki and Antti Kupiainen
Abstract: A recent analysis of the 4-point correlation function of the passive scalar advected by a time-decorrelated random flow is extended to the N-point case. It is shown that all stationary-state inertial-range correlations are dominated by homogeneous zero modes of singular operators describing their evolution. We compute analytically the zero modes governing the N-point structure functions and the anomalous dimensions corresponding to them to the linear order in the scaling exponent of the 2-point function of the advecting velocity field. The implications of these calculations for the dissipation correlations are discussed.
