Title: Renormalization of Wilson Operators in Minkowski space
Authors: A. Andra≈°i and J. C. Taylor
Abstract: We make some comments on the renormalization of Wilson operators (not just vacuum -expectation values of Wilson operators), and the features which arise in Minkowski space. If the Wilson loop contains a straight light-like segment, charge renormalization does not work in a simple graph-by-graph way; but does work when certain graphs are added together. We also verify that, in a simple example of a smooth loop in Minkowski space, the existence of pairs of points which are light-like separated does not cause any extra divergences.
