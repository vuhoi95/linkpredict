Abstract: The magnetic deformation of the Ising Model, the thermal deformations of both the Tricritical Ising Model and the Tricritical Potts Model are governed by an algebraic structure based on the Dynkin diagram associated to the exceptional algebras $E_n$ (respectively for $n=8,7,6$). We make use of these underlying structures as well as of the discrete symmetries of the models to compute the matrix elements of the stress--energy tensor and its two--point correlation function by means of the spectral representation method.
