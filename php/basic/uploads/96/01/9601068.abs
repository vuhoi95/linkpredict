Title: WZNW Models from Non-Standard Bilinear Forms
Authors: H. Arfaei and S. Parvizi
Abstract: We study the WZNW models based on nonstandard bilinear forms. We approach the problem from algebraic, perturbative and functional exact methods. It is shown that even in the case of integer $k$ we can find irrational CFT's. We prove that when the base group is noncompact with nonabelian maximal compact subgroup, the Kac-Moody representations are nonunitary.
