Title: Spherically Symmetric Istantons of the Scale Invariant SU(2) Gauged  Grassmannian Model in d=4
Authors: A. Chakrabarti and D. H. Tchrakian
Abstract: (Anti)self-dual solutions of the scale invariant SU(2) gauged Grassmanian model are sought. A stronger (anti)selfduality condition for this system is defined, referred to as strong self-duality, and spherically symmetric solutions of this {\it strong} (anti)self-duality equations are found in closed form. It is verified that these are the only solutions of the strong (anti)self-duality equations. The usual (anti)self-duality equations for the axially symmetric fields are derived and seen to be not overdetermined.
