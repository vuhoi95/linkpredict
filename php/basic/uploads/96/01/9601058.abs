Title: Finite [q-Oscillator] Description of 2-D String Theory
Authors: Antal Jevicki and Andre van Tonder
Abstract: We present a simple physical representation for states of the two-dimensional string theory. In order to incorporate a fundamental cutoff of the order 1/g we use a picture consisting of q-oscillators at the first-quantized level. In this framework we also find a representation for the (singular) negatively dressed states representing nontrivial string backgrounds.
