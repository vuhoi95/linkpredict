Title: Algebraic Bethe Ansatz for XYZ Gaudin model
Authors: E. K. Sklyanin and T. Takebe
Abstract: The eigenvectors of the Hamiltionians of the XYZ Gaudin model are constructed by means of the algebraic Bethe Ansatz. The construction is based on the quasi-classical limit of the corresponding results for the inhomogeneous higher spin eight vertex model.
