Title: QED(1+1) at Finite Temperature -- a Study with Light-Cone Quantisation
Authors: Stephan Elser and Alex C. Kalloniatis
Abstract: We explore quantum electrodynamics in (1+1) dimensions at finite temperature using the method of Discretized Light-Cone Quantisation. The partition function, energy and specific heat are computed in the canonical ensemble using the spectrum of invariant masses computed with a standard DLCQ numerical routine. In particular, the specific heat exhibits a peak which grows as the continuum limit is numerically approached. A critical exponent is tentatively extracted. The surprising result is that the density of states contains significant finite size artifacts even for a relatively high harmonic resolution. These and the other outstanding problems in the present calculation are discussed.
