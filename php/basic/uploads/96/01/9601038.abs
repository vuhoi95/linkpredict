Title: Consistency Conditions for Orientifolds and D-Manifolds
Authors: Eric G. Gimon and Joseph Polchinski
Abstract: We study superstrings with orientifold projections and with generalized open string boundary conditions (D-branes). We find two types of consistency condition, one related to the algebra of Chan-Paton factors and the other to cancellation of divergences. One consequence is that the Dirichlet 5-branes of the Type I theory carry a symplectic gauge group, as required by string duality. As another application we study the Type I theory on a $K3$ $Z_2$ orbifold, finding a family of consistent theories with various unitary and symplectic subgroups of $U(16) \times U(16)$. We argue that the $K3$ orbifold with spin connection embedded in gauge connection corresponds to an interacting conformal field theory in the Type I theory.
