Title: Temperature Expansions for Magnetic Systems
Authors: Daniel Cangemi and Gerald Dunne
Abstract: We derive finite temperature expansions for relativistic fermion systems in the presence of background magnetic fields, and with nonzero chemical potential. We use the imaginary-time formalism for the finite temperature effects, the proper-time method for the background field effects, and zeta function regularization for developing the expansions. We emphasize the essential difference between even and odd dimensions, focusing on $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions. We concentrate on the high temperature limit, but we also discuss the $T=0$ limit with nonzero chemical potential.
