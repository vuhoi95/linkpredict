Title: QKZ equation with |q|=1 and correlation functions of the XXZ model in  the gapless regime
Authors: Michio Jimbo and Tetsuji Miwa
Abstract: An integral solution to the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov ($q$KZ) equation with $|q|=1$ is presented. Upon specialization, it leads to a conjectural formula for correlation functions of the XXZ model in the gapless regime. The validity of this conjecture is verified in special cases, including the nearest neighbor correlator with an arbitrary coupling constant, and general correlators in the XXX and XY limits.
