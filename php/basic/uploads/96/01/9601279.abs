Title: QCD Interference Effects of Heavy Particles Below Threshold
Authors: Per Kraus and Frank Wilczek
Abstract: We consider how two classes of heavy particles: extra vector-like families, and strongly interacting superpartners, manifest themselves below threshold, by interference of virtual loops with normal QCD processes. Quantitative estimates are presented.
