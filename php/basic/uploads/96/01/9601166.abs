Title: General Static Solutions of 2-dimensional  Einstein-Dilaton-Maxwell-Scalar Theories
Authors: Dahl Park and Youngjai Kiem
Abstract: General static solutions of effectively 2-dimensional Einstein-Dilaton-Maxwell-Scalar theories are obtained. Our model action includes a class of 2-d dilaton gravity theories coupled with a $U(1)$ gauge field and a massless scalar field. Therefore it also describes the spherically symmetric reduction of $d$-dimensional Einstein-Scalar-Maxwell theories. The properties of the analytic solutions are briefly discussed.
