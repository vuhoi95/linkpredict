Title: New Generalized Poisson Structures
Authors: J. A. de Azcarraga and A. M. Perelomov and J. C. Perez Bueno
Abstract: New generalized Poisson structures are introduced by using suitable skew-symmetric contravariant tensors of even order. The corresponding `Jacobi identities' are provided by conditions on these tensors, which may be understood as cocycle conditions. As an example, we provide the linear generalized Poisson structures which can be constructed on the dual spaces of simple Lie algebras.
