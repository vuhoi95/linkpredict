Title: A quadratic curvature Lagrangian of Paw≈Çowski and Rcaczka: a  finger exercise with MathTensor
Authors: Efstratios Tsantilis and Roland A. Puntigam and Friedrich W. Hehl
Abstract: Recently Paw{\l}owski and R\c{a}czka proposed a unified model for the fundamental interactions which does not contain a physical Higgs field. The gravitational field equation of their model is rederived under heavy use of the computer algebra system Mathematica and its package MathTensor.
