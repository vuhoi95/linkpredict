Title: Unitarity of rational N=2 superconformal theories
Authors: W. Eholzer and M. R. Gaberdiel
Abstract: We demonstrate that all rational models of the N=2 super Virasoro algebra are unitary. Our arguments are based on three different methods: we determine Zhu's algebra (for which we give a physically motivated derivation) explicitly for certain theories, we analyse the modular properties of some of the vacuum characters, and we use the coset realisation of the algebra in terms of su_2 and two free fermions. Some of our arguments generalise to the Kazama-Suzuki models indicating that all rational N=2 supersymmetric models might be unitary.
