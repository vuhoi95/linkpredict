Title: Mass generation for gauge fields in the Salam-Weinberg theory without  Higgs
Authors: J. Barcelos-Neto and S. Rabello
Abstract: We consider the Salam-Weinberg theory by introducing tensor gauge fields. When these fields are coupled in a topological way with the vector ones, the resulting system constitutes an alternative mechanism of mass generation for vector fields without the presence of Higgs bosons. We show that these masses are in agreement with the ones obtained by means of the spontaneous symmetry breaking.
