Title: Thermodynamics for Fractional Exclusion Statistics
Authors: Serguei B. Isakov and Daniel P. Arovas and Jan Myrheim and Alexios P. Polychronakos
Abstract: We discuss the thermodynamics of a gas of free particles obeying Haldane's exclusion statistics, deriving low temperature and low density expansions. For gases with a constant density of states, we derive an exact equation of state and find that temperature-dependent quantities are independent of the statistics parameter.
