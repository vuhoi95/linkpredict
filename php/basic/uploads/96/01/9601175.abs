Title: Truly Strong Coupling and Large Radius in String Theory
Authors: Michael Dine and Yuri Shirman
Abstract: String theory, if it describes nature, is probably strongly coupled. In light of recent developments in string duality, this means that the ``real world'' should correspond to a region of the classical moduli space which admits no weak coupling description. We exhibit, in the heterotic string, one such region of the moduli space, in which the coupling, $\lambda$, is large and the ``compactification radius'' scales as $\lambda^{1/3}$. We discuss some of the issues raised by the conjecture that the true vacuum lies in such a region. These include the question of coupling constant unification, and more generally the problem of what quantities one might hope to calculate and compare with experiment in such a picture.
