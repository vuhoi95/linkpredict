Title: Geometry and Duality in Supersymmetric sigma-Models
Authors: Thomas Curtright and Tsuneo Uematsu and Cosmas Zachos
Abstract: The Supersymmetric Dual Sigma Model (SDSM) is a local field theory introduced to be nonlocally equivalent to the Supersymmetric Chiral nonlinear sigma-Model (SCM), this dual equivalence being proven by explicit canonical transformation in tangent space. This model is here reconstructed in superspace and identified as a chiral-entwined supersymmetrization of the Dual Sigma Model (DSM). This analysis sheds light on the Boson-Fermion Symphysis of the dual transition, and on the new geometry of the DSM.
