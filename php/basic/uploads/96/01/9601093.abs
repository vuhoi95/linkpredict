Title: Oscillator as a hidden non-Abelian monopole
Authors: L. G. Mardoyan and A. N. Sissakian and V. M. Ter-Antonyan
Abstract: A non--Abelian $SU(2)$ model is constructed for a five--dimensional bound system "charge--dyon" on the basis of the Hurwitz--transformed eight--dimensional isotropic quantum oscillator. The principle of dyon--oscillator duality is formulated; the energy spectrum and wave functions of the system "charge--dyon" are calculated.
