Title: Soliton equations and the zero curvature condition in noncommutative  geometry
Authors: A. Dimakis and F. Mueller-Hoissen
Abstract: Familiar nonlinear and in particular soliton equations arise as zero curvature conditions for GL(1,R) connections with noncommutative differential calculi. The Burgers equation is formulated in this way and the Cole-Hopf transformation for it attains the interpretation of a transformation of the connection to a pure gauge in this mathematical framework. The KdV, modified KdV equation and the Miura transformation are obtained jointly in a similar setting and a rather straightforward generalization leads to the KP and a modified KP equation. Furthermore, a differential calculus associated with the Boussinesq equation is derived from the KP calculus.
