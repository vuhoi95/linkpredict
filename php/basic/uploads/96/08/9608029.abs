Title: Intersection theory on moduli spaces of holomorphic bundles of arbitrary  rank on a Riemann surface
Authors: Lisa C. Jeffrey and Frances C. Kirwan
Abstract: We prove formulas (found by Witten in 1992 using physical methods) for intersection pairings in the cohomology of the moduli space M(n,d) of stable holomorphic vector bundles of rank n and degree d (assumed coprime) on a Riemann surface of genus g greater than or equal to 2. We also use these formulas for intersection numbers to obtain a proof of the Verlinde formula for the dimension of the space of holomorphic sections of a line bundle over M(n,d).
