Title: Vanishing of Cosmological Constant in Dual Supergravity
Authors: M. V. Terentiev and K. N. Zyablyuk
Abstract: The vacuun configuration of dual supergravity in ten dimensions with one-loop fivebrane corrections is analyzed. It is shown that the compactification of this theory with rather general conditions to six-dimensional space leads to zero value of cosmological constant.
