Title: Condensation of p-branes and generalized Higgs/confinement duality
Authors: Fernando Quevedo and Carlo Trugenberger
Abstract: We review our recent work on the low-energy actions and the realizations of strong-weak coupling dualities in non-perturbative phases of compact antisymmetric tensor field theories due to p-brane condensation. As examples we derive and discuss the confining string and confining membrane actions obtained from compact vector and tensor theories in 4D. We also mention the relevance of our results for the description of the Hagedorn phase transition of finite temperature strings.
