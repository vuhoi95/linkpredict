Title: Vacuum energy in a spherically symmetric background field
Authors: M. Bordag and K. Kirsten
Abstract: The vacuum energy of a scalar field in a spherically symmetric background field is considered. It is expressed through the Jost function of the corresponding scattering problem. The renormalization is discussed in detail and performed using the uniform asymptotic expansion of the Jost function. The method is demonstrated in a simple explicit example.
