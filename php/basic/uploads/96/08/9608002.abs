Title: Solutions of a discretized Toda field equation for $D_{r}$ from Analytic  Bethe Ansatz
Authors: Zengo Tsuboi and Atsuo Kuniba
Abstract: Commuting transfer matrices of $U_{q}(X_{r}^{(1)})$ vertex models obey the functional relations which can be viewed as an $X_{r}$ type Toda field equation on discrete space time. Based on analytic Bethe ansatz we present, for $X_{r}=D_{r}$, a new expression of its solution in terms of determinants and Pfaffians.
