Title: Different D-brane Interactions
Authors: H. Arfaei and M. M. Sheikh Jabbari
Abstract: We use rotation of one D-brane with respect to the other to reveal the hidden structure of D-branes in type-II theories. This is done by calculation of the interaction amplitude for two different parallel and angled branes. The analysis of strings with different boundary conditions at the ends is also given. The stable configuration for two similar branes occurs when they are anti-parallel. For branes of different dimensions stability is attained for either parallel or anti-parallel configurations and when dimensions differ by four the amplitude vanishes at the stable point. The results serve as more evidence that D-branes are stringy descriptions of non-perturbative extended solutions of SUGRA theories, as low energy approximation of superstrings.
