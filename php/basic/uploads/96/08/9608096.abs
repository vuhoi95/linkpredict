Title: Elliptic Genera of Symmetric Products and Second Quantized Strings
Authors: R. Dijkgraaf and G. Moore and E. Verlinde and H. Verlinde
Abstract: In this note we prove an identity that equates the elliptic genus partition function of a supersymmetric sigma model on the N-fold symmetric product $M^N/S_N$ of a manifold M to the partition function of a second quantized string theory on the space $M \times S^1$. The generating function of these elliptic genera is shown to be (almost) an automorphic form for O(3,2,Z). In the context of D-brane dynamics, this result gives a precise computation of the free energy of a gas of D-strings inside a higher-dimensional brane.
