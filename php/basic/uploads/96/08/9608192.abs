Title: Massless fermions in a bag at finite density and temperature
Authors: M. De Francia and H. Falomir and M. Loewe
Abstract: We introduce the chemical potential in a system of massless fermions in a bag by impossing boundary conditions in the Euclidean time direction. We express the fermionic mean number in terms of a functional trace involving the Green's function of the boundary value problem, which we study analytically. Numerical evaluations are made, and an application to a simple hadron model is discussed.
