Title: Pair Creation and Evolution of Black Holes During Inflation
Authors: Raphael Bousso and Stephen W. Hawking
Abstract: We summarise recent work on the quantum production of black holes in the inflationary era. We describe, in simple terms, the Euclidean approach used, and the results obtained both for the pair creation rate and for the evolution of the black holes.
