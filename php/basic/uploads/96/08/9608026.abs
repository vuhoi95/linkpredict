Title: A Covariant Approach To Ashtekar's Canonical Gravity
Authors: Brian P. Dolan and Kevin P. Haugh
Abstract: A Lorentz and general co-ordinate co-variant form of canonical gravity, using Ashtekar's variables, is investigated. A co-variant treatment due to Crnkovic and Witten is used, in which a point in phase space represents a solution of the equations of motion and a symplectic functional two form is constructed which is Lorentz and general co-ordinate invariant. The subtleties and difficulties due to the complex nature of Ashtekar's variables are addressed and resolved.
