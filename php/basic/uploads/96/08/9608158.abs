Title: A Relation between the Anomalous Dimensions and OPE Coefficients in  Asymptotic Free Field Theories
Authors: Hidenori Sonoda and Wang-Chang Su
Abstract: In asymptotic free field theories we show that part of the OPE of the trace of the stress-energy tensor and an arbitrary composite field is determined by the anomalous dimension of the composite field. We take examples from the two-dimensional O(N) non-linear sigma model.
