Title: Collapse versus Turbulence
Authors: L. A. Abramyan and V. I. Berezhiani and A. P. Protogenov
Abstract: We study the solutions of the equations of motion in the gauged (2+1)-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger model. The contribution of Chern-Simons gauge fields leads to a significant decrease of the critical power of self-focusing. We also show that at appropriate boundary conditions in the considered model there exists a regime of turbulent motions of hydrodynamic type.
