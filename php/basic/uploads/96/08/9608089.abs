Title: Determinant of Laplacian on a non-compact 3-dimensional hyperbolic  manifold with finite volume
Authors: A. A. Bytsenko and Guido Cognola and Sergio Zerbini
Abstract: The functional determinant of Laplace-type operators on the 3-dimensional non-compact hyperbolic manifold with invariant fundamental domain of finite volume is computed by quadratures and making use of the related terms of the Selberg trace formula.
