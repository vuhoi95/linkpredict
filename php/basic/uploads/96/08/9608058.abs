Title: How to treat $Î³_5$
Authors: Hung Cheng and S. P. Li
Abstract: We present a method to perform renormalized perturbation calculation in gauge theories with chiral fermions. We find it proper to focus directly on the Ward-Takahashi identities, relegating dimensional regularization into a supplementary and secondary role. We show with the example of the Abelian-Higgs theory how to handle amplitudes involving fermions, particularly how to handle the matrix $\gamma_5$. As a demonstration of our method of renormalization, we evaluate the radiative corrections of the triangular anomaly in the Abelian-Higgs theory with appropriate number of chiral fermions. This anomaly amplitude is calculated without any regularization and is found to vanish.
