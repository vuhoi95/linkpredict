Title: Baryogenesis and phase transition in the standard model
Authors: D. Karczewska and R. Manka
Abstract: The sphaleron type solution in the electroweak theory, generalized to include the dilaton field, is examined. The solutions describe both the variarions of Higgs and Gauge fields inside the sphaleron and the shape of the dilaton cloud surrounding the sphaleron. Such a cloud is large and extends far outside. These phenomena may play an important role during the baryogenesis which probably took place in the Early Universe.
