Title: On Euclidean spinors and Wick rotations
Authors: Peter van Nieuwenhuizen and Andrew Waldron
Abstract: We propose a continuous Wick rotation for Dirac, Majorana and Weyl spinors from Minkowski spacetime to Euclidean space which treats fermions on the same footing as bosons. The result is a recipe to construct a supersymmetric Euclidean theory from any supersymmetric Minkowski theory. This Wick rotation is identified as a complex Lorentz boost in a five-dimensional space and acts uniformly on bosons and fermions. For Majorana and Weyl spinors our approach is reminiscent of the traditional Osterwalder Schrader approach in which spinors are ``doubled'' but the action is not hermitean. However, for Dirac spinors our work provides a link to the work of Schwinger and Zumino in which hermiticity is maintained but spinors are not doubled. Our work differs from recent work by Mehta since we introduce no external metric and transform only the basic fields.
