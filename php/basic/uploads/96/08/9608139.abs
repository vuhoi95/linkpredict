Title: The unmasking of thermal Goldstone bosons
Authors: Jacques Bros and Detlev Buchholz
Abstract: The problem of extracting the modes of Goldstone bosons from a thermal background is reconsidered in the framework of relativistic quantum field theory. It is shown that in the case of spontaneous breakdown of an internal bosonic symmetry a recently established decomposition of thermal correlation functions contains certain specific contributions which can be attributed to a particle of zero mass.
