Title: Strings And Dyonic Plasmas
Authors: O. Coceal and W. A. Sabra and S. Thomas
Abstract: Recently Olesen has shown the existence of dual string solutions to the equations of ideal Magnetohydrodynamics that describe the long wavelength properties of electrically charged plasmas. Here, we extend these solutions to include the case of plasmas consisting of point like dyons, which carry both electric and magnetic charge. Such strings are dyonic in that they consist of both magnetic and electric flux. We contrast some physical features of dyonic plasmas with those of the purely electric or magnetic type, particularly in relation to the validity of the ideal approximation.
