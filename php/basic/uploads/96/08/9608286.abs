Title: Defect-Antidefect pair production via field oscillations
Authors: Sanatan Digal and Supratim Sengupta and Ajit M. Srivastava
Abstract: We show that the mechanism of vortex-antivortex pair production via field oscillations, earlier proposed by two of us for systems with first order transitions in presence of explicit symmetry breaking, is in fact very generally applicable. We further argue that this mechanism applies to all sorts of topological defects (e.g. strings, monopoles, textures) and for second order transitions as well. We also show this explicitly by numerically simulating production of vortex-antivortex pairs by decay of bubble walls for a U(1) global theory in the absence of any explicit symmetry breaking.
