Title: N=2 Moduli Spaces and N=1 Dualities for SO(n_c) and USp(2n_c) SuperQCD
Authors: Philip C. Argyres and M. Ronen Plesser and Alfred D. Shapere
Abstract: We determine the exact global structure of the moduli space of $N{=}2$ supersymmetric $SO(n)$ and $\USp(2n)$ gauge theories with matter hypermultiplets in the fundamental representations, using the non-renormalization theorem for the Higgs branches and the exact solutions for the Coulomb branches. By adding an $(N{=}2)$--breaking mass term for the adjoint chiral field and varying the mass, the $N{=}2$ theories can be made to flow to either an ``electric'' $N{=}1$ supersymmetric QCD or its $N{=}1$ dual ``magnetic'' version. We thus obtain a derivation of the $N{=}1$ dualities of Seiberg.
