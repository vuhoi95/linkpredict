Title: Causality in Covariant String Field Theory
Authors: Hiroyuki Hata and Hajime Oda
Abstract: Causality is studied in the covariant formulation of free string field theory (SFT). We find that, though the string field in the covariant formulation is a functional of the ghost coordinates as well as the space-time coordinate and the latter contains the time-like oscillators with negative norm, the condition for the commutator of two open string fields to vanish is simply given by $\int_0^\pi d\sigma\left(\Delta X^\mu(\sigma)\right)^2 >0$, which is the same condition as in the light-cone gauge SFT. For closed SFT, the corresponding condition is given in a form which is manifestly invariant under the rigid shifts of the $\sigma$ parameters of the two string fields.
