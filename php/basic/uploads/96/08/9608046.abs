Title: Dual Descriptions of Supersymmetry Breaking
Authors: Kenneth Intriligator and Scott Thomas
Abstract: Dynamical supersymmetry breaking is considered in models which admit descriptions in terms of electric, confined, or magnetic degrees of freedom in various limits. In this way, a variety of seemingly different theories which break supersymmetry are actually inter-related by confinement or duality. Specific examples are given in which there are two dual descriptions of the supersymmetry breaking ground state.
