Title: The standard model in the on-shell scheme
Authors: Elisabeth Kraus and Klaus Sibold
Abstract: We outline the renormalization of the standard model to all orders of perturbation theory in a way which does not make essential use of a specific subtraction scheme but is based on the Slavnov-Taylor identity. Physical fields and parameters are used throughout the paper. The Ward-identity for the global gauge invariance of the vertex functions is formulated. As an application the Callan-Symanzik equation is derived.
