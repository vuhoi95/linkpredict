Title: Cosmological Solutions of Type II String Theory
Authors: Andre Lukas and Burt A. Ovrut and Daniel Waldram
Abstract: We study cosmological solutions of type II string theory with a metric of the Kaluza--Klein type and nontrivial Ramond--Ramond forms. It is shown that models with only one form excited can be integrated in general. Moreover, some interesting cases with two nontrivial forms can be solved completely since they correspond to Toda models. We find two types of solutions corresponding to a negative time superinflating phase and a positive time subluminal expanding phase. The two branches are separated by a curvature singularity. Within each branch the effect of the forms is to interpolate between different solutions of pure Kaluza--Klein theory.
