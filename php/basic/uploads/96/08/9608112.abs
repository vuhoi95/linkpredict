Title: Yang-Mills fields for Cosets
Authors: J. Grundberg and U. Lindstrom and M. Rocek
Abstract: We consider theories with degenerate kinetic terms such as those that arise at strong coupling in $N=2$ super Yang-Mills theory. We compute the components of generalized $N=1,2$ supersymmetric sigma model actions in two dimensions. The target space coordinates may be matter and/or Yang-Mills superfield strengths.
