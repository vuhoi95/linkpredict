Title: Non-Integrability of Two-Dimensional QCD
Authors: Werner Krauth and Matthias Staudacher
Abstract: In this paper we numerically demonstrate that massless two-dimensional QCD is not integrable. To this aim, we explicitly solve the 't Hooft integral equation for bound states by an adaptive spline procedure, and compute the decay amplitudes. These amplitudes significantly differ from zero except in all cases in which the decay also produces a pion.
