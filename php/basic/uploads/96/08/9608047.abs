Title: An N=2 Superconformal Fixed Point with E_6 Global Symmetry
Authors: Joseph A. Minahan and Dennis Nemeschansky
Abstract: We obtain the elliptic curve corresponding to an $N=2$ superconformal field theory which has an $E_6$ global symmetry at the strong coupling point $\tau=e^{\pi i/3}$. We also find the Seiberg-Witten differential $\lambda_{SW}$ for this theory. This differential has 27 poles corresponding to the fundamental representation of $E_6$. The complex conjugate representation has its poles on the other sheet. We also show that the $E_6$ curve reduces to the $D_4$ curve of Seiberg and Witten. Finally, we compute the monodromies and use these to compute BPS masses in an $F$-Theory compactification.
