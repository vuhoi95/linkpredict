Abstract: We discuss the equivalence between Type I, Type II and Heterotic N=2 superstring theories in four dimensions. We study the effective field theory of Type I models obtained by orientifold reductions of Type IIB compactifications on $K_3\times T^2$. We show that the perturbative prepotential is determined by the one-loop corrections to the Planck mass and is associated to an index. As is the case for threshold corrections to gauge couplings, this renormalization is entirely due to N=2 BPS states that originate from D=6 massless string modes. We apply our result to the so-called S-T-U model which admits simultaneous Type II and Heterotic descriptions, and show that all three prepotentials agree in the appropriate limits as expected from the superstring triality conjecture.
