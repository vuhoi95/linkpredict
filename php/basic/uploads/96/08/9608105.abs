Title: Three Dimensional Gauge Theories and Monopoles
Authors: Gordon Chalmers and Amihay Hanany
Abstract: The coulomb branch of $N=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills gauge theories in $d=2+1$ is studied. A direct connection between gauge theories and monopole moduli spaces is presented. It is proposed that the hyper-K\"ahler metric of supersymmetric $N=4$ $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory is given by the charge $N$ centered moduli space of BPS monopoles in $SU(2)$. The theory is compared to $N=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions through compactification on a circle of the latter. It is found that rational maps are appropriate to this comparison. A BPS mass formula is also written for particles in three dimensions and strings in four dimensions.
