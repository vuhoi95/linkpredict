Title: The Oscillatory Behavior of the High-Temperature Expansion of Dyson's  Hierarchical Model: A Renormalization Group Analysis
Authors: Y. Meurice and S. Niermann and G. Ordaz
Abstract: We calculate 800 coefficients of the high-temperature expansion of the magnetic susceptibility of Dyson's hierarchical model with a Landau-Ginzburg measure. Log-periodic corrections to the scaling laws appear as in the case of a Ising measure. The period of oscillation appears to be a universal quantity given in good approximation by the logarithm of the largest eigenvalue of the linearized RG transformation, in agreement with a possibility suggested by K. Wilson and developed by Niemeijer and van Leeuwen. We estimate $\gamma $ to be 1.300 (with a systematic error of the order of 0.002) in good agreement with the results obtained with other methods such as the $\epsilon $-expansion. We briefly discuss the relationship between the oscillations and the zeros of the partition function near the critical point in the complex temperature plane.
