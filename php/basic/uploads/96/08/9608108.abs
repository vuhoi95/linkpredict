Title: Emission of charged particles from four- and five-dimensional black  holes
Authors: Steven S. Gubser and Igor R. Klebanov
Abstract: Recently Das and Mathur found that the leading order Hawking emission rate of neutral scalars by near-extremal $D=5$ black holes is exactly reproduced by a string theoretic model involving intersecting D-branes. We show that the agreement continues to hold for charged scalar emission. We further show that similar agreement can be obtained for a class of near-extremal $D=4$ black holes using a model inspired by M-theory. In this model, BPS saturated $D=4$ black holes with four charges are realized in M-theory as 5-branes triply intersecting over a string. The low-energy excitations are signals traveling on the intersection string.
