Title: Phase Transitions in Softly Broken N=2 SQCD at Non-zero Theta Angle
Authors: N. Evans and S. D. H. Hsu and M. Schwetz
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of softly broken $N=2$ SQCD at non-zero bare theta angle $\theta_0$, using superfield spurions to implement the SUSY breaking. We find a first-order phase transition as $\theta_0$ is varied from zero to $2 \pi$, in agreement with a prediction of `t Hooft. The low-energy theta angle $\theta_{eff}$, which determines the effective charges of dyonic excitations, has a complicated dependence on $\theta_0$ and breaking parameters.
