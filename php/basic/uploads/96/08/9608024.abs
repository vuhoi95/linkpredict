Authors: Tchavdar D. Palev and Preeti Parashar
Abstract: An alternative to the Chevalley description of Lie algebra sl(n+1), of its universal enveloping algebra U[sl(n+1)] and of its q-deformed analogue U_q[sl(n+1)] in terms of generators, called creation and annihilation generators (CAGs), and relations is given. It is indicated (without further discussions) that the representations of the CAGs describe new quantum statistics, which is a particular case of the Haldane exclusion statistics.
