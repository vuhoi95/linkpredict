Abstract: We analyze the phenomenon of preheating,i.e. explosive particle production due to parametric amplification of quantum fluctuations in the unbroken case, or spinodal instabilities in the broken phase, using the Minkowski space $O(N)$ vector model in the large $N$ limit to study the non-perturbative issues involved. We give analytic results for weak couplings and times short compared to the time at which the fluctuations become of the same order as the tree level,as well as numerical results including the full backreaction.In the case where the symmetry is unbroken, the analytic results agree spectacularly well with the numerical ones in their common domain of validity. In the broken symmetry case, slow roll initial conditions from the unstable minimum at the origin, give rise to a new and unexpected phenomenon: the dynamical relaxation of the vacuum energy.That is, particles are abundantly produced at the expense of the quantum vacuum energy while the zero mode comes back to almost its initial value.In both cases we obtain analytically and numerically the equation of state which turns to be written in terms of an effective polytropic index that interpolates between vacuum and radiation-like domination. We find that simplified analysis based on harmonic behavior of the zero mode, giving rise to a Mathieu equation forthe non-zero modes miss important physics. Furthermore, analysis that do not include the full backreaction do not conserve energy, resulting in unbound particle production. Our results do not support the recent claim of symmetry restoration by non-equilibrium fluctuations.Finally estimates of the reheating temperature are given,as well as a discussion of the inconsistency of a kinetic approach to thermalization when a non-perturbatively large number of particles is created.
