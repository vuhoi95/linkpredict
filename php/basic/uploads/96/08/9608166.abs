Title: Two-dimensional Superintegrable Mappings and Integrable Hierarchies in  the $(2|2)$ Superspace
Authors: A. N. Leznov and A. S. Sorin
Abstract: The formalism of integrable mappings is applied to the problem of constructing hierarchies of $(1+2)$ dimensional integrable systems in the $(2|2)$ superspace. We find new supersymmetric integrable mappings and corresponding to them new hierarchies of integrable systems which, at the reduction to the $(1|2)$ superspace, possess $N=2$ supersymmetry. The general formulae obtained for the hierarchies are used to explicitly derive their first nontrivial equations possessing a manifest $N=2$ supersymmetry. New bosonic substitutions and hierarchies are obtained from the supersymmetric counterparts in the bosonic limit.
