Abstract: We show how toroidally-compactified eleven-dimensional supergravity can be consistently truncated to yield a variety of maximally-supersymmetric ``massive'' supergravities in spacetime dimensions $D\le 8$. The mass terms arise as a consequence of making a more general ansatz than that in usual Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction, in which one or more axions are given an additional linear dependence on one of the compactification coordinates. The lower-dimensional theories are nevertheless consistent truncations of eleven-dimensional supergravity. Owing to the fact that the generalised reduction commutes neither with U-duality nor with ordinary dimensional reduction, many different massive theories can result. The simplest examples arise when just a single axion has the additional linear coordinate dependence. We find five inequivalent such theories in D=7, and 71 inequivalent ones in D=4. The massive theories admit no maximally-symmetric vacuum solution, but they do admit $(D-2)$-brane solutions, i.e. domain walls, which preserve half the supersymmetry. We present examples of these solutions, and their oxidations to D=11. Some of the latter are new solutions of D=11 supergravity.
