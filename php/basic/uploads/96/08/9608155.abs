Title: On the physical Hilbert space of QCD$_2$ in the decoupled formulation
Authors: D. C. Cabra and K. D. Rothe
Abstract: We consider the QCD$_2$ partition function in the non-local, decoupled formulation and systematically establish which subset of the nilpotent Noether charges is required to vanish on the physical states. The implications for the Hilbert space structure are also examined.
