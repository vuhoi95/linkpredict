Title: A Locally Supersymmetric Action for the Scalar Particle
Authors: Fiorenzo Bastianelli and Luca Consoli
Abstract: We construct a locally supersymmetric action for the scalar particle, and study its relation with the usual reparametrization invariant action. The mechanisms at work are similar to those employed in the embedding of the bosonic string into the fermionic one, originally due to Berkovits and Vafa in their search for a universal string. The simpler algebraic structure present in the particle case provides us with a guide on how to prove in a simple way, without the need of fixing the superconformal gauge, that the supersymmetric formulation of the bosonic string is equivalent to the usual one, where reparametrization invariance is the only world-sheet gauge symmetry.
