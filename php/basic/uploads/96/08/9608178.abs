Title: BRST-BFV method for nonstationary systems
Authors: J. Antonio Garc√≠a and J. David Vergara and Luis F. Urrutia
Abstract: Starting from an associated reparametrization-invariant action, the generalization of the BRST-BFV method for the case of nonstationary systems is constructed. The extension of the Batalin-Tyutin conversional approach is also considered in the nonstationary case. In order to illustrate these ideas, the propagator for the time-dependent two-dimensional rotor is calculated by reformulating the problem as a system with only first class constraints and subsequently using the BRST-BFV prescription previously obtained.
