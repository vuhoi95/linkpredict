Title: Modular Symmetries of N=2 Black Holes
Authors: Gabriel Lopes Cardoso and Dieter Lust and Thomas Mohaupt
Abstract: We discuss the transformation properties of classical extremal N=2 black hole solutions in S-T-U like models under S and T duality. Using invariants of (subgroups of) the triality group, which is the symmetry group of the classical BPS mass formula, the transformation properties of the moduli on the event horizon and of the entropy under these transformations become manifest. We also comment on quantum corrections and we make a conjecture for the one-loop corrected entropy.
