Abstract: We evaluate the Polyakov loop and string tension at zero and finite temperature in $QED_2.$ Using bozonization the problem is reduced to solving the Schr\"odinger equation with a particular potential determined by the ground state. In the presence of two sources of opposite charges the vacuum angle parameter $\theta $ changes by $2\pi (q/e)$, independent of the number of flavors. This, in turn, alters the chiral condensate. Particularly, in the one flavor case through a simple computer algorithm, we explore the chiral dynamics of a heavy fermion.
