Title: Photon inner product and the Gauss linking number
Authors: Abhay Ashtekar and Alejandro Corichi
Abstract: It is shown that there is an interesting interplay between self-duality, loop representation and knots invariants in the quantum theory of Maxwell fields in Minkowski space-time. Specifically, in the loop representation based on self-dual connections, the measure that dictates the inner product can be expressed as the Gauss linking number of thickened loops.
