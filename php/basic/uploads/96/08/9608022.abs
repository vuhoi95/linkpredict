Title: String Theory and the CPT Theorem on the World-Sheet
Authors: Andrea Pasquinucci and Kaj Roland
Abstract: We study the CPT theorem for a two-dimensional conformal field theory on an arbitrary Riemann surface. On the sphere the theorem follows from the assumption that the correlation functions have standard hermiticity properties and are invariant under the transformation $z \rightarrow 1/z$. The theorem can then be extended to higher genus surfaces by sewing. We show that, as a consequence of the CPT theorem on the world-sheet, the scattering $T$-matrix in string theory is {\sl formally\/} hermitean at any loop order.
