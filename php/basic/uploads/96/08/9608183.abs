Title: Exceptional SW Geometry from ALE Fibrations
Authors: W. Lerche and N. P. Warner
Abstract: We show that the genus 34 Seiberg-Witten curve underlying $N=2$ Yang-Mills theory with gauge group $E_6$ yields physically equivalent results to the manifold obtained by fibration of the $E_6$ ALE singularity. This reconciles a puzzle raised by $N=2$ string duality.
