Title: An interpolation between Bose, Fermi and Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics  based on Jack Polynomials
Authors: S. Chaturvedi and V. Srinivasan
Abstract: An interpolation between the canonical partition functions of Bose, Fermi and Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics is proposed. This interpolation makes use of the properties of Jack polynomials and leads to a physically appealing interpolation between the statistical weights of the three statistics. This, in turn, can be used to define a new exclusion statistics in the spirit of the work of Haldane.
