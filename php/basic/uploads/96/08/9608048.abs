Title: Is the $ISO(2,1)$ Gauge Gravity equivalent to the Metric Formulation?
Authors: Jin-Ho Cho and Hyuk-jae Lee
Abstract: The quantization of the gravitational Chern-Simons coefficient is investigated in the framework of $ISO(2,1)$ gauge gravity. Some paradoxes involved are cured. The resolution is largely based on the inequivalence of $ISO(2,1)$ gauge gravity and the metric formulation. Both the Lorentzian scheme and the Euclidean scheme lead to the coefficient quantization, which means that the induced spin is not quite exotic in this context.
