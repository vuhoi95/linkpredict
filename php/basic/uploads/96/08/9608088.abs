Abstract: A pseudoclassical theories of Majorana, Weyl and Majorana--Weyl particles in the space--time dimensions $D=2n$ are constructed. The canonical quantization of these theories is carried out and as a result we obtain the quantum mechanical description of neutral particle in $D=2n$ , Weyl particle in $D=2n$ and neutral Weyl particle in $D=4n+2$. In $D=2,4({\rm mod}8)$ dimensional space--time the description of the neutral particle coincides with the field theoretical description of the Majorana particle in the Foldy--Wouthuysen representation. In $D=8k+2$ dimensions the neutral Weyl particle coincides with the Majorana--Weyl particle in the Foldy--Wouthuysen representation.
