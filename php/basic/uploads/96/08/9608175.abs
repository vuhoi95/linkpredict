Title: Three Applications of the String-Inspired Technique to Quantum  Electrodynamics
Authors: Denny Fliegner and Michael G. Schmidt and Christian Schubert
Abstract: We discuss the following recent applications of the ``string-inspired'' worldline technique to calculations in quantum electrodynamics: i) Photon splitting in a constant magnetic field, ii) The two-loop Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian, iii) A progress report on a recalculation of the three-loop QED beta -- function.
