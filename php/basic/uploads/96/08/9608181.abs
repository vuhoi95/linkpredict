Title: Thermalization and Lyapunov Exponents in the Yang-Mills-Higgs Theory
Authors: U. Heinz and C. Hu and S. Leupold and S. Matinyan and B. Muller
Abstract: We investigate thermalization processes occurring at different time scales in the Yang-Mills-Higgs system at high temperatures. We determine the largest Lyapunov exponent associated with the gauge fields and verify its relation to the perturbatively calculated damping rate of a static gauge boson.
