Title: Monte Carlo computation of the effective potential for the three  dimensional Ising system
Authors: Jae-Kwon Kim and D. P. Landau
Abstract: Using a novel finite size scaling Monte Carlo technique, we calculate the four, six and eight point renormalized coupling constants defined at zero momentum for the three dimensional Ising system. Our values of the six and eight point coupling constants are significantly different from those obtained from other methods.
