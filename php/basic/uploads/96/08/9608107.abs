Title: Manifestly Supersymmetric Lax Integrable Hierarchies
Authors: H. Aratyn and C. Rasinariu
Abstract: A systematic method of constructing manifestly supersymmetric $1+1$-dimensional KP Lax hierarchies is presented. Closed expressions for the Lax operators in terms of superfield eigenfunctions are obtained. All hierarchy equations being eigenfunction equations are shown to be automatically invariant under the (extended) supersymmetry. The supersymmetric Lax models existing in the literature are found to be contained (up to a gauge equivalence) in our formalism.
