Title: Spinors and forms on generalised cones
Authors: J. S. Dowker and Klaus Kirsten
Abstract: A method is presented, and used, for determining any heat-kernel coefficient for the form-valued Laplacian on the $D$-ball as an explicit function of dimension and form order. The calculation is offerred as a particular application of a general technique developed earlier for obtaining heat-kernel coefficients on a bounded generalised cone which involves writing the sphere and ball \zfs, and coefficients, in terms of Barnes \zfs\ and generalised Bernoulli polynomials. Functional determinants are computed. Spinors are also treated by the general method.
