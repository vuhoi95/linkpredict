Title: Scattering of Plane Waves in Self-Dual Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: V. E. Korepin and T. Oota
Abstract: We consider the classical self-dual Yang-Mills equation in 3+1-dimensional Minkowski space. We have found an exact solution, which describes scattering of $n$ plane waves. In order to write the solution in a compact form, it is convenient to introduce a scattering operator $\hat{T}$. It acts in the direct product of three linear spaces: 1) universal enveloping of $su(N)$ Lie algebra, 2) $n$-dimensional vector space and 3) space of functions defined on the unit interval.
