Title: Summing up D-Instantons
Authors: Hirosi Ooguri and Cumrun Vafa
Abstract: We investigate quantum corrections to the moduli space for hypermultiplets for type IIA near a conifold singularity. We find a unique quantum deformation based on symmetry arguments which is consistent with a recent conjecture. The correction can be interpreted as an infinite sum coming from multiple wrappings of the Euclidean D-branes around the vanishing cycle.
