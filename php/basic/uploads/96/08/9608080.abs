Title: The Role of Fermions in Bubble Nucleation
Authors: D. G. Barci and E. S. Fraga and C. A. A. de Carvalho
Abstract: We present a study of the role of fermions in the decay of metastable states of a scalar field via bubble nucleation. We analyze both one and three-dimensional systems by using a gradient expansion for the calculation of the fermionic determinant. The results of the one-dimensional case are compared to the exact results of previous work.
