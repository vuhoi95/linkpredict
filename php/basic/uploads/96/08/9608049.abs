Title: Black Holes in the Gauge Theoretic Formulation of Dilatonic Gravity
Authors: Marcelo M. Leite and Victor O. Rivelles
Abstract: We show that two-dimensional topological BF theories coupled to particles carrying non-Abelian charge admit a new coupling involving the Lagrange multiplier field. When applied to the gauge theoretic formulation of dilatonic gravity it gives rise to a source term for the gravitational field. We show that the system admits black hole solutions.
