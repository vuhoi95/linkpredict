Abstract: We present the N=4 superspace constraints for the two-dimensional (2d) off-shell (4,4) supergravity with the superfield strengths expressed in terms of a (4,4) twisted (scalar) multiplet TM-I, as well as the corresponding component results, in a form suitable for applications. The constraints are shown to be invariant under the N=4 super-Weyl transformations, whose N=4 superfield parameters form another twisted (scalar) multiplet TM-II. To solve the constraints, we propose the Ansatz which makes the N=4 superconformal flatness of the N=4 supergravity curved superspace manifest. The locally (4,4) supersymmetric TM-I matter couplings, with the potential terms resulting from spontaneous supersymmetry breaking, are constructed. We also find the full (4,4) superconformally invariant (improved) TM-II matter action. The latter can be extended to the (4,4) locally supersymmetric Liouville action which is suitable for describing (4,4) supersymmetric non-critical strings.
