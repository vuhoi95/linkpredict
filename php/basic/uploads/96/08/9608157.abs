Title: Holomorphic Anomalies and the Nonrenormalization Theorem
Authors: Erich Poppitz and Lisa Randall
Abstract: It has been argued that the superpotential can be renormalized in the presence of massless particles. Possible implications which have been considered include the restoration of supersymmetry at higher loops or a shift to a supersymmetric vacuum state. We argue that even in the presence of massless particles, there are no new contributions to the superpotential at any order in perturbation theory. This confirms the utility of the Wilsonian superpotential for analyzing the moduli space of the low energy theory.
