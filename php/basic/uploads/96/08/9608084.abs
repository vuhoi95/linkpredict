Title: On the Holomorphic Structure of a Low Energy Supersymmetric Wilson  Effective Action
Authors: T. E. Clark and S. T. Love
Abstract: The Wilson (exact) renormalization group equations are used to determine the evolution of a general low energy N=1 supersymmetric action containing a U(1) gauge vector multiplet and a neutral chiral multiplet. The effective theory evolves towards satisfying a fixed relation where the K\"ahler potential and effective gauge coupling are obtained from a N=2 supersymmetric holomorphic prepotential.
