Title: Two-Loop Diagrams in Causal Perturbation Theory
Authors: A. Aste and G. Scharf
Abstract: The scalar two-loop master diagram is revisited in the massive cases needed for the computation of boson and fermion propagators in QED and QCD. By means of the causal method it is possible in a straightforward manner to express the propagators as double integrals. In the case of vacuum polarization both integrations can be carried out in terms of polylogarithms, whereas the last integral in the fermion propagator cannot be expressed by known special functions. The advantage of the method in comparison with Feynman integral calculations is indicated.
