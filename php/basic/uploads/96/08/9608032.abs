Title: Effective Potential in String Induced Action
Authors: Kazuo Ghoroku and Kazunari Kaneko
Abstract: The dynamical properties of the gauge theory of Born-Infeld type action, which is expected as the high-energy effective theory, are investigated by adding a complex scalar field to this gauge system. Especially the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism is addressed in this theory.
