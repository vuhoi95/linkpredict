Title: Fixed Scalars and Suppression of Hawking Evaporation
Authors: Barak Kol and Arvind Rajaraman
Abstract: For an extreme charged black hole some scalars take on a fixed value at the horizon determined by the charges alone. We call them fixed scalars. We find the absorption cross section for a low frequency wave of a fixed scalar to be proportional to the square of the frequency. This implies a strong suppression of the Hawking radiation near extremality. We compute the coefficient of proportionality for a specific model.
