Title: Hypermultiplet Moduli Space and String Compactification to Three  Dimensions
Authors: Nathan Seiberg and Stephen Shenker
Abstract: We study the hypermultiplet moduli space of the type II string compactified on a Calabi-Yau space $\bX$. We do this by using IIA/IIB duality in a compactification of the same theory on $\bX\times \bS ^1$ and by using recent results on three dimensional field theory.
