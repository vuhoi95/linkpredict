Title: Generic Formula of Soft Scalar Masses in String Models
Authors: Yoshiharu Kawamura and Tatsuo Kobayashi
Abstract: We derive formula of soft supersymmetry breaking scalar masses from 4-dimensional string models within a more generic framework. We consider effects of extra gauge symmetry breakings including an anomalous $U(1)$ breaking through flat directions, that is, $D$-term and $F$-term contributions, particle mixing effects and heavy-light mass mixing effects. Some phenomenological implications are discussed based on our mass formula.
