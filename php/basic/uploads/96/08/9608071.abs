Title: Casimir energies for massive fields in the bag
Authors: M. Bordag and K. Kirsten and E. Elizalde and S. Leseduarte
Abstract: The Casimir energy corresponding to a massive scalar field with Dirichlet boundary conditions on a spherical bag is obtained. The field is considered, separately, inside and outside the bag. The renormalization procedure that is necessary to apply in each situation is studied in detail, in particular the differences occurring with respect to the case when the field occupies the whole space. The final result contains several constants that experience renormalization and can be determined only experimentally. The non-trivial finite parts that appear in the massive case are found exactly, providing a precise determination of the complete, renormalized zero-point energy for the first time.
