Title: Maxwell-Bloch equation and Correlation function for penetrable Bose gas
Authors: T. Kojima and V. Korepin
Abstract: We consider the quantum nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in one space and one time dimension. We are interested in the non-free-fermionic case. We consider static temperature-dependent correlation functions. The determinant representation for correlation functions simplifies in the small mass limit of the Bose particle. In this limit we describe the correlation functions by the vacuum expectation value of a boson-valued solution for Maxwell-Bloch differential equation. We evaluate long-distance asymptotics of correlation functions in the small mass limit.
