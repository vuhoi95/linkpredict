Title: Recursion Rules for Scattering Amplitudes in Non-Abelian Gauge Theories
Authors: Chanju Kim and V. P. Nair
Abstract: We present a functional derivation of recursion rules for scattering amplitudes in a non-Abelian gauge theory in a form valid to arbitrary loop order. The tree-level and one-loop recursion rules are explicitly displayed.
