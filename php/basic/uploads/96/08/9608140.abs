Title: U(1,1)--Invariant Generation of Charges for  Einstein--Maxwell--Dilaton--Axion Theory
Authors: O. Kechkin and M. Yurova
Abstract: The action of the isometry subgroup which preserves the trivial values of the fields is studied for the stationary D=4 Einstein--Maxwell--Dilaton--Axion theory. The technique for generation of charges and the corresponding procedure for construction of new solutions is formulated. A solution describing the double rotating dyon with independent values of all physical charges is presented.
