Title: Detecting relic gravitational radiation from string cosmology with LIGO
Authors: Bruce Allen and Ram Brustein
Abstract: A characteristic spectrum of relic gravitational radiation is produced by a period of ``stringy inflation" in the early universe. This spectrum is unusual, because the energy-density rises rapidly with frequency. We show that correlation experiments with the two gravitational wave detectors being built for the Laser Interferometric Gravitational Observatory (LIGO) could detect this relic radiation, for certain ranges of the parameters that characterize the underlying string cosmology model.
