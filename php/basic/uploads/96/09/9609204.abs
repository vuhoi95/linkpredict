Title: Microscopic Entropy of N=2 Extremal Black Holes
Authors: David M. Kaplan and David A. Lowe and Juan M. Maldacena and Andrew Strominger
Abstract: String theory is used to compute the microscopic entropy for several examples of black holes in compactifications with $N=2$ supersymmetry. Agreement with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and the moduli-independent $N=2$ area formula is found in all cases.
