Title: New Models of Gauge and Gravity Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking
Authors: E. Poppitz and S. P. Trivedi
Abstract: We show that supersymmetry breaking in a class of theories with SU(N) x SU(N-2) gauge symmetry can be studied in a calculable sigma model. We use the sigma model to show that the supersymmetry breaking vacuum in these theories leaves a large subgroup of flavor symmetries intact, and to calculate the masses of the low-lying states. By embedding the Standard Model gauge groups in the unbroken flavor symmetry group we construct a class of models in which supersymmetry breaking is communicated by both gravitational and gauge interactions. One distinguishing feature of these models is that the messenger fields, responsible for the gauge mediated communication of supersymmetry breaking, are an integral part of the supersymmetry breaking sector. We also show how, by lowering the scale that suppresses the nonrenormalizable operators, a class of purely gauge mediated models with a combined supersymmetry breaking-cum-messenger sector can be built. We briefly discuss the phenomenological features of the models we construct.
