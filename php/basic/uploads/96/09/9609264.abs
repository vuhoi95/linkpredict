Title: Condensation in the Backgammon model
Authors: P. Bialas and Z. Burda and D. Johnston
Abstract: We analyse the properties of a very simple ``balls-in-boxes'' model which can exhibit a phase transition between a fluid and a condensed phase, similar to behaviour encountered in models of random geometries in one, two and four dimensions. This model can be viewed as a generalisation of the backgammon model introduced by Ritort as an example of glassy behaviour without disorder.
