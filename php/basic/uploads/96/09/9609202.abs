Title: Non Abelian Bosonization in Two and Three Dimensions
Authors: J. C. Le Guillou and E. Moreno and C. Nunez and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We discuss non-Abelian bosonization of two and three dimensional fermions using a path-integral framework in which the bosonic action follows from the evaluation of the fermion determinant for the Dirac operator in the presence of a vector field. This naturally leads to the Wess-Zumino-Witten action for massless two-dimensional fermions and to a Chern-Simons action for very massive three dimensional fermions. One advantage of our approach is that it allows to derive the exact bosonization recipe for fermion currents in a systematic way.
