Title: On the Duality between the Heterotic String and F-Theory in 8 Dimensions
Authors: Gabriel Lopes Cardoso and Gottfried Curio and Dieter Lust and Thomas Mohaupt
Abstract: In this note we compare the moduli spaces of the heterotic string compactified on a two-torus and F-Theory compactified on an elliptic K3 surface for the case of an unbroken E8 x E8 gauge group. The explicit map relating the deformation parameters alpha and beta of the F-Theory K3 surface to the moduli T and U of the heterotic torus is found using the close relationship between the K3 discriminant and the discriminant of the Calabi-Yau-threefold X(1,1,2,8,12)[24] in the limit of a large base P1.
