Title: d=2, N=2 Superconformal Symmetries and Models
Authors: Francois Delduc and Francois Gieres and Stephane Gourmelen
Abstract: We discuss the following aspects of two-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric theories defined on compact super Riemann surfaces: parametrization of (2,0) and (2,2) superconformal structures in terms of Beltrami coefficients and formulation of superconformal models on such surfaces (invariant actions, anomalies and compensating actions, Ward identities).
