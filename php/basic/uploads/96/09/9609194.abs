Title: Dirac Operator on a disk with global boundary conditions
Authors: H. Falomir and R. E. Gamboa Sarav√≠ and E. M. Santangelo
Abstract: We compute the functional determinant for a Dirac operator in the presence of an Abelian gauge field on a bidimensional disk, under global boundary conditions of the type introduced by Atiyah-Patodi-Singer. We also discuss the connection between our result and the index theorem.
