Title: Bound states of 1+1 dimensional field theories
Authors: Takehisa Fujita and Makoto Hiramoto and Hidenori Takahashi
Abstract: We discuss the bound states of the massive Thirring model. Here, the periodic boundary condition equations for the Bethe ansatz solutions are numerically solved. It is found that the massive Thirring model has only one bound state and the bound state spectrum as the function of the coupling constant agrees with that of infinite momentum frame prescription by Fujita and Ogura. Boson boson states (2p$-$2h states) appear only as the continuum spectrum without making any bound states. Further, the finite size correction to the vacuum energy is estimated. The evaluated central charge is found to be close to unity.
