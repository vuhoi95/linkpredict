Title: Critical Fluctuations in Topologically Massive Superconductors
Authors: A. P. C. Malbouisson and F. S. Nogueira and N. F. Svaiter
Abstract: We consider a topologically massive Ginzburg-Landau model of superconductivity. In the context of a mean field calculation, we show that there is an increase in the critical temperature driven by the topological term. It is shown that this effect persists even if we take into account the critical fluctuations. The renormalization group analysis gives further insight on this behavior. The fixed point structure is such that the critical exponents tend to their mean field values for very large values of the topological mass. In this sense, the topological term stabilizes the critical fluctuations of the order parameter.
