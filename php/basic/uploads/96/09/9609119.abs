Title: Superspace Formulation for the BRST Quantization of the Chiral Schwinger  Model
Authors: Everton M. C. Abreu and Nelson R. F. Braga
Abstract: It has recently been shown that the Field Antifield quantization of anomalous irreducible gauge theories with closed algebra can be represented in a BRST superspace where the quantum action at one loop order, including the Wess Zumino term, and the anomalies show up as components of the same superfield. We show here how the Chiral Schwinger model can be represented in this formulation.
