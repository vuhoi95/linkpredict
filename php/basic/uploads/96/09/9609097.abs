Title: Boundary Effects in 2+1 Dimensional Maxwell-Chern-Simons Theory
Authors: E. J. Ferrer and V. de la Incera
Abstract: The boundary effects in the screening of an applied magnetic field in a finite temperature 2+1 dimensional model of charged fermions minimally coupled to Maxwell and Chern-Simons fields are investigated. It is found that in a sample with only one boundary -a half-plane- a total Meissner effect takes place, while in a sample with two boundaries -an infinite strip- the external magnetic field partially penetrates the material.
