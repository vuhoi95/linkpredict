Title: On quantum equivalence of dual sigma models: $SL(3)$ examples
Authors: Z. Horv√°th and R. L. Karp and L. Palla
Abstract: The equivalence of several $SL(3)$ sigma models and their special Abelian duals is investigated in the two loop order of perturbation theory. The investigation is based on extracting and comparing various $\beta$ functions of the original and dual models. The role of the discrete global symmetries is emphasized.
