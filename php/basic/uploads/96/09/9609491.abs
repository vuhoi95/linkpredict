Title: Nonhermitean Random Matrix Models : a Free Random Variable Approach
Authors: Romuald A. Janik and Maciej A. Nowak and Gabor Papp and Jochen Wambach and Ismail Zahed
Abstract: Using the standard concepts of free random variables, we show that for a large class of nonhermitean random matrix models, the support of the eigenvalue distribution follows from their hermitean analogs using a conformal transformation. We also extend the concepts of free random variables to the class of nonhermitean matrices, and apply them to the models discussed by Ginibre-Girko (elliptic ensemble) and Mahaux-Weidenm\"uller (chaotic resonance scattering).
