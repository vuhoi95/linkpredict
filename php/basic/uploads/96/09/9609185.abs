Title: 1+1 Dimensional Yang-Mills Theories in Light-Cone Gauge
Authors: A. Bassetto and G. Nardelli
Abstract: In 1+1 dimensions two different formulations exist of SU(N) Yang Mills theories in light-cone gauge; only one of them gives results which comply with the ones obtained in Feynman gauge. Moreover the theory, when considered in 1+(D-1) dimensions, looks discontinuous in the limit D=2. All those features are proven in Wilson loop calculations as well as in the study of the $q\bar q$ bound state integral equation in the large N limit.
