Title: Feynman diagrams with the effective action
Authors: M. J. de la Plata and L. L. Salcedo
Abstract: A derivation is given of the Feynman rules to be used in the perturbative computation of the Green's functions of a generic quantum many-body theory when the action which is being perturbed is not necessarily quadratic. Some applications are discussed.
