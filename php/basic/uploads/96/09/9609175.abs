Title: Nambu-Goto string with the Gauss-Bonnet term and point-like masses at  the ends
Authors: Leszek Hadasz and Tomasz Rog
Abstract: In the present paper we investigate classical dynamics of the Nambu-Goto string with the Gauss-Bonnet term in the action and point-like masses at the ends in the context of effective QCD string. The configurations of rigidly rotating string is studied and its application to phenomenological description of meson is discussed.
