Title: BRS symmetry versus supersymmetry in Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory
Authors: F. Ruiz Ruiz and P. van Nieuwenhuizen
Abstract: We prove that three-dimensional $N=1$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory is finite to all loop orders. In general this leaves open the possibility that different regularization methods lead to different finite effective actions. We show that in this model dimensional regularization and regularization by dimensional reduction yield the same effective action. Consequently, the superfield approach preserves BRS invariance for this model.
