Title: Analytical results for the confinement mechanism in QCD_3
Authors: Walter Dittrich and Holger Gies
Abstract: We present analytical methods for investigating the interaction of two heavy quarks in QCD_3 using the effective action approach. Our findings result in explicit expressions for the static potentials in QCD_3 for long and short distances. With regard to confinement, our conclusion reflects many features found in the more realistic world of QCD_4.
