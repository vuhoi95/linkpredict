Abstract: The $q$-calculus for generic $q$ is developed and related to the deformed oscillator of parameter $q^{1/2}$. By passing with care to the limit in which $q$ is a root of unity, one uncovers the full algebraic structure of ${{\cal Z}}_n$-graded fractional supersymmetry and its natural representation.
