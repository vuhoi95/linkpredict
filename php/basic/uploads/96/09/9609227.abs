Title: A Model for Classical Space-time Co-ordinates
Authors: D. B. Fairlie and R. Zhdanov
Abstract: Field equations with general covariance are interpreted as equations for a target space describing physical space time co-ordinates, in terms of an underlying base space with conformal invariance. These equations admit an infinite number of inequivalent Lagrangian descriptions. A model for reparametrisation invariant membranes is obtained by reversing the roles of base and target space variables in these considerations.
