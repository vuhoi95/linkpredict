Title: Massless Composite Fermions in Two Dimensions and the Overlap
Authors: R. Narayanan and H. Neuberger
Abstract: There exist chiral gauge models in two dimensions that have massless composite fermions. Two examples are presented and it is suggested that they be accepted as benchmark test-cases for generic proposals of non-perturbatively regulating chiral gauge theories in any dimension. We apply the overlap to the simpler of the two benchmarks and present the results of a numerical simulation of modest size.
