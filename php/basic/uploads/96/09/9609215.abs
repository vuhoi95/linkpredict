Title: Multiple Mellin-Barnes Integrals as Periods of Calabi-Yau Manifolds With  Several Moduli
Authors: M. Passare and A. K. Tsikh and A. A. Cheshel
Abstract: We give a representation, in terms of iterated Mellin-Barnes integrals, of periods on multi-moduli Calabi-Yau manifolds arising in superstring theory. Using this representation and the theory of multidimensional residues, we present a method for analytic continuation of the fundamental period in the form of Horn series.
