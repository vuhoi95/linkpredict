Title: (0,2) Mirror Symmetry
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Rolf Schimmrigk and Andreas Wisskirchen
Abstract: We generalize the previously established (0,2) triality of exactly solvable models, Landau-Ginzburg theories and Calabi-Yau manifolds to a number of different classes of (0,2) compactifications derived from (2,2) vacua. For the resulting models we show that the known (2,2) mirror constructions induce mirror symmetry in the (0,2) context.
