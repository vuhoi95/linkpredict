Title: Heterotic/Type II Duality in D=4 and String/String Duality
Authors: B. Hunt and M. Lynker and R. Schimmrigk
Abstract: We discuss the structure of heterotic/type II duality in four dimensions as a consequence of string-string duality in six dimensions. We emphasize the new features in four dimensions which go beyond the six dimensional vacuum structure and pertain to the way particular K3 fibers can be embedded in Calabi-Yau threefolds. Our focus is on hypersurfaces as well as complete intersections of codimension two which arise via conifold transitions.
