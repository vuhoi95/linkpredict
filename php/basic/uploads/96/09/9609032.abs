Title: Octonionic Quantum Mechanics and Complex Geometry
Authors: Stefano De Leo and Khaled Abdel-Khalek
Abstract: The use of complex geometry allows us to obtain a consistent formulation of octonionic quantum mechanics (OQM). In our octonionic formulation we solve the hermiticity problem and define an appropriate momentum operator within OQM. The nonextendability of the completeness relation and the norm conservation is also discussed in details.
