Title: Boost invariant quantum evolution of a meson field at large proper times
Authors: D. Vautherin and T. Matsui
Abstract: We construct asymptotic solutions of the functional Schroedinger equation for a scalar field in the Gaussian approximation at large proper time. These solutions describe the late proper time stages of the expansion of a meson gas with boost invariant boundary conditions. The relevance of these solutions for the formation of a disoriented chiral condensate in ultra relativistic collisions is discussed.
