Title: Generalized Abelian Deformations: Application to Nambu Mechanics
Authors: Giuseppe Dito and Moshe Flato
Abstract: We study Abelian generalized deformations of the usual product of polynomials introduced in hep-th/9602016. We construct an explicit example for the case of $su/2$ which provides a tentative of a quantum-mechanical description of Nambu Mechanics on $R^3$. By introducing the notions of strong and weak triviality of generalized deformations, we show that the Zariski product is never trivial in either sense, while the example constructed here in a quantum-mechanical context is only strongly non-trivial.
