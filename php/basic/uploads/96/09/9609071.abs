Title: Small Instantons, del Pezzo Surfaces and Type I' theory
Authors: M. R. Douglas and S. Katz and C. Vafa
Abstract: Samll instantons of exceptional groups arise geometrically by a collapsing del Pezzo surface in a CY. We use this to explain the physics of a 4-brane probe in Type I' compactification to 9 dimensions.
