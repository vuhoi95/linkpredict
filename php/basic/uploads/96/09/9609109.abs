Title: Renormalized Path Integral in Quantum Mechanics
Authors: R. J. Henderson and S. G. Rajeev
Abstract: We obtain direct, finite, descriptions of a renormalized quantum mechanical system with no reference to ultraviolet cutoffs and running coupling constants, in both the Hamiltonian and path integral pictures. The path integral description requires a modification to the Wiener measure on continuous paths that describes an unusual diffusion process wherein colliding particles occasionally stick together for a random interval of time before going their separate ways.
