Abstract: We consider a four-fermion theory as a simple model of dynamical symmetry breaking in flat space with non-trivial topology, motivated from recent studies in similar considerations in curved space. The phase structure is investigated, by developing a useful formalism to evaluate the effective potential in arbitrary compactified flat space in 3- and 4-dimensional spacetime. The phase structure is significantly altered due to the finite volume effect in the compactified space. Interestingly, the effect works in different way depending on the boundary condition of the fermion fields. The physical interpretation of the results and its implication on the dynamical symmetry breaking phenomenon in curved space are discussed.
