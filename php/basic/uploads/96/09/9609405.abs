Title: NLO Conformal Symmetry in the Regge Limit of QCD
Authors: Claudio Corianò and Alan R. White and Mark Wüsthoff
Abstract: We show that a scale invariant approximation to the next-to-leading order BFKL kernel, constructed via transverse momentum diagrams, has a simple conformally invariant representation in impact parameter space i.e. K(r1,r2,r1',r2') = g^4 N^2 ln^4[(|r1-r1'||r2-r2'|)/(|r1-r2'||r2-r1'|)] That a conformally invariant representation exists is shown first by relating the kernel directly to Feynman diagrams contributing to two photon diffractive dissociation.
