Title: Avoidance of Collapse by Circular Current-Carrying Cosmic String Loops
Authors: Brandon Carter and Patrick Peter and Alejandro Gangui
Abstract: Earlier attempts to calculate the nonlinear dynamical evolution of Witten type superconducting vacuum vortex defects relied on the use of approximate conducting string models that were too simple to take proper account of the effect of current saturation. This effect is however allowed for adequately in a newly developed class of rather more complicated, though still conveniently analytic, conducting string models. These more realistic models have recently been employed by Larsen and Axenides for investigating the collapse of circular string loops in the case for which angular momentum is absent. The present work extends this investigation to the generic case of circular string loops for which angular momentum is present, so that there will be a centrifugal potential barrier. This barrier will prevent collapse unless the initial conditions are such that the relevant current saturation limit is attained, in which case the string description of the vortex defect will break down, so that its subsequent fate is hard to foresee. On the other hand if saturation is avoided one would expect that the loop will eventually radiate away its excess energy and settle down into a vorton type equilibrium state.
