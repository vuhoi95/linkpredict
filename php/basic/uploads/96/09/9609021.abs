Title: The 2D analogue of the Reissner-Nordstrom solution
Authors: S. Monni and M. Cadoni
Abstract: A two-dimensional (2D) dilaton gravity model, whose static solutions have the same features of the Reissner-Nordstrom solutions, is obtained from the dimensional reduction of a four-dimensional (4D) string effective action invariant under S-duality transformations. The black hole solutions of the 2D model and their relationship with those of the 4D theory are discussed.
