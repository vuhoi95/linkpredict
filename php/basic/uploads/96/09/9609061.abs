Title: Multiflavor Correlation Functions in non-Abelian Gauge Theories at  Finite Density in two dimensions
Authors: Hugo R. Christiansen and Fidel A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We compute vacuum expectation values of products of fermion bilinears for two-dimensional Quantum Chromodynamics at finite flavored fermion densities. We introduce the chemical potential as an external charge distribution within the path-integral approach and carefully analyse the contribution of different topological sectors to fermion correlators. We show the existence of chiral condensates exhibiting an oscillatory inhomogeneous behavior as a function of a chemical potential matrix. This result is exact and goes in the same direction as the behavior found in QCD_4 within the large N approximation.
