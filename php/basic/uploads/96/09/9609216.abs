Title: Variational Master Field for Large-N Interacting Matrix Models - Free  Random Variables on Trial
Authors: Michael Engelhardt and Shimon Levit
Abstract: Matrices are said to behave as free non-commuting random variables if the action which governs their dynamics constrains only their eigenvalues, i.e. depends on traces of powers of individual matrices. The authors use recently developed mathematical techniques in combination with a standard variational principle to formulate a new variational approach for matrix models. Approximate variational solutions of interacting large-N matrix models are found using the free random matrices as the variational space. Several classes of classical and quantum mechanical matrix models with different types of interactions are considered and the variational solutions compared with exact Monte Carlo and analytical results. Impressive agreement is found in a majority of cases.
