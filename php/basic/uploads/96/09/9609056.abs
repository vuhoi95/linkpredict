Title: Four-dimensional High-Branes as Intersecting D-Branes
Authors: E. Bergshoeff and M. de Roo and S. Panda
Abstract: We show that a class of extremal four-dimensional supersymmetric ``high-branes'', i.e. string and domain wall solutions, can be interpreted as intersections of four ten-dimensional Dirichlet branes. These $d=4$ solutions are related, via $T$-duality in ten dimensions, to the four-dimensional extremal Maxwell/scalar black holes that are characterized by a scalar coupling parameter $a$ with $a=0,1/\sqrt{3}, 1, \sqrt{3}$.
