Title: Four-dimensional greybody factors and the effective string
Authors: S. S. Gubser and I. R. Klebanov
Abstract: Recently Maldacena and Strominger found that the calculation of greybody factors for $D=5$ black holes carrying three U(1) charges gives striking new evidence for their description as multiply wound effective strings. Here we show that a similar result holds for $D=4$ black holes with four $U(1)$ charges. In this case the effective string may be thought of as the triple intersection of the 5-branes in M-theory compactified on $T^7$.
