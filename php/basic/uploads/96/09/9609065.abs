Title: Prepotential of $N=2$ Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theories in the Weak  Coupling Region
Authors: Takahiro Masuda and Hisao Suzuki
Abstract: We show how to obtain the explicite form of the low energy quantum effective action for $N=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in the weak coupling region from the underlying hyperelliptic Riemann surface. This is achieved by evaluating the integral representation of the fields explicitly. We calculate the leading instanton corrections for the group $SU(\nc), SO(N)$ and $SP(2N)$ and find that the one-instanton contribution of the prepotentials for the these group coincide with the one obtained recently by using the direct instanton caluculation.
