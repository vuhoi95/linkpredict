Authors: I. Ya. Aref'eva and K. S. Viswanathan and I. V. Volovich
Abstract: A generic Lagrangian, in arbitrary spacetime dimension, describing the interaction of a graviton, a dilaton and two antisymmetric tensors is considered. An isotropic p-brane solution consisting of three blocks and depending on four parameters in the Lagrangian and two arbitrary harmonic functions is obtained. For specific values of parameters in the Lagrangian the solution may be identified with previously known superstring solutions.
