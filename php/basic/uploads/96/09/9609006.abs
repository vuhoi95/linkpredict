Title: Understanding the area proposal for extremal black hole entropy
Authors: A. Ghosh and P. Mitra
Abstract: Whereas the usual understanding is that the entropy of only a non-extremal black hole is given by the area of the horizon, there are derivations of an area law for extremal black holes in some model calculations. It is explained here how such results can arise in an approach where one sums over topologies and imposes the extremality condition after quantization.
