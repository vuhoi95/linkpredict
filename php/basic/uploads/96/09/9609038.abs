Title: The W(sl(N+3),sl(3)) algebras and their contractions to W3
Authors: S. Bellucci and S. Krivonos and A. Sorin
Abstract: We construct the nonlinear $W(sl(N+3),sl(3))$ algebras and find the spectrum of values of the central charge that gives rise, by contracting the $W(sl(N+3),sl(3))$ algebras, to a $W_3$ algebra belonging to the coset $W((sl(N+3),sl(3))/(u(1)\oplus sl(N))$. Part of the spectrum was conjectured before, but part of it is given here for the first time. Using the tool of embedding the $W(sl(N+3),sl(3))$ algebras into linearizing algebras, we construct new realizations of $W_3$ modulo null fields. The possibility to predict, within the conformal linearization framework, the central charge spectrum for minimal models of the nonlinear $W(sl(N+3),sl(3))$ algebras is discussed at the end.
