Title: Nonperturbative Effects in Noncritical Strings with Soliton Backgrounds
Authors: Masafumi Fukuma and Shigeaki Yahikozawa
Abstract: We explicitly construct soliton operators in $D<2$ (or $c<1$) string theory, and show that the Schwinger-Dyson equations allow solutions with these solitons as backgrounds. The dominant contributions from 1-soliton background are explicitly evaluated in the weak coupling limit, and shown to agree with the nonperturbative analysis of string equations. We suggest that fermions should be treated as fundamental dynamical variables since both macroscopic loops and solitons are constructed in their bilinear forms.
