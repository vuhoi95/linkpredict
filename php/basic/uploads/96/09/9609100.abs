Title: Vacuum decay and internal symmetries
Authors: Alexander Kusenko and Kimyeong Lee and Erick J. Weinberg
Abstract: We study the effects of internal symmetries on the decay by bubble nucleation of a metastable false vacuum. The zero modes about the bounce solution that are associated with the breaking of continuous internal symmetries result in an enhancement of the tunneling rate into vacua in which some of the symmetries of the initial state are spontaneously broken. We develop a general formalism for evaluating the effects of these zero modes on the bubble nucleation rate in both flat and curved space-times.
