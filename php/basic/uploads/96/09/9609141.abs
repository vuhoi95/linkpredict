Title: N = 2 Supersymmetry of Higher Superspin Massless Theories
Authors: S. James Gates Jr. and Sergei M. Kuzenko and Alexander G. Sibiryakov
Abstract: We present N=2 supersymmetry transformations, both in N=1, D=4 Minkowski and anti-de Sitter superspaces, for higher superspin massless theories. It is noted that the existence of dual versions of massless supermultiplets with arbitrary superspin s may provide a basis for understanding duality in N=1, D=4 superstring theory. We further conjecture that the N=1, D=4 supergravity pre-potential together with all higher superspin s pre-potentials are components of an N=1, D=4 superstring pre-potential.
