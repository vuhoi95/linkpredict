Title: A Diagramatic Analysis of Duality in Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
Authors: Nick Evans and Martin Schmaltz
Abstract: We introduce a diagramatic notation for supersymmetric gauge theories. The notation is a tool for exploring duality and helps to present the field content of more complicated models in a simple visual way. We introduce the notation with a few examples from the literature. The power of the formalism allows us to study new models with gauge group $(SU(N))^k$ and their duals. Amongst these are models which, contrary to a naive analysis, possess no conformal phase.
