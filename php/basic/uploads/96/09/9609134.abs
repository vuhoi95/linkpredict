Title: Finite-size corrections of an integrable chain with alternating spins
Authors: B. -D. Doerfel and St. Meissner
Abstract: In this paper we calculate the finite-size corrections of an anisotropic integrable spin chain, consisting of spins s=1 and s=1/2. The calculations are done in two regions of the phase diagram with respect to the two couplings $\bar{c}$ and $\tilde{c}$. In case of conformal invariance we obtain the final answer for the ground state and its lowest excitations, which generalizes earlier results.
