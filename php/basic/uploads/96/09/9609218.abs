Title: Action Principle for the Classical Dual Electrodynamics
Authors: P. C. R. Cardoso de Mello and S. Carneiro and M. C. Nemes
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to formulate an action principle which allows for the construction of a classical lagrangean including both electric and magnetic currents. The lagrangean is non-local and shown to yield all the expected (local) equations for dual electrodynamics.
