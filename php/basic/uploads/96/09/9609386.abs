Title: Effective Field Theory for a Heavy Higgs Boson: Matching and Gauge  Invariance
Authors: A. Nyffeler and A. Schenk
Abstract: For large values of the Higgs mass the low energy structure of the gauged linear sigma model in the spontaneously broken phase can adequately be described by an effective field theory. We present a manifestly gauge-invariant functional technique to explicitly evaluate the corresponding effective Lagrangian from the underlying theory.
