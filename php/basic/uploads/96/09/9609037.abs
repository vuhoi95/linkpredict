Title: Gauge Independence of the Lagrangian Path Integral in a Higher-Order  Formalism
Authors: I. A. Batalin and K. Bering and P. H. Damgaard
Abstract: We propose a Lagrangian path integral based on gauge symmetries generated by a symmetric higher-order $\Delta$-operator, and demonstrate that this path integral is independent of the chosen gauge-fixing function. No explicit change of variables in the functional integral is required to show this.
