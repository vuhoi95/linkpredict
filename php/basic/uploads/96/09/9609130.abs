Title: Periods, Coupling Constants and Modular Functions in N=2 SU(2) SYM with  Massive Matter
Authors: A. Brandhuber and S. Stieberger
Abstract: We determine the mass dependence of the coupling constant for N=2 SYM with N_f=1,2,3 and 4 flavours. All these cases can be unified in one analytic expression, given by a Schwarzian triangle function. Moreover we work out the connection to modular functions which enables us to give explicit formulas for the periods. Using the form of the J-functions we are able to determine in an elegant way the couplings and monodromies at the superconformal points.
