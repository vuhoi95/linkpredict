Title: Nonperturbative evaluation of a field correlator appearing in the heavy  quarkonium system
Authors: M. Baker and J. S. Ball and N. Brambilla and A. Vairo
Abstract: Recently an electric and magnetic field correlator appearing in the description of the heavy quarkonium system was evaluated on the lattice. Here, we give a nonperturbative analytical evaluation of this field correlator using a dual description of long distance Yang--Mills theory and using the stochastic vacuum model. The two predictions are both compatible with lattice data but show a different dependence on the quark separation. We discuss the analytic results in relation to the lattice data.
