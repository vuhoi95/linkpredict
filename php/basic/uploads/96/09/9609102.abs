Title: On Chiral p-Forms
Authors: Ingemar Bengtsson and Astri Kleppe
Abstract: Some aspects of chiral p-forms, in particular the obstruction that makes it hard to define covariant Green functions, are discussed. It is shown that a proposed resolution involving an infinite set of gauge fields can be made mathematically rigourous in the classical case. We also give a brief demonstration of species doubling for chiral bosons.
