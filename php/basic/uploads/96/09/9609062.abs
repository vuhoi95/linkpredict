Title: Prepotentials in N=2 Supersymmetric SU(3) YM-Theory with Massless  Hypermultiplets
Authors: Holger Ewen and Kristin Foerger and Stefan Theisen
Abstract: We explicitly determine the instanton corrections to the prepotential for N=2 supersymmetric SU(3) Yang-Mills theory with massless hypermultiplets in the weak coupling regions $u\to\infty$ and $v\to\infty$. We construct the Picard-Fuchs equations for $N_f<6$ and calculate the monodromies using Picard-Lefschetz theorem for $N_f=2,4$. For all $N_f<6$ the instanton corrections to the prepotential are determined using the relation between $Tr <\phi^2>$ and the prepotential.
