Title: Negative dimensional group extrapolation and dualities in N = 1  supersymmetric gauge theories
Authors: Nobuhito Maru and Shinsaku Kitakado
Abstract: We point out that the similarities in N = 1 supersymmetric SO, SP gauge theories can be explained by using the trick of extrapolating the groups to the negative dimensions. One of the advantages of this trick is that anomaly matching is automatically satisfied.
