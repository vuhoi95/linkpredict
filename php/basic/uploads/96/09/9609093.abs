Title: Quantum Chrono-Topology of Nuclear and Sub-Nuclear Reactions
Authors: C. Syros and C. Schulz-Mirbach
Abstract: A quantum time topological space is developed and applied to solve some problems about quantum theory. It is disconnected and satifies specific separation axioms. The degree of disconnectedness of the time-space is a decreasing function of the number of simultaneous or almost simultaneous fundamental interactions. In this topology the U+R Penrose dynamics is implemented by means of a time evolution operator in QFT. This operator is unitary or non-unitary, depending on the type of quantization of the field action-integral. The time evolution operator allows to find the Boltzmann factor in QFT in the above space-time. From an elementary solution of the Liouville equation the quantization of the time follows and the Planck constant has been calculated. Compatibility between time-reversal and irreversibility is spontaneously obtained. The renormalization of the field action-integral follows from quantization. The solution of the measurement problem and the wave function reduction have been deduced in the framework of the Schroedinger theory. The Schroedinger cat's paradoxon and the paradoxon of the wave packet decay have been resolved.
