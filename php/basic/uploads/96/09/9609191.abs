Title: New Integrable Extensions of N=2 KdV and Boussinesq Hierarchies
Authors: E. Ivanov and S. Krivonos
Abstract: We construct a new variety of $N=2$ supersymmetric integrable systems by junction of pseudo-differential superspace Lax operators for $a=4$, $N=2$ KdV and multi-component $N=2$ NLS hierarchies. As an important particular case, we obtain Lax operator for $N=4$ super KdV system. A similar extension of one of $N=2$ super Boussinesq hierarchies is given. We also present a minimal $N=4$ supersymmetric extension of the second flow of $N=4$ KdV hierarchy and comment on its possible integrability.
