Title: Kaluza-Klein on the Brane
Authors: G. Papadopoulos and P. K. Townsend
Abstract: The M-theory interpretation of certain D=10 IIA p-branes implies the existence of worldvolume Kaluza-Klein modes which are expected to appear as 0-brane/p-brane bound states preserving 1/4 of the spacetime supersymmetry. We construct the corresponding solutions of the effective supergravity theory for $p=1,4$, and show that no such solution exists for $p=8$.
