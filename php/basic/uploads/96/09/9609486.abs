Title: A String-inspired Ansatz for Quark Masses and Mixing
Authors: Tatsuo Kobayashi and Zhi-zhong Xing
Abstract: We propose a simple but realistic pattern of quark mass matrices at the string scale, which can be derived from orbifold models of superstring theory with no use of gauge symmetries. This pattern is left-right symmetric and preserves the structural parallelism between up and down quark sectors. Its phenomenological consequences on flavor mixing and $CP$ violation are confronted with current experiments at the weak scale by use of the renormalization-group equations in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model. We find that good agreement is achievable without fine-tuning.
