Title: Classical Hair in String Theory II: Explicit Calculations
Authors: Finn Larsen and Frank Wilczek
Abstract: After emphasizing the importance of obtaining a space-time understanding of black hole entropy, we further elaborate our program to identify the degrees of freedom of black holes with classical space-time degrees of freedom. The Cveti\v{c}-Youm dyonic black holes are discussed in some detail as an example. In this example hair degrees of freedom transforming as an effective string can be identified explicitly. We discuss issues concerning charge quantization, identification of winding, and tension renormalization that arise in counting the associated degrees of freedom. The possibility of other forms of hair in this example, and the prospects for making contact with D-brane ideas, are briefly considered.
