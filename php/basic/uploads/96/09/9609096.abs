Title: Superconductivity in Anyon Fluid at Finite Temperature and Density
Authors: E. J. Ferrer and V. de la Incera
Abstract: The boundary effects in the screening of an applied magnetic field in a charged anyon fluid at finite temperature and density are investigated. By analytically solving the extremum equations of the sytem and minimizing the free energy density, we find that in a sample with only one boundary (the half plane), a total Meissner effect takes place; while the sample with two boundaries (the infinite strip) exhibits a partial Meissner effect. The short-ranges modes of propagation of the magnetic field inside the fluid are characterized by two temp erature dependent penetration lengths.
