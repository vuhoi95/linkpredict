Title: Rodrigues Formula for Hi-Jack Symmetric Polynomials Associated with the  Quantum Calogero Model
Authors: Hideaki Ujino and Miki Wadati
Abstract: The Hi-Jack symmetric polynomials, which are associated with the simultaneous eigenstates for the first and second conserved operators of the quantum Calogero model, are studied. Using the algebraic properties of the Dunkl operators for the model, we derive the Rodrigues formula for the Hi-Jack symmetric polynomials. Some properties of the Hi-Jack polynomials and the relationships with the Jack symmetric polynomials and with the basis given by the QISM approach are presented. The Hi-Jack symmetric polynomials are strong candidates for the orthogonal basis of the quantum Calogero model.
