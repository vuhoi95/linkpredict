Abstract: A new method to obtain the Picard-Fuchs equations of effective $N = 2$ supersymmetric gauge theories in 4 dimensions is developed. It includes both pure super Yang-Mills and supersymmetric gauge theories with massless matter hypermultiplets. It applies to all classical gauge groups, and directly produces a decoupled set of second-order, partial differential equations satisfied by the period integrals of the Seiberg-Witten differential along the 1-cycles of the algebraic curves describing the vacuum structure of the corresponding $N = 2$ theory.
