Title: Integrable Mappings for Non--Commutative Objects
Authors: A. N. Leznov and E. A. Yuzbashyan
Abstract: The integrable mappings formalism is generalized on non--commutative case. Arising hierarchies of integrable systems are invariant with respect to this "quantum" discrete transformations without any assumption about commutative properties of unknown operators they include. Partially, in the scope of this construction are the equations for Heisenberg operators of quantum (integrable) systems.
