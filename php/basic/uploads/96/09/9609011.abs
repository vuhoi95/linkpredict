Title: On Non-Abelian Thomas-Fermi Screening
Authors: G. Alexanian and V. P. Nair
Abstract: The Thomas-Fermi screening of non-Abelian gauge fields by fermions or screening of gluon fields in quark matter is discussed. It is described by an effective mass term which is, as with hard thermal loops, related to the eikonal for a Chern-Simons theory and the Wess-Zumino-Witten action.
