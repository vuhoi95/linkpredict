Title: Specific Scalar Mass Relations in SU(3)*SU(2)*U(1) Orbifold Model
Authors: Yoshiharu Kawamura and Tatsuo Kobayashi and Tohru Komatsu
Abstract: We study flat directions and soft scalar masses using a $Z_3$ orbifold model with $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ gauge group and extra gauge symmetries including an anomalous $U(1)$ symmetry. Soft scalar masses contain $D$-term contributions and particle mixing effects after symmetry breaking and they are parametrized by a few number of parameters. Some specific relations among scalar masses are obtained.
