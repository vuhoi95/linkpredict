Title: Solution of the Higgs scalar-tensor theory without Higgs particles for  static stars
Authors: Oleg von Styp Rekowski and Hartmut Frommert
Abstract: Within the scalar-tensor theory of gravity with Higgs mechanism without Higgs particles, we prove that the excited Higgs potential (the scalar field) vanishs inside and outside of the stellar matter for static spherically symmetric configurations. The field equation for the metric (the tensorial gravitational field) turns out to be essentially the Einsteinian one.
