Title: Effective Scalar Field Theory and Reduction of Couplings
Authors: Mario Atance and Jose Luis Cortes
Abstract: A general discussion of the renormalization of the quantum theory of a scalar field as an effective field theory is presented. The renormalization group equations in a mass-independent renormalization scheme allow us to identify the possibility to go beyond the renormalizable $\phi^{4}$ theory without losing its predictive power. It is shown that there is a minimal extension with just one additional free parameter (the mass scale of the effective theory expansion) and some of its properties are discussed.
