Title: D-brane Configurations and Nicolai Map in Supersymmetric Yang-Mills  Theory
Authors: I. I. Kogan and G. W. Semenoff and R. J. Szabo
Abstract: We discuss some properties of a supersymmetric matrix model that is the dimensional reduction of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in ten dimensions and which has been recently argued to represent the short-distance structure of M theory in the infinite momentum frame. We describe a reduced version of the matrix quantum mechanics and derive the Nicolai map of the simplified supersymmetric matrix model. We use this to argue that there are no phase transitions in the large-N limit, and hence that S-duality is preserved in the full eleven dimensional theory.
