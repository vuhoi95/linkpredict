Title: Static Axially Symmetric Solutions of Einstein-Yang-Mills-Dilaton Theory
Authors: Burkhard Kleihaus and Jutta Kunz
Abstract: We construct static axially symmetric solutions of SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills-dilaton theory. Like their spherically symmetric counterparts, these solutions are nonsingular and asymptotically flat. The solutions are characterized by the winding number n and the node number k of the gauge field functions. For fixed n with increasing k the solutions tend to ``extremal'' Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton black holes with n units of magnetic charge.
