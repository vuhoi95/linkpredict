Title: Nambu-Goldstone Fields, Anomalies and WZ Terms
Authors: J. Gomis and K. Kamimura and R. Kuriki
Abstract: We construct the Wess-Zumino terms from anomalies in case of quasigroups for the following situations. One is effective gauge field theories of Nambu-Goldstone fields associated with spontaneously broken global symmetries and the other is anomalous gauge theories. The formalism that we will develop can be seen as a generalization of the non-linear realization method of Lie groups. As an example we consider 2d gravity with a Weyl invariant regularization
