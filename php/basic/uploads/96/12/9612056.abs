Title: D-brane Interactions, World-sheet Parity and Anti-Symmetric Tensor
Authors: H. Arfaei and M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari
Abstract: Using world-sheet parity we show that mixed D and N components of D-strings are dual to the anti-symmetric $B_{\mu\nu}$ field. The contribution of the latter is responsible for the reduction and even removal of all the interactions between two dissimilar D-branes.
