Title: Multi-scale Renormalization
Authors: C. Ford and C. Wiesendanger
Abstract: The Standard MS renormalization prescription is inadequate for dealing with multi-scale problems. To illustrate this we consider the computation of the effective potential in the Higgs-Yukawa model. It is argued that it is natural to employ a two-scale renormalization group. We give a modified version of a two-scale scheme introduced by Einhorn and Jones. In such schemes the beta functions necessarily contain potentially large logarithms of the RG scale ratios. For credible perturbation theory one must implement a large logarithms resumation on the beta functions themselves. We show how the integrability condition for the two RG equations allows one to perform this resummation.
