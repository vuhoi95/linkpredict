Title: Generalized partition functions and interpolating statistics
Authors: P. F. Borges and H. Boschi-Filho and C. Farina
Abstract: We show that the assumption of quasiperiodic boundary conditions (those that interpolate continuously periodic and antiperiodic conditions) in order to compute partition functions of relativistic particles in 2+1 space-time can be related with anyonic physics. In particular, in the low temperature limit, our result leads to the well known second virial coefficient for anyons. Besides, we also obtain the high temperature limit as well as the full temperature dependence of this coefficient.
