Title: On the Weyl-Wigner-Moyal Description of SU$(\infty)$ Nahm Equations
Authors: Hugo Garcia-Compean and Jerzy F. Plebanski
Abstract: We show how the reduced Self-dual Yang-Mills theory described by the Nahm equations can be carried over to the Weyl-Wigner-Moyal formalism employed recently in Self-dual gravity. Evidence of the existence of correspondence between BPS magnetic monopoles and space-time hyper-K\"ahler metrics is given.
