Title: Form factors, KdV and Deformed Hyperelliptic Curves
Authors: O. Babelon and D. Bernard and F. A. Smirnov
Abstract: We review and summarize recent works on the relation between form factors in integrable quantum field theory and deformation of geometrical data associated to hyper-elliptic curves. This relation, which is based on a deformation of the Riemann bilinear identity, in particular leads to the notion of null vectors in integrable field theory and to a new description of the KdV hierarchy.
