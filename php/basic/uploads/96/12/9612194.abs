Title: On The Finite Temperature Chern-Simons Coefficient
Authors: Gerald Dunne and Kimyeong Lee and Changhai Lu
Abstract: We compute the exact finite temperature effective action in a 0+1-dimensional field theory containing a topological Chern-Simons term, which has many features in common with 2+1-dimensional Chern-Simons theories. This exact result explains the origin and meaning of puzzling temperature dependent coefficients found in various naive perturbative computations in the higher dimensional models.
