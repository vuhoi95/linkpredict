Title: Vacuum Polarization Renormalization and the Geometric Phase
Authors: Edwin Langmann and Jouko Mickelsson
Abstract: As an application of the renormalization method introduced by the second author we give a causal definition of the phase of the quantum scattering matrix for fermions in external Yang-Mills potentials. The phase is defined using parallel transport along the path of renormalized time evolution operators. The time evolution operators are elements of the restricted unitary group $U_{res}$ of Pressley and Segal. The central extension of $U_{res}$ plays a central role.
