Title: A Supersymmetry Anomaly
Authors: Aharon Casher and Yigal Shamir
Abstract: A supersymmetry anomaly is found in the presence of non-perturbative fields. When the action is expressed in terms of the correct quantum variables, anomalous surface terms appear in its supersymmetric variation - one per each collective coordinate. The anomalous surface terms do not vanish in general when inserted in two- or higher-loop bubble diagrams, and generate a violation of the SUSY Ward identities.
