Title: Black hole pairs and supergravity domain walls
Authors: A. Chamblin and J. M. A. Ashbourn-Chamblin
Abstract: We examine the pair creation of black holes in the presence of supergravity domain walls with broken and unbroken supersymmetry. We show that black holes will be nucleated in the presence of non- extreme, repulsive walls which break the supersymmetry, but that as one allows the parameter measuring deviation from extremality to approach zero the rate of creation will be suppressed. In particular, we show that the probability for creation of black holes in the presence of an extreme domain wall is identically zero, even though an extreme vacuum domain wall still has repulsive gravitational energy. This is consistent with the fact that the supersymmetric, extreme domain wall configurations are BPS states and should be stable against quantum corrections. We discuss how these walls arise in string theory, and speculate about what string theory might tell us about such objects.
