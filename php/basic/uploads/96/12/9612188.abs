Title: A Note on Low-Dimensional String Compactifications
Authors: Keshav Dasgupta and Sunil Mukhi
Abstract: We study supersymmetric compactifications of type II strings on eightfolds to two dimensions. It is demonstrated that the type IIB string on an eightfold is free of gravitational anomalies. T-duality requires that this theory when further compactified on a circle must have a vacuum momentum; this is explicitly shown to be present and to have the right value. A subtlety in the relation of IIB compactifications and M-Theory orientifolds to two dimensions is pointed out.
