Title: Confinement in N=1 SUSY Gauge Theories and Model Building Tools
Authors: Csaba Csaki and Martin Schmaltz and Witold Skiba
Abstract: We develop a systematic approach to confinement in N=1 supersymmetric theories. We identify simple necessary conditions for theories to confine without chiral symmetry breaking and to generate a superpotential non-perturbatively (s-confine). Applying these conditions we identify all N=1 theories with a single gauge group and no tree-level superpotential which s-confine. We give a complete list of the confined spectra and superpotentials. Some of these theories are of great interest for model building. We give several new examples of models which break supersymmetry dynamically.
