Title: A $\hbar$-deformed Virasoro Algebra as Hidden Symmetry of the Restricted  sine-Gordon Model
Authors: Bo-yu Hou and Wen-li Yang
Abstract: As the Yangian double with center,which is deformed from affine algebra by the additive loop parameter $\hbar$ ,we get the commuting relation and the bosonization of quantum $\hbar$-deformed Virasoro algebra. The corresponding Miura transformation, associated screening operators and the BRST charge have been studied. Moreover, we also constructe the bosonization for type I and type II intertwiner vertex operators. Finally, we show that the commuting relation of these vertex operators in the case of $p'=r p=r-1$ and $\hbar =\pi$ actually gives the exact scattering matrix of the Restricted sine-Gordon model.
