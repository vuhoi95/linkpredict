Title: Hidden Quantum Group Symmetry in the Chiral Model
Authors: A. Stern and P. Vitale
Abstract: We apply the SL(2,C) lattice Kac-Moody algebra of Alekseev, Faddeev and Semenov-Tian-Shansky to obtain a new lattice description of the SU(2) chiral model in two dimensions. The system has a global quantum group symmetry and it can be regarded as a deformation of two different theories. One is the nonabelian Toda lattice which is obtained in the limit of infinite central charge, while the other is a nonstandard Hamiltonian description of the chiral model obtained in the continuum limit.
