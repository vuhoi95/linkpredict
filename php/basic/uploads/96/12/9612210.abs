Title: On Root Multiplicities of Some Hyperbolic Kac-Moody Algebras
Authors: Michel Bauer and Denis Bernard
Abstract: Using the coset construction, we compute the root multiplicities at level three for some hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras including the basic hyperbolic extension of $A_1^{(1)}$ and $E_{10}$.
