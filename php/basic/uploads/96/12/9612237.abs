Title: Renormalization group approach to multiple-arc random matrix models
Authors: S. Higuchi and C. Itoi and S. M. Nishigaki and N. Sakai
Abstract: We study critical and universal behaviors of unitary invariant non-gaussian random matrix ensembles within the framework of the large-N renormalization group. For a simple double-well model we find an unstable fixed point and a stable inverse-gaussian fixed point. The former is identified as the critical point of single/double-arc phase transition with a discontinuity of the third derivative of the free energy. The latter signifies a novel universality of large-N correlators other than the usual single arc type. This phase structure is consistent with the universality classification of two-level correlators for multiple-arc models by Ambjorn and Akemann. We also establish the stability of the gaussian fixed point in the multi-coupling model.
