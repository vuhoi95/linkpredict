Abstract: The results of part I (hep-ph/9612284) are used to obtain full asymptotic expansions of Feynman diagrams renormalized within the MS-scheme in the regimes when some of the masses and external momenta are large with respect to the others. The large momenta are Euclidean, and the expanded diagrams are regarded as distributions with respect to them. The small masses may be equal to zero. The asymptotic operation for integrals is defined and a simple combinatorial techniques is developed to study its exponentiation. The asymptotic operation is used to obtain the corresponding expansions of arbitrary Green functions. Such expansions generalize and improve upon the well-known short-distance operator-product expansions, the decoupling theorem etc.; e.g. the low-energy effective Lagrangians are obtained to all orders of the inverse heavy mass. The obtained expansions possess the property of perfect factorization of large and small parameters, which is essential for meaningful applications to phenomenology. As an auxiliary tool, the inversion of the R-operation is constructed. The results are valid for arbitrary QFT models.
