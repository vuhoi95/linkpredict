Title: Thermal Field Dynamics and Bialgebras
Authors: T. Kopf and A. E. Santana and F. C. Khanna
Abstract: In Thermal Field Dynamics, thermal states are obtained from restrictions of vacuum states on a doubled field algebra. It is shown that the suitably doubled Fock representations of the Heisenberg algebra do not need to be introduced by hand but can be canonically handed down from deformations of the extended Heisenberg bialgebra. No artificial redefinitions of fields are necessary to obtain the thermal representations and the case of arbitrary dimension is considered from the beginning. Our results support a possibly fundamental role of bialgebra structures in defining a general framework for Thermal Field Dynamics.
