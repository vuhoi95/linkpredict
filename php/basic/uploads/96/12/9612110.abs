Title: The antiferromagnetic phi4 Model, I. The Mean-field Solution
Authors: V. Branchina and H. Mohrbach and J. Polonyi
Abstract: Certain higher dimensional operators of the lagrangian may render the vacuum inhomogeneous. A rather rich phase structure of the phi4 scalar model in four dimensions is presented by means of the mean-field approximation. One finds para- ferro- ferri- and antiferromagnetic phases and commensurate-incommensurate transitions. There are several particles described by the same quantum field in a manner similar to the species doubling of the lattice fermions. It is pointed out that chiral bosons can be introduced in the lattice regularized theory.
