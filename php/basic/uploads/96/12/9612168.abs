Title: Three Dimensional Gross-Neveu Model on Curved Spaces
Authors: Gennaro Miele and Patrizia Vitale
Abstract: The large N limit of the 3-d Gross-Neveu model is here studied on manifolds with positive and negative constant curvature. Using the $\zeta$-function regularization we analyze the critical properties of this model on the spaces $S^2 \times S^1$ and $H^2\times S^1$. We evaluate the free energy density, the spontaneous magnetization and the correlation length at the ultraviolet fixed point. The limit $S^1\to R$, which is interpreted as the zero temperature limit, is also studied.
