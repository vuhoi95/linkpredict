Title: On the Fermionic Quasi-particle Interpretation in Minimal Models of  Conformal Field Theory
Authors: A. Belavin and A. Fring
Abstract: The conjecture that the states of the fermionic quasi-particles in minimal conformal field theories are eigenstates of the integrals of motion to certain eigenvalues is checked and shown to be correct only for the Ising model.
