Title: Influence of a magnetic fluxon on the vacuum energy of quantum fields  confined by a bag
Authors: S. Leseduarte and August Romeo
Abstract: We study the simultaneous influence of boundary conditions and external fields on quantum fluctuations by considering vacuum zero-point energies for quantum fields in the presence of a magnetic fluxon confined by a bag, circular and spherical for bosons and circular for fermions. The Casimir effect is calculated in a generalized cut-off regularization after applying zeta-function techniques to eigenmode sums and using recent techniques about Bessel zeta functions at negative arguments.
