Title: Subtractive Renormalization of Strong-Coupling Quenched QED in Four  Dimensions
Authors: Frederick T. Hawes and Tom Sizer and Anthony G. Williams
Abstract: We study renormalized quenched strong-coupling QED in four dimensions in arbitrary covariant gauge, in the Dyson-Schwinger equation formalism. Above the chiral critical coupling, we show that there is no finite chiral limit. This behaviour is found to be independent of the detailed choice of proper vertex, provided that the vertex is consistent with the Ward-Takahashi identity and multiplicative renormalizability. The finite solutions previously reported lie in an unphysical regime of the theory with multiple solutions and oscillating mass functions. This study is consistent with the assertion that strong coupling QED$_4$ does not have a continuum limit in the conventional sense.
