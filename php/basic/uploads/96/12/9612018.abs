Title: Observables of the generalized 2D Yang-Mills theories on arbitrary  surfaces: a path integral approach
Authors: M. Khorrami and M. Alimohammadi
Abstract: Using the path integral method, we calculate the partition function and the generating functional (of the field strengths) of the generalized 2D Yang-Mills theories in the Schwinger--Fock gauge. Our calculation is done for arbitrary 2D orientable, and also nonorientable surfaces.
