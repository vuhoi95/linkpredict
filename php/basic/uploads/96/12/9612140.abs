Authors: A. N. Sissakian and O. Yu. Shevchenko and S. B. Solganik
Abstract: The Chern-Simons topological term coefficient is derived at arbitrary finite density. As it occures that $\mu^2 = m^2$ is the crucial point for Chern-Simons. So when $\mu^2 < m^2 \mu$--influence disappears and we get the usual Chern-Simons term. On the other hand when $\mu^2 > m^2$ the Chern-Simons term vanishes because of non-zero density of background fermions. In particular for massless case parity anomaly is absent at any finite density. This result holds in any odd dimension as in abelian so as in nonabelian cases.
