Title: Duality in String Theory
Authors: Stefan Forste and Jan Louis
Abstract: In this lecture we review some of the recent developments in string theory on an introductory and qualitative level. In particular we focus on S-T-U dualities of toroidally compactified ten-dimensional string theories and outline the connection to M-theory. Dualities among string vacua with less supersymmetries in six and four space-time dimensions is discussed and the concept of F-theory is briefly presented. (Lecture given by J. Louis at the Workshop on Gauge Theories, Applied Supersymmetry and Quantum Gravity, Imperial College, London, UK, July 5--10, 1996.)
