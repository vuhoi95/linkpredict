Title: Higher Dimensional SUSY Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Ashok Das and Sergio. A. Pernice
Abstract: Higher dimensional supersymmetric quantum mechanics is studied. General properties of the two dimensional case are presented. For three spatial dimesions or higher, a spin structure is shown to arise naturally from the nonrelativistic supersymmetry algebra.
