Title: Whirling Waves and the Aharonov-Bohm Effect for Relativistic Spinning  Particles
Authors: H. O. Girotti and F. Fonseca Romero
Abstract: The formulation of Berry for the Aharonov-Bohm effect is generalized to the relativistic regime. Then, the problem of finding the self-adjoint extensions of the (2+1)-dimensional Dirac Hamiltonian, in an Aharonov-Bohm background potential, is solved in a novel way. The same treatment also solves the problem of finding the self-adjoint extensions of the Dirac Hamiltonian in a background Aharonov-Casher.
