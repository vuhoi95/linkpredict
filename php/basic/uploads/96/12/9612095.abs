Abstract: We give a classification of all multiple intersections of D-branes in ten dimensions and M-branes in eleven dimensions that corresponds to threshold BPS bound states. The residual supersymmetry of these composite branes is determined. By dimensional reduction composite p-branes in lower dimensions can be constructed. We emphasize in dimensions D greater or equal than two, those solutions which involve a single scalar and depend on a single harmonic function. For these extremal branes we obtain the strength of the coupling between the scalar and the gauge field. In particular we give a D-brane and M-brane interpretation of extreme p-branes in two, three and four dimensions.
