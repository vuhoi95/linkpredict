Title: From p-branes to Cosmology
Authors: H. Lu and S. Mukherji and C. N. Pope
Abstract: We study the relationship between static p-brane solitons and cosmological solutions of string theory or M-theory. We discuss two different ways in which extremal p-branes can be generalised to non-extremal ones, and show how wide classes of recently discussed cosmological models can be mapped into non-extremal p-brane solutions of one of these two kinds. We also extend previous discussions of cosmological solutions to include some that make use of cosmological-type terms in the effective action that can arise from the generalised dimensional reduction of string theory or M-theory.
