Title: Dynamical Lorentz Symmetry Breaking from 3 + 1 Renormalizable Model with  Wess-Zumino Interaction
Authors: A. A. Andrianov and R. Soldati
Abstract: We study the renormalizable abelian vector-field models in the presence of the Wess-Zumino interaction with the pseudoscalar matter. The renormalizability is achieved by supplementing the standard kinetic term of vector fields with higher derivatives. The appearance of fourth power of momentum in the vector-field propagator leads to the super-renormalizable theory in which the beta-function, the vector-field renormalization constant and the anomalous mass dimension are calculated exactly. It is shown that this model has the infrared stable fixed point and its low-energy limit is non-trivial. The modified effective potential for the pseudoscalar matter leads to the occurrence of the quantum dynamical breaking of Lorentz symmetry.
