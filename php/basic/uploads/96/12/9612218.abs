Title: Path-Integral Quantization of the (2,2) String
Authors: Jan Bischoff and Olaf Lechtenfeld
Abstract: A complete treatment of the (2,2) NSR string in flat (2+2) dimensional space-time is given, from the formal path integral over N=2 super Riemann surfaces to the computational recipe for amplitudes at any loop or gauge instanton number. We perform in detail the superconformal gauge fixing, discuss the spectral flow, and analyze the supermoduli space with emphasis on the gauge moduli. Background gauge field configurations in all instanton sectors are constructed. We develop chiral bosonization on punctured higher-genus surfaces in the presence of gauge moduli and instantons. The BRST cohomology is recapitulated, with a new space-time interpretation for picture-changing. We point out two ways of combining left- and right-movers, which lead to different three-point functions.
