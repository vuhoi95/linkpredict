Title: Monopoles in Quantum Corrected N=2 Super Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Gordon Chalmers and Martin Rocek and Rikard von Unge
Abstract: We study the low-energy effective Hamiltonian of N=2 super Yang-Mills theories. We find that the BPS equations are unchanged outside a quantum core where higher dimension contributions are expected to be important. We find two quantum generalizations of the BPS soliton. The leading higher-derivative correction to the effective action is shown not to contribute to the BPS mass formula.
