Title: Quantum Deformation of the W_N Algebra
Authors: H. Awata and H. Kubo and S. Odake and J. Shiraishi
Abstract: We review the W_N algebra and its quantum deformation, based on free field realizations. The (quantum deformed) W_N algebra is defined through the (quantum deformed) Miura transformation, and its singular vectors realize the Jack (Macdonald) polynomials.
