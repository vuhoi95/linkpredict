Title: Multi-soliton Solutions of Two-dimensional Matrix Davey-Stewartson  Equation
Authors: A. N. Leznov and E. A. Yuzbashyan
Abstract: The explicit formulae for m-soliton solutions of (1+2)-dimensional matrix Davey-Stewartson equation are represented. They are found by means of known general solution of the matrix Toda chain with the fixed ends [1]. These solutions are expressed trough m+m independent solutions of a pair of linear Shrodinger equations with Hermitian potentials.
