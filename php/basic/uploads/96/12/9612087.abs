Title: Supersymmetry and Membrane Interactions in M(atrix) Theory
Authors: Gilad Lifschytz and Samir D. Mathur
Abstract: We calculate the potential between various configurations of membranes and gravitons in M(atrix) theory. The computed potentials agree with the short distance potentials between corresponding 2-branes and 0-brane configurations in Type IIA string theory, bound to a large number of 0-branes to account for the boost to the infinite momentum frame. We show that, due to the large boost, these type IIA configurations are almost supersymmetric, so that the short and long distance potentials actually agree. Thus the M(atrix) theory is able to reproduce correct long distance behavior in these cases.
