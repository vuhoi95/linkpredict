Title: Small Volumes in Compactified String Theory
Authors: Brian R. Greene and Yakov Kanter
Abstract: We discuss some of the classical and quantum geometry associated to the degeneration of cycles within a Calabi-Yau compactification. In particular, we focus on the definition and properties of quantum volume, especially as it applies to identifying the physics associated to loci in moduli space where nonperturbative effects become manifest. We discuss some unusual features of quantum volume relative to its classical counterpart.
