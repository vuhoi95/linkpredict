Title: M-branes and N=2 Strings
Authors: D. Kutasov and E. Martinec
Abstract: The string field theory of N=(2,1) heterotic strings describes a set of self-dual Yang-Mills fields coupled to self-dual gravity in 2+2 dimensions. We show that the exact classical action for this field theory is a certain complexification of the Green-Schwarz/Dirac-Born-Infeld string action, closely related to the four dimensional Wess-Zumino action describing self-dual gauge fields. This action describes the world-volume of a 2+2d ``M-brane'', which gives rise upon different null reductions to critical strings and membranes. We discuss a number of further properties of N=2 heterotic strings, such as the geometry of null reduction, general features of a covariant formulation, and possible relations to BPS and GKM algebras.
