Title: Classical Interactions for Tensionless Strings
Authors: Bjørn Jensen and Ulf Lindström
Abstract: Using an ``action at a distance'' formulation we probe the possible classical interactions for tensionless strings, (the $T\to 0$ limit of the ordinary bosonic string.) We find $G_{\mu\nu}$ and $B_{\mu\nu}$ type interactions but no dilaton interactions.
