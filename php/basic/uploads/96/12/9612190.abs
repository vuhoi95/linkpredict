Title: Curvature-induced phase transition in three-dimensional Thirring model
Authors: B. Geyer and Y. I. Shil'nov
Abstract: The effective potential of composite fermion fields in three-dimensional Thirring model in curved spacetime is calculated in linear curvature approximation. The phase transition accompanied by the creation of non-zero chiral invariant bifermionic vector-like condensate is shown to exist. The type of this phase transition is discussed.
