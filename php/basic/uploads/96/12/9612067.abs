Title: Internal Structure of Einstein-Yang-Mills Black Holes
Authors: E. E. Donets and D. V. Gal'tsov and M. Yu. Zotov
Abstract: It is shown that a generic black hole solution of the SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills equations develops a new type of an infinitely oscillating behavior near the singularity. Only for certain discrete values of the event horizon radius exceptional solutions exist, possessing an inner structure of the Schwarzschild or Reissner-Nordstrom type.
