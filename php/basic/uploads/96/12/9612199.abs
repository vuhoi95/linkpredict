Title: Rigidly Rotating Strings in Stationary Spacetimes
Authors: V. Frolov and S. Hendy and J. P. De Villiers
Abstract: In this paper we study the motion of a rigidly rotating Nambu-Goto test string in a stationary axisymmetric background spacetime. As special examples we consider the rigid rotation of strings in flat spacetime, where explicit analytic solutions can be obtained, and in the Kerr spacetime where we find an interesting new family of test string solutions. We present a detailed classification of these solutions in the Kerr background.
