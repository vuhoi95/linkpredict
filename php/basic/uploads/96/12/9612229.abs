Title: Rotating Intersecting M-Branes
Authors: Mirjam Cvetic and Donam Youm
Abstract: We present intersecting p-brane solutions of eleven-dimensional supergravity (M-branes) which upon toroidal compactification reduce to non-extreme ``rotating'' black holes. We identify harmonic functions, associated with each M-brane, and non-extremality functions, specifying a deviation from the BPS limit. These functions are modified due to the angular momentum parameters, which specify the rotation along the transverse directions of the M-branes. We spell out the intersection rules for the eleven-dimensional space-time metric for intersecting (up to three) rotating M-brane configurations (and a boost along the common intersecting direction).
