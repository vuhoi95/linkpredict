Title: A Large-N Reduced Model as Superstring
Authors: N. Ishibashi and H. Kawai and Y. Kitazawa and A. Tsuchiya
Abstract: A matrix model which has the manifest ten-dimensional N=2 super Poincare invariance is proposed. Interactions between BPS-saturated states are analyzed to show that massless spectrum is the same as that of type IIB string theory. It is conjectured that the large-N reduced model of ten-dimensional super Yang-Mills theory can be regarded as a constructive definition of this model and therefore is equivalent to superstring theory.
