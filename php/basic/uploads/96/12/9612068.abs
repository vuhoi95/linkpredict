Title: Group Quantization on Configuration Space: Gauge Symmetries and Linear  Fields
Authors: M. Navarro and V. Aldaya and M. Calixto
Abstract: A new, configuration-space picture of a formalism of group quantization, the GAQ formalism, is presented in the context of a previous, algebraic generalization. This presentation serves to make a comprehensive discussion in which other extensions of the formalism, particularly to incorporate gauge symmetries, are developed as well. Both images are combined in order to analyse, in a systematic manner and with complete generality, the case of linear fields (abelian current groups). To ilustrate these developments we particularize them for several fields and, in particular, we carry out the quantization of the abelian Chern-Simons models over an arbitrary closed surface in detail.
