Title: The Paths of Unification In The GUST With The G x G Gauge Groups of E(8)  x E(8)
Authors: A. Maslikov and I. Naumov and G. Volkov
Abstract: In the framework of the four dimensional heterotic superstring with free fermions we discuss the rank eight and/or sixteen Grand Unified String Theories (GUST) which contain the SU(3)_H - gauge family symmetry. We explicitly investigate the paths of the unification in the GUST with gauge symmetry G x G = [SU(5) x U(1) x (SU(3) x U(1))_H]^2. We show that the GUSTs with the G x G gauge group allow to make the scale of unification to be consistent with the string scale M_SU = g_{string} * 5 * 10^17 GeV.
