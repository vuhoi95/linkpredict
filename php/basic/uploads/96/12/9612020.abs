Title: Sphaleron in the dilatonic electroweak theory
Authors: D. Karczewska and R. Manka
Abstract: A numerical study of static, spherically symmetric sphaleron solutions in the standard model coupled to the dilaton field is presented. We show that sphaleron is surrounded by strong dilaton cloud which vanishes inside the sphaleron.
