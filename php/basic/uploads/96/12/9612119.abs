Title: A new supersymmetry
Authors: Itzhak Bars and Costas Kounnas
Abstract: We propose a new supersymmetry in field theory that generalizes standard supersymmetry and we construct field theoretic models that provide some of its representations. This symmetry combines a finite number of standard 4D supersymmetry multiplets into a single multiplet with a new type of Kaluza-Klein embedding in higher dimensions. We suggest that this mechanism may have phenomenological applications in understanding family unification. The algebraic structure, which has a flavor of W-algebras, is directly motivated by S-theory and its application in black holes. We show connections to previous proposals in the literature for 12 dimensional supergravity, Yang-Mills, (2,1) heterotic superstrings and Matrix models that attempt to capture part of the secret theory behind string theory.
