Title: Solutions of (2+1)-dimensional spin systems
Authors: Z. Thomova and P. Winternitz and W. J. Zakrzewski
Abstract: We use the methods of group theory to reduce the equations of motion of two spin systems in (2+1) dimensions to sets of coupled ordinary differential equations. We present solutions of some classes of these sets and discuss their physical significance.
