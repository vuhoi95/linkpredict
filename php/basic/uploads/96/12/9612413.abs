Title: One-Loop Tensor Integrals in Dimensional Regularisation
Authors: J. M. Campbell and E. W. N. Glover and D. J. Miller
Abstract: We show how to evaluate tensor one-loop integrals in momentum space avoiding the usual plague of Gram determinants. We do this by constructing combinations of $n$- and $(n-1)$-point scalar integrals that are finite in the limit of vanishing Gram determinant. These non-trivial combinations of dilogarithms, logarithms and constants are systematically obtained by either differentiating with respect to the external parameters - essentially yielding scalar integrals with Feynman parameters in the numerator - or by developing the scalar integral in $D=6-2\e$ or higher dimensions. As an explicit example, we develop the tensor integrals and associated scalar integral combinations for processes where the internal particles are massless and where up to five (four massless and one massive) external particles are involved. For more general processes, we present the equations needed for deriving the relevant combinations of scalar integrals.
