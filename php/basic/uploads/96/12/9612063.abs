Title: Self-Dual Chern-Simons Solitons and Generalized Heisenberg Ferromagnet  Models
Authors: Phillial Oh and Q-Han Park
Abstract: We consider the (2+1)-dimensional gauged Heisenberg ferromagnet model coupled with the Chern-Simons gauge fields. Self-dual Chern-Simons solitons, the static zero energy solution saturating Bogomol'nyi bounds, are shown to exist when the generalized spin variable is valued in the Hermitian symmetric spaces G/H. By gauging the maximal torus subgroup of H, we obtain self-dual solitons which satisfy vortex-type nonlinear equations thereby extending the two dimensional instantons in a nontrivial way. An explicit example for the CP(N) case is given.
