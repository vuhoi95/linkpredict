Title: SU(3)-skyrmions
Authors: V. B. Kopeliovich and B. E. Stern
Abstract: The consideration of the bound skyrmions with large strangeness content is continued. The connection between B=2 SO(3)-hedgehog and SU(2)-torus is investigated and the quantization of the dipole- type configuration with large strangeness content is described.
