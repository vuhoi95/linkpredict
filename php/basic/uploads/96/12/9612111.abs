Title: The antiferromagnetic phi4 Model, II. The one-loop renormalization
Authors: V. Branchina and H. Mohrbach and J. Polonyi
Abstract: It is shown that the four dimensional antiferromagnetic lattice phi4 model has the usual non-asymptotically free scaling law in the UV regime around the chiral symmetrical critical point. The theory describes a scalar and a pseudoscalar particle. A continuum effective theory is derived for low energies. A possibility of constructing a model with a single chiral boson is mentioned.
