Title: Classical instanton and wormhole solutions of Type IIB string theory
Authors: Jin Young Kim and H. W. Lee and Y. S. Myung
Abstract: We study $p=-1$ D-brane in type IIB superstring theory. In addition to RR instanton, we obtain the RR charged wormhole solution in the Einstein frame. This corresponds to the ten-dimensional singular wormhole solution with infinite euclidean action.
