Title: An Interacting Geometry Model and Induced Gravity
Authors: Pawel O. Mazur and V. P. Nair
Abstract: We propose the theory of quantum gravity with interactions introduced by topological principle. The fundamental property of such a theory is that its energy-momentum tensor is an BRST anticommutator. Physical states are elements of BRST cohomology group. The model with only topological excitations, introduced recently by Witten is discussed from the point of view of induced gravity program. We find that the mass scale is induced dynamically by gravitational instantons. The low energy effective theory has gravitons, which occur as the collective excitations of geometry, when the metric becomes dynamical. Applications of cobordism theory to QG are discussed.
