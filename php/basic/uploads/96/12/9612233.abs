Title: Virasoro-type Symmetries in Solvable Models
Authors: H. Awata and H. Kubo and S. Odake and J. Shiraishi
Abstract: Virasoro-type symmetries and their roles in solvable models are reviewed. These symmetries are described by the two-parameter Virasoro-type algebra $Vir_{p,q}$ by choosing the parameters p and q suitably.
