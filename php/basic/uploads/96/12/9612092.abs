Title: Permutation Invariant Statistics, Duality and Simple Interpolations
Authors: B. Melic and S. Meljanac
Abstract: General permutation invariant statistics in the second quantized approach are considered. Simple interpolations between dual statistics are constructed. Particularly, we present a new minimal interpolation between parabosons and parafermions of any order. The connection with a simple mixing between bosons and fermions is established. The construction is extended to anyonic-like statistics.
