Authors: Y. I. Shil'nov and V. V. Chitov and A. T. Kotwicki
Abstract: The dymamical chiral symmetry breaking in higher- derivative quantum gravity has been investigated on the flat background. The Schwinger- Dyson equations numerical solutions have been found in the ladder approximation. Both two- and four- dimensional cases have been considered. The dymamical fermion mass generation accompanied by the second- order phase transition has been shown to take place in a different gauges.
