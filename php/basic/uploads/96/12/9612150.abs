Title: Classical integrability of the O(N) nonlinear Sigma model on a half-line
Authors: E. Corrigan and Z-M Sheng
Abstract: The classical integrability the O(N) nonlinear sigma model on a half-line is examined, and the existence of an infinity of conserved charges in involution is established for the free boundary condition. For the case N=3 other possible boundary conditions are considered briefly.
