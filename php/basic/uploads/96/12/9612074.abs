Title: Gauging N=2 Supersymmetric Non-Linear $Ïƒ$-Models in the Atiyah-Ward  Space-Time
Authors: M. Carvalho and M. W. de Oliveira
Abstract: We build up a class of N=2 supersymmetric non-linear $\sigma$-models in an N=1 superspace based on the Atiyah-Ward space-time of (2+2)-signature metric. We also discuss the gauging of isometries of the associated hyper-K\"ahlerian target spaces and present the resulting gauge-covariant supersymmetric action functional.
