Title: Tricritical Ising Model near criticality
Authors: Riccardo Guida and Nicodemo Magnoli
Abstract: The most relevant thermal perturbation of the continuous d=2 minimal conformal theory with c=7/10 (Tricritical Ising Model) is treated here. This model describes the scaling region of the phi^6 universality class near the tricritical point. The problematic IR divergences of the naive perturbative expansion around conformal theories are dealt within the OPE approach developed at all orders by the authors. The main result is a description of the short distance behaviour of correlators that is compared with existing long distance expansion (form factors approach) related to the integrability of the model.
