Title: Relating c<0 and c>0 Conformal Field Theories
Authors: Sathya Guruswamy and Andreas W. W. Ludwig
Abstract: A `canonical mapping' is established between the c=-1 system of bosonic ghosts and the c=2 complex scalar theory and, a similar mapping between the c=-2 system of fermionic ghosts and the c=1 Dirac theory. The existence of this mapping is suggested by the identity of the characters of the respective theories. The respective c<0 and c>0 theories share the same space of states, whereas the spaces of conformal fields are different. Upon this mapping from their c<0 counterparts, the (c>0) complex scalar and the Dirac theories inherit hidden nonlocal sl(2) symmetries.
