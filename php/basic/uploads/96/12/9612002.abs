Title: Borel Quantization: Kinematics and Dynamics
Authors: H. -D. Doebner and P. Nattermann
Abstract: In this contribution we review results on the kinematics of a quantum system localized on a connected configuration manifold and compatible dynamics for the quantum system including external fields and leading to non-linear Schr\"odinger equations for pure states.
