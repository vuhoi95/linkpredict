Title: Fixed point resolution in conformal field theory
Authors: J. Fuchs and A. N. Schellekens and C. Schweigert
Abstract: We summarize recent progress in the understanding of fixed point resolution for conformal field theories. Fixed points in both coset conformal field theories and non-diagonal modular invariants which describe simple current extensions of chiral algebras are investigated. A crucial role is played by the mathematical structures of twining characters and orbit Lie algebras.
