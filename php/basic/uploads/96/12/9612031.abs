Title: Osp(1|2) Chern-Simons gauge theory as 2D N=1 Induced Supergravity
Authors: Kiyoshi Ezawa and Atushi Ishikawa
Abstract: We demonstrate the close relationship between Chern-Simons gauge theory with gauge group Osp(1|2) and N=1 induced supergravity in two dimensions. More precisely, the inner product of the physical states in the former yields the partition function of the latter evaluated in the Wess-Zumino supergauge. It is also shown that the moduli space of flat Osp(1|2) connections naturally includes super Teichm\"uller space of super Riemann surfaces.
