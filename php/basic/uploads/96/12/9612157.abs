Title: Branes from Matrices
Authors: Tom Banks and Nathan Seiberg and Stephen Shenker
Abstract: Various aspects of branes in the recently proposed matrix model for M theory are discussed. A careful analysis of the supersymmetry algebra of the matrix model uncovers some central charges which can be activated only in the large $N$ limit. We identify the states with non-zero charges as branes of different dimensions.
