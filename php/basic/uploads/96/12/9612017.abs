Title: Lattice Formulation of the Standard Model
Authors: Michael Creutz and Michel Tytgat and Claudio Rebbi and She-Sheng Xue
Abstract: Combining the Kaplan surface mode approach for chiral fermions with added terms motivated by Eichten and Preskill suggests the possibility for a lattice regularization of the standard model which is finite, exactly gauge invariant, and only has physically desired states in its low energy spectrum. The conjectured scheme manifestly requires anomaly cancelation and explicitly contains baryon and lepton number violating terms.
