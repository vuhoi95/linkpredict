Title: Logarithmic Yangians in WZW models
Authors: D. Bernard and Z. Maassarani and P. Mathieu
Abstract: A new action of the Yangians in the WZW models is displayed. Its structure is generic and level independent. This Yangian is the natural extension at the conformal point of the one unravelled in massive theories with current algebras. Expectingly, this new symmetry of WZW models will lead to a deeper understanding of the integrable structure of conformal field theories and their deformations.
