Title: Induced Gauge Structure of Quantum Mechanics on $S^D$
Authors: Minoru Hirayama and Hui-Min Zhang and Takeshi Hamada
Abstract: The Ohnuki-Kitakado (O-K) scheme of quantum mechanics on $S^D$ embedded in $R^{D+1}$ is investigated. Generators satisfying the O-K algebra are written down explicitly in term of the induced gauge potential. A direct method is developed to obtain the generators in covariant form. It is seen that there exists an induced gauge configuration which is trivial on $S^D$ but might cause a nontrivial physical effect in $R^{D+1}$. The relation of the O-K scheme to extended objects such as the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole is discussed.
