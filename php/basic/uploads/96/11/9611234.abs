Title: Derivation of quantum theories:symmetries and the exact solution of the  derived system
Authors: M. Khorrami and A. Aghamohammadi and M. Alimohammadi
Abstract: Based on the technique of derivation of a theory, presented in our recent paper, we investigate the properties of the derived quantum system. We show that the derived quantum system possesses the (nonanomalous) symmetries of the original one, and prove that the exact Green functions of the derived theory are expressed in terms of the semiclassically approximated Green functions of the original theory.
