Title: Towards a Unified Theory of Massless Superfields of All Superspins
Authors: S. James Gates Jr. and Sergei M. Kuzenko and Alexander G. Sibiryakov
Abstract: We describe the ``universal'' action for massless superfields of all superspins in N = 1, D = 4 anti-de Sitter superspace as a gauge theory of unconstrained superfields taking their values in the commutative algebra of analytic functions over a one-sheeted hyperboloid in $R^{3,1}$. The action is invariant under N = 2 supersymmetry transformations which form a closed algebra off the mass-shell.
