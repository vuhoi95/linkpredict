Title: Reconstruction of SU(5) Grand Unified Model In Noncommutative Geometry  Approach
Authors: Jianming Li and Xingchang Song
Abstract: Based on the generalized gauge theory on $M^4\times Z_2\times Z_3$, we reconstructed the realistic SU(5) Grand Unified model by a suitable assignment of fermion fields. The action of group elements $Z_2$ on fermion fields is the charge conjugation while the action of $Z_3$ elements represent generation translation. We find that to fit the spontaneous symmetry breaking and gauge hierarchy of SU(5) model a linear term of curvature has to be introduced. A new mass relation is obtained in our reconstructed model.
