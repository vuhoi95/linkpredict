Title: T-duality for open strings with respect to non-abelian isometries
Authors: Stefan Forste and Alexandros A. Kehagias and Stefan Schwager
Abstract: We gauge the non-abelian isometries of a sigma model with boundaries. Forcing the field strength of the gauge fields to vanish renders the gauged model equivalent to the ungauged one provided that boundary conditions are taken into account properly. Integrating out the gauge fields gives the T-dual model. We observe that T-duality interchanges Neumann (or mixed) boundary conditions with Dirichlet boundary conditions.
