Title: Interacting Chiral Gauge Fields in Six Dimensions and Born-Infeld Theory
Authors: Malcolm Perry and John H. Schwarz
Abstract: Dimensional reduction of a self-dual tensor gauge field in 6d gives an Abelian vector gauge field in 5d. We derive the conditions under which an interacting 5d theory of an Abelian vector gauge field is the dimensional reduction of a 6d Lorentz invariant interacting theory of a self-dual tensor. Then we specialize to the particular 6d theory that gives 5d Born-Infeld theory. The field equation and Lagrangian of this 6d theory are formulated with manifest 5d Lorentz invariance, while the remaining Lorentz symmetries are realized nontrivially. A string soliton with finite tension and self-dual charge is constructed.
