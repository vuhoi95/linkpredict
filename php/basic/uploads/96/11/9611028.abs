Authors: Valeri A. Gritsenko and Viacheslav V. Nikulin
Abstract: We give variants of lifting construction, which define new classes of modular forms on the Siegel upper half-space of complex dimension 3 with respect to the full paramodular groups (defining moduli of Abelian surfaces with arbitrary polarization). The data for these liftings are Jacobi forms of integral and half-integral indices. In particular, we get modular forms which are generalizations of the Dedekind eta-function. Some of these forms define automorphic corrections of Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebras with hyperbolic generalized Cartan matrices of rank three classified in Part I of this paper. We also construct many automorphic forms which give discriminants of moduli of K3 surfaces with conditions on Picard lattice. These results are important for Mirror Symmetry and theory of Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebras.
