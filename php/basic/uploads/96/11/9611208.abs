Title: Conformal Invariance and Cosmic Background Radiation
Authors: I. Antoniadis and P. O. Mazur and E. Mottola
Abstract: The spectrum and statistics of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) are investigated under the hypothesis that scale invariance of the primordial density fluctuations should be promoted to full conformal invariance. As in the theory of critical phenomena, this hypothesis leads in general to deviations from naive scaling. The spectral index of the two-point function of density fluctuations is given in terms of the quantum trace anomaly and is greater than one, leading to less power at large distance scales than a strict Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum. Conformal invariance also implies non-gaussian statistics for the higher point correlations and in particular, it completely determines the large angular dependence of the three-point correlations of the CMBR.
