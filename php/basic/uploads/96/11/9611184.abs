Title: Holomorphic Couplings in String Theory
Authors: Jan Louis and Kristin Foerger
Abstract: In these lectures we review the properties of holomorphic couplings in the effective action of four-dimensional N=1 and N=2 closed string vacua. We briefly outline their role in establishing a duality among (classes of) different string vacua. (Lectures presented by J. Louis at the Trieste Spring School 1996.)
