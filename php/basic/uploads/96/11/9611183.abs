Title: Localized Solutions in a 2 Dimensional Landau-Lifshitz Model
Authors: B. Piette and W. J. Zakrzewski
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of stable time dependent solutions of the Landau-Lifshitz model with a constant external magnetic field. We find such solutions in all topological sectors, including N=0. We discuss some of their properties.
