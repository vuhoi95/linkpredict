Title: Manifestly T-Duality Symmetric Matrix Models
Authors: Tsunehide Kuroki and Yuji Okawa and Fumihiko Sugino and Tamiaki Yoneya
Abstract: We present a new class of matrix models which are manifestly symmetric under the T-duality transformation of the target space. The models may serve as a nonperturbative regularization for the T-duality symmetry in continuum string theory. In particular, it now becomes possible to extract winding modes explicitly in terms of extended matrix variables.
