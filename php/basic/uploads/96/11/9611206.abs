Title: Scattering of soft, cool pions
Authors: Robert D. Pisarski and Michel Tytgat
Abstract: Consider the effective lagrangian for pions in the chiral limit, computed to leading order in an expansion about zero temperature. To describe the scattering of pions with small momenta, it is necessary to include not just the usual shift in the pion decay constant, but also a new, nonlocal term, which is precisely analogous to the hard thermal loops of hot gauge theories.
