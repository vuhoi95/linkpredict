Title: Uniqueness of the Seiberg-Witten Effective Lagrangian
Authors: R. Flume and M. Magro and L. O'Raifeartaigh and I. Sachs and O. Schnetz
Abstract: The low energy effective Lagrangian for $N\es 2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, proposed by Seiberg and Witten is shown to be the unique solution, assuming only that supersymmetry is unbroken and that the number of strong-coupling singularities is finite. Duality is then a consequence rather than an input.
