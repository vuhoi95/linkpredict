Title: Gauge and Yukawa Unification in Models with Gauge-Mediated Supersymmetry  Breaking

Abstract: We examine gauge and Yukawa coupling unification in models with gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking. We work consistently to two-loop order, and include all weak, messenger and unification-scale threshold corrections. We find that successful unification requires unification-scale threshold corrections that are in conflict with the minimal SU(5) model, but are consistent with the modified missing doublet SU(5) model for small tan beta, and large tan beta with mu>0.
