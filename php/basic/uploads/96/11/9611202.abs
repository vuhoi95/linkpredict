Title: Branes, Fluxes and Duality in M(atrix)-Theory
Authors: Ori J. Ganor and Sanjaye Ramgoolam and Washington Taylor IV
Abstract: We use the T-duality transformation which relates M-theory on T^3 to M-theory on a second T^3 with inverse volume to test the Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind suggestion for the matrix model description of M-theory. We find evidence that T-duality is realized as S-duality for $U(\infty)$ N=4 Super-Yang-Mills in 3+1D. We argue that Kaluza Klein states of gravitons correspond to electric fluxes, wrapped membranes become magnetic fluxes and instantonic membranes are related to Yang-Mills instantons. The T-duality transformation of gravitons into wrapped membranes is interpreted as the duality between electric and magnetic fluxes. The identification of M-theory T-duality as SYM S-duality provides a natural framework for studying the M-theory 5-brane as the S-dual object to the unwrapped membrane. Using the equivalence between compactified M(atrix) theory and SYM, we find a natural candidate for a description of the light-cone 5-brane of M-theory directly in terms of matrix variables, analogous to the known description of the M(atrix) theory membrane.
