Title: Gauge-Invariant Renormalization Group at Finite Temperature
Authors: Marco D'Attanasio and Massimo Pietroni
Abstract: We propose a gauge-invariant version of Wilson Renormalization Group for thermal field theories in real time. The application to the computation of the thermal masses of the gauge bosons in an SU(N) Yang-Mills theory is discussed.
