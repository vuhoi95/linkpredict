Title: Two-Dimensional Chiral Matrix Models and String Theories
Authors: Ivan K. Kostov and Matthias Staudacher
Abstract: We formulate and solve a class of two-dimensional matrix gauge models describing ensembles of non-folding surfaces covering an oriented, discretized, two-dimensional manifold. We interpret the models as string theories characterized by a set of coupling constants associated to worldsheet ramification points of various orders. Our approach is closely related to, but simpler than, the string theory describing two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory. Using recently developed character expansion methods we exactly solve the models for target space lattices of arbitrary internal connectivity and topology.
