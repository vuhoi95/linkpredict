Title: Cosmic Strings in Theories With Dynamical Symmetry Breaking
Authors: R. Brandenberger and T. Huang and K. Yang and X. Zhang
Abstract: We study the classical cosmic string solution in a theory with dynamical $U(1)$ symmetry breaking. We calculate the energy per unit length of the string and compare it to that obtained in a model with a fundamental Higgs. We find that the predictions of the standard Abelian Higgs model are quite stable towards the addition of higher dimension operators expected in the effective Lagrangian for the order parameter in a model with dynamical symmetry breaking, at least for small coupling constant $\lambda$.
