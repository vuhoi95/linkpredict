Title: Membrane Dynamics in M(atrix) Theory
Authors: Ofer Aharony and Micha Berkooz
Abstract: We analyze some of the kinematical and dynamical properties of flat infinite membrane solutions in the conjectured M theory proposed by Banks, Fischler, Shenker and Susskind. In particular, we compute the long range potential between membranes and anti-membranes, and between membranes and gravitons, and compare it with the supergravity results. We also discuss membranes with finite relative longitudinal velocities, providing some evidence for the eleven dimensional Lorentz invariance of the theory.
