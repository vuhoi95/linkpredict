Title: Mesons, Baryons and Waves in the Baby Skyrmion Model
Authors: A. Kudryavtsev and B. Piette and W. J. Zakrzewski
Abstract: We study various classical solutions of the baby-Skyrmion model in $(2+1)$ dimensions. We point out the existence of higher energy states interpret them as resonances of Skyrmions and anti-Skyrmions and study their decays. Most of the discussion involves a highly exited Skyrmion-like state with winding number one which decays into an ordinary Skyrmion and a Skyrmion-anti-Skyrmion pair. We also study wave-like solutions of the model and show that some of such solutions can be constructed from the solutions of the sine-Gordon equation. We also show that the baby-Skyrmion has non-topological stationary solutions. We study their interactions with Skyrmions.
