Title: Radiation from a class of string theoretic black holes
Authors: S. P. de Alwis and K. Sato
Abstract: The emission of a scalar with low energy $\omega$, from a $D (4\le D\le 8 )$ dimensional black hole with n charges is studied in both string and semiclassical calculations. In the lowest order in $\omega$, the weak coupling string and semiclassical calculations agree provided that the Bekenstein--Hawking formula is valid and the effective central charge $c_{eff}=6$ for any D. When the next order in $\omega$ is considered however, there is no agreement between the two schemes unless D=5, n=3 or D=4, n=4.
