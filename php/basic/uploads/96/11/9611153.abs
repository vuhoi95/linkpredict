Title: Quantum Holonomy in Three-dimensional General Covariant Field Theory and  Link Invariant
Authors: W. F. Chen. H. C. Lee and Z. Y. Zhu
Abstract: We consider quantum holonomy of some three-dimensional general covariant non-Abelian field theory in Landau gauge and confirm a previous result partially proven. We show that quantum holonomy retains metric independence after explicit gauge fixing and hence possesses the topological property of a link invariant. We examine the generalized quantum holonomy defined on a multi-component link and discuss its relation to a polynomial for the link.
