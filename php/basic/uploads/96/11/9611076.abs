Title: Supergravities in diverse dimensions and their central extension
Authors: L. Andrianopoli and R. D'Auria
Abstract: In this lecture moduli dependent charges for p-extended objects are analyzed for generic N-extended supergravities in dimensions 4 \leq D <10. Differential relations and sum rules among the charges are derived.
