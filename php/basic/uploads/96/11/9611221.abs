Title: Generalized Poisson structures
Authors: J. A. de Azcarraga and A. M. Perelomov and J. C. Perez Bueno
Abstract: New generalized Poisson structures are introduced by using skew-symmetric contravariant tensors of even order. The corresponding `Jacobi identities' are given by the vanishing of the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket. As an example, we provide the linear generalized Poisson structures which can be constructed on the dual spaces of simple Lie algebras.
