Title: Stationary Black Holes in a Generalized Three-Dimensional Theory of  Gravity
Authors: P. M. SÃ¡ and J. P. S. Lemos
Abstract: We consider a generalized three-dimensional theory of gravity which is specified by two fields, the graviton and the dilaton, and one parameter. This theory contains, as particular cases, three-dimensional General Relativity and three-dimensional String Theory. Stationary black hole solutions are generated from the static ones using a simple coordinate transformation. The stationary black holes solutions thus obtained are locally equivalent to the corresponding static ones, but globally distinct. The mass and angular momentum of the stationary black hole solutions are computed using an extension of the Regge and Teitelboim formalism. The causal structure of the black holes is described.
