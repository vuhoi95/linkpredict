Title: A U(1) Gauge Theory for Antisymmetric Tensor Fields
Authors: Shinichi Deguchi and Tadahito Nakajima and Hideomi Totsuka Atomic
Abstract: We show that a U(1) gauge theory defined in the configuration space for closed p-branes yields the gauge theory of a massless rank-(p+1) antisymmetric tensor field and the Stueckelberg formalism for a massive vector field.
