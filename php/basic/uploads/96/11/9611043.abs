Title: A continuous Wick rotation for spinor fields and supersymmetry in  Euclidean space
Authors: Peter van Nieuwenhuizen and Andrew Waldron
Abstract: We obtain a continuous Wick rotation for Dirac, Majorana and Weyl spinors $\psi \to \exp ({1\over 2} \theta \gamma^4 \gamma^5)\psi$ which interpolates between Minkowski and Euclidean field theories.
