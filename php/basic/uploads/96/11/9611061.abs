Title: Poisson Realization and Quantization of the Geroch Group
Authors: D. Korotkin and H. Samtleben
Abstract: The conserved nonlocal charges generating the Geroch group with respect to the canonical Poisson structure of the Ernst equation are found. They are shown to build a quadratic Poisson algebra, which suggests to identify the quantum Geroch algebra with Yangian structures.
