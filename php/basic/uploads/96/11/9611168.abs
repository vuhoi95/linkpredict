Title: Algebraic characterization of gauge anomalies on a nontrivial bundle
Authors: P. John and O. Moritsch and M. Schweda and S. P. Sorella
Abstract: We discuss the algebraic way of solving the descent equations corresponding to the BRST consistency condition for the gauge anomalies and the Chern--Simons terms on a nontrivial bundle. The method of decomposing the exterior derivative as a BRST commutator is extended to the present case.
