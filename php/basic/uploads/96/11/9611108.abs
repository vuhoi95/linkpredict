Title: N=2 Superintegrable f-Toda Mapping and Super-NLS Hierarchy in the (1|2)  Superspace
Authors: V. B. Derjagin and A. N. Leznov and A. S. Sorin
Abstract: A new integrable N=2 supersymmetric f-Toda mapping in (1|2) superspace, acting like the symmetry transformation of N=2 supersymmetric NLS hierarchy, is proposed. The first two Hamiltonian structures and the recursion operator connecting all evolution systems and Hamiltonian structures of the N=2 super-NLS hierarchy are constructed in explicit form using only invariance conditions with respect to the f-Toda mapping. A new representation for its Hamiltonians is observed.
