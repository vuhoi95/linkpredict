Title: Gauge dependence in topological gauge theories
Authors: C. Becchi and S. Giusto and C. Imbimbo
Abstract: We parametrize the gauge-fixing freedom in choosing the Lagrangian of a topological gauge theory. We compute the gauge-fixing dependence of correlators of equivariant operators when the compactified moduli space has a non-empty boundary and verify that only a subset of these has a gauge independent meaning. We analyze in detail a simple example of such anomalous topological theories, 4D topological Yang-Mills on the four-sphere and instanton number k=1.
