Title: Boson Mapping in Field Theory
Authors: P. O. Hess and J. C. LÃ³pez Vieyra and C. R. Stephens
Abstract: A boson mapping of pair field operators is presented. The mapping preserves all hermiticity properties and the Poisson bracket relations between fields and momenta. The most practical application of the boson mapping is to field theories which exhibit bound states of pairs of fields. As a concrete application we consider, in the low energy limit, the Wick-Cutkosky model with equal mass for the charged fields.
