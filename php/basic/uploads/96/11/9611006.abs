Title: The orthogonal eigenbasis and norms of eigenvectors in the Spin  Calogero-Sutherland Model
Authors: Kouichi Takemura and Denis Uglov
Abstract: Using a technique based on the Yangian Gelfand-Zetlin algebra and the associated Yangian Gelfand-Zetlin bases we construct an orthogonal basis of eigenvectors in the Calogero-Sutherland Model with spin, and derive product-type formulas for norms of these eigenvectors.
