Title: Numerical Domain Wall Type Solutions in phi**4 Theory
Authors: J. Karkowski and Z. Swierczynski
Abstract: The well known domain wall type solutions are nowadays of great physical interest in classical field theory. These solutions can mostly be found only approximately. Recently the Hilbert-Chapman-Enskog method was succesfully applied to obtain this type solutions in phi**4 theory. The goal of the present paper is to verify these perturbative results by numerical computations.
