Title: General Static Axially-symmetric Solutions of (2+1)-dimensional  Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton Theory
Authors: Dahl Park and Jae Kwan Kim
Abstract: We obtain the general static solutions of the axially symmetric (2+1)-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory by dimensionally reducing it to a 2-dimensional dilaton gravity theory. The solutions consist of the magnetically charged sector and the electrically charged sector. We illuminate the relationship between the two sectors by pointing out the transformations between them.
