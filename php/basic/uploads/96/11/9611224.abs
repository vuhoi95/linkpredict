Title: Perturbative Analysis of Chern-Simons Field Theory in the Coulomb Gauge
Authors: Franco Ferrari and I. Lazzizzera
Abstract: In this paper we analyse the perturbative aspects of Chern-Simons field theories in the Coulomb gauge. We show that in the perturbative expansion of the Green functions there are neither ultraviolet not infrared divergences. Moreover, all the radiative corrections are zero at any loop order. Some problems connected with the Coulomb gauge fixing, like the appearance of spurious singularities in the computation of the Feynman diagrams, are discussed and solved. The regularization used here for the spurious singularities can be easily applied also to the Yang-Mills case, which is affected by similar divergences.
