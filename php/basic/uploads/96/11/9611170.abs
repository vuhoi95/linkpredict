Title: Kosterlitz--Thouless Phase Transitions on Discretized Random Surfaces
Authors: A. Matytsin and P. Zaugg
Abstract: The large N limit of a one-dimensional infinite chain of random matrices is investigated. It is found that in addition to the expected Kosterlitz--Thouless phase transition this model exhibits an infinite series of phase transitions at special values of the lattice spacing \epsilon_{pq}=\sin(\pi p/2q). An unusual property of these transitions is that they are totally invisible in the double scaling limit. A method which allows us to explore the transition regions analytically and to determine certain critical exponents is developed. It is argued that phase transitions of this kind can be induced by the interaction of two-dimensional vortices with curvature defects of a fluctuating random lattice.
