Title: Exact expectation values of local fields in quantum sine-Gordon model
Authors: S. Lukyanov and A. Zamolodchikov
Abstract: We propose an explicit expression for vacuum expectation values of the exponential fields in the sine-Gordon model. Our expression agrees both with semi-classical results in the sine-Gordon theory and with perturbative calculations in the Massive Thirring model. We use this expression to make new predictions about the large-distance asymptotic form of the two-point correlation function in the XXZ spin chain.
