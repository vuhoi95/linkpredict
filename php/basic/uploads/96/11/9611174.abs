Title: More D-brane bound states
Authors: J. C. Breckenridge and G. Michaud and R. C. Myers
Abstract: The low-energy background field solutions corresponding to D-brane bound states which possess a difference in dimension of two are presented. These solutions are constructed using the T-duality map between the type IIA and IIB superstring theories. Since supersymmetry is preserved by T-duality, the bound state solutions retain the supersymmetric properties of the initial (single) D-brane states from which they are produced, i.e., they preserve one half of the supersymmetries.
