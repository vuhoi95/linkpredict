Title: N=1 Dualities for Exceptional Gauge Groups and Quantum Global Symmetries
Authors: Jacques Distler and Andreas Karch
Abstract: We discuss our attempts to generalize the known examples of dualities in N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories to exceptional gauge groups. We derive some dual pairs from known examples connected to exceptional groups and find an interesting phenomenon: sometimes the full global symmetry is ``hidden'' on the magnetic side. It is not realized as a symmetry on the fundamental fields in the Lagrangian. Rather, it emerges as a symmetry of the quantum theory. We then focus on an approach based on self-dual models. We construct duals for some very special matter content of $E_ 7$, $E_6$ and $F_4$. Again we find that the full global symmetry is not realized on the fundamental fields.
