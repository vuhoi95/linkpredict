Authors: R. Banerjee and H. J. Rothe and K. D. Rothe Comments 9 pages and LaTeX
Abstract: Following systematically the generalized Hamiltonian approach of Batalin and Fradkin, we demonstrate the equivalence of a self-dual model with the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory by embedding the former second-class theory into a first-class theory.
