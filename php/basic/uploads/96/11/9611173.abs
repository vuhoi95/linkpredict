Title: Super D-branes
Authors: E. Bergshoeff and P. K. Townsend
Abstract: We present a manifestly Lorentz invariant, spacetime supersymmetric, and `$\kappa$-invariant' worldvolume action for all type II Dirichlet p-branes, $p\le9$, in a general type II supergravity background, including massive backgrounds in the IIA case. The $p=0,2$ cases are rederived from D=11. The $p=9$ case provides a supersymmetrization of the D=10 Born-Infeld action.
