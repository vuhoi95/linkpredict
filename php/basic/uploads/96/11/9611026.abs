Title: Composite p-Branes in Diverse Dimensions
Authors: I. Aref'eva and A. Volovich
Abstract: We use a simple algebraic method to find a special class of composite p-brane solutions of higher dimensional gravity coupled with matter. These solutions are composed of n constituent p-branes corresponding n independent harmonic functions. A simple algebraic criteria of existence of such solutions is presented. Relations with D=11,10 known solutions are discussed.
