Title: Asymptotic States in Non-Local Field Theories
Authors: D. G. Barci and L. E. Oxman
Abstract: Asymptotic states in field theories containing non-local kinetic terms are analyzed using the canonical method, naturally defined in Minkowski space. We apply our results to study the asymptotic states of a non-local Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory coming from bosonization in 2+1 dimensions. We show that in this case the only asymptotic state of the theory, in the trivial (non-topological) sector, is the vacuum.
