Title: Characters and Partition Function for the Wen-Wu CFT Model of the  Haldane-Rezayi Quantum Hall State
Authors: L. S. Georgiev and I. T. Todorov
Abstract: The Wen-Wu c=-2 model describes the d-wave paired singlet factor of the Haldane-Rezayi (quantum Hall) wave function in terms of an SU(2) doublet of dimension 1 fermions. The resulting CFT involves an infinite sequence of Virasoro primary fields. The superalgebra generated by these fields, on the other hand, admits a set of ground state representations giving rise to a rational c=-2 CFT. We compute the corresponding characters as well as the characters of the bosonic subalgebra in the Z_2 twisted sector and write down a modular invariant partition function for the ensuing 2-dimensional conformal theory.
