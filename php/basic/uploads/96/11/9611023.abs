Title: The field theory limit of multiloop string amplitudes
Authors: P. Di Vecchia and L. Magnea and R. Marotta and A. Lerda and R. Russo
Abstract: We report on recent progress in the use of string techniques for the computation of field theory amplitudes. We show how one-loop renormalization constants in Yang-Mills theory can be computed using the open spinning string, we review the calculation of two-loop scalar amplitudes with the bosonic string, and we briefly indicate how the technique can be applied to the two-loop vacuum bubbles of Yang-Mills theory.
