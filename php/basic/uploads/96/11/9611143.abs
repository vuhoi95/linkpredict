Title: The Renormalization Group method for simple operator problems in quantum  mechanics
Authors: I. L. Egusquiza and M. A. Valle-Basagoiti
Abstract: A simple backreaction problem in quantum mechanics, the full quantum anharmonic oscillator, and quantum parametric resonance are studied using Renormalization Group techniques for global asymptotic analysis. In this short note this technique is adapted for the first time to operator problems.
