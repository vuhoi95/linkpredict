Title: Holstein-Primakoff Realizations on Coadjoint Orbits
Authors: Phillial Oh and Chaiho Rim
Abstract: We derive the Holstein-Primakoff oscillator realization on the coadjoint orbits of the $SU(N+1)$ and $SU(1,N)$ group by treating the coadjoint orbits as a constrained system and performing the symplectic reduction. By using the action-angle variables transformations, we transform the original variables into Darboux variables. The Holstein-Primakoff expressions emerge after quantization in a canonical manner with a suitable normal ordering. The corresponding Dyson realizations are also obtained and some related issues are discussed.
