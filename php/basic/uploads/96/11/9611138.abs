Authors: I. Brevik and D. M. Gitman and S. D. Odintsov
Abstract: The formalism, which permits to study the phase structure of gauged NJL-model for arbitrary external fields, is developed. The effective potential in the gauged NJL model in the weak magnetic field is found. It is shown that in fixed gauge coupling case the weak magnetic field doesn't influence chiral symmetry breaking condition. The analogy with the situation near black hole is briefly mentioned.
