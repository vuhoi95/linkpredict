Abstract: For an anisotropic euclidean $\phi^4$-theory with two interactions $[u (\sum_{i=1^M {\phi}_i^2)^2+v \sum_{i=1}^M \phi_i^4]$ the $\beta$-functions are calculated from five-loop perturbation expansions in $d=4-\varepsilon$ dimensions, using the knowledge of the large-order behavior and Borel transformations. For $\varepsilon=1$, an infrared stable cubic fixed point for $M \geq 3$ is found, implying that the critical exponents in the magnetic phase transition of real crystals are of the cubic universality class. There were previous indications of the stability based either on lower-loop expansions or on less reliable Pad\'{e approximations, but only the evidence presented in this work seems to be sufficently convincing to draw this conclusion.
