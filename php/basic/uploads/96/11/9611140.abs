Title: Entropy of N=2 black holes and their M-brane description
Authors: Klaus Behrndt and Thomas Mohaupt
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the M-brane description for a N=2 black hole. This solution is a result of the compactification of M-5-brane configurations over a Calabi-Yau threefold with arbitrary intersection numbers $C_{ABC}$. In analogy to the D-brane description where one counts open string states we count here open 2-branes which end on the M-5-brane.
