Title: On amplitudes in self-dual sector of Yang-Mills theory
Authors: A. A. Rosly and K. G. Selivanov
Abstract: Self-dual perturbiner in the Yang-Mills theory is constructed by the twistor methods both in topologically trivial and topologically nontrivial cases. Maximally helicity violating amplitudes and their instanton induced analogies are briefly discussed.
