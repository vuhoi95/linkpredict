Title: Geometrical representation of Euclidean general relativity in the  canonical formalism
Authors: Glenn Barnich and Viqar Husain
Abstract: We give an SU(2) covariant representation of the constraints of Euclidean general relativity in the Ashtekar variables. The guiding principle is the use of triads to transform all free spatial indices into SU(2) indices. A central role is played by a special covariant derivative. The Gauss, diffeomorphism and Hamiltonian constraints become purely algebraic restrictions on the curvature and the torsion associated with this connection. We introduce coordinates on the jet space of the dynamical fields which cleanly separate the constraint and gauge directions from the true physical directions. This leads to a classification of all local diffeomorphism and Gauss invariant charges.
