Title: Relativistic Corrections to the Aharonov-Bohm Scattering
Authors: M. Gomes and J. M. C. Malbouisson and A. J. da Silva
Abstract: We determine the |p|/m expansion of the two body scattering amplitude of the quantum theory of a Chern-Simons field minimally coupled to a scalar field with quartic self-interaction. It is shown that the existence of a critical value of the self-interaction parameter for which the 2-particle amplitude reduces to the Aharonov-Bohm one is restricted to the leading, nonrelativistic, order. The subdominant terms correspond to relativistic corrections to the Aharonov-Bohm scattering.
