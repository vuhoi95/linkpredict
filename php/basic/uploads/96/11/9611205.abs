Title: F^4 Terms in N=4 String Vacua
Authors: C. Bachas and E. Kiritsis
Abstract: We discuss $F_{\mu\nu}^4$ terms in torroidal compactifications of type-I and heterotic SO(32) string theory. We give a simple argument why only short BPS multiplets contribute to these terms at one loop, and verify heterotic-type-I duality to this order.
