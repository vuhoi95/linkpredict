Abstract: We show that recent 3He experiments at Manchester demonstrate the creation of excitation momentum (momentogenesis) by quantized vortices, a process analogous to baryogenesis within cosmic strings. Since superfluid 3He is the most complex field theoretic system available in the laboratory, this experiment gives a firmer foundation to chiral anomaly calculations for baryogenesis on non-trivial backgrounds of the Higgs field such as cosmic strings.
