Title: On the BRST approach to the description of a Regge trajectory
Authors: A. Pashnev and M. Tsulaia
Abstract: The free field theory for Regge trajectory is described in the framework of the BRST - quantization method. The physical spectrum includes daugther trajectories along with parent one. The applicability of the BRST approach to the description of a single Regge trajectory without its daughter trajectories is discussed. The simple example illustrates the appropriately modified BRST construction for the needed second class constraints.
