Title: Regularized overlap and the chiral determinant
Authors: C. D. Fosco and R. C. Trinchero
Abstract: We study the relationship between the continuum overlap and its corresponding chiral determinant, showing that the former amounts to an unregularised version of the latter. We then construct a regularised continuum overlap, and consider the chiral anomalies that follow therefrom. The relation between these anomalies and the ones derived from the formal (i.e., unregularised) overlap is elucidated.
