Title: Geometric Engineering of N=1 Quantum Field Theories
Authors: Sheldon Katz and Cumrun Vafa
Abstract: We construct local geometric model in terms of F- and M-theory compactification on Calabi-Yau fourfolds which lead to N=1 Yang-Mills theory in d=4 and its reduction on a circle to d=3. We compute the superpotential in d=3, as a function of radius, which is generated by the Euclidean 5-brane instantons. The superpotential turns out to be the same as the potential for affine Toda theories. In the limit of vanishing radius the affine Toda potential reduces to the Toda potential.
