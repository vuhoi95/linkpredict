Title: Non-Central Potentials and Spherical Harmonics Using Supersymmetry and  Shape Invariance
Authors: Ranabir Dutt and Asim Gangopadhyaya and Uday P. Sukhatme
Abstract: It is shown that the operator methods of supersymmetric quantum mechanics and the concept of shape invariance can profitably be used to derive properties of spherical harmonics in a simple way. The same operator techniques can also be applied to several problems with non-central vector and scalar potentials. As examples, we analyze the bound state spectra of an electron in a Coulomb plus an Aharonov-Bohm field and/or in the magnetic field of a Dirac monopole.
