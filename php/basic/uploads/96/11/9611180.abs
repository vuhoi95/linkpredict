Title: Thermodynamic properties of spontaneous magnetization in Chern-Simons  QED_3
Authors: Shinya Kanemura and Takao Matsushita
Abstract: The spontaneous magnetization in Chern-Simons QED_3 is discussed in a finite temperature system. The thermodynamical potential is analyzed within the weak field approximation and in the fermion massless limit. We find that there is a linear term with respect to the magnetic field with a negative coefficient at any finite temperature. This implies that the spontaneous magnetic field does not vanish even at high temperature. In addition, we examine the photon spectrum in the system. We find that the bare Chern-Simons coefficient is cancelled by the radiative effects. The photons then become topologically massless according to the magnetization, though they are massive by finite temperature effects. Thus the magnetic field is a long-range force without the screening even at high temperature.
