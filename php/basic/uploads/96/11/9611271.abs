Title: Non-perturbative renormalization group approach for a scalar theory in  higher-derivative gravity
Authors: Alfio Bonanno and Dario Zappal√°
Abstract: A renormalization group study of a scalar theory coupled to gravity through a general functional dependence on the Ricci scalar in the action is discussed. A set of non-perturbative flow equations governing the evolution of the new interaction terms generated in both local potential and wavefunction renomalization is derived. It is shown for a specific model that these new terms play an important role in determining the scaling behavior of the system above the mass of the inflaton field.
