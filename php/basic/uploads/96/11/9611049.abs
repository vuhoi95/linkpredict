Title: Some Quantum Aspects of D=3 Space-Time Massive Gravity
Authors: Carlos Pinheiro and Gentil O. Pires and Fernando A. B. Rabelo de Carvalho
Abstract: We discuss some features of Einstein-Proca gravity in D=3 and 4 space-times. Our study includes a discussion on the tree-level unitarity and on the issue of light deflection in 3D gravity in the presence of a mass term.
