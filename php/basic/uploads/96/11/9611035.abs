Title: The Î¼- term in Effective Supergravity Theories
Authors: G. K. Leontaris and N. D. Tracas
Abstract: The Higgs mixing term coefficient $\mu_{eff}$ is calculated in the scalar potential in supergravity theories with string origin, in a model independent approach. A general low energy effective expression is derived, where new contributions are included which depend on the modular weights $q_{1,2}$ of the Higgs superfields, the moduli and derivative terms. We find that in a class of models obtained in the case of compactifications of the heterotic superstring, the derivative terms are identically zero. Further, the total $\mu_{eff}$-term vanishes identically if the sum of the two modular weights $q_1+q_2$ is equal to two. Subleading $\mu$- corrections, in the presence of intermediate gauge symmetries predicted in viable string scenarios, are also discussed.
