Title: Superconformal Invariants and Extended Supersymmetry
Authors: P. S. Howe and P. C. West
Abstract: The superconformal invariants in analytic superspace are found. Superconformal invariance is shown to imply that the Green's functions of analytic operators are invariant holomorphic sections of a line bundle on a product of certain harmonic superspaces. It is argued that the correlation functions for a class of sufficiently low dimension gauge invariant operators in N=2 and N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory can be evaluated up to constants.
