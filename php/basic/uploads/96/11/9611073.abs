Title: Differential Geometry of the Vortex Filament Equation
Authors: Yukinori Yasui and Norihito Sasaki
Abstract: Differential calculus on the space of asymptotically linear curves is developed. The calculus is applied to the vortex filament equation in its Hamiltonian description. The recursion operator generating the infinite sequence of commuting flows is shown to be hereditary. The system is shown to have a description with a Hamiltonian pair. Master symmetries are found and are applied to deriving an expression of the constants of motion in involution. The expression agrees with the inspection of Langer and Perline.
