Title: Determinant representation for dynamical correlation functions of the  Quantum nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation
Authors: T. Kojima and V. Korepin and N. Slavnov
Abstract: The foundation for the theory of correlation functions of exactly solvable models is determinant representation. Determinant representation permit to describe correlation functions by classical completely integrable differential equations [Barough, McCoy, Wu]. In this paper we show that determinant represents works not only for free fermionic models. We obtained determinant representation for the correlation function $<\psi(0,0)\psi^\dagger(x,t)>$ of the quantum nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, out of free fermionic point. In the forthcoming publications we shall derive completely integrable equation and asymptotic for the quantum correlation function of this model of interacting fermions.
