Title: The Schrodinger Wave Functional and Vacuum States in Curved Spacetime
Authors: D. V. Long and G. M. Shore
Abstract: The Schrodinger picture description of vacuum states in curved spacetime is further developed. General solutions for the vacuum wave functional are given for both static and dynamic (Bianchi type I) spacetimes and for conformally static spacetimes of Robertson-Walker type. The formalism is illustrated for simple cosmological models with time-dependent metrics and the phenomenon of particle creation is related to a special form of the kernel in the vacuum wave functional.
