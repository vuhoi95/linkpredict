Authors: A. A. Andrianov and M. V. Ioffe and D. N. Nishnianidze
Abstract: The new method based on the SUSY algebra with supercharges of higher order in derivatives is proposed to search for dynamical symmetry operators in 2-dim quantum and classical systems. These symmetry operators arise when closing the SUSY algebra for a wide set of potentials. In some cases they are of 2-nd order in derivatives. The particular solutions are obtained also for potentials accepting symmetry operators of 4-th order. The investigation of quasiclassical limit of the SUSY algebra yields new classical integrals of motion for a certain type of systems which are polynomials of 4-th order in momenta. The general SUSY-inspired algorithm to construct classical systems with additional integrals of motion is outlined.
