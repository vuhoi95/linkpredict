Title: One loop renormalization of the 4-D Quantum Dilaton Gravity in Spherical  symmetric background
Authors: Seiji Mukaigawa and Hiroyuki Takata
Abstract: We study the one loop renormalization in the most general metric-dilaton theory with second derivative only. In constant background dilaton theory, there are two types of gravity background which enable the theory renormalizable at one-loop level. We show this concretely to discuss on the spherical symmetric background.
