Title: String dynamics in cosmological and black hole backgrounds: The null  string expansion
Authors: Carlos O. Lousto and N. Sanchez
Abstract: We study the classical dynamics of a bosonic string in the $D$--dimensional flat Friedmann--Robertson--Walker and Schwarzschild backgrounds. We make a perturbative development in the string coordinates around a {\it null} string configuration; the background geometry is taken into account exactly. In the cosmological case we uncouple and solve the first order fluctuations; the string time evolution with the conformal gauge world-sheet $\tau$--coordinate is given by $X^0(\sigma, \tau)=q(\sigma)\tau^{1\over1+2\beta}+c^2B^0(\sigma, \tau)+\cdots$, $B^0(\sigma,\tau)=\sum_k b_k(\sigma)\tau^k$ where $b_k(\sigma)$ are given by Eqs.\ (3.15), and $\beta$ is the exponent of the conformal factor in the Friedmann--Robertson--Walker metric, i.e. $R\sim\eta^\beta$. The string proper size, at first order in the fluctuations, grows like the conformal factor $R(\eta)$ and the string energy--momentum tensor corresponds to that of a null fluid. For a string in the black hole background, we study the planar case, but keep the dimensionality of the spacetime $D$ generic. In the null string expansion, the radial, azimuthal, and time coordinates $(r,\phi,t)$ are $r=\sum_n A^1_{n}(\sigma)(-\tau)^{2n/(D+1)}~,$ $\phi=\sum_n A^3_{n}(\sigma)(-\tau)^{(D-5+2n)/(D+1)}~,$ and $t=\sum_n A^0_{n} (\sigma)(-\tau)^{1+2n(D-3)/(D+1)}~.$ The first terms of the series represent a {\it generic} approach to the Schwarzschild singularity at $r=0$. First and higher order string perturbations contribute with higher powers of $\tau$. The integrated string energy-momentum tensor corresponds to that of a null fluid in $D-1$ dimensions. As the string approaches the $r=0$ singularity its proper size grows indefinitely like $\sim(-\tau)^{-(D-3)/(D+1)}$. We end the paper giving three particular exact string solutions inside the black hole.
