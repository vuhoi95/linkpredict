Title: Model of statistically coupled chiral fields on the circle
Authors: Serguei B. Isakov and Susanne Viefers
Abstract: Starting from a field theoretical description of multicomponent anyons with mutual statistical interactions in the lowest Landau level, we construct a model of interacting chiral fields on the circle, with the energy spectrum characterized by a symmetric matrix $g_{\alpha\beta}$ with nonnegative entries. Being represented in a free form, the model provides a field theoretical realization of (ideal) fractional exclusion statistics for particles with linear dispersion, with $g_{\alpha\beta}$ as a statistics matrix. We derive the bosonized form of the model and discuss the relation to the effective low-energy description of the edge excitations for abelian fractional quantum Hall states in multilayer systems.
