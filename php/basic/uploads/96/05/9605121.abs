Title: Symmetries of an Extended Hubbard Model
Authors: Bianca L. Cerchiai and Peter Schupp
Abstract: An extended Hubbard model with phonons is considered on a D-dimensional lattice. The symmetries of the model are studied in various cases. It is shown that for a certain choice of the parameters a superconducting SU_q(2) holds as a true quantum symmetry - but only for D=1. In a natural basis the symmetry requires vanishing local phonon coupling; a quantum symmetric Hubbard model without phonons can then be obtained by a mean field approximation.
