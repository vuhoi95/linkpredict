Title: Toda lattice field theories, discrete W algebras, Toda lattice  hierarchies and quantum groups
Authors: L. Bonora and L. P. Colatto and C. P. Constantinidis
Abstract: In analogy with the Liouville case we study the $sl_3$ Toda theory on the lattice and define the relevant quadratic algebra and out of it we recover the discrete $W_3$ algebra. We define an integrable system with respect to the latter and establish the relation with the Toda lattice hierarchy. We compute the the relevant continuum limits. Finally we find the quantum version of the quadratic algebra.
