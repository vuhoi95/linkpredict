Title: Minimal Dynamical Triangulations of Random Surfaces
Authors: M. J. Bowick and S. M. Catterall and G. Thorleifsson
Abstract: We introduce and investigate numerically a minimal class of dynamical triangulations of two-dimensional gravity on the sphere in which only vertices of order five, six or seven are permitted. We show firstly that this restriction of the local coordination number, or equivalently intrinsic scalar curvature, leaves intact the fractal structure characteristic of generic dynamically triangulated random surfaces. Furthermore the Ising model coupled to minimal two-dimensional gravity still possesses a continuous phase transition. The critical exponents of this transition correspond to the usual KPZ exponents associated with coupling a central charge c=1/2 model to two-dimensional gravity.
