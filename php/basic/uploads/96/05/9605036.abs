Title: SUSY Gauge Dynamics and Singularities of 4d N=1 String Vacua
Authors: S. Kachru and N. Seiberg and E. Silverstein
Abstract: Many N=1 heterotic string compactifications exhibit physically mysterious singularities at codimension one in the moduli space of vacua. At these singularities, Yukawa couplings of charged fields develop poles as a function of the moduli. We explain these conformal field theory singularities, in a class of examples, as arising from non-perturbative gauge dynamics of non-perturbative gauge bosons (whose gauge coupling is the sigma model coupling) in the string theory.
