Title: Intersecting M-branes and bound states
Authors: N. Khviengia and Z. Khviengia and H. Lu and C. N. Pope
Abstract: In this paper, we construct multi-scalar, multi-center $p$-brane solutions in toroidally compactified M-theory. We use these solutions to show that all supersymmetric $p$-branes can be viewed as bound states of certain basic building blocks, namely $p$-branes that preserve $1/2$ of the supersymmetry. We also explore the M-theory interpretation of $p$-branes in lower dimensions. We show that all the supersymmetric $p$-branes can be viewed as intersections of M-branes or boosted M-branes in $D=11$.
