Title: TG-Equivariance of Connections and Gauge Transformations
Authors: H. M. Bosselmann and N. A. Papadopoulos
Abstract: We consider the notion of a connection on a principal bundle $P(M,G)$ from the point of view of the action of the tangential group $TG$. This leads to a new definition of a connection and allows to interpret gauge transformations as effect of the $TG$ action.
