Title: Perturbative Renormalization with Flow Equations in Minkowski Space
Authors: Georg Keller and Christoph Kopper and Clemens Schophaus
Abstract: We show within the Wilson renormalization group framework how the flow equation method can be used to prove the perturbative renormalizability of a relativistic massive selfinteracting scalar field. Furthermore we prove the regularity of the renormalized relativistic one-particle irreducible n-point Green functions in the region predicted by axiomatic quantum field theory which ensures that physical renormalization conditions for the two-point function can be imposed.
