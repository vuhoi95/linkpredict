Title: An Analysis of the Representations of the Mapping Class Group of a  Multi-Geon Three-Manifold
Authors: Rafael D. Sorkin and Sumati Surya
Abstract: It is well known that the inequivalent unitary irreducible representations (UIR's) of the mapping class group $G$ of a 3-manifold give rise to ``theta sectors'' in theories of quantum gravity with fixed spatial topology. In this paper, we study several families of UIR's of $G$ and attempt to understand the physical implications of the resulting quantum sectors. The mapping class group of a three-manifold which is the connected sum of $\R^3$ with a finite number of identical irreducible primes is a semi-direct product group. Following Mackey's theory of induced representations, we provide an analysis of the structure of the general finite dimensional UIR of such a group. In the picture of quantized primes as particles (topological geons), this general group-theoretic analysis enables one to draw several interesting qualitative conclusions about the geons' behavior in different quantum sectors, without requiring an explicit knowledge of the UIR's corresponding to the individual primes.
