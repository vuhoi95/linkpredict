Title: Super-Virasoro Anomaly, Super-Weyl Anomaly and the Super-Liouville  Action for 2D Supergravity
Authors: Takanori Fujiwara and Hiroshi Igarashi and Tadao Suzuki
Abstract: The relation between super-Virasoro anomaly and super-Weyl anomaly in $N=1$ NSR superstring coupled with 2D supergravity is investigated from canonical theoretical view point. The WZW action canceling the super-Virasoro anomaly is explicitly constructed. It is super-Weyl invariant but nonlocal functional of 2D supergravity. The nonlocality can be remedied by the super-Liouvlle action, which in turn recovers the super-Weyl anomaly. The final gravitational effective action turns out to be local but noncovariant super-Liouville action, describing the dynamical behavior of the super-Liouville fields. The BRST invariance of this approach is examined in the superconformal gauge and in the light-cone gauge.
