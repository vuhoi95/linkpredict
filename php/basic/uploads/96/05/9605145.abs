Title: Higher-Derivative Gravity in String Theory
Authors: Kristin Forger and Burt A. Ovrut and Stefan J. Theisen and Daniel Waldram
Abstract: We explicitly extract the structure of higher-derivative curvature-squared terms at genus 0 and 1 in the d=4 heterotic string effective action compactified on symmetric orbifolds by computing on-shell S-matrix superstring amplitudes. In particular, this is done within the context of calculating the graviton 4-point amplitude. We also discuss the moduli-dependent gravitational threshold corrections to the coupling associated with the CP even quadratic curvature terms.
