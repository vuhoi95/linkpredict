Title: One-Loop Superstring Cosmology and the Non-Singular Universe
Authors: Richard Easther and Kei-ichi Maeda
Abstract: We study the cosmological implications of the one-loop terms in the string expansion. In particular, we find non-singular solutions which interpolate between a contracting universe and an expanding universe, and show that these solutions provide a mechanism for removing the initial conditions problem peculiar to spatially closed FRW cosmologies. In addition, we perform numerical calculations to show that the non-singular cosmologies do not require a careful choice of initial conditions, and estimate the likely magnitude of higher order terms in the string expansion.
