Title: Effective Field Theory for Coherent Optical Pulse Propagation
Authors: Q-Han Park and H. J. Shin
Abstract: Hidden nonabelian symmetries in nonlinear interactions of radiation with matter are clarified. In terms of a nonabelian potential variable, we construct an effective field theory of self-induced transparency, a phenomenon of lossless coherent pulse propagation, in association with Hermitian symmetric spaces $G/H$. Various new properties of self-induced transparency, e.g. soliton numbers, effective potential energy, gauge symmetry and discrete symmetries, modified pulse area, conserved $U(1)$-charge etc. are addressed and elaborated in the nondegenerate two-level case where $G/H = SU(2)/U(1)$. Using the $U(1)$-charge conservation, a new type of analysis on pulse stability is given which agrees with earlier numerical results.
