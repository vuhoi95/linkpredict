Title: Dilaton Stabilization in the Context of Dynamical Supersymmetry Breaking  through Gaugino Condensation
Authors: Pierre Bin√©truy and Mary K. Gaillard and Yi-Yen Wu
Abstract: We study gaugino condensation in the context of superstring effective theories using the linear multiplet formulation for the dilaton superfield. Including nonperturbative corrections to the K\"ahler potential for the dilaton may naturally achieve dilaton stabilization, with supersymmetry breaking and gaugino condensation; these three issues are interrelated in a very simple way. In a toy model with a single static condensate, a dilaton $vev$ is found within a phenomenologically interesting range. The effective theory differs significantly from condensate models studied previously in the chiral formulation.
