Title: Mass, Confinement and CP Invariance in the Seiberg-Witten Model"
Authors: Massimo Di Pierro and Kenichi Konishi
Abstract: Several physics aspects of the Seiberg-Witten solution of N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with SU(2) gauge group, supplemented with a small mass term for the "matter" fields which leads to an $N=1$ theory with confinement, are discussed. The light spectrum of the theory is understood on the basis of current algebra relations, and CP invariance of the massless and massive theories is studied. We find that in the massive (confining) theory the low energy physics has an exact CP symmetry, while in a generic vacuum in the massless theory CP invarince is spontaneously broken.
