Title: Instantons or Monopoles? Dyons
Authors: V. Bornyakov and G. Schierholz
Abstract: Non-abelian gauge theories can be cast into abelian gauge theories with monopoles. We ask what becomes of the instantons after abelian projection. Instantons are found to consist of closed dyon loops. It is shown that the electric charge of the dyons is quantized. The implication of this result for the dynamics of the Yang-Mills vacuum is briefly discussed.
