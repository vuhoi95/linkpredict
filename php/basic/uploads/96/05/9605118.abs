Title: Aspects of Space-Time Dualities
Authors: A. Giveon and M. Porrati
Abstract: Duality groups of Abelian gauge theories on four manifolds and their reduction to two dimensions are considered. The duality groups include elements that relate different space-times in addition to relating different gauge-coupling matrices. We interpret (some of) such dualities as the geometrical symmetries of compactified theories in higher dimensions. In particular, we consider compactifications of a (self-dual) 2-form in 6-D, and compactifications of a self-dual 4-form in 10-D. Relations with a self-dual superstring in 6-D and with the type IIB superstring are discussed.
