Title: Photon splitting in strong magnetic fields: asymptotic approximation  formulae vs. accurate numerical results
Authors: C. Wilke and G. Wunner
Abstract: We present the results of a numerical calculation of the photon splitting rate below the electron-pair creation threshold ($\omega \le 2m$) in magnetic fields $B ~{> \atop \sim}~ B_{\rm cr} = m^2 /e = 4.414 \times 10^{9}$ T. Our results confirm asymptotic approximations derived in the low-field ($B < B_{\rm cr}$) and high-field ($B \gg B_{\rm cr}$) limit, and allow interpolating between the two asymptotic regions. Our expression for the photon splitting rate is a simplified version of a formula given by Mentzel et al. We also point out that, although the analytical formula is correct, the splitting rates calculated there are wrong due to an error in the numerical calculations.
