Title: Non-Abelian Momentum-Winding Exchange
Authors: C. Klimcik and P. Severa
Abstract: A non-Abelian analogue of the Abelian T-duality momentum-winding exchange is described. The non-Abelian T-duality relates $\sigma$-models living on the cosets of a Drinfeld double with respect to its isotropic subgroups. The role of the Abelian momentum-winding lattice is in general played by the fundamental group of the Drinfeld double.
