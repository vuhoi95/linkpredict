Authors: A. E. Chubykalo and M. W. Evans and R. Smirnov-Rueda
Abstract: A charge $q$ moving in a reference laboratory system with constant velocity {\bf V} in the $X$-axis produces in the $Z$-axis a longitudinal, phase free, vacuum magnetic field which is identified as the radiated ${\bf B}^{(3)}$ field of Evans, Vigier and others.
