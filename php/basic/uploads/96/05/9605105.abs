Title: Solving the strongly coupled 2D gravity III: String susceptibility and  topological N-point functions
Authors: Jean-Loup Gervais and Jean-Fran√ßois Roussel
Abstract: We spell out the derivation of novel features, put forward earlier in a letter, of two dimensional gravity in the strong coupling regime, at $C_L=7$, 13, 19. Within the operator approach previously developed, they neatly follow from the appearence of a new cosmological term/marginal operator, different from the standard weak-coupling one, that determines the world sheet interaction. The corresponding string susceptibility is obtained and found real contrary to the continuation of the KPZ formula. Strongly coupled (topological like) models--only involving zero-mode degrees of freedom--are solved up to sixth order, using the ward identities which follow from the dependence upon the new cosmological constant. They are technically similar to the weakly coupled ones, which reproduce the matrix model results, but gravity and matter quantum numbers are entangled differently.
