Title: Algebraic Bethe ansatz approach for the one-dimensional Hubbard model
Authors: P. B. Ramos and M. J. Martins
Abstract: We formulate in terms of the quantum inverse scattering method the algebraic Bethe ansatz solution of the one-dimensional Hubbard model. The method developed is based on a new set of commutation relations which encodes a hidden symmetry of 6-vertex type.
