Title: Absorption vs Decay of Black holes in string theory and T-symmetry
Authors: Avinash Dhar and Gautam Mandal and Spenta R. Wadia
Abstract: Classically a black hole can absorb but not emit energy. We discuss how this T-asymmetric property of black holes arises in the recently proposed (T-symmetric) microscopic models of black holes based on bound states of D-branes. In these string theory based models, the nonvanishing classical absorption is made possible essentially by the exponentially increasing degeneracy of quantum states with mass of the black hole. The classical limit of the absorption crosssection computed in the microscopic model agrees with the result obtained from a classical analysis of a wave propagating in the background metric of the corresponding black hole (upto a numerical factor).
