Title: Isomonodromic Quantization of Dimensionally Reduced Gravity
Authors: D. Korotkin and H. Nicolai
Abstract: We present a detailed account of the isomonodromic quantization of dimensionally reduced Einstein gravity with two commuting Killing vectors. This theory constitutes an integrable ``midi-superspace" version of quantum gravity with infinitely many interacting physical degrees of freedom. The canonical treatment is based on the complete separation of variables in the isomonodromic sectors of the model. The Wheeler-DeWitt and diffeomorphism constraints are thereby reduced to the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations for $SL(2,R)$. The physical states are shown to live in a well defined Hilbert space and are manifestly invariant under the full diffeomorphism group. An infinite set of independent observables \`a la Dirac exists both at the classical and the quantum level. Using the discrete unitary representations of $SL(2,R)$, we construct explicit quantum states. However, satisfying the additional constraints associated with the coset space $SL(2,R)/SO(2)$ requires solutions based on the principal series representations, which are not yet known. We briefly discuss the possible implications of our results for string theory.
