Title: Constrained systems described by Nambu mechanics
Authors: C. C. Lassig and G. C. Joshi
Abstract: Using the framework of Nambu's generalised mechanics, we obtain a new description of constrained Hamiltonian dynamics, involving the introduction of another degree of freedom in phase space, and the necessity of defining the action integral on a world sheet. We also discuss the problem of quantising Nambu mechanics.
