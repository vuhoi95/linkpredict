Title: Integrable discretizations of the spin Ruijsenaars-Schneider models
Authors: O. Ragnisco and Yu. B. Suris
Abstract: Integrable discretizations are introduced for the rational and hyperbolic spin Ruijsenaars--Schneider models. These discrete dynamical systems are demonstrated to belong to the same integrable hierarchies as their continuous--time counterparts. Explicit solutions are obtained for arbitrary flows of the hierarchies, including the discrete time ones.
