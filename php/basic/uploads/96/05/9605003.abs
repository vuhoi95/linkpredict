Title: Chirality and Dirac Operator on Noncommutative Sphere
Authors: Ursula Carow-Watamura and Satoshi Watamura
Abstract: We give a derivation of the Dirac operator on the noncommutative $2$-sphere within the framework of the bosonic fuzzy sphere and define Connes' triple. It turns out that there are two different types of spectra of the Dirac operator and correspondingly there are two classes of quantized algebras. As a result we obtain a new restriction on the Planck constant in Berezin's quantization. The map to the local frame in noncommutative geometry is also discussed.
