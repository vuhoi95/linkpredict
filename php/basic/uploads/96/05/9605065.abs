Title: Correlation Functions in the Two-dimensional Ising Model in a Magnetic  Field at $T=T_c$
Authors: G. Delfino and P. Simonetti
Abstract: The one and two-particle form factors of the energy operator in the two-dimensional Ising model in a magnetic field at $T=T_c$ are exactly computed within the form factor bootstrap approach. Together with the matrix elements of the magnetisation operator already computed in ref.\,\cite{immf}, they are used to write down the large distance expansion for the correlators of the two relevant fields of the model.
