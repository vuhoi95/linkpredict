Title: Counting States of Black Strings with Traveling Waves
Authors: Gary T. Horowitz and Donalf Marolf
Abstract: We consider a family of solutions to string theory which depend on arbitrary functions and contain regular event horizons. They describe six dimensional extremal black strings with traveling waves and have an inhomogeneous distribution of momentum along the string. The structure of these solutions near the horizon is studied and the horizon area computed. We also count the number of BPS string states at weak coupling whose macroscopic momentum distribution agrees with that of the black string. It is shown that the number of such states is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the black string with traveling waves.
