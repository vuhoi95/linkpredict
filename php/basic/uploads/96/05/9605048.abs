Title: Classical Fields Near Thermal Equilibrium
Authors: Carsten Greiner and Berndt Muller
Abstract: We discuss the classical limit for the long-distance (``soft'') modes of a quantum field when the hard modes of the field are in thermal equilibrium. We address the question of the correct semiclassical dynamics when a momentum cut-off is introduced. Higher order contributions leads to a stochastic interpretation for the effective action in analogy to Quantum Brownian Motion, resulting in dissipation and decoherence for the evolution of the soft modes. Particular emphasis is put on the understanding of dissipation. Our discussion focuses mostly on scalar fields, but we make some remarks on the extension to gauge theories.
