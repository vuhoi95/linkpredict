Title: Black hole solutions with dilatonic hair in higher curvature gravity
Authors: S. O. Alexeyev and M. V. Pomazanov
Abstract: A new numerical integration method for examining a black hole structure was realized. Black hole solutions with dilatonic hair of 4D low energy effective SuperString Theory action with Gauss-Bonnet quadratic curvature contribution were studied, using this method, inside and outside the event horizon. Thermodynamical properties of this solution were also studied.
