Title: 2+1 dimensional charged black hole with (anti-)self dual Maxwell fields
Authors: Masaru Kamata and Takao Koikawa
Abstract: We discuss the exact electrically charged BTZ black hole solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations with a negative cosmological constant in 2+1 spacetime dimensions assuming a (anti-)self dual condition between the electromagnetic fields. In a coordinate condition there appears a logarithmic divergence in the angular momentum at spatial infinity. We show how it is to be regularized by taking the contribution from the boundary into account. We show another coordinate condition which leads to a finite angular momentum though it brings about a peculiar spacetime topology.
