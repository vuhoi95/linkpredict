Title: On the Fractional Electric Charge of a Magnetic Monopole at Nonzero  Temperature
Authors: A. Goldhaber and R. Parwani and H. Singh
Abstract: We extend recent discussions about the effect of nonzero temperature on the induced electric charge, due to CP violation, of a Dirac or an 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole. In particular, we determine the fractional electric charge of a very small 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole coupled to light fermions at nonzero temperature. If dyons with fractional electric charge exist in the Weinberg-Salam model, as recently suggested in the literature, then their charge too should be temperature dependent.
