Title: Topological susceptibility at zero and finite $T$ in SU(3) Yang-Mills  theory
Authors: B. All√©s and M. D'Elia and A. Di Giacomo
Abstract: We determine the topological susceptibility $\chi$ at T=0 in pure SU(3) gauge theory and its behaviour at finite $T$ across the deconfining transition. We use an improved topological charge density operator. $\chi$ drops sharply by one order of magnitude at the deconfining temperature $T_c$.
