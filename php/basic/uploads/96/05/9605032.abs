Abstract: The general form of N=2 supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of vector multiplets and hypermultiplets, with a generic gauging of the scalar manifold isometries is given. This extends the results already available in the literature in that we use a coordinate independent and manifestly symplectic covariant formalism which allows to cover theories difficult to formulate within superspace or tensor calculus approach. We provide the complete lagrangian and supersymmetry variations with all fermionic terms, and the form of the scalar potential for arbitrary quaternionic manifolds and special geometry, not necessarily in special coordinates. Lagrangians for rigid theories are also written in this general setting and the connection with local theories elucidated. The derivation of these results using geometrical techniques is briefly summarized.
