Title: Reflection Matrices for Integrable $N=1$ Supersymmetric Theories
Authors: M. Moriconi and K. Schoutens
Abstract: We study two-dimensional integrable $N=1$ supersymmetric theories (without topological charges) in the presence of a boundary. We find a universal ratio between the reflection amplitudes for particles that are related by supersymmetry and we propose exact reflection matrices for the supersymmetric extensions of the multi-component Yang-Lee models and for the breather multiplets of the supersymmetric sine-Gordon theory. We point out the connection between our reflection matrices and the classical boundary actions for the supersymmetric sine-Gordon theory as constructed by Inami, Odake and Zhang \cite{IOZ}.
