Authors: Noboru Kawamoto and Eisaku Ozawa and Kazuhiko Suehiro
Abstract: We present a quantization of previously proposed generalized Chern-Simons theory with $gl(1,{\bf R})$ algebra in 1+1 dimensions. This simplest model shares the common features of generalized CS theories: on-shell reducibility and violations of regularity. On-shell reducibility of the theory requires us to use the Lagrangian Batalin-Vilkovisky and/or Hamiltonian Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky formulation. Since the regularity condition is violated, their quantization is not straightforward. In the present case we can show that both formulations give an equivalent result. It leads to an interpretation that a physical degree of freedom which does not exist at the classical level appears at the quantum level.
