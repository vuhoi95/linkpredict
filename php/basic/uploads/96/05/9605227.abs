Title: The measure in three dimensional Nambu-Goto string theory
Authors: J. Ambjorn and A. Sedrakyan
Abstract: We show that the measure of the three dimensional Nambu-Goto string theory has a simple decomposition as a measure on two parameter group of induced area-preserving transformations of the immersed surface and a trivial measure for the area of the surface.
