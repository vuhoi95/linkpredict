Title: A q-Deformation of the Harmonic Oscillator
Authors: A. Lorek and A. Ruffing and J. Wess
Abstract: The q-deformed harmonic oscillator is studied in the light of q-deformed phase space variables. This allows a formulation of the corresponding Hamiltonian in terms of the ordinary canonical variables $x$ and $p$. The spectrum shows unexpected features such as degeneracy and an additional part that cannot be reached from the ground state by creation operators. The eigenfunctions show lattice structure, as expected.
