Title: An Itzykson-Zuber-like Integral and Diffusion for Complex Ordinary and  Supermatrices
Authors: Thomas Guhr and Tilo Wettig
Abstract: We compute an analogue of the Itzykson-Zuber integral for the case of arbitrary complex matrices. The calculation is done for both ordinary and supermatrices by transferring the Itzykson-Zuber diffusion equation method to the space of arbitrary complex matrices. The integral is of interest for applications in Quantum Chromodynamics and the theory of two-dimensional Quantum Gravity.
