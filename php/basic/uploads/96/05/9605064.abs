Title: Partition function for general multi-level systems
Authors: S. Meljanac and M. Stojic and D. Svrtan
Abstract: We describe a unified approach to calculating the partition functions of a general multi-level system with a free Hamiltonian. Particularly, we present new results for parastatistical systems of any order in the second quantized approach. Anyonic- like systems are briefly discussed.
