Title: One-loop counterterms for the dimensional regularization of arbitrary  Lagrangians
Authors: P. Pronin and K. Stepanyantz
Abstract: We present master formulas for the divergent part of the one-loop effective action for an arbitrary (both minimal and nonminimal) operators of any order in the 4-dimensional curved space. They can be considered as computer algorithms, because the one-loop calculations are then reduced to the simplest algebraic operations. Some test applications are considered by REDUCE analytical calculation system.
