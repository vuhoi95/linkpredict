Title: Response to Tarrach's "Mode Dependent Field Renormalization and  Trivialty"
Authors: M. Consoli and P. M. Stevenson
Abstract: We respond to Tarrach's criticisms (hep-th/9511034) of our work on lambda Phi^4 theory. Tarrach does not discuss the same renormalization procedure that we do. He also relies on results from perturbation theory that are not valid. There is no "infrared divergence" or unphysical behaviour associated with the zero-momentum limit of our effective action.
