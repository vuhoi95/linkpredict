Title: BPS mass spectrum from D-brane action
Authors: H. Ishikawa and Y. Matsuo and Y. Sugawara and K. Sugiyama
Abstract: We derive the BPS mass formulae of the Dirichlet branes from the Born-Infeld type action. BPS saturation is realized when the brane has the minimal volume while keeping the appropriate winding numbers. We apply the idea to two cases, type IIA superstring compactified on $T^4$ and $K3$. The result is consistent with the string duality, and the expected spectrum for the BPS states is reproduced.
