Title: Curves of Marginal Stability and Weak and Strong-Coupling BPS Spectra in  $N=2$ Supersymmetric QCD
Authors: Adel Bilal and Frank Ferrari
Abstract: We explicitly determine the global structure of the $SL(2,Z)$ bundle over the Coulomb branch of the moduli space of asymptotically free $N=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories with gauge group $SU(2)$ when massless hypermultiplets are present. For each relevant number of flavours, we show that there is a curve of marginal stability on the Coulomb branch, diffeomorphic to a circle, across which the BPS spectrum is discontinuous. We determine rigorously and completely the BPS spectra inside and outside the curve. In all cases, the spectrum inside the curve consists of only those BPS states that are responsible for the singularities of the low energy effective action (in addition to the massless abelian gauge multiplet which is always present). The predicted decay patterns across the curve of marginal stability are perfectly consistent with all quantum numbers carried by the BPS states. As a byproduct, we also show that the electric and magnetic quantum numbers of the massless states at the singularities proposed by Seiberg and Witten are the only possible ones.
