Title: Complete zeta-function approach to the electromagnetic Casimir effect  for spheres and circles
Authors: S. Leseduarte and August Romeo
Abstract: A technique for evaluating the electromagnetic Casimir energy in situations involving spherical or circular boundaries is presented. Zeta function regularization is unambiguously used from the start and the properties of Bessel and related zeta functions are central. Nontrivial results concerning these functions are given. While part of their application agrees with previous knowledge, new results like the zeta-regularized electromagnetic Casimir energy for a circular wire are included.
