Title: Statistics of holons and spinons in the t-J model
Authors: I. Ichinose and T. Matsui and K. Sakakibara
Abstract: We study the statistics of holons and spinons in the framework of the gauge theory. We start with the t-J model in the slave-boson formalism and use Chern-Simons gauge theory to study the statistics transmutation of quasiexcitations in the charge-spin separated phase.
