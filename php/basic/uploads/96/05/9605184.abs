Abstract: We consider various aspects of compactifications of the Type I/heterotic $Spin(32)/\Z_2$ theory on K3. One family of such compactifications includes the standard embedding of the spin connection in the gauge group, and is on the same moduli space as the compactification of the heterotic $E_8\times E_8$ theory on K3 with instanton numbers (8,16). Another class, which includes an orbifold of the Type I theory recently constructed by Gimon and Polchinski and whose field theory limit involves some topological novelties, is on the moduli space of the heterotic $E_8\times E_8$ theory on K3 with instanton numbers (12,12). These connections between $Spin(32)/\Z_2$ and $E_8\times E_8$ models can be demonstrated by T duality, and permit a better understanding of non-perturbative gauge fields in the (12,12) model. In the transformation between $Spin(32)/\Z_2$ and $E_8\times E_8$ models, the strong/weak coupling duality of the (12,12) $E_8\times E_8$ model is mapped to T duality in the Type I theory. The gauge and gravitational anomalies in the Type I theory are canceled by an extension of the Green-Schwarz mechanism.
