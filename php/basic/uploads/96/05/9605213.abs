Title: Higher-order simple Lie algebras
Authors: J. A. de Azcarraga and J. C. Perez Bueno
Abstract: It is shown that the non-trivial cocycles on simple Lie algebras may be used to introduce antisymmetric multibrackets which lead to higher-order Lie algebras, the definition of which is given. Their generalised Jacobi identities turn out to be satisfied by the antisymmetric tensors (or higher-order `structure constants') which characterise the Lie algebra cocycles. This analysis allows us to present a classification of the higher-order simple Lie algebras as well as a constructive procedure for them. Our results are synthesised by the introduction of a single, complete BRST operator associated with each simple algebra.
