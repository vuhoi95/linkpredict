Title: Integration Approach to Ising Models
Authors: Sergio Albeverio and Shao-Ming Fei
Abstract: An integral representation of the partition function for general $n$-dimensional Ising models with nearest or non-nearest neighbours interactions is given. The representation is used to derive some properties of the partition function. An exact solution is given in a particular case.
