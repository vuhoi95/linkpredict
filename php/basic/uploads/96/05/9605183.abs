Abstract: We find the finite volume QCD partition function for arbitrary quark masses. This is a generalization of a result obtained by Leutwyler and Smilga for equal quark masses. Our result is derived in the sector of zero topological charge using a generalization of the Itzykson-Zuber integral appropriate for arbitrary complex matrices. We present a conjecture regarding the result for arbitrary topological charge which reproduces the Leutwyler-Smilga result in the limit of equal quark masses. We derive a formula of the Itzykson-Zuber type for arbitrary {\em rectangular} complex matrices, extending the result of Guhr and Wettig obtained for {\em square} matrices.
