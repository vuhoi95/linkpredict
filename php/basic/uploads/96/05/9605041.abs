Title: Representation theory of deformed oscillator algebras
Authors: C. Quesne and N. Vansteenkiste
Abstract: The representation theory of deformed oscillator algebras, defined in terms of an arbitrary function of the number operator~$N$, is developed in terms of the eigenvalues of a Casimir operator~$C$. It is shown that according to the nature of the $N$ spectrum, their unitary irreducible representations may fall into one out of four classes, some of which contain bosonic, fermionic or parafermionic Fock-space representations as special cases. The general theory is illustrated by classifying the unitary irreducible representations of the Arik-Coon, Chaturvedi-Srinivasan, and Tamm-Dancoff oscillator algebras, which may be derived from the boson one by the recursive minimal-deformation procedure of Katriel and Quesne. The effects on non-Fock-space representations of the minimal deformation and of the quommutator-commutator transformation, considered in such a procedure, are studied in detail.
