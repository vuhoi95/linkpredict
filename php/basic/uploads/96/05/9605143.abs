Abstract: In this paper we continue our investigation of the N = 2 supergravity models, where scalar fields of hypermultiplets parameterize the nonsymmetric quaternionic manifolds. Using the results of our previous paper, where we have given an explicit construction for the Lagrangians and the supertransformations and, in-particular, the known global symmetries of the Lagrangians, we consider here the switching on the gauge interaction. We show that in this type of models there appears to be possible to have spontaneous supersymmetry breaking with two different scales and without a cosmological term. Moreover, such a breaking could lead to the generation of the Yukawa interactions of the scalar and spinor fields from the hypermultiplets which are absent in other known models.
