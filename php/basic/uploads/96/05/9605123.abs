Title: Quantum Knizhnik--Zamolodchikov equation for $U_q (\widehat{ sl_n})$ and  integral formula
Authors: T. Kojima and Y. H. Quano
Abstract: Presented is an integral formula for solutions to the quantum Knizhnik--Zamolodchikov equation of level $0$ associated with the vector representation of $U_q (\widehat{ sl_n})$. This formula gives a generalization of both our previous work for $U_q (\widehat{ sl_2})$ and Smirnov's formula for form factors of $SU(n)$ chiral Gross-Neveu model.
