Title: Causality in Dense Matter
Authors: B. D. Keister and W. N. Polyzou
Abstract: The possibility of non-causal signal propagation is examined for various theories of dense matter. This investigation requires a discussion of definitions of causality, together with interpretations of spacetime position. Specific examples are used to illustrate the satisfaction or violation of causality in realistic calculations.
