Title: Multi-vortex solution in the Sutherland model
Authors: I. AndriÄ‡ and V. Bardek and L. Jonke
Abstract: We consider the large-$N$ Sutherland model in the Hamiltonian collective-field approach based on the $1/N$ expansion. The Bogomol'nyi limit appears and the corresponding solutions are given by static-soliton configurations. They exist only for $\l<1$, i.e. for the negative coupling constant of the Sutherland interaction. We determine their creation energies and show that they are unaffected by higher-order corrections. For $\l=1$, the Sutherland model reduces to the free one-plaquette Kogut-Susskind model.
