Title: Odd Dimensional Translation between Complex and Quaternionic Mechanics
Authors: Stefano De Leo and Pietro Rotelli
Abstract: We complete the rules of translation between standard complex quantum mechanics (CQM) and quaternionic quantum mechanics (QQM) with a complex geometry. In particular we describe how to reduce ($2n$+$1$)-dimensional complex matrices to {\em overlapping\/} ($n$+$1$)-dimensional quaternionic matrices with generalized quaternionic elements. This step resolves an outstanding difficulty with reduction of purely complex matrix groups within quaternionic QM and avoids {\em anomalous} eigenstates. As a result we present a more complete translation from CQM to QQM and viceversa.
