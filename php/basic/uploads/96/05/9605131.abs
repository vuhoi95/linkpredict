Title: Finite temperature properties of the gauge theory of nonrelativistic  fermions
Authors: M. Onoda and I. Ichinose and T. Matsui
Abstract: We study the finite temperature properties of the gauge theory of nonrelativistic fermions by using RPA and ladder approximation. This gauge theory is relevant to two interesting systems: high-Tc superconductivity and electrons in the half-filled Landau level.
