Title: Curvature expansion for the background-induced gluodynamics string
Authors: D. V. Antonov and D. Ebert and Yu. A. Simonov
Abstract: Using cumulant expansion for an averaged Wilson loop we derive an action of the gluodynamics string in the form of a series in powers of the correlation length of the vacuum. In the lowest orders it contains the Nambu-Goto term and the rigidity term with the coupling constants computed from the bilocal correlator of gluonic fields. Some higher derivative corrections are calculated.
