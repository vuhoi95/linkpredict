Title: Symmetry, Integrable Chain Models and Stochastic Processes
Authors: Sergio Albeverio and Shao-Ming Fei
Abstract: A general way to construct chain models with certain Lie algebraic or quantum Lie algebraic symmetries is presented. These symmetric models give rise to series of integrable systems. As an example the chain models with $A_n$ symmetry and the related Temperley-Lieb algebraic structures and representations are discussed. It is shown that corresponding to these $A_n$ symmetric integrable chain models there are exactly solvable stationary discrete-time (resp. continuous-time) Markov chains whose spectra of the transition matrices (resp. intensity matrices) are the same as the ones of the corresponding integrable models.
