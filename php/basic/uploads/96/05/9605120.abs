Title: Non-Abelian Kubo Formula and the Multiple Time-Scale Method
Authors: Zhang Xiaofei and Li Jiarong
Abstract: The non-Abelian Kubo formula is derived from the kinetic theory. That expression is compared with the one obtained using the eikonal for a Chern-Simons theory. The multiple time-scale method is used to solve the non-Abelian Kubo formula, and the damping rate for longitudinal color waves is computed.
