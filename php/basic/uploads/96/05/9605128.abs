Title: Closed formula for Wilson loops for $SU(N)$ Quantum Yang-Mills Theory in  two dimensions
Authors: Abhay Ashtekar and Jurek Lewandowski and Donald Marolf and José Mourão and Thomas Thiemann
Abstract: A closed expression of the Euclidean Wilson-loop functionals is derived for pure Yang-Mills continuum theories with gauge groups $SU(N)$ and $U(1)$ and space-time topologies $\Rl^1\times\Rl^1$ and $\Rl^1\times S^1$. (For the $U(1)$ theory, we also consider the $S^1\times S^1$ topology.) The treatment is rigorous, manifestly gauge invariant, manifestly invariant under area preserving diffeomorphisms and handles all (piecewise analytic) loops in one stroke. Equivalence between the resulting Euclidean theory and and the Hamiltonian framework is then established. Finally, an extension of the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms for gauge theories is proposed. These axioms are satisfied for the present model.
