Title: Couplings of self-dual tensor multiplet in six dimensions
Authors: E. Bergshoeff and E. Sezgin and E. Sokatchev
Abstract: The (1,0) supersymmetry in six dimensions admits a tensor multiplet which contains a second-rank antisymmetric tensor field with a self-dual field strength and a dilaton. We describe the fully supersymmetric coupling of this multiplet to Yang-Mills multiplet, in the absence of supergravity. The self-duality equation for the tensor field involves a Chern-Simons modified field strength, the gauge fermions, and an arbitrary dimensionful parameter.
