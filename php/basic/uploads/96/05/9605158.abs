Title: Note on Constrained Cohomology
Authors: Francois Delduc and Nicola Maggiore and Olivier Piguet and Sylvain Wolf
Abstract: The cohomology of the BRS operator corresponding to a group of rigid symmetries is studied in a space of local field functionals subjected to a condition of gauge invariance. We propose a procedure based on a filtration operator counting the degree in the infinitesimal parameters of the rigid symmetry transformations. An application to Witten's topological Yang-Mills theory is given.
