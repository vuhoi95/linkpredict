Title: Square Root Singularity in Boundary Reflection Matrix
Authors: J. D. Kim and I. G. Koh
Abstract: Two-particle scattering amplitudes for integrable relativistic quantum field theory in 1+1 dimensions can normally have at most singularities of poles and zeros along the imaginary axis in the complex rapidity plane. It has been supposed that single particle amplitudes of the exact boundary reflection matrix exhibit the same structure. In this paper, single particle amplitudes of the exact boundary reflection matrix corresponding to the Neumann boundary condition for affine Toda field theory associated with twisted affine algebras $a_{2n}^{(2)}$ are conjectured, based on one-loop result, as having a new kind of square root singularity.
