Title: Reply to "Comment on 'Background Thermal Contributions in Testing the  Unruh effect' "
Authors: Sandro S. Costa and George E. A. Matsas
Abstract: Park et al's recent comment (hep-th/9605132) that for detectors with large energy gap in comparison with the temperature of the background thermal bath, the maximum excitation rate is obtained for some non-zero detector's velocity is correct but was previously discussed by ourselves elsewhere, and moreover does not affect in our paper above any mathematical formula, numerical result, and consequently our final conclusion that the background thermal bath does not contribute substantially in the depolarization of electrons at LEP.
