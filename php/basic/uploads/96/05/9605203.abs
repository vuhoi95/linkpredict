Title: Small Thermal Fluctuation on a Large Domain
Authors: Tetsuya Shiromizu and Masahiro Morikawa
Abstract: Weak first-order phase transitions proceed with percolation of new phase. The kinematics of this process is clarified from the point of view of subcritical bubbles. We examine the effect of small subcritical bubbles around a large domain of asymmetric phase by introducing an effective geometry. The percolation process can be understood as a perpetual growth of the large domain aided by the small subcritical bubbles.
