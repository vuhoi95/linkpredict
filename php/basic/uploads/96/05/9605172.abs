Title: Exact Solution of the One-Dimensional Non-Abelian Coulomb Gas at Large N
Authors: G. Semenoff and O. Tirkkonen and K. Zarembo
Abstract: The problem of computing the thermodynamic properties of a one-dimensional gas of particles which transform in the adjoint representation of the gauge group and interact through non-Abelian electric fields is formulated and solved in the large $N$ limit. The explicit solution exhibits a first order confinement-deconfinement phase transition with computable properties and describes two dimensional adjoint QCD in the limit where matter field masses are large.
