Title: Extremal Branes as Elementary Particles
Authors: Vijay Balasubramanian and Finn Larsen
Abstract: The supersymmetric p-branes of Type II string theory can be interpreted after compactification as extremal black holes with zero entropy and infinite temperature. We show how the p-branes avoid this apparent, catastrophic instability by developing an infinite mass gap. Equivalently, these black holes behave like elementary particles: they are dressed by effective potentials that prevent absorption of impinging particles. In contrast, configurations with 2, 3, and 4 intersecting branes and their nonextremal extensions, behave increasingly like conventional black holes. These results extend and clarify earlier work by Holzhey and Wilczek in the context of four dimensional dilaton gravity.
