Abstract: The spherical domains $S^d_\beta$ with conical singularities are a convenient arena for studying the properties of tensor Laplacians on arbitrary manifolds with such a kind of singular points. In this paper the vector Laplacian on $S^d_\beta$ is considered and its spectrum is calculated exactly for any dimension $d$. This enables one to find the Schwinger-DeWitt coefficients of this operator by using the residues of the $\zeta$-function. In particular, the second coefficient, defining the conformal anomaly, is explicitly calculated on $S^d_\beta$ and its generalization to arbitrary manifolds is found. As an application of this result, the standard renormalization of the one-loop effective action of gauge fields is demonstrated to be sufficient to remove the ultraviolet divergences up to the first order in the conical deficit angle.
