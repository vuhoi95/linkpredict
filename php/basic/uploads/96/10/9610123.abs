Title: Factored coset approach to bosonization in the context of topological  backgrounds and massive fermions
Authors: M. V. Manias and C. M. Naon and M. L. Trobo
Abstract: We consider a recently proposed approach to bosonization in which the original fermionic partition function is expressed as a product of a $G/G$-coset model and a bosonic piece that contains the dynamics. In particular we show how the method works when topological backgrounds are taken into account. We also discuss the application of this technique to the case of massive fermions.
