Title: Generalized action principle and extrinsic geometry for N=1  superparticle
Authors: Igor A. Bandos and Alexei Yu. Nurmagambetov
Abstract: It is proposed the generalized action functional for N=1 superparticle in D=3,4,6 and 10 space-time dimensions. The superfield geometric approach equations describing superparticle motion in terms of extrinsic geometry of the worldline superspace are obtained on the base of the generalized action. The off-shell superdiffeomorphism invariance (in the rheonomic sense) of the superparticle generalized action is proved. It was demonstrated that the half of the fermionic and one bosonic (super)fields disappear from the generalized action in the analytical basis. Superparticle interaction with Abelian gauge theory is considered in the framework of this formulation. The geometric approach equations describing superparticle motion in Abelian background are obtained.
