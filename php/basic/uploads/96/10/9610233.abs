Title: Quantum Fluctuations and Dynamical Chaos: An Effective Potential  Approach
Authors: Sergei G. Matinyan and Berndt MÃ¼ller
Abstract: We discuss the intimate connection between the chaotic dynamics of a classical field theory and the instability of the one-loop effective action of the associated quantum field theory. Using the example of massless scalar electrodynamics, we show how the radiatively induced spontaneous symmetry breaking stabilizes the vacuum state against chaos, and we speculate that monopole condensation can have the same effect in non-Abelian gauge theories.
