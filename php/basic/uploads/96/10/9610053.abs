Title: Self-Dual Strings and Stability of BPS States in N=2 SU(2) Gauge  Theories
Authors: A. Brandhuber and S. Stieberger
Abstract: We show how BPS states of supersymmetric SU(2) Yang-Mills with matter -both massless and massive- are described as self-dual strings on a Riemann surface. This connection enables us to prove the stability and the strong coupling behaviour of these states. The Riemann surface naturally arises from type-IIB Calabi-Yau compactifications whose three-branes wrapped around vanishing two-cycles correspond to one-cycles on this surface.
