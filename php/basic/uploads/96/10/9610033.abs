Title: Global effects in quaternionic quantum field theory
Authors: S. P. Brumby and G. C. Joshi
Abstract: We present some striking global consequences of a model quaternionic quantum field theory which is locally complex. We show how making the quaternionic structure a dynamical quantity naturally leads to the prediction of cosmic strings and non-baryonic hot dark matter candidates.
