Title: Implications of quaternionic dark matter
Authors: S. P. Brumby and B. E. Hanlon and G. C. Joshi
Abstract: Taking the complex nature of quantum mechanics which we observe today as a low energy effect of a broken quaternionic theory we explore the possibility that dark matter arises as a consequence of this underlying quaternionic structure to our universe. We introduce a low energy, effective, Lagrangian which incorporates the remnants of a local quaternionic algebra, investigate the stellar production of the resultant exotic bosons and explore the possible low energy consequences of our remnant extended Hilbert space.
