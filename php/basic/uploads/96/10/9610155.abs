Title: Enhancement of Supersymmetry Near 5d Black Hole Horizon
Authors: Ali Chamseddine and Sergio Ferrara and Gary W. Gibbons and Renata Kallosh
Abstract: Geometric Killing spinors which exist on AdS_{p+2} X S^{d-p-2} sometimes may be identified with supersymmetric Killing spinors. This explains the enhancement of unbroken supersymmetry near the p-brane horizon in d dimensions. The corresponding p-brane interpolates between two maximally supersymmetric vacua, at infinity and at the horizon. New case is studied here: p=0, d=5. The details of supersymmetric version of the very special geometry are presented. We find the area-entropy formula of the supersymmetric 5d black holes via the volume of S^3 which depends on charges and intersection matrix.
