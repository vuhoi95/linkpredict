Title: Combinatorics of Solitons in Noncritical String Theory
Authors: Masafumi Fukuma and Shigeaki Yahikozawa
Abstract: We study the combinatorics of solitons in $D<2$ (or $c<1$) string theory. The weights in the summation over multi-solitons are shown to be automatically determined if we further require that the partition function with soliton background be a $\tau$ function of the KP hierarchy, in addition to the $W_{1+\infty}$ constraint.
