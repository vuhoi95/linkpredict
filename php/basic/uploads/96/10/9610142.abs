Title: On the weak coupling spectrum of N=2 supersymmetric SU(n) gauge theory
Authors: Christophe Fraser and Timothy J. Hollowood
Abstract: The weak coupling spectrum of BPS saturated states of pure $N=2$ supersymmetric SU$(n)$ gauge theory is investigated. The method uses known results on the dyon spectrum of the analogous theory with $N=4$ supersymmetry, along with the action on these states of the semi-classical monodromy transformations. For dyons whose magnetic charge is not a simple root of the Lie algebra, it is found that the weak coupling region is divided into a series of domains, for which the dyons have different electric charge, separated by walls on which the dyons decay. The proposed spectrum is shown to be consistent with the exact solution of the theory at strong coupling in the sense that the states at weak coupling can account for the singularities at strong coupling.
