Title: A Systematic Approach to Confinement in N=1 Supersymmetric Gauge  Theories
Authors: Csaba Csaki and Martin Schmaltz and Witold Skiba
Abstract: We give necessary criteria for N=1 supersymmetric theories to be in a smoothly confining phase without chiral symmetry breaking and with a dynamically generated superpotential. Using our general arguments we find all such confining SU and Sp theories with a single gauge group and no tree level superpotential.
