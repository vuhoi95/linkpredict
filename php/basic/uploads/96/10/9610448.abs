Title: $Îµ$ expansion analysis of very weak first-order transitions in  the cubic anisotropy model, Part II
Authors: Peter Arnold and Yan Zhang
Abstract: A companion article analyzed very weakly first-order phase transitions in the cubic anisotropy model using $\eps$ expansion techniques. We extend that analysis to a calculation of the relative discontinuity of specific heat across the transition.
