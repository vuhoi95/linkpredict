Title: Topological solitons in Chern-Simons theories for double-layer  fractional quantum Hall effect
Authors: I. Ichinose and A. Sekiguchi
Abstract: Topological excitations in Chern-Simons gauge theories which describe double-layer fractional quantum Hall effct are studied. There are two types of solitons; one is vortex and the other is nontrivial pseudospin textures which are so-called skyrmion or meron. Effective field theory which describes these solitons is derived by duality transformation.
