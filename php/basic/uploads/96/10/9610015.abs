Title: Toda theories as contraction of affine Toda theories
Authors: A. Aghamohammadi and M. Khorrami and A. Shariati
Abstract: Using a contraction procedure, we obtain Toda theories and their structures, from affine Toda theories and their corresponding structures. By structures, we mean the equation of motion, the classical Lax pair, the boundary term for half line theories, and the quantum transfer matrix. The Lax pair and the transfer matrix so obtained, depend nontrivially on the spectral parameter.
