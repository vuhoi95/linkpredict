Title: Eliminating Infrared Divergences in the Pressure
Authors: I. T. Drummond and R. R. Horgan and P. V. Landshoff and A. Rebhan
Abstract: The pressure of a system in thermal equilibrium is expressed as a mass integral over a sum of thermal propagators. This allows a Dyson resummation and is used to demonstrate that potential infrared divergences are rendered harmless.
