Title: Instantons in QCD
Authors: T. Schaefer and E. Shuryak
Abstract: We review the theory and phenomenology of instantons in QCD. After a general overview, we provide a pedagogical introduction to semi-classical methods in quantum mechanics and field theory. The main part of the review summarizes our understanding of the instanton liquid in QCD and the role of instantons in generating the spectrum of light hadrons. We also discuss properties of instantons at finite temperature and the chiral phase transition. We give an overview over the importance of instantons in some other models, in particular two dimensional sigma models, electroweak theory and supersymmetric QCD.
