Title: New N=1 Superconformal Field Theories in Four Dimensions from D-brane  Probes
Authors: Ofer Aharony and Shamit Kachru and Eva Silverstein
Abstract: We present several new examples of nontrivial 4d N=1 superconformal field theories. Some of these theories exhibit exotic global symmetries, including non-simply laced groups (such as $F_4$). They are obtained by studying threebrane probes in F-theory compactifications on elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds. The geometry of the compactification encodes in a simple way the behavior of the gauge coupling and the K\"ahler potential on the Coulomb branch of these theories.
