Title: Solitons in (1,1)-supersymmetric massive sigma model
Authors: A. Opfermann and G. Papadopoulos
Abstract: We find the solitons of massive (1,1)-supersymmetric sigma models with target space the groups $SO(2)$ and $SU(2)$ for a class of scalar potentials and compute their charge, mass and moduli space metric. We also investigate the massive sigma models with target space any semisimple Lie group and show that some of their solitons can be obtained from embedding the $SO(2)$ and $SU(2)$ solitons.
