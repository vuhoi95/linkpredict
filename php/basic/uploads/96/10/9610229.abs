Title: Zeta-function on the generalised cone
Authors: Guido Cognola and Sergio Zerbini
Abstract: The analytic properties of the zeta-function for a Laplace operator on a generalised cone are studied in some detail using the Cheeger's approach and explicit expressions are given. In the compact case, the zeta-function of the Laplace operator turns out to be singular at the origin. As a result, strictly speaking, the zeta-function regularisation does not ``regularise'' and a further subtraction is required for the related one-loop effective potential.
