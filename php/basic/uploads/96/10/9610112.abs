Title: Kaluza-Klein electrically charged black branes in M-theory
Authors: Miguel S. Costa and Malcolm J. Perry
Abstract: We present a class of Kaluza-Klein electrically charged black p-brane solutions of ten-dimensional, type IIA superstring theory. Uplifting to eleven dimensions these solutions are studied in the context of M-theory. They can be interpreted either as a p+1 extended object trapped around the eleventh dimension along which momentum is flowing or as a boost of the following backgrounds: the Schwarzschild black (p+1)-brane or the product of the (10-p)-dimensional Euclidean Schwarzschild manifold with the (p+1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime.
