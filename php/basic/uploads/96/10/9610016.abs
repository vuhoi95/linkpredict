Title: Laying the ghost of the relativistic temperature transformation
Authors: P. T. Landsberg and G. E. A. Matsas
Abstract: Using the Unruh-DeWitt detector, it is shown that a universal and continuous Lorentz transformaion of temperature cannot exist for black-body radiation. Since any valid Lorentz transformation of temperature must be able to deal with black-body radiation, it is concluded that a universal and continuous temperature transformation does not exist.
