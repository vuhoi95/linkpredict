Title: Colliding Singularities in F-theory and Phase Transitions
Authors: Michael Bershadsky and Andrei Johansen
Abstract: We study F-theory on elliptic threefold Calabi-Yau near colliding singularities. We demonstrate that resolutions of those singularities generically correspond to transitions to phases characterized by new tensor multiplets and enhanced gauge symmetry. These are governed by the dynamics of tensionless strings. We also find new transition points which are associated with several small instantons simultaneously shrinking to zero size.
