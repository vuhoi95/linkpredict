Title: String Kaluza-Klein cosmologies with RR-fields
Authors: R. Poppe and S. Schwager
Abstract: We construct 4-dimensional cosmological FRW--models by compactifying a black 5-brane solution of type IIB supergravity, which carries both magnetic NS-NS-charge and RR-charge. The influence of nontrivial RR-fields on the dynamics of the cosmological models is investigated.
