Title: Stationary Dilatons with Arbitrary Electromagnetic Field
Authors: Tonatiuh Matos and Cesar Mora
Abstract: We present two new classes of axisymmetric stationary solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton equations with coupling constant $\alpha^2=3$. Both classes are written in terms of two harmonic maps $\lambda$ and $\tau$. $\lambda$ determines the gravitational potential and $\tau$ the electromagnetic one in such a form that we can have an arbitrary electromagnetic field. As examples we generate two solutions with mass ($M$), rotation ($s$) and scalar ($\delta$) parameters, one with electric charge ($q$) another one with magnetic dipole ($Q$) parameter. The first solution contains the Kerr metric for $q=\delta=0$.
