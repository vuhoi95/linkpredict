Title: Five-branes in M(atrix) Theory
Authors: Micha Berkooz and Michael R. Douglas
Abstract: We propose a construction of five-branes which fill both light-cone dimensions in Banks, Fischler, Shenker and Susskind's matrix model of M theory. We argue that they have the correct long-range fields and spectrum of excitations. We prove Dirac charge quantization with the membrane by showing that the five-brane induces a Berry phase in the membrane world-volume theory, with a familiar magnetic monopole form.
