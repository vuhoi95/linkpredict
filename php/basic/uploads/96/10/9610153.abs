Title: Equilibrium Statistical Ensembles and Structure of the Entropy  Functional in Generalized Quantum Dynamics
Authors: Stephen L. Adler and L. P. Horwitz
Abstract: We review here the microcanonical and canonical ensembles constructed on an underlying generalized quantum dynamics and the algebraic properties of the conserved quantities. We discuss the structure imposed on the microcanonical entropy by the equilibrium conditions.
