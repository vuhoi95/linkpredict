Title: Induced representations of the one dimensional quantum Galilei group
Authors: F. Bonechi and R. Giachetti and E. Sorace and M. Tarlini
Abstract: We study the representations of the quantum Galilei group by a suitable generalization of the Kirillov method on spaces of non commutative functions. On these spaces we determine a quasi-invariant measure with respect to the action of the quantum group by which we discuss unitary and irreducible representations. The latter are equivalent to representations on \ell^2, i.e. on the space of square summable functions on a one dimensional lattice.
