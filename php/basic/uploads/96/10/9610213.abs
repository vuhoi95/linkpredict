Title: Monopoles and Strings in Yang-Mills Theories
Authors: K. Langfeld and H. Reinhardt and M. Quandt
Abstract: Yang-Mills theory is studied in a variant of 't Hooft's maximal Abelian gauge. In this gauge magnetic monopoles arise in the Abelian magnetic field. We show, however, that the full (non-Abelian) magnetic field does not possess any monopoles, but rather strings of magnetic fluxes. We argue that these strings are the relevant infrared degrees of freedom. The properties of the magnetic strings which arise from a dilute instanton gas are investigated for the gauge group SU(2).
