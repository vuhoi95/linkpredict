Title: $C^*$-algebras of $b$-pseudodifferential operators and an  $\R^k$-equivariant index theorem
Authors: Richard B. Melrose and Victor Nistor
Abstract: We compute $K$-theory invariants of algebras of pseudodifferential operators on manifolds with corners and prove an equivariant index theorem for operators invariant with respect to an action of $\R^k.$ We discuss the relation between our results and the $\eta$-invariant.
