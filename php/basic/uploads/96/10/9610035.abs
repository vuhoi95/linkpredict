Title: Fermion Hilbert Space and Fermion Doubling in the Noncommutative  Geometry Approach to Gauge Theories
Authors: F. Lizzi and G. Mangano and G. Miele and G. Sparano
Abstract: In this paper we study the structure of the Hilbert space for the recent noncommutative geometry models of gauge theories. We point out the presence of unphysical degrees of freedom similar to the ones appearing in lattice gauge theories (fermion doubling). We investigate the possibility of projecting out these states at the various levels in the construction, but we find that the results of these attempts are either physically unacceptable or geometrically unappealing.
