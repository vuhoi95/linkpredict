Title: Structure constants for the osp(1|2) current algebra
Authors: I. P. Ennes and A. V. Ramallo and J. M. Sanchez de Santos
Abstract: We study the free field realization of the two-dimensional osp(1|2) current algebra. We consider the case in which the level of the affine osp(1|2) symmetry is a positive integer. Using the Coulomb gas technique we obtain integral representations for the conformal blocks of the model. In particular, from the behaviour of the four-point function, we extract the structure constants for the product of two arbitrary primary operators of the theory. From this result we derive the fusion rules of the osp(1|2) conformal field theory and we explore the connections between the osp(1|2) affine symmetry and the N=1 superconformal field theories.
