Title: T-duality and the moment map
Authors: C. Klimcik and P. Severa
Abstract: Aspects of Poisson-Lie T-duality are reviewed in more algebraic way than in our, rather geometric, previous papers. As a new result, a moment map is constructed for the Poisson-Lie symmetry of the system consisting of open strings propagating in a Poisson-Lie group manifold.
