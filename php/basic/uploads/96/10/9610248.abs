Title: On the Reduced SU(N) Gauge Theory in the Weyl-Wigner-Moyal Formalism
Authors: Hugo Garcia-Compean and Jerzy F. Plebanski and Norma Quiroz-Perez
Abstract: Weyl-Wigner-Moyal formalism is used to describe the large-$N$ limit of reduced SU$(N)$ quenching gauge theory. Moyal deformation of Schild-Eguchi action is obtained.
