Title: Antigraviting Bubbles with the Non-Minkowskian Asymptotics
Authors: A. Barnaveli and M. Gogberashvili
Abstract: The conventional approach describes the spherical domain walls by the same state equation as the flat ones. In such case they also must be gravitationally repulsive, what is seemingly in contradiction with Birkhoff's theorem. However this theorem is not valid for the solutions which do not display Minkowski geometry in the infinity. In this paper the solution of Einstein equations describing the stable gravitationally repulsive spherical domain wall is considered within the thin-wall formalism for the case of the non-Minkowskian asymptotics.
