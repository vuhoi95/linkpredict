Authors: L. G. Mardoyan and A. N. Sissakian and V. M. Ter-Antonyan
Abstract: The problem of separation of variables in a dyon--dyon system is discussed. A linear transformation is obtained between fundamental bases of this system. Comparison of the dyon--dyon system with a 4D isotropic oscillator is carried out.
