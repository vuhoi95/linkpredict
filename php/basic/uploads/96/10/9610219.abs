Title: Nongaussian Isocurvature Perturbations from Inflation
Authors: A. Linde and V. Mukhanov
Abstract: We present a class of very simple inflationary models of two scalar fields which leads to nongaussian isothermal perturbations with "blue" spectrum, n > 1. One of the models is inspired by supersymmetric theories where light scalar fields naturally acquire masses of the order of the Hubble constant H during inflation. Another model presumes that one of the fields has a nonminimal interaction with gravity. By a slight modification of parameters of these models one can obtain either gaussian isothermal perturbations, or nongaussian adiabatic perturbations with n > 1.
