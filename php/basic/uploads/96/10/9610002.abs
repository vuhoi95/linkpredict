Title: Gauge invariance and mass gap in (2+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Dimitra Karabali and V. P. Nair
Abstract: In terms of a gauge-invariant matrix parametrization of the fields, we give an analysis of how the mass gap could arise in non-Abelian gauge theories in two spatial dimensions.
