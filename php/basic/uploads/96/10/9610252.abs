Title: Resolution of Cosmological Singularities
Authors: Finn Larsen and Frank Wilczek
Abstract: We show that a class of 3+1 dimensional Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmologies can be embedded within a variety of solutions of string theory. In some realizations the apparent singularities associated with the big bang or big crunch are resolved at non-singular horizons of higher-dimensional quasi-black hole solutions (with compactified real time); in others plausibly they are resolved at D-brane bound states having no conventional space-time interpretation.
