Title: Boundary ABF Models
Authors: Tetsuji Miwa and Robert Weston
Abstract: We diagonalise the transfer matrix of boundary ABF models using bosonized vertex operators. We compute the boundary S-matrix and check the scaling limit against known results for perturbed boundary conformal field theories.
