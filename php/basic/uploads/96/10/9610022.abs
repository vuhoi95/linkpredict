Authors: Valeri A. Gritsenko and Viacheslav V. Nikulin
Abstract: Using the general method which was applied to prove finiteness of the set of hyperbolic generalized Cartan matrices of elliptic and parabolic type, we classify all symmetric (and twisted to symmetric) hyperbolic generalized Cartan matrices of elliptic type and of rank 3 with a lattice Weyl vector. We develop the general theory of reflective lattices T with 2 negative squares and reflective automorphic forms on homogeneous domains of type IV defined by T. We consider this theory as mirror symmetric to the theory of elliptic and parabolic hyperbolic reflection groups and corresponding hyperbolic root systems. We formulate Arithmetic Mirror Symmetry Conjecture relating both these theories and prove some statements to support this Conjecture. This subject is connected with automorphic correction of Lorentzian Kac--Moody algebras. We define Lie reflective automorphic forms which are the most beautiful automorphic forms defining automorphic Lorentzian Kac--Moody algebras, and we formulate finiteness Conjecture for these forms. Detailed study of automorphic correction and Lie reflective automorphic forms for generalized Cartan matrices mentioned above will be given in Part II.
