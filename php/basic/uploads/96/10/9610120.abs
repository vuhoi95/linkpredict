Title: Observability of Quantum State of Black Hole
Authors: Justin R. David and Avinash Dhar and Gautam Mandal and Spenta R. Wadia
Abstract: We analyze terms subleading to Rutherford in the $S$-matrix between black hole and probes of successively high energies. We show that by an appropriate choice of the probe one can read off the quantum state of the black hole from the S-matrix, staying asymptotically far from the BH all the time. We interpret the scattering experiment as scattering off classical stringy backgrounds which explicitly depend on the internal quantum numbers of the black hole.
