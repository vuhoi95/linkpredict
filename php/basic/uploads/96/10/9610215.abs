Title: Discrete Folding
Authors: Mark Bowick and Philippe Di Francesco and Olivier Golinelli and Emmanuel Guitter
Abstract: Models of folding of a triangular lattice embedded in a discrete space are studied as simple models of the crumpling transition of fixed-connectivity membranes. Both the case of planar folding and three-dimensional folding on a face-centered-cubic lattice are treated. The 3d-folding problem corresponds to a 96-vertex model and exhibits a first-order folding transition from a crumpled phase to a completely flat phase as the bending rigidity increases.
