Title: A Schwinger term in q-deformed su(2) algebra
Authors: Kazuo Fujikawa and Harunobu Kubo and C. H. Oh
Abstract: An extra term generally appears in the q-deformed $su(2)$ algebra for the deformation parameter $q = \exp{ 2 \pi i\theta}$, if one combines the Biedenharn-Macfarlane construction of q-deformed $su(2)$, which is a generalization of Schwinger's construction of conventional $su(2)$, with the representation of the q-deformed oscillator algebra which is manifestly free of negative norm. This extra term introduced by the requirement of positive norm is analogous to the Schwinger term in current algebra. Implications of this extra term on the Bloch electron problem analyzed by Wiegmann and Zabrodin are briefly discussed.
