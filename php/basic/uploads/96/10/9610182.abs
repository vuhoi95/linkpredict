Title: Explicit determination of a 727-dimensional root space of the hyperbolic  Lie algebra $E_{10}$
Authors: Oliver BÃ¤rwald and Reinhold W. Gebert
Abstract: The 727-dimensional root space associated with the level-2 root $\bLambda_1$ of the hyperbolic Kac--Moody algebra $E_{10}$ is determined using a recently developed string theoretic approach to hyperbolic algebras. The explicit form of the basis reveals a complicated structure with transversal as well as longitudinal string states present.
