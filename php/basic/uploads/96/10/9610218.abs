Title: On the gauge dependence of the topological sigma model beta functions
Authors: Luis Alvarez-Consul and C. P. Martin
Abstract: We compute the dependence on the classical action "gauge" parameters of the beta functions of the standard topological sigma model in flat space. We thus show that their value is a "gauge" artifact indeed. We also show that previously computed values of these beta functions can be continuously connected to one another by smoothly varying those gauge parameters.
