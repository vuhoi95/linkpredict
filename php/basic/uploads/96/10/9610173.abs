Title: Anomaly and Condensate in the Light-Cone Schwinger Model
Authors: J. Gamboa and I. Schmidt and L. Vergara
Abstract: The axial anomaly and fermion condensate in the light cone Schwinger model are studied following path integral methods. This formalism allows for a simple and direct calculation for these and other vacuum dependent phenomena.
