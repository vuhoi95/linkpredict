Title: D-Brane Actions with Local Kappa Symmetry
Authors: Mina Aganagic and Costin Popescu and John H. Schwarz
Abstract: We formulate world-volume actions that describe the dynamics of Dirichlet p-branes in a flat 10d background. The fields in these theories consist of the 10d superspace coordinates and an abelian world-volume gauge field. The global symmetries are given by the N=2A or N=2B super-Poincare group, according to whether p is even or odd. The local symmetries in the (p + 1)-dimensional world volume are general coordinate invariance and a fermionic kappa symmetry.
