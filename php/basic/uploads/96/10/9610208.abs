Title: Solution of the odderon problem for arbitrary conformal weights
Authors: J. Wosiek and R. E. Janik
Abstract: A new method is applied to solve the Baxter equation for three coupled, noncompact spins. Due to the equivalence with the system of three reggeized gluons, the intercept of the odderon trajectory is predicted for the first time, as the analytic function of the two relevant parameters.
