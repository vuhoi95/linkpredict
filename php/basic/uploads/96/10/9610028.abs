Title: Unstable Modes and Confinement in the Lattice Schr√∂dinger Functional  Approach
Authors: Paolo Cea and Leonardo Cosmai
Abstract: We analyze the problem of the Nielsen-Olesen unstable modes in the SU(2) lattice gauge theory by means of a recently introduced gauge-invariant effective action. We perform numerical simulations in the case of a constant Abelian chromomagnetic field. We find that for lattice sizes above a certain critical length the density of effective action shows a behaviour compatible with the presence of the unstable modes. We put out a possible relation between the dynamics of the unstable modes and the confinement.
