Title: Reaction-Diffusion Processes from Equivalent Integrable Quantum Chains
Authors: Malte Henkel and Enzo Orlandini and Jaime Santos
Abstract: One-dimensional reaction-diffusion systems are mapped through a similarity transformation onto integrable (and a priori non-stochastic) quantum chains. Time-dependent properties of these chemical models can then be found exactly. The reaction-diffusion processes related to free fermion systems with site-independent interactions are classified. The time-dependence of the mean particle density is calculated. Furthermore new integrable stochastic processes related to the Heisenberg XXZ chain are identified and the relaxation times for the particle density and density correlation for these systems are found.
