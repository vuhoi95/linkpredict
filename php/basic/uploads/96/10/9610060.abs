Title: Zero-branes in 2+1 dimensions
Authors: S. Forste and A. Kehagias
Abstract: We discuss zero-brane solutions in three-dimensional Minkowski space-time annihilated by half of the supersymmetries. The other half of the supersymmetries which should generate the supersymmetric multiplet are ill-defined and lead to a non bose-fermi degenerate solitonic spectrum.
