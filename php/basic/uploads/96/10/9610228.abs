Title: N=2 Supermultiplet of Currents and Anomalous Transformations in  Supersymmetric Gauge Theory
Authors: H. Itoyama and M. Koike and H. Takashino
Abstract: We examine some properties of supermultiplet consisting of the U(1)_{J} current, extended supercurrents, energy-momentum tensor and the central charge in N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The superconformal improvement requires adding another supermultiplet beginning with the U(1)_{R} current. We determine the anomalous (quantum mechanical) supersymmetry transformation associated with the central charge and the energy-momentum tensor to one-loop order.
