Title: Experimental status of quaternionic quantum mechanics
Authors: S. P. Brumby and G. C. Joshi
Abstract: Analysis of the logical foundations of quantum mechanics indicates the possibility of constructing a theory using quaternionic Hilbert spaces. Whether this mathematical structure reflects reality is a matter for experiment to decide. We review the only direct search for quaternionic quantum mechanics yet carried out and outline a recent proposal by the present authors to look for quaternionic effects in correlated multi-particle systems. We set out how such experiments might distinguish between the several quaternionic models proposed in the literature.
