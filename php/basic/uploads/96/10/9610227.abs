Title: Deconfinement Transition and Flux-String Models
Authors: Arshad Momen and Carl Rosenzweig
Abstract: Flux-string models can be used to study the deconfining phase transition. In this note, we study the models proposed by Patel. We also study the large N_c limits of Patel's model. To discuss the validity of the mean field theory results, the one-loop Coleman-Weinberg effective potential is calculated for N_c=3. We argue that the quantum corrections vanish at large N_c when the energy of the so-called baryonic vertices scale with N_c.
