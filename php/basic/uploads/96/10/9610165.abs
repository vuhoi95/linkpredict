Title: Split Dimensional Regularization for the Temporal Gauge
Authors: Yaw-Hwang Chen and Ron-Jou Hsieh and Chilong Lin
Abstract: A split dimensional regularization, which was introduced for the Coulomb gauge by Leibbrandt and Williams, is used to regularize the spurious singularities of Yang-Mills theory in the temporal gauge. Typical one-loop split dimensionally regularized temporal gauge integrals, and hence the renormalization structure of the theory are shown to be the same as those calculated with some nonprincipal-value prescriptions.
