Title: Finite Temperature Schwinger Model with Chirality Breaking Boundary  Conditions
Authors: Stephan DÃ¼rr and Andreas Wipf
Abstract: The $N_f$-flavour Schwinger Model on a finite space $0\leq x^1\leq L$ and subject to bag-type boundary-conditions at $x^1=0$ und $x^1=L$ is solved at finite temperature $T=1/\beta$. The boundary conditions depend on a real parameter $\theta$ and break the axial flavour symmetry. We argue that this approach is more appropriate to study the broken phases than introducing small quark masses, since all calculations can be performed analytically. In the imaginary time formalism we determine the thermal correlators for the fermion-fields and the determinant of the Dirac-operator in arbitrary background gauge-fields. We show that the boundary conditions induce a CP-odd $\theta$-term in the effective action. The chiral condensate, and in particular its T- and L- dependence, is calculated for $N_f$ fermions. It is seen to depend on the order in which the two lengths $\beta=1/T$ and $L$ are sent to infinity.
