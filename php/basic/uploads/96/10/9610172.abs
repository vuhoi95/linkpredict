Abstract: We calculate the emission and absorption rates of fixed scalars by the near-extremal five-dimensional black holes that have recently been modeled using intersecting D-branes. We find agreement between the semi-classical and D-brane computations. At low energies the fixed scalar absorption cross-section is smaller than for ordinary scalars and depends on other properties of the black hole than just the horizon area. In the D-brane description, fixed scalar absorption is suppressed because these scalars must split into at least four, rather than two, open strings running along the D-brane. Consequently, this comparison provides a more sensitive test of the effective string picture of the D-brane bound state than does the cross-section for ordinary scalars. In particular, it allows us to read off the value of the effective string tension. That value is precisely what is needed to reproduce the near-extremal 5-brane entropy.
