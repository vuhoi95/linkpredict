Title: Magnetically charged solutions via an analog of the electric-magnetic  duality in (2+1)-dimensional gravity theories
Authors: Youngjai Kiem and Dahl Park
Abstract: We find an analog of the electric-magnetic duality, which is a $Z_2$ transformation between magnetic and electric sectors of the static and rotationally symmetric solutions in a class of (2+1)-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton gravity theories. The theories in our consideration include, in particular, one parameter class of theories continuously connecting the Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) gravity and the low energy string effective theory. When there is no $U(1)$ charge, we have $O(2)$ or $O(1,1)$ symmetry, depending on a parameter that specifies each theory. Via the $Z_2$ transformation, we obtain exact magnetically charged solutions from the known electrically charged solutions. We explain the relationship between the $Z_2$ transformation and $O(2,Z)$ symmetry, and comment on the $T$-duality of the string theory.
