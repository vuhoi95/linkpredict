Title: Field Theory, Critical Phenomena and Interfaces
Authors: Gernot Münster and Harald Grießhammer and Dirk Lehmann
Abstract: These lecture notes want to illustrate the close connection between statistical mechanics and field theory not only on the formal level, i.e. that many concepts of one area can easily be taken over to the other one, but also on the level of actual calculations. To this purpose, the last section will demonstrate that a special statistical system, the binary fluid system, can be described by field theory in its critical behaviour.
