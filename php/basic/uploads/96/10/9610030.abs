Title: The Origin of the Entropy in the Universe
Authors: A. Feinstein and M. A. Pérez Sebastián
Abstract: We discuss the entropy generation in quantum tunneling of a relativistic particle under the influence of a time varying force with the help of squeezing formalism. It is shown that if one associates classical coarse grained entropy to the phase space volume, there is an inevitable entropy increase due to the changes in position and momentum variances. The entropy change can be quantified by a simple expression $\Delta S=\ln\cosh 2r$, where $r$ is the squeeze parameter measuring the "height" and "width" of the potential barrier. We suggest that the universe could have acquired its initial entropy in a quantum squeeze from "nothing" and briefly discuss the implications of our proposal.
