Title: A Monopole Metric
Authors: Harry Braden and Paul Sutcliffe
Abstract: We calculate explicitly in terms of complete elliptic integrals the metric on the moduli space of tetrahedrally-symmetric, charge four, SU(2) monopoles. Using this we verify that in the asymptotic regime the metric of Gibbons and Manton is exact up to exponentially suppressed corrections.
