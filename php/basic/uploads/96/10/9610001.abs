Title: Quantizing N=2 matter-supergravity systems
Authors: M. T. Grisaru and A. Santambrogio and D. Zanon
Abstract: We consider $N=2$ supergravity coupled to $N=2$ Yang--Mills matter and discuss the nature of one--loop divergences. Using $N=1$ superfields and superspace methods, we describe the quantization of the system in the abelian case.
