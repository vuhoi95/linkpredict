Title: Geometries of orthogonal groups and their contractions: a unified  classical deformation viewpoint
Authors: Mariano Santander and Francisco J. Herranz
Abstract: The geometries of spaces having as groups the real orthogonal groups and some of their contractions are described from a common point of view. Their central extensions and Casimirs are explicitly given. An approach to the trigonometry of their spaces is also advanced.
