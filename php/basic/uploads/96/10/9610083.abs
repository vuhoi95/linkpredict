Title: BRST Formulation of Partition Function Constraints
Authors: J. Alfaro and K. Bering and P. H. Damgaard
Abstract: We show that constraints on the generating functional have direct BRST-extensions in terms of nilpotent operators $\Delta$ that annihilate this generating functional, and which may be of arbitrarily high order. The free energy $F$ in the presence of external sources thus satisfies a ``Master Equation'' which is described in terms of a tower of higher antibrackets.
