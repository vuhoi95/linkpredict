Title: Branched Polymers with Loops
Authors: J. Jurkiewicz and A. Krzywicki
Abstract: We propose a classification of critical behaviours of branched polymers for arbitrary topology. We show that in an appropriately defined double scaling limit the singular part of the partition function is universal. We calculate this partition function exactly in the generic case and perturbatively otherwise. In the discussion section we comment on the relation between branched polymer theory and Euclidean quantum gravity.
