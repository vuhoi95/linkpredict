Abstract: We use heterotic/type-II prepotentials to study quantum/classical black holes with half the $N=2, D=4$ supersymmetries unbroken. We show that, in the case of heterotic string compactifications, the perturbatively corrected entropy formula is given by the tree-level entropy formula with the tree-level coupling constant replaced by the perturbative coupling constant. In the case of type-II compactifications, we display a new entropy/area formula associated with axion-free black-hole solutions, which depends on the electric and magnetic charges as well as on certain topological data of Calabi--Yau three-folds, namely the intersection numbers, the second Chern class and the Euler number of the three-fold. We show that, for both heterotic and type-II theories, there is the possibility to relax the usual requirement of the non-vanishing of some of the charges and still have a finite entropy.
