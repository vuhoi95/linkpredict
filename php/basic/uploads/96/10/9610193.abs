Title: Knots and Particles
Authors: L. Faddeev and Antti J. Niemi
Abstract: Using methods of high performance computing, we have found indications that knotlike structures appear as stable finite energy solitons in a realistic 3+1 dimensional model. We have explicitly simulated the unknot and trefoil configurations, and our results suggest that all torus knots appear as solitons. Our observations open new theoretical possibilities in scenarios where stringlike structures appear, including physics of fundamental interactions and early universe cosmology. In nematic liquid crystals and 3He superfluids such knotted solitons might actually be observed.
