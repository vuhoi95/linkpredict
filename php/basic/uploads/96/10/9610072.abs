Title: Quantization on the Cone and Cyon-Oscillator Duality
Authors: A. N. Sissakian and V. M. Ter-Antonyan
Abstract: It is shown that the three-dimensional isotropic oscillator with coordinates belonging to the two-dimensional half-up cone is dual to the cyon , i.e. the planar particle-vortex bound system provided by fractional statistics.
