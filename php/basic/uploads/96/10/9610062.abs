Title: Non-Abelian T-duality for open strings
Authors: Stefan Forste and Alexandros A. Kehagias and Stefan Schwager
Abstract: In the first part of the talk we discuss T-duality for a free boson on a world sheet with boundary in a setting suitable for the generalization to non-trivial backgrounds. The gauging method as well as the canonical transformation are considered. In both cases Dirichlet strings as T-duals of Neumann strings arise in a generic way. In the second part the gauging method is employed to construct the T-dual of a model with non-Abelian isometries.
