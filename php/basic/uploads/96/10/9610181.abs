Title: Point-Like Structure in Strings and Non-Commutative Geometry
Authors: Farhad Ardalan and Amir H. Fatollahi
Abstract: Dynamics of a free point particle on a multi world-line is presented and shown to reduce to that of a bosonic string theory at the appropriate limit. Other higher dimensional extended objects are argued to appear at other regions of the space of configurations of the theory.
