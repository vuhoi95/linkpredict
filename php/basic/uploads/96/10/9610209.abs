Title: Transition Amplitude within the Stochastic Quantization Scheme --  Perturbative Treatment
Authors: Kazuya Yuasa and Hiromichi Nakazato
Abstract: The quantum mechanical transition amplitudes are calculated perturbatively on the basis of the stochastic quantization method of Parisi and Wu. It is shown that the stochastic scheme reproduces the ordinary result for the amplitude and systematically incorporates higher-order effects, even at the lowest order.
