Title: The Geometry of Supersymmetric Sigma-Models
Authors: Alexander Sevrin and Jan Troost
Abstract: We review non-linear sigma-models with (2,1) and (2,2) supersymmetry. We focus on off-shell closure of the supersymmetry algebra and give a complete list of (2,2) superfields. We provide evidence to support the conjecture that all N=(2,2) non-linear sigma-models can be described by these fields. This in its turn leads to interesting consequences about the geometry of the target manifolds. One immediate corollary of this conjecture is the existence of a potential for hyper-Kahler manifolds, different from the Kahler potential, which does not only allow for the computation of the metric, but of the three fundamental two-forms as well. Several examples are provided: WZW models on SU(2) x U(1) and SU(2) x SU(2) and four-dimensional special hyper-Kahler manifolds.
