Title: Mini-Instantons in SU(2) Gauge Theory
Authors: Vincenzo Branchina and Janos Polonyi
Abstract: The effects of instantons close to the cut-off is studied in four dimensional SU(2) gauge theory with higher order derivative terms in the action. It is found in the framework of the dilute instanton gas approximation that the convergence of the topological observables requires non-universal beta function.
