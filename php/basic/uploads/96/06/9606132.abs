Title: One-Loop Effective Action for Euclidean Maxwell Theory on Manifolds with  Boundary
Authors: Giampiero Esposito and Alexander Yu. Kamenshchik and Klaus Kirsten
Abstract: This paper studies the one-loop effective action for Euclidean Maxwell theory about flat four-space bounded by one three-sphere, or two concentric three-spheres. The analysis relies on Faddeev-Popov formalism and $\zeta$-function regularization, and the Lorentz gauge-averaging term is used with magnetic boundary conditions. The contributions of transverse, longitudinal and normal modes of the electromagnetic potential, jointly with ghost modes, are derived in detail. The most difficult part of the analysis consists in the eigenvalue condition given by the determinant of a $2 \times 2$ or $4 \times 4$ matrix for longitudinal and normal modes. It is shown that the former splits into a sum of Dirichlet and Robin contributions, plus a simpler term. This is the quantum cosmological case. In the latter case, however, when magnetic boundary conditions are imposed on two bounding three-spheres, the determinant is more involved. Nevertheless, it is evaluated explicitly as well. The whole analysis provides the building block for studying the one-loop effective action in covariant gauges, on manifolds with boundary. The final result differs from the value obtained when only transverse modes are quantized, or when noncovariant gauges are used.
