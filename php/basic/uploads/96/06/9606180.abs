Title: On the free field realization of the osp(1|2) current algebra
Authors: I. P. Ennes and A. V. Ramallo and J. M. Sanchez de Santos
Abstract: The free field representation of the osp(1|2) current algebra is analyzed. The four point conformal blocks of the theory are studied. The structure constants for the product of an arbitrary primary operator and a primary field that transforms according to the fundamental representation of osp(1|2) are explicitly calculated.
