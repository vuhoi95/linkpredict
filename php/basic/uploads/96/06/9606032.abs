Title: The Symmetric Space and Homogeneous sine-Gordon Theories
Authors: C. R. Fernandez-Pousa and M. V. Gallas and T. J. Hollowood and J. L. Miramontes
Abstract: Two series of integrable theories are constructed which have soliton solutions and can be thought of as generalizations of the sine-Gordon theory. They exhibit internal symmetries and can be described as gauged WZW theories with a potential term. The spectrum of massive states is determined.
