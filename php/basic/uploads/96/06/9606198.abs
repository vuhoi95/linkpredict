Title: Yang-Mills vacuum structure and quantum gravity
Authors: S. Odintsov and R. Percacci
Abstract: Using renormalization group methods we calculate the derivative expansion of the effective Lagrangian for a covariantly constant gauge field in curved spacetime. Curvature affects the vacuum, in particular it could induce phase transitions between different vacua. We also consider the effect of quantum fluctuations of the metric , in the context of a renormalizable $R^2$ theory. In this case the critical curvature depends on the gravi tational coupling constants.
