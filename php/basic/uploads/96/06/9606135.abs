Title: Supergravity Coupled to Chiral and Yang-Mills Matter at One Loop
Authors: Mary K. Gaillard and Vidyut Jain and Kamran Saririan
Abstract: We present the full result for the divergent one-loop contribution to the effective boson Lagrangian for supergravity coupled to chiral and Yang-Mills supermultiplets. We also consider the specific case of dilaton couplings in effective supergravity Lagrangians from superstrings, for which the one-loop result is considerably simplified.
