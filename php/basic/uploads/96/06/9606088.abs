Title: Shift Operator for Nonabelian Lattice Current Algebra
Authors: L. Faddeev and A. Yu. Volkov
Abstract: The shift operator for a quantum lattice current algebra associated with sl(2) is produced in the form of product of local factors. This gives a natural deformation of the Sugawara construction for discrete space-time.
