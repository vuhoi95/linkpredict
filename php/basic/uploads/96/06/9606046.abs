Title: Axiomatic Analyticity Properties and Representations of Particles in  Thermal Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Jacques Bros and Detlev Buchholz
Abstract: We provide an axiomatic framework for Quantum Field Theory at finite temperature which implies the existence of general analyticity properties of the $ n $-point functions; the latter parallel the properties derived from the usual Wightman axioms in the vacuum representation of Quantum Field Theory. Complete results are given for the propagators, including a generalization of the K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation. Some known examples of ``hard-thermal-loop calculations'' and the representation of ``quasiparticles'' are discussed in this general framework.
