Title: Vortices, flux tubes and other structures in the Ginzburg-Landau model:  a possible fine structure of the mixed state?
Authors: Yuri N. Obukhov and Franz E. Schunck
Abstract: We present new regular static isolated cylindrically symmetric solutions for the Ginzburg-Landau model which have finite Gibbs free energy. These configurations (which we call the {\it flux tube} and {\it type B} solutions) are energetically favorable in the interval of the external magnetic fields between the thermodynamic critical value $H_{c}$ and the upper critical field $H_{c_2}$ which indicates that they are important new elements of the mixed state describing a transition from vortices to the normal state.
