Abstract: We analyse the fusion of representations of the triplet algebra, the maximally extended symmetry algebra of the Virasoro algebra at c=-2. It is shown that there exists a finite number of representations which are closed under fusion. These include all irreducible representations, but also some reducible representations which appear as indecomposable components in fusion products.
