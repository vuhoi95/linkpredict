Title: Predictability and Semiclassical Approximation at the onset of Black  Hole formation
Authors: Sukanta Bose and Leonard Parker and Yoav Peleg
Abstract: We combine analytical and numerical techniques to study the collapse of conformally coupled massless scalar fields in semiclassical 2D dilaton gravity, with emphasis on solutions just below criticality when a black hole almost forms. We study classical information and quantum correlations. We show explicitly how recovery of information encoded in the classical initial data from the outgoing classical radiation becomes more difficult as criticality is approached. The outgoing quantum radiation consists of a positive-energy flux, which is essentially the standard Hawking radiation, followed by a negative-energy flux which ensures energy conservation and guarantees unitary evolution through strong correlations with the positive-energy Hawking radiation. As one reaches the critical solution there is a breakdown of unitarity. We show that this breakdown of predictability is intimately related to a breakdown of the semiclassical approximation.
