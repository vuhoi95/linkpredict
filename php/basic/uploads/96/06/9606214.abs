Title: On the anyon description of the Laughlin hole states
Authors: Heidi Kj√∏nsberg and Jon Magne Leinaas
Abstract: We examine the anyon representation of the Laughlin quasi-holes, in particular the one-dimensional, algebraic aspects of the representation. For the cases of one and two quasi-holes an explicit mapping to anyon systems is given, and the connection between the hole-states and coherent states of the fundamental algebras of observables is examined. The quasi-electron case is discussed more briefly, and some remaining questions are pointed out.
