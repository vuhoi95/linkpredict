Title: F-theory from Dirichlet 3-branes
Authors: Dileep P. Jatkar and S. Kalyana Rama
Abstract: Starting from the type IIB Dirichlet 3-brane action, we obtain a Nambu-Goto action. It is interpreted as the world volume action of a fundamental 3-brane, and its target space theory as F-theory. The target space is twelve dimensional, with signature $(11, 1)$. It is an elliptic fibration over a ten dimensional base space. The $SL(2, Z)$ symmetry of type IIB string has now an explicit geometric interpretation. Also, one gets a glimpse of the conjectured self-duality of M-theory.
