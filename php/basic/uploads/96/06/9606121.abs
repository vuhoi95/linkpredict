Title: A Geometric Representation for the Proca Model
Authors: Jaime Camacaro and Rolando Gait√°n and Lorenzo Leal
Abstract: The Proca model is quantized in an open-path dependent representation that generalizes the Loop Representation of gauge theories. The starting point is a gauge invariant Lagrangian that reduces to the Proca Lagrangian when certain gauge is selected.
