Title: Characteristic cohomology of $p$-form gauge theories
Authors: Marc Henneaux and Bernard Knaepen and Christiane Schomblond
Abstract: The characteristic cohomology $H^k_{char}(d)$ for an arbitrary set of free $p$-form gauge fields is explicitly worked out in all form degrees $k<n-1$, where $n$ is the spacetime dimension. It is shown that this cohomology is finite-dimensional and completely generated by the forms dual to the field strengths. The gauge invariant characteristic cohomology is also computed. The results are extended to interacting $p$-form gauge theories with gauge invariant interactions. Implications for the BRST cohomology are mentioned.
