Title: Supersymmetric Sine-Gordon Model and the Eight-Vertex Free Fermion model  with Boundary
Authors: Changrim Ahn and Wai Ming Koo
Abstract: We compute the boundary scattering amplitudes of the breathers of the supersymmetric sine-Gordon model using the fusion of the soliton-antisoliton pair scattering with the boundary with a known result of the soliton boundary scattering amplitudes. We also solve the boundary Yang-Baxter equation of the eight-vertex free fermion models to find the boundary reflection matrices. The former result is confirmed by the latter since the bulk $S$-matrices of the breathers can be identified with the trigonometric limit of the Boltzmann weights of the free fermion models. Our dual approach can answer a few quesions on the relationships between the free parameters in the boundary potential and those in the scattering amplitudes.
