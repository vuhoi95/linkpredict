Title: Anyons and Chiral Solitons on a Line
Authors: U. Aglietti and L. Griguolo and R. Jackiw and S. -Y. Pi and D. Seminara
Abstract: We show that excitations in a recently proposed gauge theory for anyons on a line in fact do not obey anomalous statistics. On the other hand, the theory supports novel chiral solitons. Also we construct a field-theoretic description of lineal anyons, but gauge fields play no role.
