Title: Equivalence of Two Approaches to the mKdV Hierarchies
Authors: Benjamin Enriquez and Edward Frenkel
Abstract: The equivalence between the approaches of Drinfeld-Sokolov and Feigin-Frenkel to the mKdV hierarchies is established. A new derivation of the mKdV equations in the zero curvature form is given. Connection with the Baker-Akhiezer function and the tau-function is also discussed.
