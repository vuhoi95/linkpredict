Abstract: We study the path-integral formalism in the imaginary-time to show its validity in a case with a metastable ground state. The well-known method based on the bounce solution leads to the imaginary part of the energy even for a state that is only metastable and has a simple oscillating behavior instead of decaying. Although this has been argued to be the failure of the Euclidean formalism, we show that proper account of the global structure of the path-space leads to a valid expression for the energy spectrum, without the imaginary part. For this purpose we use the proper valley method to find a new type of instanton-like configuration, the ``valley instantons''. Although valley instantons are not the solutions of equation of motion, they have dominant contribution to the functional integration. A dilute-gas approximation for the valley instantons is shown to lead to the energy formula. This method extends the well-known imaginary-time formalism so that it can take into account the global behavior of the theory.
