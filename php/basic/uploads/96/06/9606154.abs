Title: Logarithmic Correlation Functions in Two Dimensional Turbulence
Authors: M. R. Rahimi Tabar and S. Rouhani
Abstract: We consider the correlation functions of two-dimensional turbulence in the presence and absence of a three-dimensional perturbation, by means of conformal field theory. In the persence of three dimensional perturbation, we show that in the strong coupling limit of a small scale random force, there is some logarithmic factor in the correlation functions of velocity stream functions. We show that the logarithmic conformal field theory $c_{8,1}$ describes the 2D- turbulence both in the absence and the presence of the perturbation. We obtain the following energy spectrum $E(k) \sim k^{-5.125 } \ln(k )$ for perturbed 2D - turbulence and $E(k) \sim k^{-5 } \ln(k )$ for unperturbed turbulence. Recent numerical simulation and experimental results confirm our prediction.
