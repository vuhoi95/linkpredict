Title: Non-extreme black holes from non-extreme intersecting M-branes
Authors: M. Cvetic and A. A. Tseytlin
Abstract: We present non-extreme generalisations of intersecting p-brane solutions of eleven-dimensional supergravity which upon toroidal compactification reduce to non-extreme static black holes in dimensions D=4, D=5 and 5<D<10, parameterized by four, three and two charges, respectively. The D=4 black holes are obtained either from non-extreme configuration of three intersecting five-branes with a boost along the common string or from non-extreme intersecting system of two two-branes and two five-branes. The D=5 black holes arise from three intersecting two-branes or from a system of intersecting two-brane and five-brane with a boost along the common string. Five-brane and two-brane with a boost along one direction reduce to black holes in D=6 and D=9, respectively, while D=7 black hole can be interpreted in terms of non-extreme configuration of two intersecting two-branes. We discuss the expressions for the corresponding masses and entropies.
