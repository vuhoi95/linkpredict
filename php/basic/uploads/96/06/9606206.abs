Title: Quantum theory for mesoscopic electric circuits
Authors: You-Quan Li and Bin Chen
Abstract: A quantum theory for mesoscopic electric circuits in accord with the discreteness of electric charges is proposed. On the basis of the theory, Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the quantum LC-design and L-design is solved exactly. The uncertainty relation for electric charge and current is obtained and a minimum uncertainty state is solved. By introducing a gauge field, a formula for persistent current arising from magnetic flux is obtained from a new point of view.
