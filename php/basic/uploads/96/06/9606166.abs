Title: Particle-Flux Separation of Electrons in the Half-Filled Landau Level:  Chargeon-Fluxon Approach
Authors: I. Ichinose and T. Matsui
Abstract: Mechanism of the particle-flux separation in the Chern-Simons gauge theory coupled with nonrelativistic fermions is studied in a nonperturbative method. This problem is very important for the composite fermion approach to the fractional quantum Hall effect. We show that due to repulsive interactions between electrons the composite fermions are stable quasiexcitations in the half-filled Landau level at low temperature.
