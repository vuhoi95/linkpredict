Title: Supersymmetry Breaking and Duality in SU(N)xSU(N-M) Theories
Authors: E. Poppitz and Y. Shadmi and S. P. Trivedi
Abstract: We consider a class of N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories, with gauge group SU(N)xSU(N - M) and fundamental matter content. Duality plays an essential role in analyzing the nonperturbative infrared dynamics of these models. We find that Yukawa couplings drive these theories into the confining phase, and show how the nonperturbative superpotentials arise in the dual picture. We show that the odd-N, M = 2 models with an appropriate tree-level superpotential break supersymmetry.
