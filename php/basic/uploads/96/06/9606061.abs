Title: The self-dual sector of QCD amplitudes
Authors: G. Chalmers and W. Siegel
Abstract: We provide an action for self-dual Yang-Mills theory which is a simple truncation of the usual Yang-Mills action. Only vertices that violate helicity conservation maximally are included. One-loop amplitudes in the self-dual theory then follow as a subset of the Yang-Mills ones. In light-cone gauges this action is almost identical to previously proposed actions, but in this formulation the vanishing of all higher-loop amplitudes is obvious; the explicit perturbative S-matrix is known. Similar results apply to gravity.
