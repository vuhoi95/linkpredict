Title: Semiclassical Expansion for the Angular Momentum
Authors: Marko Robnik and Luca Salasnich
Abstract: After reviewing the WKB series for the Schr\"odinger equation we calculate the semiclassical expansion for the eigenvalues of the angular momentum operator. This is the first systematic semiclassical treatment of the angular momentum for terms beyond the leading torus approximation.
