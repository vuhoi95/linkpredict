Title: Generalized string compactifications with spontaneously broken  supersymmetry
Authors: Hans-Peter Nilles and Michal Spalinski
Abstract: The Narain lattice construction of string compactifications is generalized to include spontaneously broken supersymmetry. Consistency conditions from modular invariance and Lorentz symmetry are solved in full generality. This framework incorporates models where supersymmetry breaking is inversely proportional to the radii of compact dimensions. The enhanced lattice description, however, might allow for models with a different geometrical or even non-geometrical interpretation.
