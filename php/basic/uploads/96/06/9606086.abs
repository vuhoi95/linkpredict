Title: Perturbing Supersymmetric Black Hole
Authors: Hisashi Onozawa and Takashi Okamura and Takashi Mishima and Hideki Ishihara
Abstract: An investigation of the perturbations of the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole in the $N=2$ supergravity is presented. We prove in the extremal limit that the black hole responds to the perturbation of each field in the same manner. We conjecture that we can match the modes of the graviton, gravitino and photon because of supersymmetry transformations.
