Title: Vacuum Structures of Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theories in $1+1$  Dimensions
Authors: Hodaka Oda and Norisuke Sakai and Tadakatsu Sakai
Abstract: Vacuum structures of supersymmetric (SUSY) Yang-Mills theories in $1+1$ dimensions are studied with the spatial direction compactified. SUSY allows only periodic boundary conditions for both fermions and bosons. By using the Born-Oppenheimer approximation for the weak coupling limit, we find that the vacuum energy vanishes, and hence the SUSY is unbroken. Other boundary conditions are also studied, especially the antiperiodic boundary condition for fermions which is related to the system in finite temperatures. In that case we find for gaugino bilinears a nonvanishing vacuum condensation which indicates instanton contributions.
