Title: Geometrical Interpretation of the KPZ Exponents
Authors: J. Ambjorn and K. N. Anagnostopoulos and U. Magnea and G. Thorleifsson
Abstract: We provide evidence that the KPZ exponents in two-dimensional quantum gravity can be interpreted as scaling exponents of correlation functions which are functions of the invariant geodesic distance between the fields.
