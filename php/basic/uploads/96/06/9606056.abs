Title: A Universal Action Formula
Authors: Ali Chamseddine and Alain Connes
Abstract: A universal formula for an action associated with a noncommutative geometry, defined by a spectal triple $(\Ac ,\Hc ,D)$, is proposed. It is based on the spectrum of the Dirac operator and is a geometric invariant. The new symmetry principle is the automorphism of the algebra $\Ac $ which combines both diffeomorphisms and internal symmetries. Applying this to the geometry defined by the spectrum of the standard model gives an action that unifies gravity with the standard model at a very high energy scale.
