Title: WT identities for proper vertices and renormalization in a superspace  formulation of gauge theories
Authors: Satish D. Joglekar and Bhabani Prssad Mandal
Abstract: We formulate the WT identity for proper vertices in a simple and compact form $\partial \Gamma / {\partial \theta } =0 $ in a superspace formulation of gauge theories proposed earlier. We show this WT identity (together with a subsidiary constraint) lead, in transparent way, the superfield superspace multiplet renormalizations formulated earlier (and shown to explain symmetries of Yang-Mills theory renormalization).
