Title: On the Equation rotA = K A
Authors: J. Vaz Jr. and W. A. Rodrigues Jr
Abstract: We show that when correctly formulated the equation $\nabla \times \mbox{\boldmath $a$} = \kappa \mbox{\boldmath $a$}$ does not exhibit some inconsistencies atributed to it, so that its solutions can represent physical fields.
