Title: Free field representations for the affine superalgebra sl(2|1)
Authors: P. Bowcock and R-L. K. Koktava and A. Taormina
Abstract: Free field representations of the affine superalgebra $A(1,0)^{(1)}$ at level $k$ are needed in the description of the noncritical $N=2$ string. The superalgebra admits two inequivalent choices of simple roots. We give the Wakimoto representations corresponding to each of these and derive the relation between the two at the quantum level.
