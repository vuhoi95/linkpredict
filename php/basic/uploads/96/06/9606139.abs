Title: Branes Intersecting at Angles
Authors: Micha Berkooz and Michael R. Douglas and Robert G. Leigh
Abstract: We show that configurations of multiple D-branes related by SU(N) rotations will preserve unbroken supersymmetry. This includes cases in which two D-branes are related by a rotation of arbitrarily small angle, and we discuss some of the physics of this. In particular, we discuss a way of obtaining 4D chiral fermions on the intersection of D-branes. We also rephrase the condition for unbroken supersymmety as the condition that a `generalized holonomy group' associated with the brane configuration and manifold is reduced, and relate this condition (in Type IIA string theory) to a condition in eleven dimensions.
