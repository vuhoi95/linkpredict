Title: F-Theory Duals of Nonperturbative Heterotic E8xE8 Vacua in Six  Dimensions
Authors: Philip Candelas and Eugene Perevalov and Govindan Rajesh
Abstract: We present a systematic way of generating F-theory models dual to nonperturbative vacua (i.e., vacua with extra tensor multiplets) of heterotic E8xE8 strings compactified on K3, using hypersurfaces in toric varieties. In all cases, the Calabi-Yau is an elliptic fibration over a blow up of the Hirzebruch surface F_n. We find that in most cases the fan of the base of the elliptic fibration is visible in the dual polyhedron of the Calabi-Yau, and that the extra tensor multiplets are represented as points corresponding to the blow-ups of the F_n.
