Title: A Non-linear Sigma-model for Partially Polarized QH-states
Authors: T. H. Hansson and A. Karlhede and J. M. Leinaas
Abstract: We consider a two-component quantum Hall system within a Landau-Ginzburg theory with two Chern-Simons gauge fields. From this theory we derive a sigma model covariantly coupled to one Chern-Simons field and find mean field solutions that could describe partially polarized quantum Hall states. The quasiparticles in the original model, which have quantized charge and spin, are described in the covariant sigma model by topological excitations, with the correct quantum numbers. They have finite energy due to the presence of the Chern-Simons field, and closely resemble the skyrmions in the usual non-linear sigma model. For the fully polarized states the spin is no longer quantized, but determined by Coulomb and Zeeman interactions.
