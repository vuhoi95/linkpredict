Title: Bosonization of vertex operators for the $A^{(1)_{n-1}$ face model
Authors: Y. Asai and M. Jimbo and T. Miwa and Y. Pugai
Abstract: We present a free boson realization of the vertex operators and their duals for the solvable SOS lattice model of $A^{(1)}_{n-1}$ type. We discuss a possible connection to the calculation of the correlation functions.
