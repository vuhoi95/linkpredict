Title: A Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory Solution For Two Dimensional  Magnetohydrodynamics In Presence of The Alf'ven Effect
Authors: M. R. Rahimi Tabar and S. Rouhani
Abstract: When Alf`ven effect is peresent in magnetohydrodynamics one is naturally lead to consider conformal field theories, which have logarithmic terms in their correlation functions. We discuss the implications of such logarithmic terms and find a unique conformal field theory with centeral charge $c=-\frac{209}{7}$, within the border of the minimal series, which satisfies all the constraints. The energy espectrum is found to be \newline $E(k)\sim k^{-\frac{13}{7}} \log{k}$.
