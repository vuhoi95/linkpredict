Title: Exact calculation of thermodynamical quantities of the integrable t-J  model
Authors: G. Juttner and A. Klumper
Abstract: The specific heat and the compressibility for the integrable t-J model are calculated showing Luttinger liquid behavior for low temperatures. A Trotter-Suzuki mapping and the quantum transfer matrix approach are utilized. Using an algebraic Bethe ansatz this method permits the exact calculation of the free energy and related quantities. A set of just two non-linear integral equations determining these quantities is studied for various particle densities and temperatures. The structure of the specific heat is discussed in terms of the elementary charge as well as spin excitations.
