Title: The extended conformal theory of Luttinger systems
Authors: M. Frau and A. Lerda and S. Sciuto and G. R. Zemba
Abstract: We describe the recently introduced method of algebraic bosonization of the $(1+1)$-dimensional Luttinger systems by discussing in detail the specific case of the Calogero-Sutherland model, and mentioning the hard-core Bose gas. We also compare our findings with the exact Bethe Ansatz results.
