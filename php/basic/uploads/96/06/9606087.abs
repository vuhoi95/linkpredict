Title: Solving the Decompactification Problem in String Theory
Authors: E. Kiritsis and C. Kounnas and M. Petropoulos and J. Rizos
Abstract: We investigate heterotic ground states in four dimensions in which N=4 supersymmetry is spontaneously broken to N=2. N=4 supersymmetry is restored at a decompactification limit corresponding to $m_{3/2}\to 0$. We calculate the full moduli dependent threshold corrections and confirm that they are supressed in the decompactification limit $m_{3/2}\to 0$ as expected from the restoration of N=4 supersymmetry. This should be contrasted with the behavior of the standard N=2 groundstates where the coupling blow up linearly with the volume of the decompactifying manifold. This mechanism provides a solution to the decompactification problem for the gauge coupling constants. We also discuss how the mechanism can be implemented in ground states with lower supersymmetry.
