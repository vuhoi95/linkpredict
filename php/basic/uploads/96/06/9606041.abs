Title: Supersymmetric matrix models and branched polymers
Authors: J. Ambjorn and Y. Makeenko and K. Zarembo
Abstract: We solve a supersymmetric matrix model with a general potential. While matrix models usually describe surfaces, supersymmetry enforces a cancellation of bosonic and fermionic loops and only diagrams corresponding to so-called branched polymers survive. The eigenvalue distribution of the random matrices near the critical point is of a new kind.
