Title: The Heavy Quark Potential from Wilson's Exact Renormalization Group
Authors: Ulrich Ellwanger and Manfred Hirsch and Axel Weber
Abstract: We perform a calculation of the full momentum dependence of the gluon and ghost propagators in pure SU(3) Yang-Mills theory by integrating Wilson's exact renormalization group equations with respect to an infrared cutoff k. The heavy quark potential in the quenched approximation can be expressed in terms of these propagators. Our results strongly indicate a 1/p^4 behaviour of the heavy quark potential for $p^2 \to 0$. We show in general, that effective actions which satisfy Schwinger-Dyson equations, correspond to (quasi-) fixed points of Wilson's exact renormalization group equations.
