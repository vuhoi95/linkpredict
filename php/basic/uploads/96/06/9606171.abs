Title: On the Existence of Undistorted Progressive Waves (UPWs) of Arbitrary  Speeds $0 \leq v< \infty$ in Nature
Authors: W. A. Rodrigues Jr. and J. -Y. Lu
Abstract: We present the theory, the experimental evidence, and fundamental physical consequences concerning the existence of families of undistorted progressive waves (UPWs) of arbitrary speeds $0\leq v < \infty$, which are solutions of the homogeneous wave equation, Maxwell equations, and Dirac and Weyl equations.
