Title: Matrix-Product States for a One-Dimensional Lattice Gas with Parallel  Dynamics
Authors: A. Honecker and I. Peschel
Abstract: The hopping motion of classical particles on a chain coupled to reservoirs at both ends is studied for parallel dynamics with arbitrary probabilities. The stationary state is obtained in the form of an alternating matrix product. The properties of one- and two-dimensional representations are studied in detail and a general relation of the matrix algebra to that of the sequential limit is found. In this way the general phase diagram of the model is obtained. The mechanism of the sequential limit, the formulation as a vertex model and other aspects are discussed.
