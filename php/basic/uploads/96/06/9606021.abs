Title: Galilean symmetry in a nonabelian Chern Simons matter system
Authors: R. Banerjee and P. Mukherjee
Abstract: We study the Galilean symmetry in a nonrelativistic model, recently advanced by Bak, Jackiw and Pi, involving the coupling of a nonabelian Chern-Simons term with matter fields. The validity of the Galilean algebra on the constraint surface is demonstrated in the gauge independent formalism. Then the reduced space formulation is discussed in the axial gauge using the symplectic method. An anomalous term in the Galilean algebra is obtained which can be eliminated by demanding conditions on the Green function. Finally, the axial gauge is also treated by Dirac's method. Galilean symmetry is preserved in this method. Comparisions with the symplectic approach reveal some interesting features.
