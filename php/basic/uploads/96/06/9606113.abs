Title: Counting States of Black Strings with Traveling Waves II
Authors: Gary T. Horowitz and Donald Marolf
Abstract: We extend our recent analysis of the entropy of extremal black strings with traveling waves. We previously considered waves carrying linear momentum on black strings in six dimensions. Here we study waves carrying angular momentum on these strings, and also waves carrying linear momentum on black strings in five dimensions. In both cases, we show that the horizon remains homogeneous and compute its area. We also count the number of BPS states at weak string coupling with the same distribution of linear and angular momentum, and find complete agreement with the black string entropy.
