Abstract: We propose a unified scheme for finding the hyperelliptic curve of $N=2$ SUSY YM theory with any Lie gauge groups. Our general scheme gives the well known results for classical gauge groups and exceptional $G_2$ group. In particular, we present the curve for the exceptional gauge groups $F_4, E_{6,7,8}$ and check consistency condition for them. The exact monodromies and the dyon spectrum of these theories are determined. We note that for any Lie gauge groups, the exact monodromies could be obtained only from the Cartan matrix.
