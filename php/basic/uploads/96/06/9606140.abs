Title: Alternative actions for quantum gravity and the intrinsic rigidity of  the spacetime
Authors: J. Ambjorn and G. K. Savvidy and K. G. Savvidy
Abstract: Using the Steiner-Weyl expansion formula for parallel manifolds and the so called gonihedric principle we find a large class of discrete integral invariants which are defined on simplicial manifolds of various dimensions. These integral invariants include the discrete version of the Hilbert-Einstein action found by Regge and alternative actions which are linear with respect to the size of the manifold. In addition the concept of generalized deficit angles appear in a natural way and is related to higher order curvature terms. These angles may be used to introduce various aspects of rigidity in simplicial quantum gravity.
