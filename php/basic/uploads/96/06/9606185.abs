Title: Comparing decay rates for black holes and D-branes
Authors: Sumit R. Das and Samir D. Mathur
Abstract: We compute the leading order (in coupling) rate of emission of low energy quanta from a slightly nonextremal system of 1 and 5 D-branes. We also compute the classical cross-section, and hence the Hawking emission rate, for low energy scalar quanta for the black hole geometry that corresponds to these branes (at sufficiently strong coupling). These rates are found to agree with each other.
