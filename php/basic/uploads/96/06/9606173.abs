Title: Almost-Hermitian Random Matrices: Eigenvalue Density in the Complex  Plane
Authors: Yan V. Fyodorov and Boris A. Khoruzhenko and Hans-Juergen Sommers
Abstract: We consider an ensemble of large non-Hermitian random matrices of the form $\hat{H}+i\hat{A}_s$, where $\hat{H}$ and $\hat{A}_s$ are Hermitian statistically independent random $N\times N$ matrices. We demonstrate the existence of a new nontrivial regime of weak non-Hermiticity characterized by the condition that the average of $N\mbox{Tr} \hat{A}_s^2$ is of the same order as that of $\mbox{Tr} \hat{H}^2 $ when $N\to \infty$. We find explicitly the density of complex eigenvalues for this regime in the limit of infinite matrix dimension. The density determines the eigenvalue distribution in the crossover regime between random Hermitian matrices whose real eigenvalues are distributed according to the Wigner semi-circle law and random complex matrices whose eigenvalues are distributed in the complex plane according to the so-called ``elliptic law''.
