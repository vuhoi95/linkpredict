Title: The effective action of (2+1)-dimensional QED: the effect of finite  fermion density
Authors: Dae Kwan Kim and Kwang-Sup Soh
Abstract: The effective action of (2+1)-dimensional QED with finite fermion density is calculated in a uniform electromagnetic field. It is shown that the integer quantum Hall effect and de Haas-van Alphen like phenomena in condensed matter physics are derived directly from the effective action.
