Title: Black Holes and U-Duality
Authors: Mirjam Cvetic and Christopher M. Hull
Abstract: We find the general charged rotating black hole solutions of the maximal supergravities in dimensions $4\le D\le 9$ arising from toroidally compactified Type II string or M-theories. In each dimension, these are obtained by acting on a generating solution with classical duality symmetries. In D=4, D=5 and $6\le D \le 9$ the generating solution is specified by the ADM mass, $[{D-1}/2]$-angular momentum components and five, three and two charges, respectively. We discuss the BPS-saturated (static) black holes and derive the U-duality invariant form of the area of the horizon. We also comment on the U-duality invariant form of the BPS mass formulae.
