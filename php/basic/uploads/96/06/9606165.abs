Title: Thermodynamic Properties of Generalized Exclusion Statistics
Authors: Hyun Seok Yang and Bum-Hoon Lee and Chanyong Park
Abstract: We analytically calculate some thermodynamic quantities of an ideal $g$-on gas obeying generalized exclusion statistics. We show that the specific heat of a $g$-on gas ($g \neq 0$) vanishes linearly in any dimension as $T \to 0$ when the particle number is conserved and exhibits an interesting dual symmetry that relates the particle-statistics at $g$ to the hole-statistics at $1/g$ at low temperatures. We derive the complete solution for the cluster coefficients $b_l(g)$ as a function of Haldane's statistical interaction $g$ in $D$ dimensions. We also find that the cluster coefficients $b_l(g)$ and the virial coefficients $a_l(g)$ are exactly mirror symmetric ($l$=odd) or antisymmetric ($l$=even) about $g=1/2$. In two dimensions, we completely determine the closed forms about the cluster and the virial coefficients of the generalized exclusion statistics, which exactly agree with the virial coefficients of an anyon gas of linear energies. We show that the $g$-on gas with zero chemical potential shows thermodynamic properties similar to the photon statistics. We discuss some physical implications of our results.
