Title: A Statistical Interpretation of Space and Classical-Quantum duality
Authors: Alon E. Faraggi and Marco Matone
Abstract: By defining a prepotential function for the stationary Schr\"odinger equation we derive an inversion formula for the space variable $x$ as a function of the wave-function $\psi$. The resulting equation is a Legendre transform that relates $x$, the prepotential ${\cal F}$, and the probability density. We invert the Schr\"odinger equation to a third-order differential equation for ${\cal F}$ and observe that the inversion procedure implies a $x$-$\psi$ duality. This phenomenon is related to a modular symmetry due to the superposition of the solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation. We propose that in quantum mechanics the space coordinate can be interpreted as a macroscopic variable of a statistical system with $\hbar$ playing the role of a scaling parameter. We show that the scaling property of the space coordinate with respect to $\tau=\partial_{\psi}^2{\cal F}$ is determined by the ``beta-function''. We propose that the quantization of the inversion formula is a natural way to quantize geometry. The formalism is extended to higher dimensions and to the Klein-Gordon equation.
