Title: Mirror Symmetry is T-Duality
Authors: Andrew Strominger and Shing-Tung Yau and Eric Zaslow
Abstract: It is argued that every Calabi-Yau manifold $X$ with a mirror $Y$ admits a family of supersymmetric toroidal 3-cycles. Moreover the moduli space of such cycles together with their flat connections is precisely the space $Y$. The mirror transformation is equivalent to T-duality on the 3-cycles. The geometry of moduli space is addressed in a general framework. Several examples are discussed.
