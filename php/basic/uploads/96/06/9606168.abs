Title: Softly broken N=2 QCD
Authors: L. Alvarez-Gaume and M. Marino
Abstract: We analyze the possible soft breaking of $N=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with and without matter flavour preserving the analyticity properties of the Seiberg-Witten solution. We present the formalism for an arbitrary gauge group and obtain an exact expression for the effective potential. We describe in detail the onset of the confinement description and the vacuum structure for the pure $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills case and also some general features in the $SU(N)$ case. A general mass formula is obtained, as well as explicit results for the mass spectrum in the $SU(2)$ case.
