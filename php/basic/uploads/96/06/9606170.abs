Title: Quantum Deformations of Space-Time Symmetries and Interactions
Authors: Jerzy Lukierski and Peter C. Stichel
Abstract: We discuss quantum deformations of Lie algebra as described by the noncoassociative modification of its coalgebra structure. We consider for simplicity the quantum $D=1$ Galilei algebra with four generators: energy $H$, boost $B$, momentum $P$ and central generator $M$ (mass generator). We describe the nonprimitive coproducts for $H$ and $B$ and show that their noncocommutative and noncoassociative structure is determined by the two-body interaction terms. Further we consider the case of physical Galilei symmetry in three dimensions. Finally we discuss the noninteraction theorem for manifestly covariant two-body systems in the framework of quantum deformations of $D=4$ \poin algebra and a possible way out.
