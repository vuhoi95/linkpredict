Title: A Canticle on (4,0) Supergravity-Scalar Multiplet Systems for a  ``Cognoscente''
Authors: R. Dhanawittayapol and S. James Gates Jr. and Lubna Rana
Abstract: Extending prior investigations, we study three of the the four distinct minimal (4,0) scalar multiplets coupled to (4,0) supergravity. It is found that the scalar multiplets manifest their differences at the component level by possessing totally different couplings to the supergravity fields. Only the SM-I multiplet possesses a conformal coupling. For the remaining multiplets, terms linear in the world sheet curvature and/or SU(2) gauge field strengths are required to appear in the action by local supersymmetry.
