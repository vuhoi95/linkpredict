Title: Observation of Induced Chern-Simons Term in P- and T- violating  Superconductors
Authors: J. Goryo and K. Ishikawa
Abstract: We show in this letter that P- and T-odd terms of the electromagnetic potentials (P; parity, T; time reversal) are induced and lead an unusual phenomenon in P- and T-violating superconductors discovered recently. The Ginzburg-Landau action includes this term in the gauge invariant manner. The coefficient of the term is nearly topological invariant with a small correction and equals to the fine structure constant approximately. Unusual ``Hall effect'' {\it without external} magnetic field could be observed by SQUID.
