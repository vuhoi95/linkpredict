Title: AdS_7/CFT_6 Correspondence and Matrix Models of M5-Branes
Authors: Hidetoshi Awata and Shinji Hirano
Abstract: We study the large N limit of matrix models of M5-branes, or (2,0) six-dimensional superconformal field theories, by making use of the Bulk/Boundary correspondence. Our emphasis is on the relation between the near-horizon limit of branes and the light-like limit of M-theory. In particular we discuss a conformal symmetry in the D0 + D4 system, and interpret it as a conformal symmetry in the discrete light-cone formulation of M5-branes. We also compute two-point functions of scalars by applying the conjecture for the AdS/CFT correspondence to the near-horizon geometry of boosted M5-branes. We find an expected result up to a point subtle, but irrelevant to the IR behavior of the theory. Our analysis matches with the Seiberg and Sen's argument of a justification for the matrix model of M-theory.
