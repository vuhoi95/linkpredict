Title: Finite Tensor Deformations of Supergravity Solitons
Authors: Martin Cederwall and Ulf Gran and Magnus Holm and Bengt E. W. Nilsson
Abstract: We consider brane solutions where the tensor degrees of freedom are excited. Explicit solutions to the full non-linear supergravity equations of motion are given for the M5 and D3 branes, corresponding to finite selfdual tensor or Born-Infeld field strengths. The solutions are BPS-saturated and half-supersymmetric. The resulting metric space-times are analysed.
