Title: Lagrangian Formulation of Connes' Gauge Theory
Authors: Hiromi Kase and Katsusada Morita and Yoshitaka Okumura
Abstract: It is shown that Connes' generalized gauge field in non-commutative geometry is derived by simply requiring that Dirac lagrangian be invariant under local transformations of the unitary elements of the algebra, which define the gauge group. The spontaneous breakdown of the gauge symmetry is guaranteed provided the chiral fermions exist in more than one generations as first observed by Connes-Lott. It is also pointed out that the most general gauge invariant lagrangian in the bosonic sector has two more parameters than in the original Connes-Lott scheme.
