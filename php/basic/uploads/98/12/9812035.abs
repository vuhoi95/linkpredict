Title: New Vacua of Gauged N=8 Supergravity
Authors: A. Khavaev and K. Pilch and N. P. Warner
Abstract: We analyze a particular SU(2) invariant sector of the scalar manifold of gauged N=8 supergravity in five dimensions, and find all the critical points of the potential within this sector. The critical points give rise to Anti-de Sitter vacua, and preserve at least an SU(2) gauge symmetry. Consistent truncation implies that these solutions correspond to Anti-de Sitter compactifications of IIB supergravity, and hence to possible near-horizon geometries of 3-branes. Thus we find new conformal phases of softly broken N=4 Yang--Mills theory. One of the critical points preserves N=2 supersymmetry in the bulk and is therefore completely stable, and corresponds to an N=1 superconformal fixed point of the Yang--Mills theory. The corresponding renormalization group flow from the N=4 point has c_{IR}/c_{UV} = 27/32. We also discuss the ten-dimensional geometries corresponding to these critical points.
