Title: Seiberg-Witten theory for a non-trivial compactification from five to  four dimensions
Authors: H. W. Braden and A. Marshakov and A. Mironov and A. Morozov
Abstract: The prepotential and spectral curve are described for a smooth interpolation between an enlarged N=4 SUSY and ordinary N=2 SUSY Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions, obtained by compactification from five dimensions with non-trivial (periodic and antiperiodic) boundary conditions. This system provides a new solution to the generalized WDVV equations. We show that this exhausts all possible solutions of a given functional form.
