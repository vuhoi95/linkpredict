Title: Note on the Massive Rarita-Schwinger Field in the AdS/CFT correspondence
Authors: A. S. Koshelev and O. A. Rytchkov
Abstract: We consider a massive Rarita-Schwinger field on the Anti-de Sitter space and solve the corresponding equations of motion. We show that appropriate boundary terms calculated on-shell give two-point correlation functions for spin-3/2 fields of the conformal field theory on the boundary. The relation between Rarita-Schwinger field masses and conformal dimensions of corresponding operators is established.
