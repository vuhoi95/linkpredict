Title: On Lorentz invariance and supersymmetry of four particle scattering  amplitudes in $S^N\R^8$ orbifold sigma model
Authors: G. Arutyunov and S. Frolov and A. Polishchuk
Abstract: The $S^N\R^8$ supersymmetric orbifold sigma model is expected to describe the IR limit of the Matrix string theory. In the framework of the model the type IIA string interaction is governed by a vertex which was recently proposed by R.Dijkgraaf, E.Verlinde and H.Verlinde. By using this interaction vertex we derive all four particle scattering amplitudes directly from the orbifold model in the large $N$ limit.
