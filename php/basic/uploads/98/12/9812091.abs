Title: On nonequilibrium states in QFT model with boundary interaction
Authors: V. Bazhanov and S. Lukyanov and A. Zamolodchikov
Abstract: We prove that certain nonequilibrium expectation values in the boundary sine-Gordon model coincide with associated equilibrium-state expectation values in the systems which differ from the boundary sine-Gordon in that certain extra boundary degrees of freedom (q-oscillators) are added. Applications of this result to actual calculation of nonequilibrium characteristics of the boundary sine-Gordon model are also discussed.
