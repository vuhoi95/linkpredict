Title: N=2 central charge superspace and a minimal supergravity multiplet
Authors: G. Akemann and R. Grimm and M. Hasler and C. Herrmann
Abstract: We extend the notion of central charge superspace to the case of local supersymmetry. Gauged central charge transformations are identified as diffeomorphisms at the same footing as space-time diffeomorphisms and local supersymmetry transformations. Given the general structure we then proceed to the description of a particular vector-tensor supergravity multiplet of 24+24 components, identified by means of rather radical constraints.
