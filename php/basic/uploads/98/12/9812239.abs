Title: Supergravity currents and linearized interactions for Matrix Theory  configurations with fermionic backgrounds
Authors: Washington Taylor and Mark Van Raamsdonk
Abstract: The leading terms in the long-range interaction potential between an arbitrary pair of matrix theory objects are calculated at one-loop order. This result generalizes previous calculations by including arbitrary fermionic background field configurations. The interaction potential at orders 1/r^7 and 1/r^8 is shown to correspond precisely with the leading terms expected from linearized supergravity interactions between arbitrary objects in M-theory. General expressions for the stress tensor, membrane current and 5-brane current of an arbitrary matrix configuration are derived, including fermionic contributions. Supergravity effects which are correctly reproduced include membrane/5-brane interactions, 0-brane/6-brane interactions, supercurrent/supercurrent interactions and the spin contributions to moments of the supergravity currents. The matrix theory description of the supergravity stress tensor, membrane current and 5-brane current are used to propose an explicit formulation of matrix theory in an arbitrary background metric and 3-form field.
