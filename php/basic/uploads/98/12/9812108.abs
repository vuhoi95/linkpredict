Title: Spacetime Duality and Two-dimensional Gauge Field Theory
Authors: A. Smailagic and E. Spallucci
Abstract: In this letter we implement a recently proposed {\it spacetime duality} approach to dualize a two dimensional, Abelian, gauge field theory, which has no dual version under $p$--duality. Our result suggests that spacetime duality spans a new, wider, class of dual theories, which cannot be related one to another by $p$--duality transformations.
