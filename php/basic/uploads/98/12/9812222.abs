Abstract: In this work we apply the Lie group representation method introduced in the real time formalism for finite-temperature quantum-field theory, thermofield dynamics, to derive a spinorial density matrix equation. Symmetry properties of such equation are analysed, and as a basic result it is shown that one solution is the generalised density matrix operator proposed by Heinz, to deal with gauge covariant kinetic equations. In the same context, preliminary aspects of a Lagrangian formalism to derive kinetic equations, as well as quantum density matrix equations in curved space-time, are discussed.
