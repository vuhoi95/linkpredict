Title: Quantum caustics in the Gaussian slit experiment
Authors: K. Horie and H. Miyazaki and I. Tsutsui and S. Tanimura
Abstract: We study classical and quantum caustics for system with quadratic Lagrangian. Gaussian slit experiment is examined and it is pointed out that the focusing around caustics is stabilized against initial momentum fluctuations by quantum effect.
