Title: Supersymmetric Non-Abelian Born-Infeld Theory
Authors: S. Gonorazky and F. A. Schaposnik and G. Silva
Abstract: Using the natural curvature invariants as building blocks in a superfield construction, we show that the use of a symmetric trace is mandatory if one is to reproduce the square root structure of the non-Abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld Lagrangian in the bosonic sector. We also discuss the BPS relations in connection with our supersymmetry construction.
