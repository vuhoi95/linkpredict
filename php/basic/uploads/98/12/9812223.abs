Title: Galilei covariance and (4,1) de Sitter space
Authors: A. E. Santana and F. C. Khanna and Y. Takahashi
Abstract: A vector space G is introduced such that the Galilei transformations are considered linear mappings in this manifold. The covariant structure of the Galilei Group (Y. Takahashi, Fortschr. Phys. 36 (1988) 63; 36 (1988) 83) is derived and the tensor analysis is developed. It is shown that the Euclidean space is embedded the (4,1) de Sitter space through in G. This is an interesting and useful aspect, in particular, for the analysis carried out for the Lie algebra of the generators of linear transformations in G.
