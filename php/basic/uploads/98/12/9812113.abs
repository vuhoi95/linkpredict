Title: Conformal Field Theory in Conformal Space
Authors: C. R. Preitschopf and M. A. Vasiliev
Abstract: We present a new framework for a Lagrangian description of conformal field theories in various dimensions based on a local version of d+2-dimensional conformal space. The results include a true gauge theory of conformal gravity in d=(1,3) and any standard matter coupled to it. An important feature is the automatic derivation of the conformal gravity constraints, which are necessary for the analysis of the matter systems.
