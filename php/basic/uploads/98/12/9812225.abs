Title: Brane Actions and String Dualities
Authors: Eduardo Eyras and Yolanda Lozano
Abstract: An effective action for the M9-brane is proposed. We study its relation with other branes via dualities. Among these, we find actions for branes which are not suggested by the central charges of the Type II superalgebras.
