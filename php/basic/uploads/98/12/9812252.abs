Title: The No-ghost Theorem and Strings on AdS_3
Authors: J. M. Evans and M. R. Gaberdiel and M. J. Perry
Abstract: A brief review of string theory on group manifolds is given, and comparisons are then drawn between Minkowski space, SU(2), and SU(1,1) = AdS_3. The proof of the no-ghost theorem is outlined, assuming a certain restriction on the representation content for bosonic and fermionic strings on SU(1,1). Some possible connections with the AdS/CFT correspondence are mentioned. (Based on invited talk by JME at Trieste Conference on Super 5-branes and Physics in (5+1)-dimensions.)
