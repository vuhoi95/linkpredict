Title: A Note on ADE-Spectra in Conformal Field Theory
Authors: A. G. Bytsko and A. Fring
Abstract: We demonstrate that certain Virasoro characters (and their linear combinations) in minimal and non-minimal conformal models which admit factorized forms are manifestly related to the ADE series. This permits to extract quasi-particle spectra of a Lie algebraic nature which resembles the features of Toda field theory. These spectra possibly admit a construction in terms of the $W_n$-generators. In the course of our analysis we establish interrelations between the factorized characters related to the parafermionic models, the compactified boson and the minimal models.
