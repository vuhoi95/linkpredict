Title: The Kaluza-Klein Monopole in a Massive IIA Background
Authors: Eduardo Eyras and Yolanda Lozano
Abstract: We construct the effective action of the KK-monopole in a massive Type IIA background. We follow two approaches. First we construct a massive M-theory KK-monopole from which the IIA monopole is obtained by double dimensional reduction. This eleven dimensional monopole contains two isometries: one under translations of the Taub-NUT coordinate and the other under massive transformations of the embedding coordinates. Secondly, we construct the massive T-duality rules that map the Type IIB NS-5-brane onto the massive Type IIA KK-monopole. This provides a check of the action constructed from eleven dimensions.
