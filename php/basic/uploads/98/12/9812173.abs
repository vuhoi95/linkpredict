Title: Unstable Bundles in Quantum Field Theory
Authors: M. Asorey and F. Falceto and G. Luzon
Abstract: The relation between connections on 2-dimensional manifolds and holomorphic bundles provides a new perspective on the role of classical gauge fields in quantum field theory in two, three and four dimensions. In particular we show that there is a close relation between unstable bundles and monopoles, sphalerons and instantons. Some of these classical configurations emerge as nodes of quantum vacuum states in non-confining phases of \qft which suggests a relevant role for those configurations in the mechanism of quark confinement in QCD.
