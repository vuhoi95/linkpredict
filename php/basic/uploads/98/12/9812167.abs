Title: Hamiltonian Reduction of General Relativity and Conformal Unified Theory
Authors: M. Pawlowski and V. N. Pervushin and V. I. Smirichinski
Abstract: We discuss the application of the method of the gaugeless Hamiltonian reduction to general relativity. This method is based on explicit resolving the global part of the energy constraint and on identification of one of the metric components with the evolution parameter of the equivalent unconstrained (reduced) system. The Hamiltonian reduction reveals a possibility to unify General Relativity and Standard Model of strong and electro-weak interactions with the modulus of the Higgs field identified with the product of the determinant of 3D metric and the Planck constant. We give the geometrical foundation of the scalar field, derive and discuss experimental consequences of this unified model: the cosmic Higgs vacuum, the Hoyle-Narlikar cosmology, a $\sigma$-model version of Standard Model without Higgs particle excitations and inflation.
