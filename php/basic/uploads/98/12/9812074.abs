Title: New Superparticle Models Outside the HLS Supersymmetry Scheme
Authors: Igor Bandos and Jerzy Lukierski
Abstract: We consider the superparticle models invariant under the supersymmetries with tensorial central charges, which were not included in D=4 Haag-Lopuszanski-Sohnius (HLS) supersymmetry scheme. We present firstly a generalization of D=4 Ferber-Shirafuji (FS) model with fundamental bosonic spinors and tensorial central charge coordinates. The model contains four fermionic coordinates and possesses three kappa- symmetries thus providing the BPS configuration preserving 3/4 of the target space supersymmetries. We show that the physical degrees of freedom (8 real bosonic and 1 real Grassmann variable) of our model can be described by OSp(8|1) supertwistor. Then we propose a higher dimensional generalization of our model with one real fundamental bosonic spinor. D=10 model describes massless superparticle with composite tensorial central charges and in D=11 we obtain 0-superbrane model with nonvanishing mass which is generated dynamically. The introduction of D=11 Lorentz harmonics provides the possibility to construct massless D=11 superparticle model which can be formulated in a way preserving 1/2, 17/32, 18/32,..., 31/32 supersymmetries. In a special case we obtain the twistor-like formulation of the usual massless D=11 superparticle proposed recently by Bergshoeff and Townsend.
