Abstract: The evolution of the parameters including those in the soft supersymmetry-breaking (SSB) sector is studied in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) with a certain set of Kaluza-Klein towers which has been recently considered by Dienes et al. We use the continuous Wilson renormalizaion group technique to derive the matching condition between the effective, renormalizable and original, unrenormalizable theories. We investigate whether the assumption on a large compactification radius in the model is consistent with the gauge coupling unification, the $b-\tau$ unification and the radiative breaking of the electroweak gauge symmetry with the universal SSB terms. We calculate the superpartner spectrum under the assumption of the universal SSB parameters to find differences between the model and the MSSM.
