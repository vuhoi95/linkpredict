Title: Regularizing Property of the Maximal Acceleration Principle in Quantum  Field Theory
Authors: V. V. Nesterenko and A. Feoli and G. Lambiase and G. Scarpetta
Abstract: It is shown that the introduction of an upper limit to the proper acceleration of a particle can smooth the problem of ultraviolet divergencies in local quantum field theory. For this aim, the classical model of a relativistic particle with maximal proper acceleration is quantized canonically by making use of the generalized Hamiltonian formalism developed by Dirac. The equations for the wave function are treated as the dynamical equations for the corresponding quantum field. Using the Green's function connected to these wave equations as propagators in the Feynman integrals leads to an essential improvement of their convergence properties.
