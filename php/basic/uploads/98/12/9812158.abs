Title: Orientifolds of Non-Supersymmetric Asymmetric Orbifolds
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Lars Goerlich
Abstract: We consider certain four dimensional supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric asymmetric orbifolds with vanishing cosmological constant up to two loops and gauge the world sheet parity transformation. This leads to new string vacua, in which Dp and D(p-4) branes or Dp and anti-D(p-4) are identified. Moreover, it is shown that different degrees of supersymmetry can be realized in the bulk and on the brane. We show that for non-supersymmetric models the cosmological constant still vanishes at one loop order.
