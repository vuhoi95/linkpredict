Title: On short and long SU(2,2/4) multiplets in the AdS/CFT correspondence
Authors: L. Andrianopoli and S. Ferrara
Abstract: We analyze short and long multiplets which appear in the OPE expansion of ``chiral'' primary operators in N=4 Super Yang--Mills theory. Among them, higher spin long and new short multiplets appear, having the interpretation, in the AdS/CFT correspondence, of string states and supergravity multiparticle states respectively. We also analyze the decomposition of long multiplets under N=1 supersymmetry, as a possible tool to explore other supersymmetric deformations of IIB string on AdS_5 x S_5.
