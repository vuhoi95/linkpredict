Title: The Wess-Zumino Consistency Condition For p-Form Gauge Theories
Authors: Marc Henneaux and Bernard Knaepen
Abstract: The general solution of the antifield-independent Wess-Zumino consistency condition is worked out for models involving exterior form gauge fields of arbitrary degree. We consider both the free theory and theories with Chapline-Manton couplings. Our approach relies on solving the full set of descent equations by starting from the last element down ("bottom").
