Title: Superconformal invariance and the geography of four-manifolds
Authors: Marcos Marino and Gregory Moore and Grigor Peradze
Abstract: The correlation functions of supersymmetric gauge theories on a four-manifold X can sometimes be expressed in terms of topological invariants of X. We show how the existence of superconformal fixed points in the gauge theory can provide nontrivial information about four-manifold topology. In particular, in the example of gauge group SU(2) with one doublet hypermultiplet, we derive a theorem relating classical topological invariants such as the Euler character and signature to sum rules for Seiberg-Witten invariants.
