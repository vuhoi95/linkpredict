Title: Anharmonic oscillators, the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, and nonlinear  integral equations
Authors: Patrick Dorey and Roberto Tateo
Abstract: The spectral determinant $D(E)$ of the quartic oscillator is known to satisfy a functional equation. This is mapped onto the $A_3$-related $Y$-system emerging in the treatment of a certain perturbed conformal field theory, allowing us to give an alternative integral expression for $D(E)$. Generalising this result, we conjecture a relationship between the $x^{2M}$ anharmonic oscillators and the $A_{2M-1}$ TBA systems. Finally, spectral determinants for general $|x|^{\alpha}$ potentials are mapped onto the solutions of nonlinear integral equations associated with the (twisted) XXZ and sine-Gordon models.
