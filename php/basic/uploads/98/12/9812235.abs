Title: Spectral Geometry of Heterotic Compactifications
Authors: David D. Song and Richard J. Szabo
Abstract: The structure of heterotic string target space compactifications is studied using the formalism of the noncommutative geometry associated with lattice vertex operator algebras. The spectral triples of the noncommutative spacetimes are constructed and used to show that the intrinsic gauge field degrees of freedom disappear in the low-energy sectors of these spacetimes. The quantum geometry is thereby determined in much the same way as for ordinary superstring target spaces. In this setting, non-abelian gauge theories on the classical spacetimes arise from the K-theory of the effective target spaces.
