Title: Soliton Solution of the Integrable Coupled Nonlinear Schrodinger  Equation of Manakov Type
Authors: Freddy P. Zen and Hendry I. Elim
Abstract: The soliton solution of the integrable coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLS) of Manakov type is investigated by using Zakharov-Shabat (ZS) scheme. We get the bright N-solitons solution by solving the integrable uncoupled NLS of Manakov type. We also find that there is an elastic collision of the bright N-solitons.
