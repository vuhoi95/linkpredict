Authors: V. Ch. Zhukovsky and V. V. Khudyakov and I. V. Mamsurov
Abstract: Different models with nonabelian homogeneous condensate fields are considered in the one-loop approximation. Effective action in a model of gluodynamics in curved space is calculated. Free energy and its minimum in a (2+1)-dimensional model of QCD are investigated. Photon polarization operator (PO) is obtained.
