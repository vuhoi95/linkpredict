Title: String Multiplets from an Invariant 2-Brane
Authors: Sandip Bhattacharyya and Alok Kumar and Subir Mukhopadhyay
Abstract: We study a three-dimensional gauge theory obtained from the dimensional reduction of a D4-brane worldvolume theory in the background of space-time moduli. An SL(3) symmetry in this theory, which acts on fields as well as coupling constants, is identified. By comparing the energies with the string tensions, we show that certain 1/2 supersymmetric classical solutions of this theory can be identified as SL(3,Z) multiplets of type II strings in eight dimensions. Results are then generalized to the non-linear Born-Infeld action. We also discuss the possibility of 1/8 BPS states in this theory and their representations in terms of string networks.
