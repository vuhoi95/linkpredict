Title: Conformal Symmetry on World Volumes of Branes
Authors: Piet Claus and Renata Kallosh and Antoine Van Proeyen
Abstract: We show how the anti-de Sitter isometries of a brane solution of supergravity theory produce superconformal invariance of their world-volume action. In this way linear as well as non-linear superconformal actions are obtained in various dimensions. Two particular examples are a conformal action with the antisymmetric tensor in 6 dimensions in Pasti-Sorokin-Tonin formulation, and superconformal mechanics.
