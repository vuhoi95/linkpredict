Title: Four-manifold geography and superconformal symmetry
Authors: Marcos Marino and Gregory Moore and Grigor Peradze
Abstract: A compact oriented 4-manifold is defined to be of ``superconformal simple type'' if certain polynomials in the basic classes (constructed using the Seiberg-Witten invariants) vanish identically. We show that all known 4-manifolds of $b_2^+>1$ are of superconformal simple type, and that the numerical invariants of 4-manifolds of superconformal simple type satisfy a generalization of the Noether inequality. We sketch how these phenomena are predicted by the existence of certain four-dimensional superconformal quantum field theories.
