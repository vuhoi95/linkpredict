Title: Large extra dimensions and deep-inelastic scattering at HERA
Authors: Prakash Mathews and Sreerup Raychaudhuri and K. Sridhar
Abstract: In scenarios motivated by string theories, it is possible to have extra Kaluza-Klein dimensions compactified to rather large magnitudes, leading to large effects of gravity at scales down to a TeV. The effect of the spin-2 Kaluza-Klein modes on the deep-inelastic cross-section at HERA is investigated. We find that the data can be used to obtain bounds on the effective low energy scale, $M_S$.
