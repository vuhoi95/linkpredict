Title: Compensating fields, bosonization and soldering in QCD2
Authors: Ricardo Amorim and Nelson R. F. Braga
Abstract: An interesting tool for investigating the quantum features of a field theory is the introduction of compensating fields. For instance, the anomalous divergence of the chiral current can be calculated in the field-antifield formalism from an extended form of QCD with compensating fields. The interpretation of this procedure from the bosonized point of view, in the two dimensional case, crucially depends on the possibility of defining a bosonized version for the extended theory. We show, by using some recent results on the soldering of bosonized actions corresponding to chiral fermions, how is the mapping between bosonic and fermionic representations of this extended $QCD_2$. In the bosonic formulation the anomalous divergence of the chiral current shows up from the equations of motion of the compensating fields.
