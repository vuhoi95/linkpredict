Title: On intersection of domain walls in a supersymmetric model
Authors: S. V. Troitsky and M. B. Voloshin
Abstract: We consider a classical field configuration, corresponding to intersection of two domain walls in a supersymmetric model, where the field profile for two parallel walls at a finite separation is known explicitly. An approximation to the solution for intersecting walls is constructed for a small angle at the intersection. We find a finite effective length of the intersection region and also an energy, associated with the intersection.
