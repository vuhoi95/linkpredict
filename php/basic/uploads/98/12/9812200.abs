Title: Ramond-Ramond (boundary) states
Authors: M. Billo and R. Russo
Abstract: The description of D-branes as boundary states for type II string theories (in the covariant formulation) requires particular care in the R-R sector. Also the vertices for R-R potentials that can couple to D-branes need a careful handling. As an illustration of this, the example of the D0-D8 system is reviewed, where a ``microscopic'' description of the interaction via exchange of R-R potentials becomes possible.
