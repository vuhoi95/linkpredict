Title: Particle production and complex path analysis
Authors: K. Srinivasan and T. Padmanabhan
Abstract: This paper discusses particle production in Schwarzchild-like spacetimes and in an uniform electric field. Both problems are approached using the method of complex path analysis. Particle production in Schwarzchild-like spacetimes with a horizon is obtained here by a new and simple semi-classical method based on the method of complex paths. Hawking radiation is obtained in the (t,r) co-ordinate system of the standard Schwarzchild metric {\it without} requiring the Kruskal extension. The co-ordinate singularity present at the horizon manifests itself as a singularity in the expression for the semi-classical propagator for a scalar field. We give a prescription whereby this singularity is regularised with Hawking's result being recovered. In the case of the electric field, standard quantum field theoretic methods can be used to obtain particle production in a purely time-dependent gauge. In a purely space-dependent gauge, however, the tunnelling interpretation has to be resorted to. We attempt, in this paper, to provide a tunnelling description for both the time and space dependent gauges. The usefulness of such a common description becomes evident when `mixed' gauges, which are functions of both space and time variables, are analysed. We report, in this paper, certain mixed gauges which have the interesting property that mode functions in these gauges are found to be a combination of {\it elementary} functions unlike the standard modes. Finally, we present an attempt to interpret particle production by the electric field as a tunnelling process between the two sectors of the Rindler spacetime.
