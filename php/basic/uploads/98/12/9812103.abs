Title: Low Energy Vortex Dynamics in Abelian Higgs Systems
Authors: W. Garcia Fuertes and J. Mateos Guilarte
Abstract: The low energy dynamics of the vortices of the Abelian Chern-Simons-Higgs system is investigated from the adiabatic approach. The difficulties involved in treating the field evolution as motion on the moduli space in this system are shown. Another two generalized Abelian Higgs systems are discusssed with respect to their vortex dynamics at the adiabatic limit. The method works well and we find bound states in the first model and scattering at right angles in the second system.
