Title: Modular Constructions of Quantum Field Theories with Interactions
Authors: B. Schroer and H. -W. Wiesbrock
Abstract: We extend the previously introduced constructive modular method to nonperturbative QFT. In particular the relevance of the concept of ``quantum localization'' (via intersection of algebras) versus classical locality (via support properties of test functions) is explained in detail, the wedge algebras are constructed rigorously and the formal aspects of double cone algebras for d=1+1 factorizing theories are determined. The well-known on-shell crossing symmetry of the S-Matrix and of formfactors (cyclicity relation) in such theories is intimately related to the KMS properties of new quantum-local PFG (one-particle polarization-free generators) of these wedge algebras. These generators are ``on-shell'' and their Fourier transforms turn out to fulfill the Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra. As the wedge algebras contain the crossing symmetry informations, the double cone algebras reveal the particle content of fields. Modular theory associates with this double cone algebra two very useful chiral conformal quantum field theories which are the algebraic versions of the light ray algebras.
