Title: A geometrical particle model for anyons
Authors: A. Nersessian and E. Ramos
Abstract: We consider the simplest geometrical particle model associated with light-like curves in (2+1)-dimensions. The action is proportional to the pseudo-arc length of the particle's path. We show that under quantization it yields the (2+1)-dimensional anyonic field equation supplemented with a Majorana-like relation on mass and spin, i.e., $mass \times spin =\alpha^2$, with $\alpha$ the coupling constant in front of the action.
