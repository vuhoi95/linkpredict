Title: Vassiliev Invariants in the Context of Chern-Simons Gauge Theory
Authors: J. M. F. Labastida and Esther Perez
Abstract: We summarize the progress made during the last few years on the study of Vassiliev invariants from the point of view of perturbative Chern-Simons gauge theory. We argue that this approach is the most promising one to obtain a combinatorial universal formula for Vassiliev invariants. The combinatorial expressions for the two primitive Vassiliev invariants of order four, recently obtained in this context, are reviewed and rewritten in terms of Gauss diagrams.
