Title: Green-Schwarz Superstring on AdS3 * S3
Authors: Jaemo Park and Soo-Jong Rey
Abstract: Green-Schwarz action of Type IIB string on $AdS_3 \times S^3$ is constructed via coset superspace approach. The construction relies exclusively on symplectically Majorana-Weyl spinor formalism, thus permitting it easier to prove $\kappa$-symmetry for on-shell Type IIB supergravity backgrounds.
