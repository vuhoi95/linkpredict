Title: The wave function of the universe and spontaneaus breaking of  supersymmetry
Authors: O. Obreg√≥n and J. J. Rosales and J. Socorro and V. I. Tkach
Abstract: In this work we define a scalar product ``weighted'' with the scalar factor $R$ and show how to find a normalized wave function for the supersymmetric quantum FRW cosmological model using the idea of supersymmetry breaking selection rules under local n=2 conformal supersymmetry. We also calculate the expectation value of the scalar factor R in this model and its corresponding behaviour.
