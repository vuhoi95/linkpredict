Title: On the Free-Energy of Three-Dimensional CFTs and Polylogarithms
Authors: A. C. Petkou and M. B. Silva Neto
Abstract: We study the O(N) vector model and the U(N) Gross-Neveu model with fixed total fermion number, in three dimensions. Using non-trivial polylogarithmic identities, we calculate the large-N renormalized free-energy density of these models, at their conformal points in a ``slab'' geometry with one finite dimension of length L. We comment on the possible implications of our results.
