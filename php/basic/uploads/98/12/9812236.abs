Title: Effects of Boson-Vacuum Polarization by a Singular Magnetic Vortex
Authors: Yu. A. Sitenko and A. Yu. Babansky
Abstract: In a space of arbitrary dimensions, the effect of an external magnetic field on the vacuum of a quantized charged scalar field is studied for the field configuration in the form of a singular vortex. The zeta-function technique is used to regularize ultraviolet divergences. The expression for the effective action is derived. It is shown that the energy density and current induced in the vacuum decrease exponentially at large distances from the vortex. The analytic properties of vacuum features as functions of the complex-valued space dimension are discussed.
