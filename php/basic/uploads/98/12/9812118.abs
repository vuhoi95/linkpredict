Abstract: We study total and partial supersymmetry breaking by freely acting orbifolds, or equivalently by Scherk-Schwarz compactifications, in type I string theory. In particular, we describe a four-dimensional chiral compactification with spontaneously broken N=1 supersymmetry, some models with partial $N=4\to N=2$ and $N=4\to N=1$ supersymmetry breaking and their heterotic and M-theory duals. A generic feature of these models is that in the gravitational sector and in the spectrum of D-branes parallel to the breaking coordinate, all mass splittings are proportional to the compactification scale, while global (extended) supersymmetry remains unbroken at tree level for the massless excitations of D-branes transverse to the breaking direction.
