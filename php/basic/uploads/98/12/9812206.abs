Title: Geometrical Finiteness, Holography, and the BTZ Black Hole
Authors: Danny Birmingham and Conall Kennedy and Siddhartha Sen and Andy Wilkins
Abstract: We show how a theorem of Sullivan provides a precise mathematical statement of a 3d holographic principle, that is, the hyperbolic structure of a certain class of 3d manifolds is completely determined in terms of the corresponding Teichmuller space of the boundary. We explore the consequences of this theorem in the context of the Euclidean BTZ black hole in three dimensions.
