Abstract: An Abelian gauge model, with vector and 2-form potential fields linked by a topological mass term that mixes the two Abelian factors, is shown to exhibit Dirac-like magnetic monopoles in the presence of a matter background. In addition, considering a "non-minimal coupling" between the fermions and the tensor field, we obtain a generalised quantisation condition that involves, among others, the mass parameter. Also, it is explicitly shown that 1_loop (finite) corrections do not shift the value of such a mass parameter.
