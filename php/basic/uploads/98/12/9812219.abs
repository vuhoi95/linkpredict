Title: Noncommutative Open String and D-brane
Authors: Chong-Sun Chu and Pei-Ming Ho
Abstract: In this paper we consider the quantization of open strings ending on D-branes with a background B field. We find that spacetime coordinates of the open string end-points become noncommutative, and correspondingly the D-brane worldvolume also becomes noncommutative. This provides a string theory derivation and generalization of the noncommutativity obtained previously in the Matrix model compactification. For Dp-branes with p>=2 our results are new and agree with that of Matrix theory for the case of A=0 (where $A$ is the worldvolume gauge field) if the T-duality radii are used.
