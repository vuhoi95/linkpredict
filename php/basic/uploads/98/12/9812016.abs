Title: Finite-dimensional analogs of string s <-> t duality and pentagon  equation
Authors: I. G. Korepanov and S. Saito
Abstract: We put forward one of the forms of functional pentagon equation (FPE), known from the theory of integrable models, as an algebraic explanation to the phenomenon known in physics as s<->t duality. We present two simple geometrical examples of FPE solutions, one of them yielding in a particular case the well-known Veneziano expression for 4-particle amplitude. Finally, we interpret our solutions of FPE in terms of relations in Lie groups.
