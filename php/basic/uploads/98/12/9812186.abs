Title: Yangians, finite W-algebras and the Non Linear Schrodinger hierarchy
Authors: M. Mintchev and E. Ragoucy and P. Sorba and Ph. Zaugg
Abstract: We show an algebra morphism between Yangians and some finite W-algebras. This correspondence is nicely illustrated in the framework of the Non Linear Schrodinger hierarchy. For such a purpose, we give an explicit realization of the Yangian generators in terms of deformed oscillators.
