Title: Holographic Principle during Inflation and a Lower Bound on Density  Fluctuations
Authors: S. Kalyana Rama and Tapobrata Sarkar
Abstract: We apply the holographic principle during the inflationary stage of our universe. Where necessary, we illustrate the analysis in the case of new and extended inflation which, together, typify generic models of inflation. We find that in the models of extended inflation type, and perhaps of new inflation type also, the holographic principle leads to a lower bound on the density fluctuations.
