Title: On Principal Admissible Representations and Conformal Field Theory
Authors: P. Mathieu and M. A. Walton
Abstract: The principal admissible representations of affine Kac-Moody algebras are studied, with a view to their use in conformal field theory. We discuss the generation of the set of principal admissible highest weights, concentrating mainly on $A_r^{(1)}$ at rational level $k$. A related algorithm is described that produces the Malikov-Feigen-Fuchs null vectors of these representations. With the principal admissible description of the highest weights, we are able to prove that field identifications (including maverick ones) lead to the canonical description of the primary fields of the nonunitary diagonal coset theories.
