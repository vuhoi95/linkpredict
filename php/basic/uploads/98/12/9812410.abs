Title: Stability of the compressible quantum Hall state around the half-filled  Landau level
Authors: Kenzo Ishikawa and Nobuki Maeda and Tetsuyuki Ochiai
Abstract: We study the compressible states in the quantum Hall system using a mean field theory on the von Neumann lattice. In the lowest Landau level, a kinetic energy is generated dynamically from Coulomb interaction. The compressibility of the state is calculated as a function of the filling factor $\nu$ and the width $d$ of the spacer between the charge carrier layer and dopants. The compressibility becomes negative below a critical value of $d$ and the state becomes unstable at $\nu=1/2$. Within a finite range around $\nu=1/2$, the stable compressible state exists above the critical value of $d$.
