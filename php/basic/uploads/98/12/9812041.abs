Title: Magnetization and dynamically induced finite densities in  three-dimensional Chern-Simons QED
Authors: Taichi Itoh and Hiroshi Kato
Abstract: In (2+1)-dimensional QED with a Chern-Simons term, we show that spontaneous magnetization occurs in the context of finite density vacua, which are the lowest Landau levels fully or half occupied by fermions. Charge condensation is shown to appear so as to complement the fermion anti-fermion condensate, which breaks the flavor U(2N) symmetry and causes fermion mass generation. The solutions to the Schwinger-Dyson gap equation show that the fermion self-energy contributes to the induction of a finite fermion density and/or fermion mass. The magnetization can be supported by charge condensation for theories with the Chern-Simons coefficient $\kappa=N e^2/2 \pi$, and $\kappa=N e^2/4 \pi$, under the Gauss law constraint. For $\kappa=N e^2/4 \pi$, both the magnetic field and the fermion mass are simultaneously generated in the half-filled ground state, which breaks the U(2N) symmetry as well as the Lorentz symmetry.
