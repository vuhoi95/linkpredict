Title: Counterterms/M-theory Corrections to D=11 Supergravity
Authors: S. Deser and D. Seminara
Abstract: We construct a local on-shell invariant in D=11 supergravity from the nonlocal four-point tree scattering amplitude.Its existence, together with earlier arguments, implies non-renormalizability of the theory at lowest possible, two loop, level. This invariant, whose leading bosonic terms are exhibited, may also express the leading, "zero-slope", M$-$theory corrections to its D=11 supergravity limit.
