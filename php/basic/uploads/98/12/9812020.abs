Title: Higher-derivative scalar field theories as constrained second-order  theories
Authors: F. J. de Urries and J. Julve
Abstract: As an alternative to the covariant Ostrogradski method, we show that higher-derivative relativistic Lagrangian field theories can be reduced to second differential-order by writing them directly as covariant two-derivative theories involving Lagrange multipliers and new fields. Notwithstanding the intrinsic non-covariance of the Dirac's procedure used to deal with the constraints, the Lorentz invariance is recovered at the end. We develope this new setting for a simple scalar model and then its applications to generalized electrodynamics and higher-derivative gravity are outlined. This method is better suited than Ostrogradski's for a generalization to 2n-derivative theories.
