Title: D-Branes and Spin^c Structures
Authors: Robert L. Bryant and Eric R. Sharpe
Abstract: It was recently pointed out by E. Witten that for a D-brane to consistently wrap a submanifold of some manifold, the normal bundle must admit a Spin^c structure. We examine this constraint in the case of type II string compactifications with vanishing cosmological constant, and argue that in all such cases, the normal bundle to a supersymmetric cycle is automatically Spin^c.
