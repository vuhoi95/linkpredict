Title: Matrix Compactification On Orientifolds
Authors: Pei-Ming Ho and Yong-Shi Wu
Abstract: Generalizing previous results for orbifolds, in this paper we describe the compactification of Matrix model on an orientifold which is a quotient space as a Yang-Mills theory living on a quantum space. The information of the compactification is encoded in the action of the discrete symmetry group G on Euclidean space and a projective representation U of G. The choice of Hilbert space on which the algebra of U is realized as an operator algebra corresponds to the choice of a physical background for the compactification. All these data are summarized in the spectral triple of the quantum space.
