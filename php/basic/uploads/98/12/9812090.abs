Title: Partial duality in SU(N) Yang-Mills theory
Authors: L. Faddeev and Antti J. Niemi
Abstract: Recently we have proposed a set of variables for describing the infrared limit of four dimensional SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. here we extend these variables to the general case of four dimensional SU(N) Yang-Mills theory. We find that the SU(N) connection A decomposes according to irreducible representations of SO(N-1) and the curvature two-form F is related to the symplectic Kirillov two forms that characterize irreducible representations of SU(N). We propose a general class of nonlinear chiral models that may describe stable, soliton-like configurations with nontrivial topological numbers.
