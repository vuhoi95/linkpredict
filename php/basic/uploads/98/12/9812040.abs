Title: Renormalizability of Nonrenormalizable Field Theories
Authors: Alberto Blasi and Nicola Maggiore and Silvio P. Sorella and Luiz C. Q. Vilar
Abstract: We give a simple and elegant proof of the Equivalence Theorem, stating that two field theories related by nonlinear field transformations have the same S matrix. We are thus able to identify a subclass of nonrenormalizable field theories which are actually physically equivalent to renormalizable ones. Our strategy is to show by means of the BRS formalism that the "nonrenormalizable" part of such fake nonrenormalizable theories, is a kind of gauge fixing, being confined in the cohomologically trivial sector of the theory.
