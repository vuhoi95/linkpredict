Title: Moduli Space for Conifolds as Intersection of Orthogonal D6 branes
Authors: Robert de Mello Koch and Kyungho Oh and Radu Tatar
Abstract: We show that a system of parallel D3 branes near a conifold singularity can be mapped onto an intersecting configuration of orthogonal branes in type IIA string theory. Using this brane configuration, we analyze the Higgs moduli space of the associated field theory. The dimension of the Higgs moduli space is computed from a geometrical analysis of the conifold singularity. Our results provide evidence for an extended s-rule. In addition, a discrepancy between the prediction of the brane configuration and the result obtained from a geometrical anaysis is noted. This discrepancy is traced back to worldsheet instanton effects.
