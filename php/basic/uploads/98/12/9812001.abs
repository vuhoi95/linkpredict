Title: Lagrangian Approach of the First Class Constrained Systems
Authors: Yong-Wan Kim and Seung-Kook Kim and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: We show how to systematically derive the exact form of local symmetries for the abelian Proca and CS models, which are converted into first class constrained systems by the BFT formalism, in the Lagrangian formalism. As results, without resorting to a Hamiltonian formulation we obtain the well-known U(1) symmetry for the gauge invariant Proca model, while showing that for the CS model there exist novel symmetries as well as the usual symmetry transformations.
