Title: Connected Correlators in Quantum Gravity
Authors: J. Ambjorn and P. Bialas and J. Jurkiewicz
Abstract: We discuss the concept of connected, reparameterization invariant matter correlators in quantum gravity. We analyze the effect of discretization in two solvable cases: branched polymers and two-dimensional simplicial gravity. In both cases the naively defined connected correlators for a fixed volume display an anomalous behavior, which could be interpreted as a long-range order. We suggest that this is in fact only a highly non-trivial finite-size effect and propose an improved definition of the connected correlator, which reduces the effect. Using this definition we illustrate the appearance of a long-range spin order in the Ising model on a two-dimensional random lattice in an external magnetic field $H$, when $H \to 0$ and $\beta=\beta_C$.
