Authors: V. Bazhanov and S. Lukyanov and A. Zamolodchikov
Abstract: Relation between the vacuum eigenvalues of CFT Q-operators and spectral determinants of one-dimensional Schroedinger operator with homogeneous potential, recently conjectured by Dorey and Tateo for special value of Virasoro vacuum parameter p, is proven to hold, with suitable modification of the Schroedinger operator, for all values of p.
