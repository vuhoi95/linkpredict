Title: (Non-)Anomalous D-brane and O-plane couplings: the normal bundle
Authors: Ben Craps and Frederik Roose
Abstract: The direct string computation of anomalous D-brane and orientifold plane couplings is extended to include the curvature of the normal bundle. The normalization of these terms is fixed unambiguously. New, non-anomalous gravitational couplings are found.
