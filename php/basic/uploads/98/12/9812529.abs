Title: The strategy of regions for asymptotic expansion of two-loop vertex  Feynman diagrams
Authors: V. A. Smirnov and E. R. Rakhmetov
Abstract: General prescriptions for evaluation of coefficients at arbitrary powers and logarithms in the asymptotic expansion of Feynman diagrams in the Sudakov limit are discussed and illustrated by two-loop examples. Peculiarities connected with evaluation of individual terms of the expansion, in particular, the introduction of auxiliary analytic regularization, are characterized.
