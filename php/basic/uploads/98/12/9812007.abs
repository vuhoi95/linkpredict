Title: Vacua, Propagators, and Holographic Probes in AdS/CFT
Authors: Ulf H. Danielsson and Esko Keski-Vakkuri and Martin Kruczenski
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the relation between the bulk and boundary in AdS/CFT. We first discuss the relation between the Poincare and the global vacua, and then study various probes of the bulk from the boundary theory point of view. We derive expressions for retarded propagators and note that objects in free fall look like expanding bubbles in the boundary theory. We also study several Yang-Mills theory examples where we investigate thermal screening and confinement using propagators. In the case of confinement we also calculate the profile of a flux tube and provide an alternative derivation of the tension.
