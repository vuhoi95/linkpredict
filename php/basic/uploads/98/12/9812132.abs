Title: Lorentz and CPT Violating Chern-Simons Term in the Derivative Expansion  of QED
Authors: J. -M. Chung and Phillial Oh
Abstract: We calculate by the method of dimensional regularization and derivative expansion the one-loop effective action for a Dirac fermion with a Lorentz-violating and CPT-odd kinetic term in the background of a gauge field. We show that this term induces a Chern-Simons modification to Maxwell theory. Some related issues are also discussed.
