Authors: Paul M. N. Feehan and Peter B. Kronheimer and Thomas G. Leness and Tomasz S. Mrowka
Abstract: In this article we show that some of the recent results of Marino, Moore, and Peradze (math.DG/9812042, hep-th/9812055) -- in particular their conjecture that all closed, smooth four-manifolds with b_2^+ > 1 (and Seiberg-Witten simple type) are of `superconformal simple type' -- can be understood using a simple mathematical argument via the PU(2)-monopole cobordism of Pidstrigach and Tyurin (dg-ga/9507004) and results of the first and third authors (dg-ga/9712005, dg-ga/9709022).
