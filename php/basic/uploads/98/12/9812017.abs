Title: Two-Boundaries AdS/CFT Correspondence in Dilatonic Gravity
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: We discuss dilatonic gravity (bulk theory) from the point of view of (generalized) AdS/CFT correspondence. Self-consistent dilatonic background is considered. It may be understood as two boundaries space where AdS boundary appears as infinite boundary and new (singular) boundary occurs at short distances. The two-point correlation function and conformal dimension for minimal and dilaton coupled scalar are found. Even for minimal scalar, the conformal dimension is found to be different on above two boundaries. Hence, new CFT appears in AdS/CFT correspondence at short distances. AdS/CFT correspondence may be understood as interpolating bulk theory between two different CFTs.
