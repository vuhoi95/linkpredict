Title: Massless particle in 2d spacetime with constant curvature
Authors: George Jorjadze and WÅ‚odzimierz Piechocki
Abstract: We consider dynamics of massless particle in 2d spacetimes with constant curvature. We analyze different examples of spacetime. Dynamical integrals are constructed from spacetime symmetry related to $sl(2.{\bf R})$ algebra. Mass-shell condition restricts dynamical integrals to a cone (without vertex) which defines physical-phase space. We parametrize the cone by canonical coordinates. Canonical quantization with definite choice of operator ordering leads to unitary irreducible representations of $SO_\uparrow (2.1)$ group.
