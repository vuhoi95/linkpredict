Abstract: The left-right symmetric model (LRSM) with gauge group $SU(2)_{L} \times SU(2)_{R} \times U(1)_{B-L}$ is reconstructed from the geometric formulation of gauge theory in $M_4 \times Z_2 \times Z_2$ where $M_4$ is the four-dimensional Minkowski space and $Z_2 \times Z_2$ the discrete space with four points. The geometrical structure of this model becomes clearer compared with other works based on noncommutative geometry. As a result, the Yukawa coupling terms and the Higgs potential are derived in more restricted forms than in the standard LRSM.
