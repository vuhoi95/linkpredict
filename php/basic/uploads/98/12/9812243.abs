Title: Renormalization group approach to interacting polymerised manifolds
Authors: P. K. Mitter and B. Scoppola
Abstract: We propose to study the infrared behaviour of polymerised (or tethered) random manifolds of dimension D interacting via an exclusion condition with a fixed impurity in d-dimensional Euclidean space in which the manifold is embedded. We prove rigorously, via methods of Wilson's renormalization group, the convergence to a non Gaussian fixed point for suitably chosen physical parameters.
