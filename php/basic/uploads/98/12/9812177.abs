Title: USp(2k) Matrix Model: Schwinger-Dyson Equations and Closed-Open String  Interactions
Authors: H. Itoyama and A. Tsuchiya
Abstract: We derive the Schwinger-Dyson/loop equations for the USp(2k) matrix model which close among the closed and open Wilson loop variables. These loop equations exhibit a complete set of the joining and splitting interactions required for the nonorientable Type I superstrings. The open loops realize the SO(2n_f) Chan-Paton factor and their linearized loop equations derive the mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary conditions.
