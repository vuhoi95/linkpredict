Title: On Wilson loops and $Q\bar Q$-potentials from the AdS/CFT relation at  $T\geq 0$
Authors: H. Dorn and H. -J. Otto
Abstract: We give a short introduction to and a partial review of the work on the calculation of Wilson loops and $Q\bar Q$-potentials via the conjectured AdS/CFT duality. Included is a discussion of the relative weight of the stringy correction to the target space background versus the correction by the quantum fluctuations of the string world sheet.
