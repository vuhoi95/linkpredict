Title: Exact Relativistic Two-Body Motion in Lineal Gravity
Authors: R. B. Mann and D. Robbins and T. Ohta
Abstract: We consider the N-body problem in (1+1) dimensional lineal gravity. For 2 point masses (N=2) we obtain an exact solution for the relativistic motion. In the equal mass case we obtain an explicit expression for their proper separation as a function of their mutual proper time. Our solution gives the exact Hamiltonian to infinite order in the gravitational coupling constant.
