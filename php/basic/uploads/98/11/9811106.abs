Title: Quadratic action for type IIB supergravity on $AdS_5\times S^5$
Authors: G. Arutyunov and S. Frolov
Abstract: The quadratic action for physical fields of type IIB supergravity model on $AdS_5\times S^5$ is derived starting from the recently found covariant action. All boundary terms that have to be added to the action to be used in the AdS/CFT correspondence are determined.
