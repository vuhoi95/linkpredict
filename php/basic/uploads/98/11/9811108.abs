Title: Progress in classically solving ten dimensional supersymmetric reduced  Yang-Mills theories
Authors: Jean-Loup Gervais and Mikhail Saveliev
Abstract: It is shown that there exists an on-shell light cone gauge where half of the fermionic components of the super vector potential vanish, so that part of the superspace flatness conditions becomes linear. After reduction to $(1+1)$ space-time dimensions, the general solution of this subset of equations is derived. The remaining non-linear equations are written in a form which is analogous to Yang equations, albeit with superderivatives involving sixteen fermionic coordinates. It is shown that this non-linear part may, nevertheless, be solved by methods similar to powerful technics previously developed for the (purely bosonic) self-dual Yang Mills equations in four dimensions.
