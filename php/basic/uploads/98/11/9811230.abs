Title: Generalized Conifolds and 4d N=1 SCFT
Authors: S. Gubser and N. Nekrasov and S. L. Shatashvili
Abstract: This paper lays groundwork for the detailed study of the non-trivial renormalization group flow connecting supersymmetric fixed points in four dimensions using string theory on AdS spaces. Specifically, we consider D3-branes placed at singularities of Calabi-Yau threefolds which generalize the conifold singularity and have an ADE classification. The $\CN=1$ superconformal theories dictating their low-energy dynamics are infrared fixed points arising from deforming the corresponding ADE $\CN=2$ superconformal field theories by mass terms for adjoint chiral fields. We probe the geometry with a single $D3$-brane and discuss the near-horizon supergravity solution for a large number $N$ of coincident $D3$-branes.
