Title: Effective action and Hawking radiation for dilaton coupled scalars in  two dimensions
Authors: W. Kummer and D. V. Vassilevich
Abstract: The effective one-loop action for general dilaton theories with arbitrary dilaton-dependent measure and nonminimal coupling to scalar matter is computed. As an application we determine the Hawking flux to infinity from black holes in d-dimensions. We resolve the recently resurrected problem of an apparent negative flux for nonminimally coupled scalars: For any $D \geq 4$ Black Hole the complete flux turns out to be precisely the one of minimal coupling. This result is obtained from a Christensen-Fulling type argument involving the (non-)conservation of energy-momentum. It is compared with approaches using the effective action.
