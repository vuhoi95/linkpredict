Title: Field Theory of the Random Flux Model
Authors: Alexander Altland and B D Simons
Abstract: The long-range properties of the random flux model (lattice fermions hopping under the influence of maximally random link disorder) are shown to be described by a supersymmetric field theory of non-linear sigma model type, where the group GL(n|n) is the global invariant manifold. An extension to non-abelian generalizations of this model identifies connections to lattice QCD, Dirac fermions in a random gauge potential, and stochastic non-Hermitian operators.
