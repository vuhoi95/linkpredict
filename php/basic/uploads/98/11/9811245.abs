Title: String Theory on AdS_3 x S^3 x S^3 x S^1
Authors: Shmuel Elitzur and Ofer Feinerman and Amit Giveon and David Tsabar
Abstract: Spacetime properties of superstrings on AdS_3 x S^3 x S^3 x S^1 are studied. The boundary theory is a two dimensional superconformal field theory with a large N=(4,4) supersymmetry.
