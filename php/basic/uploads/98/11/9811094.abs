Title: Geometry of 2d spacetime and quantization of particle dynamics
Authors: George Jorjadze and WÅ‚odzimierz Piechocki
Abstract: We analyze classical and quantum dynamics of a particle in 2d spacetimes with constant curvature which are locally isometric but globally different. We show that global symmetries of spacetime specify the symmetries of physical phase-space and the corresponding quantum theory. To quantize the systems we parametrize the physical phase-space by canonical coordinates. Canonical quantization leads to unitary irreducible representations of $SO_\uparrow (2.1)$ group.
