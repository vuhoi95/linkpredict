Title: The Hausdorff dimension in polymerized quantum gravity
Authors: Martin G. Harris and John F. Wheater
Abstract: We calculate the Hausdorff dimension, $d_H$, and the correlation function exponent, $\eta$, for polymerized two dimensional quantum gravity models. If the non-polymerized model has correlation function exponent $\eta_0 >3$ then $d_H=\gamma^{-1}$ where $\gamma$ is the susceptibility exponent. This suggests that these models may be in the same universality class as certain non-generic branched polymer models.
