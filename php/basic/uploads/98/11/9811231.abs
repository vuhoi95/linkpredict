Title: The Quantum Noether Condition in terms of interacting fields
Authors: Tobias Hurth and Kostas Skenderis
Abstract: We review our recent work, hep-th/9803030, on the constraints imposed by global or local symmetries on perturbative quantum field theories. The analysis is performed in the Bogoliubov-Shirkov-Epstein-Glaser formulation of perturbative quantum field theory. In this formalism the S-matrix is constructed directly in the asymptotic Fock space with only input causality and Poincare invariance. We reformulate the symmetry condition proposed in our earlier work in terms of interacting Noether currents.
