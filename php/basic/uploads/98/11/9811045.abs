Title: Single-sided domain walls in M-theory
Authors: G. W. Gibbons and P. Rychenkova
Abstract: We describe some single-sided BPS domain wall configurations in M-theory. These are smooth non-singular resolutions of Calabi--Yau orbifolds obtained by identifying the two sides of the wall under reflection. They may thus be thought of as domain walls at the end of the universe. We also describe related domain wall type solutions with a negative cosmological constant.
