Title: Statistical Entropy and AdS/CFT Correspondence in BTZ Black Holes
Authors: Seungjoon Hyun and Won Tae Kim and Julian Lee
Abstract: We study AdS/CFT correspondence in the case of AdS3. We obtain the statistical entropy of the BTZ black hole in terms of the correct central charge and the conformal dimensions for the states corresponding to the BTZ black hole. We point out the difference between our method and the old fashioned approaches based on SL(2,R) Wess-Zumino-Witten model or Liouville theory.
