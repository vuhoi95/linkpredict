Abstract: General results on the structure of the bosonization of fermionic systems in $(2+1)$d are obtained. In particular, the universal character of the bosonized topological current is established and applied to generic fermionic current interactions. The final form of the bosonized action is shown to be given by the sum of two terms. The first one corresponds to the bosonization of the free fermionic action and turns out to be cast in the form of a pure Chern-Simons term, up to a suitable nonlinear field redefinition. We show that the second term, following from the bosonization of the interactions, can be obtained by simply replacing the fermionic current by the corresponding bosonized expression.
