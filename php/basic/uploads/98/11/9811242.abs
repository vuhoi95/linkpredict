Title: Dirac fields in a Bohm-Aharonov background and spectral boundary  conditions
Authors: C. G. Beneventano and M. De Francia and E. M. Santangelo
Abstract: We study the problem of a Dirac field in the background of an Aharonov-Bohm flux string. We exclude the origin by imposing spectral boundary conditions at a finite radius then shrinked to zero. Thus, we obtain a behaviour of the eigenfunctions which is compatible with the self-adjointness of the radial Hamiltonian and the invariance under integer translations of the reduced flux. After confining the theory to a finite region, we check the consistency with the index theorem, and discuss the vacuum fermionic number and Casimir energy.
