Title: Dynamical Aspects of Large N Reduced Models
Authors: Tomohiro Hotta and Jun Nishimura and Asato Tsuchiya
Abstract: We study the large N reduced model of D-dimensional Yang-Mills theory with special attention to dynamical aspects related to the eigenvalues of the N by N matrices, which correspond to the space-time coordinates in the IIB matrix model. We first put an upper bound on the extent of space time by perturbative arguments. We perform a Monte Carlo simulation and show that the upper bound is actually saturated. The relation of our result to the SSB of the U(1)^D symmetry in the Eguchi-Kawai model is clarified. We define a quantity which represents the uncertainty of the space-time coordinates and show that it is of the same order as the extent of space time, which means that a classical space-time picture is maximally broken. We develop a 1/D expansion, which enables us to calculate correlation functions of the model analytically. The absence of an SSB of the Lorentz invariance is shown by the Monte Carlo simulation as well as by the 1/D expansion.
