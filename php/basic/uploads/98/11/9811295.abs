Title: The Interaction Structure and Cosmological Relevance of Mass Scales in  String Motivated Supersymmetric Theories
Authors: Arjun Berera and Thomas W. Kephart
Abstract: A string motivated, N=1 global supersymmetric, general Lagrangian is obtained that represents an inflaton interacting with the modes of a string. Focus is placed on the Lagrangian's relevance to warm inflation, which is a cosmology based on dissipative dynamics. Several interaction schemes are identified from the general Lagrangian that may have interesting consequences for dissipative dynamics. Distributed-mass-models, which have been shown to solve the horizon problem within a warm inflation regime, are identified in the general Lagrangian.
