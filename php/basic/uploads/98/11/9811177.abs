Title: Brane Dynamics and Four-Dimensional Quantum Field Theory
Authors: N. D. Lambert and P. C. West
Abstract: We review the relation between the classical dynamics of the M-fivebrane and the quantum low energy effective action for N=2 Yang-Mills theories. We also discuss some outstanding issues in this correspondence.
