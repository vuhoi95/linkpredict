Title: An exactly solvable model of the Calogero type for the icosahedral group
Authors: Oliver Haschke and Werner Ruehl
Abstract: We construct a quantum mechanical model of the Calogero type for the icosahedral group as the structural group. Exact solvability is proved and the spectrum is derived explicitly.
