Title: Implications of N=1 supersymmetry for QCD conformal operators
Authors: A. V. Belitsky and D. Muller and A. Schafer
Abstract: We prove a set of identities for the anomalous dimensions of the quark and gluon conformal operators in the flavour singlet channel in QCD. These relations arise from the graded commutator algebra of the N=1 superconformal group. We evaluate the rotation matrices for the quantities under study from the conventional dimensional regularization to the supersymmetry preserving regularization scheme. Using them we verify the equalities in two-loop approximation employing the results for the NLO anomalous dimensions of the conformal operators in the minimal subtraction scheme derived earlier.
