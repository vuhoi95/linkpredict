Abstract: In the context of brane solutions of supergravity, we discuss a general method to introduce collective modes of any spin by exploiting a particular way of breaking symmetries. The method is applied to the D3, M2 and M5 branes and we derive explicit expressions for how the zero-modes enter the target space fields, verify normalisability in the transverse directions and derive the corresponding field equations on the brane. In particular, the method provides a clear understanding of scalar, spinor, and rank r tensorial Goldstone modes, chiral as well as non-chiral, and how they arise from the gravity, Rarita-Schwinger, and rank r+1 Kalb-Ramond tensor gauge fields, respectively. Some additional observations concerning the chiral tensor modes on the M5 brane are discussed.
