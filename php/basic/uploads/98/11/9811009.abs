Title: On the Riemann-Hilbert approach to the asymptotic analysis of the  correlation functions of the Quantum Nonlinear Schrodinger equation. Non-free  fermionic case
Authors: A. R. Its and N. A. Slavnov
Abstract: We consider the local field dynamical temperature correlation function of the Quantum Nonlinear Schrodinger equation with the finite coupling constant. This correlation function admits a Fredholm determinant representation. The related operator-valued Riemann--Hilbert problem is used for analysing the leading term of the large time and long distance asymptotics of the correlation function.
