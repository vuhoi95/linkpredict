Title: The Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation on the Half Line
Authors: M. Gattobigio and A. Liguori and M. Mintchev
Abstract: The nonlinear Schrodinger equation on the half line with mixed boundary condition is investigated. After a brief introduction to the corresponding classical boundary value problem, the exact second quantized solution of the system is constructed. The construction is based on a new algebraic structure, which is called in what follows boundary algebra and which substitutes, in the presence of boundaries, the familiar Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra. The fundamental quantum field theory properties of the solution are established and discussed in detail. The relative scattering operator is derived in the Haag-Ruelle framework, suitably generalized to the case of broken translation invariance in space.
