Title: Categorial mirror symmetry for K3 surfaces
Authors: C. Bartocci and U. Bruzzo and G. Sanguinetti
Abstract: We study the structure of a modified Fukaya category ${\frak F}(X)$ associated with a K3 surface $X$, and prove that whenever $X$ is an elliptic K3 surface with a section, the derived category of $\fF(X)$ is equivalent to a subcategory of the derived category ${\bold D}(\hat X)$ of coherent sheaves on the mirror K3 surface $\hat X$.
