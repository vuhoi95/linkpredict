Title: Polchinski ERG equation and 2D scalar field theory
Authors: Yuri Kubyshin and Rui Neves and Robertus Potting
Abstract: We investigate a $Z_2$-symmetric scalar field theory in two dimensions using the Polchinski exact renormalization group equation expanded to second order in the derivative expansion. We find preliminary evidence that the Polchinski equation is able to describe the non-perturbative infinite set of fixed points in the theory space, corresponding to the minimal unitary series of 2D conformal field theories. We compute the anomalous scaling dimension $\eta$ and the correlation length critical exponent $\nu$ showing that an accurate fit to conformal field theory selects particular regulating functions.
