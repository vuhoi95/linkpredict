Title: Yang-Mills instantons vs. type IIB D-instantons
Authors: Massimo Bianchi and Stefano Kovacs
Abstract: We report on the computation of the one-instanton contribution to the 16-point Green function of fermionic composite operators in N=4 Super YM theory. The remarkable agreement, initially found in the case of an SU(2) gauge group, with the one D-instanton contribution to the corresponding type IIB superstring amplitude on $AdS_5\times S^5$ is reviewed here. The recent extension by other authors of this result to any SU(N) gauge group and to multi-instantons in the large N limit is briefly discussed. We also argue that for the AdS/SCFT correspondence under consideration to work for any $N\geq 2$, at least for some protected interactions, string effects should require a truncation of the Kaluza--Klein spectrum for finite $S^5$ radius much in the same way as worldsheet unitarity restricts the allowed isospins in SU(2) WZW models. Finally, we briefly comment on the logarithmic behavior of some four-point Green functions of scalar composite operators.
