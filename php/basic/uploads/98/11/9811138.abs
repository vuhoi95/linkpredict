Title: The Kondo Model with a Bulk Mass Term
Authors: Z. S. Bassi and A. LeClair
Abstract: We introduce two massive versions of the anisotropic spin 1/2 Kondo model and discuss their integrability. The two models have the same bulk sine-Gordon interactions, but differ in their boundary interactions. At the Toulouse free fermion point each of the models can be understood as two decoupled Ising models in boundary magnetic fields. Reflection S-matrices away from the free fermion point are conjectured.
