Title: Consistent, covariant and multiplicative anomalies
Authors: Guido Cognola and Sergio Zerbini
Abstract: It is shown that the multiplicative anomaly in the vector-axial-vector model, which apparently has nothing to do with the breaking of classical current symmetries, nevertheless is strictly related to the well known consistent and covariant anomalies.
