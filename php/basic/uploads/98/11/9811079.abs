Title: Dynamical Chiral Symmetry Breaking in QED in a Magnetic Field: Toward  Exact Results
Authors: V. P. Gusynin and V. A. Miransky and I. A. Shovkovy
Abstract: We describe a (first, to the best of our knowledge) essentially soluble example of dynamical symmetry breaking phenomenon in a 3+1 dimensional gauge theory without fundamental scalar fields: QED in a constant magnetic field.
