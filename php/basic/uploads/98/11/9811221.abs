Title: Dynamical Generation of the Primordial Magnetic Field by Ferromagnetic  Domain Walls
Authors: Paolo Cea and Luigi Tedesco
Abstract: The spontaneous generation of uniform magnetic condensate in $QED_3$ gives rise to ferromagnetic domain walls at the electroweak phase transition. These ferromagnetic domain walls are caracterized by vanishing effective surface energy density avoiding, thus, the domain wall problem. Moreover we find that the domain walls generate a magnetic field $B \simeq 10^{24} Gauss$ at the electroweak scale which account for the seed field in the so called dynamo mechanism for the cosmological primordial magnetic field. We find that the annihilation processes of walls with size $R \simeq 10^5 Km$ could release an energy of order $10^{52} erg$ indicating the invisible ferromagnetic walls as possible compact sources of Gamma Ray Bursts.
