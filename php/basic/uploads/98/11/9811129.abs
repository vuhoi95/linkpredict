Title: Spectral Covers, Charged Matter and Bundle Cohomology
Authors: Duiliu-Emanuel Diaconescu and Gheorghe Ionesei
Abstract: We consider four dimensional heterotic compactifications on smooth elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds. Using spectral cover techniques, we study bundle cohomology groups corresponding to charged matter multiplets. The analysis shows that in generic situations, the resulting charged matter spectrum is stable under deformations of the vector bundle.
