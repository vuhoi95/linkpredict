Title: On the construction of gauge theories from non critical type 0 strings
Authors: Gabriele Ferretti and Dario Martelli
Abstract: We investigate Polyakov's proposal of constructing Yang-Mills theories by using non critical type 0 strings. We break conformal invariance by putting the system at finite temperature and find that the entropy of the cosmological solutions for these theories matches that of a gas of weakly interacting Yang-Mills bosons, up to a numerical constant. The computation of the entropy using the effective action approach presents some novelties in that the whole contribution comes from the RR fields. We also find an area law and a mass gap in the theory and show that such behavior persists for $p>4$. We comment on the possible physical meaning of this result.
