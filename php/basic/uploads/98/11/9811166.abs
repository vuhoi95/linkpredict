Title: Generalized partition functions, interpolating statistics and higher  virial coefficients
Authors: P. F. Borges and H. Boschi-Filho and C. Farina
Abstract: Starting from determinants at finite temperature obeying an intermediate boundary condition between the periodic (bosonic) and antiperiodic (fermionic) cases, we find results which can be mapped onto the ones obtained from anyons for the second virial coefficient. Using this approach, we calculate the corresponding higher virial coefficients and compare them with the results known in the literature.
