Title: Continuity of Quark and Hadron Matter
Authors: Thomas Schaefer and Frank Wilczek
Abstract: We review, clarify, and extend the notion of color-flavor locking. We present evidence that for three degenerate flavors the qualitative features of the color-flavor locked state, reliably predicted for high density, match the expected features of hadronic matter at low density. This provides, in particular, a controlled, weak-coupling realization of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in this (slight) idealization of QCD.
