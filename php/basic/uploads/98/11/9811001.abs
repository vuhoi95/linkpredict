Title: Abelian Monopoles and Action Density in SU(2) Gluodynamics on the  Lattice
Authors: B. L. G. Bakker and M. N. Chernodub and M. I. Polikarpov and A. I. Veselov
Abstract: We show that the extended Abelian magnetic monopoles in the Maximal Abelian projection of lattice SU(2) gluodynamics are locally correlated with the magnetic and the electric parts of the SU(2) action density. These correlations are observed in the confined and in the deconfined phases.
