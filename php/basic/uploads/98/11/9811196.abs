Title: Non-Standard neutral kaons dynamics from D-brane statistics
Authors: F. Benatti and R. Floreanini
Abstract: The neutral kaon system can be effectively described by non-unitary, dissipative, completely positive dynamics that extend the usual treatment. In the framework of open quantum systems, we show how the origin of these non-standard time evolutions can be traced to the interaction of the kaon system with a large environment. We find that D-branes, effectively described by a heat-bath of quanta obeying infinite statistics, could constitute a realistic example of such an environment.
