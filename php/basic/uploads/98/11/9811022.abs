Title: Tensorial Central Charges and New Superparticle Models with Fundamental  Spinor Coordinates
Authors: Igor Bandos and Jerzy Lukierski
Abstract: We consider firstly simple D=4 superalgebra with six real tensorial central charges $Z_{\mu\nu}$, and discuss its possible realizations in massive and massless cases. Massless case is dynamically realized by generalized Ferber-Shirafuji (FS) model with fundamental bosonic spinor coordinates. The Lorentz invariance is not broken due to the realization of central charges generators in terms of bosonic spinors. The model contains four fermionic coordinates and possesses three kappa-symmetries thus providing the BPS configuration preserving 3/4 of the target space supersymmetries. We show that the physical degrees of freedom (8 real bosonic and 1 real Grassmann variable) of our model can be described by OSp(8|1) supertwistor. The relation with recent superparticle model by Rudychev and Sezgin is pointed out. Finally we propose a higher dimensional generalization of our model with one real fundamental bosonic spinor. D=10 model describes massless superparticle with composite tensorial central charges and in D=11 we obtain 0-superbrane model with nonvanishing mass which is generated dynamically.
