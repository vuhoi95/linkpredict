Title: Wick Rotation and Abelian Bosonization
Authors: Aleksandar Bogojevic and Olivera Miskovic
Abstract: We investigate the connection between Abelian bosonization in the Minkowski and Euclidean formalisms. The relation is best seen in the complex time formalism of S. A. Fulling and S. N. M. Ruijsenaars \cite{fulling}.
