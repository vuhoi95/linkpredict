Title: Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization of symmetric Chern-Simons theory
Authors: Won Tae Kim and Chang-Yeong Lee and Dong Won Lee
Abstract: We study the manifestly covariant three-dimensional symmetric Chern-Simons action in terms of the Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization method. We find that the Lorentz covariant gauge fixed version of this action is reduced to the usual Chern-Simons type action after a proper field redefinition. Furthermore, the renormalizability of the symmetric Chern-Simons theory turns out to be the same as that of the original Chern-Simons theory.
