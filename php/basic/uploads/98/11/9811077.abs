Title: Solitons, Links and Knots
Authors: Richard Battye and Paul Sutcliffe
Abstract: Using numerical simulations of the full nonlinear equations of motion we investigate topological solitons of a modified O(3) sigma model in three space dimensions, in which the solitons are stabilized by the Hopf charge. We find that for solitons up to charge five the solutions have the structure of closed strings, which become increasingly twisted as the charge increases. However, for higher charge the solutions are more exotic and comprise linked loops and knots. We discuss the structure and formation of these solitons and demonstrate that the key property responsible for producing such a rich variety of solitons is that of string reconnection.
