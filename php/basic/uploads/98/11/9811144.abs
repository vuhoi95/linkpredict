Title: Induced Rigid String Action From Fermions
Authors: R. Parthasarathy and K. S. Viswanathan
Abstract: From the Dirac action on the world sheet, an effective action is obtained by integrating over the 4-dimensional fermion fields pulled back to the world sheet. This action consists of the Nambu-Goto area term with right dimensionful constant in front, extrinsic curvature action and the topological Euler characteristic term.
