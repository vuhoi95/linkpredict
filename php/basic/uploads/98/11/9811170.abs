Title: Matrix Strings, Compactification Scales and Hagedorn Transition
Authors: Marco Laucelli Meana and Jesús Puente Peñalba
Abstract: In this work we use the Matrix Model of Strings in order to extract some non-perturbative information on how the Hagedorn critical temperature arises from eleven-dimensional physics. We study the thermal behavior of M and Matrix theories on the compactification backgrounds that correspond to string models. We obtain some information that allows us to state that the Hagedorn temperature is not unique for all Matrix String models and we are also able to sketch how the $S$-duality transformation works in this framework.
