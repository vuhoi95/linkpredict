Title: Spectral correlations of the massive QCD Dirac operator at finite  temperature
Authors: Burkhard Seif and Tilo Wettig and Thomas Guhr
Abstract: We use the graded eigenvalue method, a variant of the supersymmetry technique, to compute the universal spectral correlations of the QCD Dirac operator in the presence of massive dynamical quarks. The calculation is done for the chiral Gaussian unitary ensemble of random matrix theory with an arbitrary Hermitian matrix added to the Dirac matrix. This case is of interest for schematic models of QCD at finite temperature.
