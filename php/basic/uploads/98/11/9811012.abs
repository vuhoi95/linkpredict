Title: A geometrical interpretation of parity violation in gravity with torsion
Authors: Biswarup Mukhopadhyaya and Soumitra Sengupta
Abstract: In a space-time with torsion, the action for the gravitational field can be extended with a parity-violating piece. We show how to obtain such a piece from geometry itself, by suitably modifying the affine connection so as to include a pseudo-tensorial part. A consistent method is thus suggested for incorporating parity-violation in the Lagrangians of all matter fields with spin in a space-time background with torsion.
