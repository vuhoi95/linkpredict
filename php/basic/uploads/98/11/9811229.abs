Title: Classical description of spinning degrees of freedom of relativistic  particles by means of commuting spinors
Authors: A. A. Deriglazov and D. M. Gitman
Abstract: We consider a possibility to describe spin one-half and higher spins of massive relativistic particles by means of commuting spinors. We present two classical gauge models with the variables $x^\mu,\xi_\alpha,\chi_\alpha$, where $\xi,\chi$ are commuting Majorana spinors. In course of quantization both models reproduce Dirac equation. We analyze the possibility to introduce an interaction with an external electromagnetic background into the models and to generalize them to higher spin description. The first model admits a minimal interaction with the external electromagnetic field, but leads to reducible representations of the Poincare group being generalized for higher spins. The second model turns out to be appropriate for description of the massive higher spins. However, it seams to be difficult to introduce a minimal interaction with an external electromagnetic field into this model. We compare our approach with one, which uses Grassman variables, and establish a relation between them.
