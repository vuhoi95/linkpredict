Title: Duality from Topological Symmetry
Authors: L Baulieu and S. L. Shatashvili
Abstract: We describe topological gauge theories for which duality properties are encoded by construction. We study them for compact manifolds of dimensions four, eight and two. The fields and their duals are treated symmetrically, within the context of field--antifield unification. Dual formulations correspond to different gauge-fixings of the topological symmetry. We also describe novel features in eight-dimensional theories, and speculate about their possible "Abelian" descriptions.
