Title: Monopole Dynamics from the M-Fivebrane
Authors: N. D. Lambert and P. C. West
Abstract: We study the BPS states of the M-fivebrane which correspond to monopoles of N=2 SU(2) gauge theory. Far away from the centres of the monopoles these states may be viewed as solitons in the Seiberg-Witten effective action. It is argued that these solutions are smooth and some properties of their moduli space are discussed.
