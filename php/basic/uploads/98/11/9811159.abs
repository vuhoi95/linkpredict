Title: BPS states on noncommutative tori and duality
Authors: Anatoly Konechny and Albert Schwarz
Abstract: We study gauge theories on noncommutative tori. It was proved in [5] that Morita equivalence of noncommutative tori leads to a physical equivalence (SO(d,d| Z)-duality) of the corresponding gauge theories. We calculate the energy spectrum of maximally supersymmetric BPS states in these theories and show that this spectrum agrees with the SO(d,d| Z)-duality. The relation of our results with those of recent calculations is discussed.
