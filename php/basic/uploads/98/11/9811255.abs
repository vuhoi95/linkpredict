Title: Screening of Fractional Charges in (2+1)-dimensional QED
Authors: D. Diakonov and K. Zarembo
Abstract: We show that the logarithmically rising static potential between opposite-charged sources in two dimensions is screened by dynamical fields even if the probe charges are fractional, in units of the charge of the dynamical fields. The effect is due to quantum mechanics: the wave functions of the screening charges are superpositions of two bumps localized both near the opposite- and the same-charge sources, so that each of them gets exactly screened.
