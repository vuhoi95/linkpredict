Title: Collider Signatures of New Large Space Dimensions
Authors: Eugene A. Mirabelli and Maxim Perelstein and Michael E. Peskin
Abstract: Recently, Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, and Dvali have proposed that there are extra compact dimensions of space, accessible to gravity but not to ordinary matter, which could be macroscopically large. In this letter, we argue that high-energy collider processes in which gravitons are radiated into these new dimensions place significant, model-independent constraints on this picture. We present the constraints from anomalous single photon production at e+e- colliders and from monojet production at hadron colliders.
