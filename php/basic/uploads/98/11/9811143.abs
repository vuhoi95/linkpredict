Title: Scalar dark matter in spiral galaxies
Authors: F. S. Guzman and T. Matos and H. Villegas-Brena
Abstract: An exact, axially symmetric solution to the Einstein-Klein-Gordon field equations is employed to model the dark matter in spiral galaxies. The extended rotation curves from a previous analysis are used to fit the model and a very good agreement is found. It is argued that, although our model possesses three parameters to be fitted, it is better than the non-relativistic alternatives in the sense that it is not of a phenomenological nature, since the dark matter would consist entirely of a scalar field.
