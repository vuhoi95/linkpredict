Title: Domain wall interacting with a black hole: A new example of critical  phenomena
Authors: V. P. Frolov and A. L. Larsen and M. Christensen
Abstract: We study a simple system that comprises all main features of critical gravitational collapse, originally discovered by Choptuik and discussed in many subsequent publications. These features include universality of phenomena, mass-scaling relations, self-similarity, symmetry between super-critical and sub-critical solutions, etc. The system we consider is a stationary membrane (representing a domain wall) in a static gravitational field of a black hole. For a membrane that spreads to infinity, the induced 2+1 geometry is asymptotically flat. Besides solutions with Minkowski topology there exists also solutions with the induced metric and topology of a 2+1 dimensional black hole. By changing boundary conditions at infinity, one finds that there is a transition between these two families. This transition is critical and it possesses all the above-mentioned properties of critical gravitational collapse. It is remarkable that characteristics of this transition can be obtained analytically. In particular, we find exact analytical expressions for scaling exponents and wiggle-periods. Our results imply that black hole formation as a critical phenomenon is far more general than one might expect.
