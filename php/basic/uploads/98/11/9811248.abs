Title: SU(N)-Gauge Theories in Polyakov Gauge on the Torus
Authors: C. Ford and T. Tok and A. Wipf
Abstract: We investigate the Abelian projection with respect to the Polyakov loop operator for SU(N) gauge theories on the four torus. The gauge fixed $A_0$ is time-independent and diagonal. We construct fundamental domains for $A_0$. In sectors with non-vanishing instanton number such gauge fixings are always singular. The singularities define the positions of magnetically charged monopoles, strings or walls. These magnetic defects sit on the Gribov horizon and have quantized magnetic charges. We relate their magnetic charges to the instanton number.
