Abstract: Relation between Bopp-Kubo formulation and Weyl-Wigner-Moyal symbol calculus, and non-commutative geometry interpretation of the phase space representation of quantum mechanics are studied. Harmonic oscillator in phase space via creation and annihilation operators, both the usual and $q$-deformed, is investigated. We found that the Bopp-Kubo formulation is just non-commuting coordinates representation of the symbol calculus. The Wigner operator for the $q$-deformed harmonic oscillator is shown to be proportional to the 3-axis spherical angular momentum operator of the algebra $su_{q}(2)$. The relation of the Fock space for the harmonic oscillator and double Hilbert space of the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction is established. The quantum extension of the classical ergodiicity condition is proposed.
