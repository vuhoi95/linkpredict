Title: Melzer's identities revisited
Authors: Omar Foda and Trevor A. Welsh
Abstract: We further develop the finite length path generating transforms introduced previously, and use them to obtain constant sign polynomial expressions that reduce, in the limit of infinite path lengths, to parafermion and ABF Virasoro characters. This provides us, in the ABF case, with combinatorial proofs of Melzer's boson-fermion polynomial identities.
