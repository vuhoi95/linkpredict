Title: Constraints on Higher Derivative Operators in Maximally Supersymmetric  Gauge Theory
Authors: David A. Lowe and Rikard von Unge
Abstract: Following the work of Dine and Seiberg for SU(2), we study the leading irrelevant operators on the moduli space of N=4 supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theory. These operators are argued to be one-loop exact, and are explicitly computed.
