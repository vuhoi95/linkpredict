Abstract: The unification of general relativity and standard model for strong and electro-weak interactions is considered on the base of the conformal symmetry principle. The Penrose-Chernikov-Tagirov Lagrangian is used to describe the Higgs scalar field modulus and gravitation. We show that the procedure of the Hamiltonian reduction converts the homogeneous part of the Higgs field into the dynamical parameter of evolution of the equivalent reduced system. The equation of dynamics of the "proper time" of an observer with respect to the evolution parameter reproduces the Friedmann-like equation, which reflects the cosmological evolution of elementary particle masses. The value of the Higgs field is determined, at the present time, by the values of mean density of matter and the Hubble parameter in satisfactory agreement with the data of cosmological observations.
