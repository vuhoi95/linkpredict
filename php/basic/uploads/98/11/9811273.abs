Abstract: We analyze the non-equilibrium dynamics of the O(N) Phi^4 model in the large N limit and for states of large energy density. The dynamics is dramatically different when the energy density is above the top of the tree level potential V_0 than when it is below it.When the energy density is below V_0, we find that non-perturbative particle production through spinodal instabilities provides a dynamical mechanism for the Maxwell construction. The asymptotic values of the order parameter only depend on the initial energy density and all values between the minima of the tree level potential are available, the asymptotic dynamical `effective potential' is flat between the minima. When the energy density is larger than V_0, the evolution samples ergodically the broken symmetry states, as a consequence of non-perturbative particle production via parametric amplification. Furthermore, we examine the quantum dynamics of phase ordering into the broken symmetry phase and find novel scaling behavior of the correlation function. There is a crossover in the dynamical correlation length at a time scale t_s \sim \ln(1/lambda). For t < t_s the dynamical correlation length \xi(t) \propto \sqrt{t} and the evolution is dominated by spinodal instabilities, whereas for t>t_s the evolution is non-linear and dominated by the onset of non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensation of long-wavelength Goldstone bosons.In this regime a true scaling solution emerges with a non- perturbative anomalous scaling length dimension z=1/2 and a dynamical correlation length \xi(t) \propto (t-t_s). The equal time correlation function in this scaling regime vanishes for r>2(t-t_s) by causality. For t > t_s the equal time correlation function falls of as 1/r. A semiclassical but stochastic description emerges for time scales t > t_s.
