Title: Quantum Gravity effects near the null black hole singularity
Authors: Alfio Bonanno and Martin Reuter
Abstract: The structure of the Cauchy Horizon singularity of a black hole formed in a generic collapse is studied by means of a renormalization group equation for quantum gravity. It is shown that during the early evolution of the Cauchy Horizon the increase of the mass function is damped when quantum fluctuations of the metric are taken into account.
