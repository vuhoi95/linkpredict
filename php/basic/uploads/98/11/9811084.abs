Title: Domain defects in systems of two real scalar fields
Authors: D. Bazeia and H. Boschi-Filho and F. A. Brito
Abstract: In this work we investigate the role of the symmetry of the Lagrangian on the existence of defects in systems of coupled scalar fields. We focus attention mainly on solutions where defects may nest defects. When space is non-compact we find topological BPS and non-BPS solutions that present internal structure. When space is compact the solutions are nontopological sphalerons, which may be nested inside the topological defects. We address the question of classical stability of these topological and nontopological solutions and investigate how the thermal corrections may modify the classical scenario.
