Title: Finite density and temperature in hybrid bag models
Authors: M. De Francia and H. Falomir and M. Loewe
Abstract: We introduce the chemical potential in a system of two-flavored massless fermions in a chiral bag by imposing boundary conditions in the Euclidean time direction. We express the fermionic mean number in terms of a functional trace involving the Green function of the boundary value problem, which is studied analytically. Numerical evaluations for the fermionic number are presented.
