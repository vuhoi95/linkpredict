Title: Solving Four Dimensional Field Theories with the Dirichlet Fivebrane
Authors: R. de Mello Koch and J. P. Rodrigues
Abstract: The realization of ${\cal N}=2$ four dimensional super Yang-Mills theories in terms of a single Dirichlet fivebrane in type IIB string theory is considered. A classical brane computation reproduces the full quantum low energy effective action. This result has a simple explanation in terms of mirror symmetry.
