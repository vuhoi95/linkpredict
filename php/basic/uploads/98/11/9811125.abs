Title: New approach to summation of field-theoretical series in models with  strong coupling
Authors: A. I. Mudrov and K. B. Varnashev
Abstract: A new approach to summation of divergent field-theoretical series is suggested. It is based on the Borel transformation combined with a conformal mapping and does not imply the knowledge of the exact asymptotic parameters. The method is tested on functions expanded in their asymptotic power series and applied to estimating the ground state energy of simple quantum mechanical problems including anisotropic oscillators and caclulating the critical exponents for certain comformal field models. It can be expected that the new approach to summation may be used to obtaining numerical estimates for important physical quantities represented by divergent series in two- and three-dimensional field models.
