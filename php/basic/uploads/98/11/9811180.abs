Title: D=4, N=1 Supersymmetric Henneaux-Knaepen Models
Authors: Friedemann Brandt and Ulrich Theis
Abstract: We construct N=1 supersymmetric versions of four-dimensional Freedman-Townsend models and generalizations thereof found recently by Henneaux and Knaepen, with couplings between 1-form and 2-form gauge potentials. The models are presented both in a superfield formulation with linearly realized supersymmetry and in WZ gauged component form. In the latter formulation the supersymmetry transformations are nonlinear and do not commute with all the gauge transformations. Among others, our construction yields N=1 counterparts of recently found N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories involving vector-tensor multiplets with gauged central charge.
