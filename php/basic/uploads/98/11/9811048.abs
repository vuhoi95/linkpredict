Title: Dibaryons, Branes, And Strings In AdS Orbifold Models
Authors: Sergei Gukov and Mukund Rangamani and Edward Witten
Abstract: A generalization of the Maldacena conjecture asserts that Type IIB string theory on $\S^5/\Z_3$ is equivalent to a certain supersymmetric $SU(N)^3$ gauge theory with bifundamental matter. To test this assertion, we analyze the wrapped branes on $\S^5/\Z_3$ and their interpretation in terms of gauge theory. The wrapped branes are interpreted in some cases as baryons or dibaryons of the gauge theory and in other cases as strings around which there is a global monodromy. In order to successfully match the brane analysis with field theory, we must uncover some aspects of $S$-duality which are novel even in the case of four-dimensional free field theory.
