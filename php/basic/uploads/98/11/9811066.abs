Title: Consistent Dirac Quantization of SU(2) Skyrmion equivalent to the BFT  Scheme
Authors: Soon-Tae Hong and Yong-Wan Kim and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: In the framework of Dirac quantization, the SU(2) Skyrmion is canonically quantized to yield the modified predictions of the static properties of baryons. We show that the energy spectrum of this Skyrmion obtained by the Dirac method with the suggestion of generalized momenta is consistent with the result of the Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin formalism.
