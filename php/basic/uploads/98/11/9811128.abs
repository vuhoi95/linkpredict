Title: Higher Derivative Terms from Threebranes in F Theory
Authors: Robert de Mello Koch and Radu Tatar
Abstract: The computation of higher derivative corrections to the low energy effective actions of ${\cal N}=2$ gauge theories is considered. In particular, higher derivative corrections are computed for four dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ super Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU(2) and $N_f=4$ hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation. The four derivative terms computed in an approach which realizes the gauge theory as the world volume theory of three branes in F theory are in agreement with the field theory result.
