Title: Holographic Principle and String Cosmology
Authors: Dongsu Bak and Soo-Jong Rey
Abstract: String cosmology is revisited from cosmological viewpoint of holographic principle put forward by `t Hooft, and by Fischler and Susskind. It is shown that the holography requires existence of a `graceful exit' mechanism, which renders the Universe nonsingular by connecting pre- and post-big bang phases smoothly. It is proven that flat Universe is consistent with the holography only if it starts with an absolutely cold and vacuous state. Particle entropy produced during the `graceful exit' apparently saturates the holography bound. Open Universe can always satisfy the holography no matter what initial state of the Universe is.
