Title: Vertex Models with Alternating Spins
Authors: Jin Hong and Seok-Jin Kang and Tetsuji Miwa and Robert Weston
Abstract: The diagonalisation of the transfer matrices of solvable vertex models with alternating spins is given. The crystal structure of (semi-)infinite tensor products of finite-dimensional $U_q(\hat{sl}_2)$ crystals with alternating dimensions is determined. Upon this basis the vertex models are formulated and then solved by means of $U_q(\hat{sl}_2)$ intertwiners.
