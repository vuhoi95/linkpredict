Title: On Sasakian-Einstein Geometry
Authors: Charles P. Boyer and Krzysztof Galicki
Abstract: We discuss Sasakian-Einstein geometry under a quasi-regularity assumption. It is shown that the space of all quasi-regular Sasakian-Einstein orbifolds has a natural multiplication on it. Furthermore, necessary and sufficient conditions are given for the `product' of two Sasakian-Einstein manifolds to be a smooth Sasakian-Einstein manifold. Using spectral sequence arguments we work out the cohomology ring in many cases of interest. This type of geometry has recently become of interest in the physics of supersymmetric conformal field theories.
