Title: Maximally Realistic Causal Quantum Mechanics
Authors: S. M. Roy and Virendra Singh
Abstract: We recently constructed a causal quantum mechanics in 2 dim. phase space which is more realistic than the de Broglie-Bohm mechanics as it reproduces not just the position but also the momentum probability density of ordinary quantum theory. Here we present an even more ambitious construction in 2n dim. phase space. We conjecture that the causal Hamiltonian quantum mechanics presented here is `maximally realistic'. The positive definite phase space density reproduces as marginals the correct quantum probability densities of $n+1$ different complete commuting sets of observables (e.g. $\vec q$, $\vec p$ and $n-1$ other sets). In general the particle velocities do not coincide with the de Broglie-Bohm velocities.
