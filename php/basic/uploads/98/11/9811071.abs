Title: BTZ Black Hole Entropy from Ponzano-Regge Gravity
Authors: V. Suneeta and R. K. Kaul and T. R. Govindarajan
Abstract: The entropy of the BTZ black hole is computed in the Ponzano-Regge formulation of three-dimensional lattice gravity. It is seen that the correct semi-classical behaviour of entropy is reproduced by states that correspond to all possible triangulations of the Euclidean black hole.
