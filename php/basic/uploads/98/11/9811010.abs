Title: N=8 SCFT and M Theory on AdS_4 x RP^7
Authors: Changhyun Ahn and Hoil Kim and Bum-Hoon Lee and Hyun Seok Yang
Abstract: We study M theory on $AdS_4 \times \RP^7$ corresponding to 3 dimensional ${\cal N}=8$ superconformal field theory which is the strong coupling limit of 3 dimensional super Yang-Mills theory. For SU(N) theory, a wrapped M5 brane on $\RP^5$ can be interpreted as baryon vertex. For $SO(N)/Sp(2N)$ theory, by using the property of (co-)homology of $\RP^7$, we classify various wrapping branes and consider domain walls and the baryon vertex.
