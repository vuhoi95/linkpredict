Title: Monopole Inflation in Brans-Dicke Theory
Authors: Nobuyuki Sakai and Jun'ichi Yokoyama and Kei-ichi Maeda
Abstract: According to previous work, topological defects expand exponentially without an end if the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field is of the order of the Planck mass. We extend the study of inflating topological defects to the Brans-Dicke gravity. With the help of numerical simulation we investigate the dynamics and spacetime structure of a global monopole. Contrary to the case of the Einstein gravity, any inflating monopole eventually shrinks and takes a stable configuration. We also discuss cosmological constraints on the model parameters.
