Title: Wess-Zumino actions for IIA D-branes and their supersymmetries
Authors: Machiko Hatsuda and Kiyoshi Kamimura
Abstract: We present Wess-Zumino actions for general IIA D-p-branes in explicit forms. We perform the covariant and irreducible separation of the fermionic constraints of IIA D-p-branes into the first class and the second class. A necessary condition which guarantees this separation is discussed. The generators of the local supersymmetry (kappa symmetry) and the kappa algebra are obtained. We also explicitly calculate the conserved charge of the global supersymmetry (SUSY) and the SUSY algebra which contains topological charges.
