Title: Three Brane Action and The Correspondence Between N=4 Yang Mills Theory  and Anti De Sitter Space
Authors: Sumit R. Das and Sandip P. Trivedi
Abstract: Recently, a relation between N=4 Super Yang Mills in 3+1 dimensions and supergravity in an $AdS_5$ background has been proposed. In this paper we explore the idea that the correspondence between operators in the Yang Mills theory and modes of the supergravity theory can be obtained by using the D3 brane action. Specifically, we consider two form gauge fields for this purpose. The supergravity analysis predicts that the operator which corresponds to this mode has dimension six. We show that this is indeed the leading operator in the three brane Dirac-Born-Infeld and Wess-Zumino action which couples to this mode. It is important in the analysis that the brane action is expanded around the anti de-Sitter background. Also, the Wess-Zumino term plays a crucial role in cancelling a lower dimension operator which appears in the the Dirac-Born-Infeld action.
