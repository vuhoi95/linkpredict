Title: Conformal Field Theory Correlators from Classical Scalar Field Theory on  $AdS_{d+1}$
Authors: Wolfgang Mueck and K. S. Viswanathan
Abstract: We use the correspondence between scalar field theory on $AdS_{d+1}$ and a conformal field theory on $R^d$ to calculate the 3- and 4-point functions of the latter. The classical scalar field theory action is evaluated at tree level.
