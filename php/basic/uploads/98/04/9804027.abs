Title: The Higgs Branch of Impurity Theories
Authors: Anton Kapustin and Savdeep Sethi
Abstract: We consider supersymmetric gauge theories with impurities in various dimensions. These systems arise in the study of intersecting branes. Unlike conventional gauge theories, the Higgs branch of an impurity theory can have compact directions. For models with eight supercharges, the Higgs branch is a hyperKahler manifold given by the moduli space of solutions of certain differential equations. These equations are the dimensional reductions of self-duality equations with boundary conditions determined by the impurities. They can also be interpreted as Nahm transforms of self-duality equations on toroidally compactified spaces. We discuss the application of our results to the light-cone formulation of Yang-Mills theories and to the solution of certain N=2 d=4 gauge theories.
