Title: Statistical Entropy of Calabi-Yau Black Holes
Authors: Mikhail Z. Iofa and Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas
Abstract: We computed the statistical entropy of nonextremal 4D and extremal 5D Calabi-Yau black holes and found exact agreement with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. The computation is based on the fact that the near-horizon geometry of equivalent representations contains as a factor the Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black hole and on subsequent use of Strominger's proposal generalizing the statistical count of microstates of the BTZ black hole due to Carlip.
