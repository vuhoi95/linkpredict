Abstract: Conformal techniques are applied to the calculation of integrals on AdS(d+1) space which define correlators of composite operators in the superconformal field theory on the d-dimensional boundary. The 3-point amplitudes for scalar fields of arbitrary mass and gauge fields in the AdS supergravity are calculated explicitly. For 3 gauge fields we compare in detail with the known conformal structure of the SU(4) flavor current correlator <J_i^a J_j^b J_k^c> of the N=4, d=4 SU(N) SYM theory. Results agree with the free field approximation as would be expected from superconformal non-renormalization theorems. In studying the Ward identity relating <J_i^a O^I O^J> to <O^I O^J> for (non-marginal) scalar composite operators O^I, we find that there is a subtlety in obtaining the normalization of <O^I O^J> from the supergravity action integral.
