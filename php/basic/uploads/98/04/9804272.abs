Title: Arithmetic and the standard electroweak theory
Authors: G. Lopez Castro and J. Pestieau
Abstract: We propose the relations 1/e - e =3 and tan(2theta_W)=3/2, where e is the positron charge and theta_W is the weak angle. Present experimental data support these relations to a very high accuracy. We suggest that some duality relates the weak isospin and hypercharge gauge groups of the standard electroweak theory.
