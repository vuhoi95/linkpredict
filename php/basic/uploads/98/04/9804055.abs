Title: Green-Schwarz type formulation of D=11 S - invariant superstring and  superparticle actions
Authors: A. A. Deriglazov and D. M. Gitman
Abstract: A manifestly Poincare invariant formulations for $SO(1,10)$ and SO(2,9) superstring actions are proposed. The actions are invariant under a local fermionic $\kappa$-symmetry as well as under a number of global symmetries, which turn out to be on-shell realization of the known ``new supersymmetry`` S-algebra. Canonical quantization of the theory is performed and relation of the quantum state spectrum with that of type IIA Green-Schwarz superstring is discussed. Besides, a mechanical model is constructed, which is a zero tension limit of the D=11 superstring and which incorporates all essential features of the latter. A corresponding action invariant under off-shell closed realization of the S-algebra is obtained.
