Title: Integrability and Canonical Structure of d=2, N=16 Supergravity
Authors: H. Nicolai and H. Samtleben
Abstract: The canonical formulation of d=2, N=16 supergravity is presented. We work out the supersymmetry generators (including all higher order spinor terms) and the N=16 superconformal constraint algebra. We then describe the construction of the conserved non-local charges associated with the affine E_9 symmetry of the classical equations of motion. These charges are shown to commute weakly with the supersymmetry constraints, and hence with all other constraints. Under commutation, they close into a quadratic algebra of Yangian type, which is formally the same as that of the bosonic theory. The Lie-Poisson action of E_9 on the classical solutions is exhibited explicitly. Further implications of our results are discussed.
