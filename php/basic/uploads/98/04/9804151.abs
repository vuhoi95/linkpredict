Abstract: We consider N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories in four dimensions with gauge group SU(N) for N larger than two. Using the cubic curve for a matter hypermultiplet transforming in the symmetric representation, obtained from M-theory by Landsteiner and Lopez, we calculate the prepotential up to the one instanton correction. We treat the curve to be approximately hyperelliptic and perform a perturbation expansion for the Seiberg-Witten differential to get the one instanton contribution. We find that it reproduces the correct result for one-loop, and we obtain the prediction for that curve for the one instanton correction term.
