Title: Boundary Critical Phenomena in the Three-State Potts Model
Authors: Ian Affleck and Masaki Oshikawa and Hubert Saleur
Abstract: Boundary critical phenomena are studied in the 3- State Potts model in 2 dimensions using conformal field theory, duality and renormalization group methods. A presumably complete set of boundary conditions is obtained using both fusion and orbifold methods. Besides the previously known free, fixed and mixed boundary conditions a new one is obtained. This illustrates the necessity of considering fusion with operators that don't occur in the bulk spectrum, to obtain all boundary conditions. It is shown that this new boundary condition is dual to the mixed ones. The phase diagram for the quantum chain version of the Potts model is analyzed using duality and renormalization group arguments.
