Title: Multi-Pronged Strings and BPS Saturated Solutions in SU(N)  Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Koji Hashimoto and Hiroyuki Hata and Naoki Sasakura
Abstract: Extending our previous work on SU(3), we construct spherically symmetric BPS saturated regular configurations of N=4 SU(N) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory preserving 1/4 supersymmetry, and investigate their features. We also give exact solutions in the case some of the free parameters of the general solutions take certain values. These field theory BPS states correspond to the string theory BPS states of multi-pronged strings connecting N different D3-branes by regarding the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory as an effective field theory on parallel D3-branes. We compare our solutions with multi-pronged strings in string picture.
