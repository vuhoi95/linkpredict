Title: Light propagation in non-trivial QED vacua
Authors: Walter Dittrich and Holger Gies
Abstract: Within the framework of effective action QED, we derive the light cone condition for homogeneous non-trivial QED vacua in the geometric optics approximation. Our result generalizes the ``unified formula'' suggested by Latorre, Pascual and Tarrach and allows for the calculation of velocity shifts and refractive indices for soft photons travelling through these vacua. Furthermore, we clarify the connection between the light velocity shift and the scale anomaly. This study motivates the introduction of a so-called effective action charge that characterizes the velocity modifying properties of the vacuum. Several applications are given concerning vacuum modifications caused by, e.g., strong fields, Casimir systems and high temperature.
