Title: Computer-aided analysis of Riemann sheet structures
Authors: A. van Hameren and R. Kleiss
Abstract: We report on experience with an investigation of the analytic structure of the solution of certain algebraic complex equations. In particular the behavior of their series expansions around the origin is discussed. The investigation imposes the need for an analysis of the singularities and the Riemann sheets of the solution, in which numerical methods are used.
