Title: Spectrum of Chiral Operators in Strongly Coupled Gauge Theories
Authors: Rami Entin and Jaume Gomis
Abstract: We analyze the large $N$ spectrum of chiral primary operators of three dimensional fixed points of the renormalization group. Using the space-time picture of the fixed points and the correspondence between anti-de Sitter compactifications and conformal field theories we are able to extract the dimensions of operators in short superconformal multiplets. We write down some of these operators in terms of short distance theories flowing to these non-trivial fixed points in the infrared.
