Title: Discrete Space-Time Volume for 3-Dimensional BF Theory and Quantum  Gravity
Authors: Laurent Freidel and Kirill Krasnov
Abstract: The Turaev-Viro state sum invariant is known to give the transition amplitude for the three dimensional BF theory with cosmological term, and its deformation parameter hbar is related with the cosmological constant via hbar=sqrt{Lambda}. This suggests a way to find the expectation value of the spacetime volume by differentiating the Turaev-Viro amplitude with respect to the cosmological constant. Using this idea, we find an explicit expression for the spacetime volume in BF theory. According to our results, each labelled triangulation carries a volume that depends on the labelling spins. This volume is explicitly discrete. We also show how the Turaev-Viro model can be used to obtain the spacetime volume for (2+1) dimensional quantum gravity.
