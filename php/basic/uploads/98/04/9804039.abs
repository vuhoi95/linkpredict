Title: Quantum Geometry and Black Holes
Authors: Abhay Ashtekar and Kirill Krasnov
Abstract: Non-perturbative quantum general relativity provides a possible framework to analyze issues related to black hole thermodynamics from a fundamental perspective. A pedagogical account of the recent developments in this area is given. The emphasis is on the conceptual and structural issues rather than technical subtleties. The article is addressed to post-graduate students and beginning researchers.
