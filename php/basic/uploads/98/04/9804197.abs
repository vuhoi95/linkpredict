Title: 2D Induced Gravity as an Effective WZNW System
Authors: M. Blagojevic and B. Sazdovic
Abstract: We introduced a dynamical system given by a difference of two simple SL(2,R) WZNW actions in 2D, and defined the related gauge theory in a consistent way. It is shown that gauge symmetry can be fixed in such a way that, after integrating out some dynamical variables in the functional integral, one obtains the induced gravity action.
