Title: On the vacuum wavefunction and string tension of Yang-Mills theories in  (2+1) dimensions
Authors: D. Karabali and C. Kim and V. P. Nair
Abstract: We present an analytical continuum calculation, starting from first principles, of the vacuum wavefunction and string tension for pure Yang-Mills theories in $(2+1)$ dimensions, extending our previous analysis using gauge-invariant matrix variables. The vacuum wavefunction is consistent with what is expected at both high and low momentum regimes. The value of the string tension is in very good agreement with recent lattice Monte Carlo evaluations.
