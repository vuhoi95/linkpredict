Title: Numerical Field Theory on the Continuum
Authors: Stephen C. Hahn and G. S. Guralnik
Abstract: An approach to calculating approximate solutions to the continuum Schwinger-Dyson equations is outlined, with examples for \phi^4 in D=1. This approach is based on the source Galerkin methods developed by Garcia, Guralnik and Lawson. Numerical issues and opportunities for future calculations are also discussed briefly.
