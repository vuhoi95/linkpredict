Title: Comments on the Background Field Method in Harmonic Superspace:  Non-holomorphic Corrections in N=4 SYM
Authors: I. L. Buchbinder and S. M. Kuzenko
Abstract: We analyse the one-loop effective action of N=4 SYM theory in the framework of the background field formalism in N=2 harmonic superspace. For the case of on-shell background N=2 vector multiplet we prove that the effective action is free of harmonic singularities. When the lowest N=1 superspace component of the N=2 vector multiplet is switched off, the effective action of N=4 SYM theory is shown to coincide with that obtained by Grisaru et al on the base of the N=1 background field method. We compute the leading non-holomorphic corrections to the N=4 SU(2) SYM effective action.
