Title: Generalized Stochastic Quantization of Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Helmuth Huffel and Gerald Kelnhofer
Abstract: We perform the stochastic quantization of Yang-Mills theory in configuration space and derive the Faddeev-Popov path integral density. Based on a generalization of the stochastic gauge fixing scheme and its geometrical interpretation this result is obtained as the exact equilibrium solution of the associated Fokker--Planck equation. Included in our discussion is the precise range of validity of our approach.
