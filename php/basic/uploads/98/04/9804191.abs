Title: Shape Invariant Natanzon Potentials from Potential Algebra
Authors: Asim Gangopadhyayaa and Jeffry V. Mallow and Uday P. Sukhatme
Abstract: Using the underlying algebraic structures of Natanzon potentials, we discuss conditions that generate shape invariant potentials. In fact, these conditions give all the known shape invariant potentials corresponding to a translational change of parameters. We also find that while the algebra for the general Natanzon potential is $SO(2,2)$, a subgroup $SO(2,1)$ suffices for all the shape invariant problems of Natanzon type.
