Title: On Brane Actions and Superembeddings
Authors: P. S. Howe and O. Raetzel and E. Sezgin
Abstract: Actions for branes, with or without worldsurface gauge fields, are discussed in a unified framework. A simple algorithm is given for constructing the component Green-Schwarz actions. Superspace actions are also discussed. Three examples are given to illustrate the general procedure: the membrane in D=11 and the D2-brane, which both have on-shell worldsurface supermultiplets, and the membrane in D=4, which has an off-shell multiplet.
