Title: Perturbative Expansion around the Gaussian Effective Potential of the  Fermion Field Theory
Authors: Geon Hyoung Lee and Tack Hwi Lee and Jae Hyung Yee
Abstract: We have extended the perturbative expansion method around the Gaussian effective action to the fermionic field theory, by taking the 2-dimensional Gross-Neveu model as an example. We have computed both the zero temperature and the finite temperature effective potentials of the Gross-Neveu model up to the first perturbative correction terms, and have found that the critical temperature, at which dynamically broken symmetry is restored, is significantly improved for small value of the flavour number.
