Title: Virtual photon effects in D=3 Born-Infeld theory
Authors: C. Fosco and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: One loop effects due to virtual gauge field propagation in 2+1 dimensional Born-Infeld theory are investigated. Although this field theory model is not power counting renormalizable, it can be consistently interpreted as an effective field theory. We derive the one-loop effective action in this framework. Halpern's field strength's formulation is then applied to derive an effective description for the interaction between magnetically charged particles, when the gauge field dynamics is determined by a Born-Infeld action. We compare the results with those of the Maxwell theory.
