Title: Quasi-Supersymmetry in Top Sector of the Standard Model
Authors: B. B. Deo and L. P. Singh
Abstract: We show the existence of quasi-supersymmetry as formulated by Nambu in the top-sector of the standard model. We present the explicit form of the quasi-supersymmetric charge. We also deduce,like Nambu, a quasi supersymmetric mass relation which is the same as suggested by Veltman.
