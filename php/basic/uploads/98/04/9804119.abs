Title: Back reaction of vacuum and the renormalization group flow from the  conformal fixed point
Authors: Guido Cognola and Ilya L. Shapiro
Abstract: We consider the GUT-like model with two scalar fields which has infinitesimal deviation from the conformal invariant fixed point at high energy region. In this case the dominating quantum effect is the conformal trace anomaly and the interaction between the anomaly-generated propagating conformal factor of the metric and the usual dimensional scalar field. This interaction leads to the renormalization group flow from the conformal point. In the supersymmetric conformal invariant model such an effect produces a very weak violation of sypersymmetry at lower energies.
