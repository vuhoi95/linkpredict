Title: Reply to comment by Zaslavskii on extremal black hole action
Authors: A. Ghosh and P. Mitra
Abstract: It is shown that Zaslavskii's misunderstanding of our published proof of the irrelevance of all extremal black hole configurations (whether with equal charge and mass or not) rests on his refusal to see the essential difference between the correct inequality governing extremal and non-extremal actions and his incorrect version.
