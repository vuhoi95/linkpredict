Title: Super D-branes revisited
Authors: E. Bergshoeff and P. K. Townsend
Abstract: A version of the kappa-symmetric super D-p-brane action is presented in which the tension is a dynamical variable, equal to the flux of a p-form worldvolume gauge field. The Lagrangian is shown to be invariant under all (super)isometries of the background for appropriate transformations of the worldvolume gauge fields, which determine the central charges in the symmetry algebra. We also present the Hamiltonian form of the action in a general supergravity background.
