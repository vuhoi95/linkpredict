Title: Exact results for non-holomorphic masses in softly broken supersymmetric  gauge theories
Authors: Nima Arkani-Hamed and Riccardo Rattazzi
Abstract: We consider strongly coupled supersymmetric gauge theories softly broken by the addition of gaugino masses $m_\lambda$ and (non-holomorphic) scalar masses $m^2$, taken to be small relative to the dynamical scale $\Lambda$. For theories with a weakly coupled dual description in the infrared, we compute exactly the leading soft masses for the "magnetic" degrees of freedom, with uncalculable corrections suppressed by powers of $(m_{\lambda}/\Lambda), (m/\Lambda)$. The exact relations hold between the infrared fixed point "magnetic" soft masses and the ultraviolet fixed point "electric" soft masses, and correspond to a duality mapping for soft terms. We briefly discuss implications of these results for the vacuum structure of these theories.
