Abstract: Using quasiclassical limit of Baxter's 8 - vertex R - matrix, an elliptic generalization of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation is constructed. Via Off-Shell Bethe ansatz an integrable representation for this equation is obtained. It is shown that there exists a gauge transformation connecting this equation with Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard equation for SU(2)-WZNW model on torus.
