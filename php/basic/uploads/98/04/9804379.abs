Title: Broken conformal invariance and spectrum of anomalous dimensions in QCD
Authors: A. V. Belitsky and D. Mueller
Abstract: Employing the operator algebra of the conformal group and the conformal Ward identities, we derive the constraints for the anomalies of dilatation and special conformal transformations of the local twist-2 operators in Quantum Chromodynamics. We calculate these anomalies in the leading order of perturbation theory in the minimal subtraction scheme. From the conformal consistency relation we derive then the off-diagonal part of the anomalous dimension matrix of the conformally covariant operators in the two-loop approximation of the coupling constant in terms of these quantities. We deduce corresponding off-diagonal parts of the Efremov-Radyushkin-Brodsky-Lepage kernels responsible for the evolution of the exclusive distribution amplitudes and non-forward parton distributions in the next-to-leading order in the flavour singlet channel for the chiral-even parity-odd and -even sectors as well as for the chiral-odd one. We also give the analytical solution of the corresponding evolution equations exploiting the conformal partial wave expansion.
