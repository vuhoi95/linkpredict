Title: The gravitating $σ$ model in 2+1 dimensions: black hole solutions
Authors: G. Clément and A. Fabbri
Abstract: We derive and discuss black-hole solutions to the gravitating O(3) $\sigma$ model in (2+1) dimensions. Three different kinds of static black holes are found. One of these resembles the static BTZ black hole, another is completely free of singularities, and the last type has the same Penrose diagram as the (3+1)-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole. We also construct static and dynamical multi-black hole systems.
