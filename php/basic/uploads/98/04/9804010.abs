Title: Simulation of Supersymmetric Models with a Local Nicolai Map
Authors: Matteo Beccaria and Giuseppe Curci and Erika D'Ambrosio
Abstract: We study the numerical simulation of supersymmetric models having a local Nicolai map. The mapping can be regarded as a stochastic equation and its numerical integration provides an algorithm for the simulation of the original model. In this paper, the method is discussed in details and applied to examples in 0+1 and 1+1 dimensions.
