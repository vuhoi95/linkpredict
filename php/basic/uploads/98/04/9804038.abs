Title: Duality Symmetry in Softly Broken N=2 Gauge Theories
Authors: Marcos Marino and Frederic Zamora
Abstract: We study the soft breaking of N=2 self-dual gauge theories down to N=0 by promoting the coupling constant and hypermultiplet masses to spurions, and we analyze the microscopic duality symmetry in the resulting models. Explicit formulae are given for the Seiberg-Witten periods and couplings in the case of SU(2), and we perform a numerical study of the non-supersymmetric vacuum structure in the case of the mass-deformed N=4 SU(2) gauge theory. Although the softly broken model has a well-defined behavior under the duality symmetry, the stable vacua are in a confining phase. We also extend some of the results to the self-dual theories with classical gauge groups, and we obtain the RG equation for these models.
