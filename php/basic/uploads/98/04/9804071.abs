Title: so(4) Plebanski Action and Relativistic Spin Foam Model
Authors: R. De Pietri and L. Freidel
Abstract: In this note we study the correspondence between the ``relativistic spin foam'' model introduced by Barrett, Crane and Baez and the so(4) Plebanski action. We argue that the $so(4)$ Plebanski model is the continuum analog of the relativistic spin foam model. We prove that the Plebanski action possess four phases, one of which is gravity and outline the discrepancy between this model and the model of Euclidean gravity. We also show that the Plebanski model possess another natural dicretisation and can be associate with another, new, spin foam model that appear to be the $so(4)$ counterpart of the spin foam model describing the self dual formulation of gravity.
