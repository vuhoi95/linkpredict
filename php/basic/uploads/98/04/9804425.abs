Title: First-order nonthermal phase transition after preheating
Authors: S. Khlebnikov and L. Kofman and A. Linde and I. Tkachev
Abstract: During preheating after inflation, parametric resonance rapidly generates very large fluctuations of scalar fields. In models where the inflaton field $\phi$ oscillates in a double-well potential and interacts with another scalar field $X$, fluctuations of X can keep the \phi to -\phi symmetry temporarily restored. If the coupling of \phi to X is much stronger than the inflaton self-coupling, the subsequent symmetry breaking is a first-order phase transition. We demonstrate the existence of this nonthermal phase transition with lattice simulations of the full nonlinear dynamics of the interacting fields. In particular, we observe nucleation of an expanding bubble.
