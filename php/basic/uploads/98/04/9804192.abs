Title: Interaction Energy of `t Hooft-Polyakov Monopoles
Authors: B. Kleihaus and J. Kunz and D. H. Tchrakian
Abstract: The dependence of the energies of axially symmetric monopoles of magnetic charges 2 and 3, on the Higgs self-interaction coupling constant, is studied numerically. Comparing the energy per unit topological charge of the charge-2 monopole with the energy of the spherically symmetric charge-1 monopole, we confirm that there is only a repulsive phase in the interaction energy between like monopoles
