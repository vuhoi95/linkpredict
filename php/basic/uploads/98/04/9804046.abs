Title: On Generalized Super-Coherent States
Authors: M. Daoud and Y. Hassouni and M. Kibler
Abstract: A set of operators, the so-called k-fermion operators, that interpolate between boson and fermion operators are introduced through the consideration of an algebra arising from two non-commuting quon algebras. The deformation parameters q and 1/q for these quon algebras are roots of unity with q to the power k being equal to 1. The case k = 2 corresponds to fermions and the case k going to infinity to bosons. Generalized coherent states (connected to the k-fermionic states) and super-coherent states (involving a k-fermionic sector and a purely bosonic sector) are investigated.
