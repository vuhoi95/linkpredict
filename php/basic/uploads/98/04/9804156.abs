Title: Gauge Symmetries of the Master Action
Authors: M A Grigoriev and A M Semikhatov and I Yu Tipunin
Abstract: We study the geometry of the Lagrangian Batalin--Vilkovisky theory on an antisymplectic manifold. We show that gauge symmetries of the BV-theory are essentially the symmetries of an even symplectic structure on the stationary surface of the master action.
