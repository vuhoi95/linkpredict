Title: Equivariant Sheaves
Authors: A. Knutson and E. Sharpe
Abstract: In this article we review some recent developments in heterotic compactifications. In particular we review an ``inherently toric'' description of certain sheaves, called equivariant sheaves, that has recently been discussed in the physics literature. We outline calculations that can be performed with these objects, and also outline more general phenomena in moduli spaces of sheaves.
