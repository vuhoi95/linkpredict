Title: Orbifolds AdS_7xS^4 and Six Dimensional (0, 1) SCFT
Authors: Changhyun Ahn and Kyungho Oh and Radu Tatar
Abstract: We analyze the relation between the large N limit of 6 dimensional superconformal field theories with eight supercharges and M theory on orbifolds of AdS_7xS^4. We use the known spectrum of Kaluza-Klein harmonics of supergravity on AdS_7xS^4 and we take their orbifold projection to get information about the chiral primary operators of 6 dimensional SCFT which is realized on the worldvolume of M5 brane sitting at the orbifold singularities.
