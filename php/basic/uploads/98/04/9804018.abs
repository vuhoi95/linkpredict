Title: On The Stability of the Compacton Solutions
Authors: Bishwajyoti Dey and Avinash Khare
Abstract: The stability of the recently discovered compacton solutions is studied by means of both linear stability analysis as well as Lyapunov stability criteria. From the results obtained it follows that, unlike solitons, all the allowed compacton solutions are stable, as the stability condition is satisfied for arbitrary values of the nonlinearity parameter. The results are shown to be true even for the higher order nonlinear dispersion equations for compactons. Some new conservation laws for the higher order nonlinear dispersion equations are also presented.
