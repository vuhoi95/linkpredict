Title: Currents and Superpotentials in classical gauge invariant theories I.  Local results with applications to Perfect Fluids and General Relativity
Authors: B. Julia and S. Silva
Abstract: E. Noether's general analysis of conservation laws has to be completed in a Lagrangian theory with local gauge invariance. Bulk charges are replaced by fluxes of superpotentials. Gauge invariant bulk charges may subsist when distinguished one-dimensional subgroups are present. As a first illustration we propose a new {\it Affine action} that reduces to General Relativity upon gauge fixing the dilatation (Weyl 1918 like) part of the connection and elimination of auxiliary fields. It allows a comparison of most gravity superpotentials and we discuss their selection by the choice of boundary conditions. A second and independent application is a geometrical reinterpretation of the convection of vorticity in barotropic nonviscous fluids. We identify the one-dimensional subgroups responsible for the bulk charges and thus propose an impulsive forcing for creating or destroying selectively helicity. This is an example of a new and general Forcing Rule.
