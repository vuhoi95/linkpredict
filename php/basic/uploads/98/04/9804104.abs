Title: Donaldson invariants for nonsimply connected manifolds
Authors: Marcos Marino and Gregory Moore
Abstract: We study Coulomb branch (``u-plane'') integrals for $\CN=2$ supersymmetric $SU(2),SO(3)$ Yang-Mills theory on 4-manifolds $X$ of $b_1(X)>0, b_2^+(X)=1$. Using wall-crossing arguments we derive expressions for the Donaldson invariants for manifolds with $b_1(X)>0, b_2^+(X)>0$. Explicit expressions for $X=\IC P^1 \times F_g$, where $F_g$ is a Riemann surface of genus $g$ are obtained using Kronecker's double series identity. The result might be useful in future studies of quantum cohomology.
