Title: D-instanton partition functions
Authors: Michael B. Green and Michael Gutperle
Abstract: Duality arguments are used to determine D-instanton contributions to certain effective interaction terms of type II supergravity theories in various dimensions. This leads to exact expressions for the partition functions of the finite N D-instanton matrix model in d=4 and 6 dimensions that generalize our previous expression for the case d=10. These results are consistent with the fact that the Witten index of the T-dual D-particle process should only be non-vanishing for d=10.
