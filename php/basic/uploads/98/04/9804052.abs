Title: Lorentz covariant spin two superspaces
Authors: Chandrashekar Devchand and Jean Nuyts
Abstract: Superalgebras including generators having spins up to two and realisable as tangent vector fields on Lorentz covariant generalised superspaces are considered. The latter have a representation content reminiscent of configuration spaces of (super)gravity theories. The most general canonical supercommutation relations for the corresponding phase space coordinates allowed by Lorentz covariance are discussed. By including generators transforming according to every Lorentz representation having spin up to two, we obtain, from the super Jacobi identities, the complete set of quadratic equations for the Lorentz covariant structure constants. These defining equations for spin two Heisenberg superalgebras are highly overdetermined. Nevertheless, non-trivial solutions can indeed be found. By making some simplifying assumptions, we explicitly construct several classes of these superalgebras.
