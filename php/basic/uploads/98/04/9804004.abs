Title: Some Useful Formulas in Nonlinear Sigma Models in (1+2)-Dimensions
Authors: Kazuyuki Fujii and Tatsuo Suzuki
Abstract: We give in this paper some formulas which are useful in the construction of nontrivial conserved currents for submodels of CP^1-model or QP^1-model in (1+2) dimensions. These are full generalization of our results in the previous paper (hep-th/9802105).
