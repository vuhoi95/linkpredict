Title: Calogero-Moser and Toda Systems for Twisted and Untwisted Affine Lie  Algebras
Authors: E. D'Hoker and D. H. Phong
Abstract: The elliptic Calogero-Moser Hamiltonian and Lax pair associated with a general simple Lie algebra $\G$ are shown to scale to the (affine) Toda Hamiltonian and Lax pair. The limit consists in taking the elliptic modulus $\tau$ and the Calogero-Moser couplings $m$ to infinity, while keeping fixed the combination $M = m e^{i \pi \delta \tau}$ for some exponent $\delta$. Critical scaling limits arise when $1/\delta$ equals the Coxeter number or the dual Coxeter number for the untwisted and twisted Calogero-Moser systems respectively; the limit consists then of the Toda system for the affine Lie algebras $\G^{(1)}$ and $(\G ^{(1)})^\vee$. The limits of the untwisted or twisted Calogero-Moser system, for $\delta$ less than these critical values, but non-zero, consists of the ordinary Toda system, while for $\delta =0$, it consists of the trigonometric Calogero-Moser systems for the algebras $\G$ and $\G^\vee$ respectively.
