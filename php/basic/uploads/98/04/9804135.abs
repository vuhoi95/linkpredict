Title: The effect of Wilson line moduli on CP-violation by soft supersymmetry  breaking terms
Authors: D. Bailin and G. V. Kraniotis and A. Love
Abstract: The CP-violating phases in the soft supersymmetry-breaking sector in orbifold compactifications with a continuous Wilson line are investigated. In this case the modular symmetry is the Siegel modular group $Sp(4,Z)$ of genus two. In particular, we study the case that the hidden sector non-perturbative superpotential is determined by the Igusa cusp form ${\cal C}_{12}$ of modular weight 12. The effect of large non-perturbative corrections to the dilaton K\"ahler potential on the resulting CP-violating phases is also investigated.
