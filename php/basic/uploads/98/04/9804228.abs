Title: Adjoint Messengers and Perturbative Unification at the String Scale
Authors: T. Han and T. Yanagida and R. -J. Zhang
Abstract: We consider states in the adjoint representation of the Standard Model gauge group as messengers for mediation of supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking. These new messengers can shift the gauge coupling unification to the string scale at O(5x10^{17} GeV) if their masses are at O(10^{14} GeV). The predicted SUSY mass spectrum at the electroweak scale is significantly different from those in other gauge-mediated or supergravity models, resulting in robust mass relations. The gravitino mass is predicted to be about 1-10 GeV. The heavy messenger sector could provide a superheavy dark matter candidate.
