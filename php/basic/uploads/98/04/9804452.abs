Title: Excited glue and the vibrating flux tube
Authors: Theodore J. Allen and M. G. Olsson and Sinisa Veseli
Abstract: Recent lattice results for the energy of gluonic excitations as a function of quark separation are shown to correspond to transverse relativistic flux tube vibration modes. For large quark separations all states appear to degenerate into a few categories which are predicted uniquely, given the ground state.
