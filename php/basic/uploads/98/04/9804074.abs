Title: Superconformal N=1 Gauge Theories, beta-Function Invariants and their  Behavior under Seiberg Duality
Authors: Andreas Karch and Dieter Lust and George Zoupanos
Abstract: In this paper we discuss some aspects of the behavior of superconformal N=1 models under Seiberg's duality. Our claim is that if an electric gauge theory is superconformal on some marginal subspace of all coupling constants then its magnetic dual must be also superconformal on a corresponding moduli space of dual couplings. However this does not imply that the magnetic dual of a completely finite N=1 gauge theory is again finite. Moreover we generalize this statement conjecturing that also for non-superconformal N=1 models the determinant of the beta-function equations is invariant under Seiberg duality. During the course of this investigation we construct some superconformal N=1 gauge theories which were not yet discussed before.
