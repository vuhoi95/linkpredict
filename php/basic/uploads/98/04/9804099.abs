Title: Conformal Symmetry of Supergravities in AdS spaces
Authors: Renata Kallosh and Antoine Van Proeyen
Abstract: We show that the background field method applied to supergravity in adS space-time provides the path integral for the theory in the bulk with conformal symmetry associated with the isometry of the adS space. This in turn allows to establish the rigid conformal invariance of the generating functional for the supergravity correlators on the boundary.
