Abstract: We establish the exact correspondence of the Calogero-Marchioro-Wolfes model and several of its generalizations with free oscillators. This connection yields the eigenstates and leads to a proof of the quantum integrability. The usefulness of our method for finding new solvable models is then demonstrated by an example.
