Title: Berezinian Construction of Super-Solitons in Supersymmetric Constrained  KP Hierarchies
Authors: H. Aratyn and E. Nissimov and S. Pacheva
Abstract: We consider a broad class of consistently reduced Manin-Radul supersymmetric KP hierarchies (MR-SKP) which are supersymmetric analogs of the ordinary bosonic constrained KP models. Compatibility of these reductions with the MR fermionic isospectral flows is achieved via appropriate modification of the latter preserving their (anti-)commutation algebra. Unlike the general unconstrained MR-SKP case, Darboux-Backlund transformations do preserve the fermionic isospectral flows of the reduced MR-SKP hierarchies. This allows for a systematic derivation of explicit Berezinian solutions for the super-tau-functions (super-solitons) for these models.
