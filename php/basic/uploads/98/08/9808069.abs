Title: Creation and Structure of Baby Universes in Monopole Collisions
Authors: Arvind Borde and Mark Trodden and Tanmay Vachaspati
Abstract: Under certain circumstances, the collision of magnetic monopoles, topologically locked-in regions of false vacuum, leads to topological inflation and the creation of baby universes. The future evolution of initial data represented by the two incoming monopoles may contain a timelike singularity but this need not be the case. We discuss the global structure of the spacetime associated with monopole collisions and also that of topological inflation. We suggest that topological inflation within magnetic monopoles leads to an eternally reproducing universe.
