Title: Anomalous D-brane and orientifold couplings from the boundary state
Authors: Ben Craps and Frederik Roose
Abstract: We compute scattering amplitudes involving both R-R and NS-NS fields in the presence of a D-brane or orientifold plane. These provide direct evidence for the anomalous couplings in the D-brane and orientifold actions. The D9-brane and O9-plane are found to couple to the first Pontrjagin class with the expected relative strength.
