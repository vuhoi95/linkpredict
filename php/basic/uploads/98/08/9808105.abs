Title: Complex Monopoles and Gribov Copies
Authors: Y. Hosotani and K. Saririan and B. Tekin
Abstract: Complex monopole solutions exist in the three dimensional Georgi-Glashow model with the Chern-Simons term. They dominate the path integral and disorder the Higgs vacuum. Gribov copies of the vacuum and monopole configurations are studied in detail.
