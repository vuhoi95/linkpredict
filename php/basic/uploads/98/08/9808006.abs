Title: Comments on 4-point functions in the CFT/AdS correspondence
Authors: Daniel Z. Freedman and Samir D. Mathur and Alec Matusis and Leonardo Rastelli
Abstract: We study the four--point function of chiral primaries corresponding to the dilaton--axion sector in supergravity in the $AdS_5$/CFT$_4$ correspondence. We find relations between some of the supergravity graphs and compute their leading singularities. We discuss the issue of logarithmic singularities and their significance for the OPE structure of the CFT.
