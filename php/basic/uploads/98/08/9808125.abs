Title: Duality for SUxSO and SUxSp via Branes
Authors: E. Lopez and B. Ormsby
Abstract: Using a six-orientifold, fourbranes and four fivebranes in type IIA string theory we construct $\mathcal{N}$=1 supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions with product group $SU(M)\times SO(N)$ or $SU(M)\times Sp(2N)$, a bifundamental flavor and quarks. We obtain the Seiberg dual for these theories and rederive it via branes. To obtain the complete dual group via branes we have to add semi-infinite fourbranes. We propose that the theory derived from branes has a meson deformation switched on. This deformation implies higgsing in the dual theory. The addition of the semi-infinite fourbranes compensates this effect.
