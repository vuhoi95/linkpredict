Title: Two-loop renormalization group restrictions on the standard model and  the fourth chiral family
Authors: Yu. F. Pirogov and O. V. Zenin
Abstract: In the framework of the two-loop renormalization group, the global profile of the Standard Model (SM) in its full parameter space is investigated up to the scale of the gauge singularity. The critical Higgs masses bordering the strong coupling, unstable and the safe regions are explicitly found. Restrictions on the Higgs boson mass as a function of a cutoff scale are obtained from the stability of the electroweak vacuum and from the absence of the strong coupling both in the Higgs and Yukawa sectors. The cutoff being equal to the Plank scale requires the Higgs mass to be M=(161.3+-20.6)+4-10 GeV and M>=140.7+-10 GeV, where the M corridor is the theoretical one and the errors are due to the top mass uncertainty. The SM two-loop beta-functions are generalized to the massive neutrino case. Modification of the two-loop global profile of the SM extended by one new chiral family is studied, and bounds on the masses of the family are found. The requirement of self-consistency of the perturbative SM as an underlying theory up to the Planck or GUT scale excludes the fourth chiral family with the mass up to 250 GeV depending on the Higgs mass and the cutoff scale. Under precision experiment restriction M<=200 GeV, the fourth chiral family, taken alone, is excluded. Nevertheless a pair of the chiral families constituting the vector-like one could still exist.
