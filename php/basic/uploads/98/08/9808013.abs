Title: The universal chiral partition function for exclusion statistics
Authors: A. Berkovich and B. M. McCoy
Abstract: We demonstrate the equality between the universal chiral partition function, which was first found in the context of conformal field theory and Rogers-Ramanujan identities, and the exclusion statistics introduced by Haldane in the study of the fractional quantum Hall effect. The phenomena of multiple representations of the same conformal field theory by different sets of exclusion statistics is discussed in the context of the ${\hat u}(1)$ theory of a compactified boson of radius $R.$
