Title: Frobenius Manifolds And Virasoro Constraints
Authors: Boris Dubrovin and Youjin Zhang
Abstract: For an arbitrary Frobenius manifold a system of Virasoro constraints is constructed. In the semisimple case these constraints are proved to hold true in the genus one approximation. Particularly, the genus $\leq 1$ Virasoro conjecture of T.Eguchi, K.Hori, M.Jinzenji, and C.-S.Xiong and of S.Katz is proved for smooth projective varieties having semisimple quantum cohomology.
