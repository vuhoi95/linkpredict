Title: Magnetic monopole solutions with a massive dilaton
Authors: Peter Forgacs and Jozsef Gyurusi
Abstract: Static, spherically symmetric monopole solutions of a spontaneously broken SU(2) gauge theory coupled to a massive dilaton field are studied in detail in function of the dilaton coupling strength and of the dilaton mass.
