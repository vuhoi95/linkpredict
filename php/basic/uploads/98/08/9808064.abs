Title: Quantization of generally covariant systems with extrinsic time
Authors: Rafael Ferraro and Daniel M. Sforza
Abstract: A generally covariant system can be deparametrized by means of an ``extrinsic'' time, provided that the metric has a conformal ``temporal'' Killing vector and the potential exhibits a suitable behavior with respect to it. The quantization of the system is performed by giving the well ordered constraint operators which satisfy the algebra. The searching of these operators is enlightned by the methods of the BRST formalism.
