Title: On the Renormalizability of Theories with Gauge Anomalies
Authors: Rodolfo Casana and Sebastiao Alves Dias
Abstract: We consider the detailed renormalization of two (1+1)-dimensional gauge theories which are quantized without preserving gauge invariance: the chiral and the "anomalous" Schwinger models. By regularizing the non-perturbative divergences that appear in fermionic Green's functions of both models, we show that the "tree level" photon propagator is ill-defined, thus forcing one to use the complete photon propagator in the loop expansion of these functions. We perform the renormalization of these divergences in both models to one loop level, defining it in a consistent and semi-perturbative sense that we propose in this paper.
