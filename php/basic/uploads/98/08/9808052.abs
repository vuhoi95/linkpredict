Abstract: We construct the supermembrane action in an AdS_4 x S^7 and AdS_7 x S^4 background to all orders in anticommuting coordinates. The result is compared to and agrees completely with results obtained earlier for generic supergravity backgrounds through gauge completion at low orders in \theta.
