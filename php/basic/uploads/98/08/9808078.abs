Title: Renormalization of the Hamiltonian and a geometric interpretation of  asymptotic freedom
Authors: G. Alexanian and E. F. Moreno
Abstract: Using a novel approach to renormalization in the Hamiltonian formalism, we study the connection between asymptotic freedom and the renormalization group flow of the configuration space metric. It is argued that in asymptotically free theories the effective distance between configuration decreases as high momentum modes are integrated out.
