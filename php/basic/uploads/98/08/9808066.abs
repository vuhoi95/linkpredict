Title: Neutrino oscillation in a space-time with torsion
Authors: M. alimohammadi and A. Shariati
Abstract: Using the Einstein-Cartan-Dirac theory, we study the effect of torsion on neutrino oscillation. We see that torsion cannot induce neutrino oscillation, but affects it whenever oscillation exists for other reasons. We show that the torsion effect on neutrino oscillation is as important as the neutrino mass effect, whenever the ratio of neutrino number density to neutrino energy is $\sim 10^{69}$ cm$^{-3}$ /eV, or the number density of the matter is $\sim 10^{69}$ cm$^{-3}$.
