Title: Seiberg-Witten Geometry with Various Matter Contents
Authors: Seiji Terashima and Sung-Kil Yang
Abstract: We obtain the Seiberg-Witten geometry for four-dimensional N=2 gauge theory with gauge group SO(2N_c) (N_c \leq 5) with massive spinor and vector hypermultiplets by considering the gauge symmetry breaking in the N=2 $E_6$ theory with massive fundamental hypermultiplets. In a similar way the Seiberg-Witten geometry is determined for N=2 SU(N_c) (N_c \leq 6) gauge theory with massive antisymmetric and fundamental hypermultiplets. Whenever possible we compare our results expressed in the form of ALE fibrations with those obtained by geometric engineering and brane dynamics, and find a remarkable agreement. We also show that these results are reproduced by using N=1 confining phase superpotentials.
