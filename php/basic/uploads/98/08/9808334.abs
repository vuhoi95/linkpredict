Title: Quantum decoherence effect and neutrino oscillation
Authors: C. P. Sun and D. L. Zhou
Abstract: In the view of the quantum dynamic theory of measurement developed from the Hepp-Colemen (HC) model (K. Hepp, Hev.Phys.Acta, {\bf 45}, 237 (1972)), the quantum decoherence in neutrino flavor oscillation caused by an environment surrounding neutrinos is generally considered in this paper. The Ellis, Hagelin, Nanopoulos and Srednicki (EHNS) mechanism for solving the solar neutrino problem can be comprehended in a framework of the ordinary quantum mechanics. In the weak- coupling limit, a microscopic model is proposed to describe the transition of two neutrino system from a pure state to a mixed state. It gives the modified formula of survival probability of neutrino oscillation with two additional time-dependent parameters. For specified environments, this result shows that the oscillating phenomena of neutrino still exist even without a mass difference in free neutrino.
