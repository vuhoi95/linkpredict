Abstract: The RG expansions for renormalized coupling constants g_6 and g_8 of the 3D n-vector model are calculated in the 4-loop and 3-loop approximations respectively. Resummation of the RG series for g_6 by the Pade-Borel-Leroy technique results in the estimates for its universal critical values g_6^*(n) which are argued to deviate from the exact numbers by less than 0.3%. The RG expansion for g_8 demonstrates stronger divergence being much less suitable for getting reliable numerical estimates.
