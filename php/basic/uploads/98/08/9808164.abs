Title: Off-shell amplitudes for nonoriented closed strings
Authors: L. Cappiello and R. Marotta and R. Pettorino and F. Pezzella
Abstract: In the context of the bosonic closed string theory, by using the operatorial formalism, we give a simple expression of the off-shell amplitude with an arbitrary number of external massless states inserted on the Klein bottle.
