Authors: Cong-xin Liu and Guo-xing Ju and Shi-kun Wang and Ke Wu
Abstract: The symmetries, especially those related to the $R$-transformation, of the reflection equation(RE) for two-component systems are analyzed. The classification of solutions to the RE for eight-, six- and seven-vertex type $R$-matrices is given. All solutions can be obtained from those corresponding to the standard $R$-matrices by $K$-transformation. For the free-Fermion models, the boundary matrices have property $tr K_+(0)=0$, and the free-Fermion type $R$-matrix with the same symmetry as that of Baxter type corresponds to the same form of $K_-$-matrix for the Baxter type. We present the Hamiltonians for the open spin systems connected with our solutions. In particular, the boundary Hamiltonian of seven-vertex models was obtained with a generalization to the Sklyanin's formalism.
