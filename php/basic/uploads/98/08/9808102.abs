Title: Unconstrained Hamiltonian Formulation of SU(2) Gluodynamics
Authors: A. M. Khvedelidze and H. -P. Pavel
Abstract: SU(2) Yang-Mills field theory is considered in the framework of the generalized Hamiltonian approach and the equivalent unconstrained system is obtained using the method of Hamiltonian reduction. A canonical transformation to a set of adapted coordinates is performed in terms of which the Abelianization of the Gauss law constraints reduces to an algebraic operation and the pure gauge degrees of freedom drop out from the Hamiltonian after projection onto the constraint shell. For the remaining gauge invariant fields two representations are introduced where the three fields which transform as scalars under spatial rotations are separated from the three rotational fields. An effective low energy nonlinear sigma model type Lagrangian is derived which out of the six physical fields involves only one of the three scalar fields and two rotational fields summarized in a unit vector. Its possible relation to the effective Lagrangian proposed recently by Faddeev and Niemi is discussed. Finally the unconstrained analog of the well-known nonnormalizable groundstate wave functional which solves the Schr\"odinger equation with zero energy is given and analysed in the strong coupling limit.
