Title: To be or knot to be?
Authors: Richard A. Battye and Paul M. Sutcliffe
Abstract: It has been suggested recently that knots might exist as stable soliton solutions in a simple three-dimensional classical field theory, opening up a wide range of possible applications in physics and beyond. We have re-examined and extended this work in some detail using a combination of analytic approximations and sophisticated numerical algorithms. For charges between one and eight, we find solutions which exhibit a rich and spectacular variety of phenomena, including stable toroidal solitons with twists, linked loops and also knots. The physical process which allows for this variety is the reconnection of string-like segments.
