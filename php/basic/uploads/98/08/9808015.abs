Title: On Function Theory in Quantum Disc: Integral Representations
Authors: D. Shklyarov and S. Sinel'shchikov and L. Vaksman
Abstract: The present work considers one of the simplest homogeneous spaces of the quantum group SU(1,1), the q-analogue of the unit disc in ${\Bbb C}$. We state without proofs q-analogues of Cauchy-Green formulae, integral representations of eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, Green functions for Poisson equation and an inversion formula for Fourier transform. It is also demonstrated that the two-parameter quantization of the disc introduced before by S. Klimec and A. Lesniewski, can be derived via an application of the method of F. Berezin.
