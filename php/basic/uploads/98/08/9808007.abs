Title: Entanglement of projection and a new class of quantum erasers
Authors: Robert Garisto and Lucien Hardy
Abstract: We define a new measurement of entanglement, the entanglement of projection, and find that it is natural to write the entanglements of formation and assistance in terms of it. Our measure allows us to describe a new class of quantum erasers which restore entanglement rather than just interference. Such erasers can be implemented with simple quantum computer components. We propose realistic optical versions of these erasers.
