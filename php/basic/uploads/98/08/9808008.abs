Title: The construction of Frobenius manifolds from KP tau-functions
Authors: J. W. van de Leur and R. Martini
Abstract: Frobenius manifolds (solutions of WDVV equations) in canonical coordinates are determined by the system of Darboux-Egoroff equations. This system of partial differential equations appears as a specific subset of the $n$-component KP hierarchy. KP representation theory and the related Sato infinite Grassmannian are used to construct solutions of this Darboux-Egoroff system and the related Frobenius manifolds. Finally we show that for these solutions Dubrovin's isomonodromy tau-function can be expressed in the KP tau-function.
