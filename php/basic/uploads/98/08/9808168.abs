Title: Absorption and Hawking Radiation of Minimal and Fixed Scalars, and  AdS/CFT correspondence
Authors: Justin R. David and Gautam Mandal and Spenta R. Wadia
Abstract: We present a complete derivation of absorption cross-section and Hawking radiation of minimal and fixed scalars from the Strominger-Vafa model of five-dimensional black hole, starting right from the moduli space of the D1-D5 brane system. We determine the precise coupling of this moduli space to bulk modes by using the AdS/CFT correspondence. Our methods resolve a long-standing problem regarding emission of fixed scalars. We calculate three-point correlators of operators coupling to the minimal scalars from supergravity and from SCFT, and show that both vanish. We make some observations about how the AdS/SYM correspondence implies a close relation between large $N$ equations of motion of $d$-dimensional gauge theory and supergravity equations on $AdS_{d+1}$-type backgrounds. We compare with the explicit nonlocal transform relating 1 and 2 dimensions in the context of $c=1$ matrix model.
