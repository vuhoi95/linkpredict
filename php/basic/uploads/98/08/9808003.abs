Title: From One-Component KP Hierarchy to Two-Component KP Hierarchy and Back
Authors: H. Aratyn and E. Nissimov and S. Pacheva
Abstract: We show that the system of the standard one-component KP hierarchy endowed with a special infinite set of abelian additional symmetries, generated by squared eigenfunction potentials, is equivalent to the two-component KP hierarchy.
