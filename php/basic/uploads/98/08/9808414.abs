Title: Two-loop renormalization group profile of the standard model and a new  generation
Authors: Yu. F. Pirogov and O. V. Zenin
Abstract: The two-loop renormalization group global profile of the Standard Model (SM) in its full parameter space is investigated. Restrictions on the Higgs boson mass as a function of a cutoff scale are obtained from the stability of the electroweak vacuum and from the perturbative validity both in the Higgs and Yukawa sectors. The cutoff equal to the Planck scale requires the Higgs mass to be M=(161.3+-20.6)+4-10 GeV and M>=140.7+-10 GeV, where the M corridor is the theoretical one and the errors are due to the top mass uncertainty. Modification of the two-loop global profile of the SM extended by one new chiral generation is studied, and bounds on the masses of the generation are derived. Under the precision experiment restriction M<=200 GeV, the forth chiral generation, taken alone, is excluded. Nevertheless a pair of the chiral generations constituing the vector-like one could exist.
