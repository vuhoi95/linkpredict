Title: Order Parameters, Free Fermions, and Conservation Laws for  Calogero-Moser Systems
Authors: E. D'Hoker and D. H. Phong
Abstract: The classical order parameters for the $\N=2$ supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theory with matter in the adjoint representation are exhibited explicitly as conservation laws for the elliptic Calogero-Moser system. Central to the construction are certain elliptic function identities, which arise from considering Feynman diagrams in a theory of free fermions with twisted boundary conditions.
