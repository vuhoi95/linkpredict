Title: Supersymmetry of Anti-de Sitter Black Holes
Authors: Marco M. Caldarelli and Dietmar Klemm
Abstract: We examine supersymmetry of four-dimensional asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) dyonic black holes in the context of gauged N=2 supergravity. Our calculations concentrate on black holes with unusual topology and their rotating generalizations, but we also reconsider the spherical rotating dyonic Kerr-Newman-AdS black hole, whose supersymmetry properties have previously been investigated by Kosteleck\'{y} and Perry within another approach. We find that in the case of spherical, toroidal or cylindrical event horizon topology, the black holes must rotate in order to preserve some supersymmetry; the non-rotating supersymmetric configurations representing naked singularities. However, we show that this is no more true for black holes whose event horizons are Riemann surfaces of genus $g>1$, where we find a nonrotating extremal solitonic black hole carrying magnetic charge and permitting one Killing spinor. For the nonrotating supersymmetric configurations of various topologies, all Killing spinors are explicitly constructed.
