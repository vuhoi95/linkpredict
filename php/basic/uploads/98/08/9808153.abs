Title: Bethe Equations "on the Wrong Side of Equator"
Authors: G. P. Pronko and Yu. G. Stroganov
Abstract: We analyse the famous Baxter's $T-Q$ equations for $XXX$ ($XXZ$) spin chain and show that apart from its usual polynomial (trigonometric) solution, which provides the solution of Bethe-Ansatz equations, there exists also the second solution which should corresponds to Bethe-Ansatz beyond $N/2$. This second solution of Baxter's equation plays essential role and together with the first one gives rise to all fusion relations.
