Title: U-Duality Invariance of the Four-dimensional Born-Infeld Theory
Authors: Christiaan Hofman and Erik Verlinde and Gysbert Zwart
Abstract: We calculate the Hamiltonian of a compactified D4-brane, with general fluxes and moduli, and find the BPS-mass. The results are invariant under the complete U-duality SO(5,5,Z).
