Title: BRST Inner Product Spaces and the Gribov Obstruction
Authors: Norbert Duechting and Sergei V. Shabanov and Thomas Strobl
Abstract: A global extension of the Batalin-Marnelius proposal for a BRST inner product to gauge theories with topologically nontrivial gauge orbits is discussed. It is shown that their (appropriately adapted) method is applicable to a large class of mechanical models with a semisimple gauge group in the adjoint and fundamental representation. This includes cases where the Faddeev-Popov method fails. Simple models are found also, however, which do not allow for a well-defined global extension of the Batalin-Marnelius inner product due to a Gribov obstruction. Reasons for the partial success and failure are worked out and possible ways to circumvent the problem are briefly discussed.
