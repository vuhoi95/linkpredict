Title: Moyal Quantization, Holography, and the Quantum Geometry of Surfaces
Authors: George Chapline and Alex Granik
Abstract: An elementary introduction is provided to the phase space quantization method of Moyal and Wigner. We generalize the method so that it applies to 2-dimensional surfaces, where it has an interesting connection with quantum holography. In the case of Riemann surfaces the connection between Moyal quantization and holography provides new insights into the Torelli theorem and the quantization of non-linear integrable models. Quantum holography may also serve as a model for a quantum theory of membranes.
