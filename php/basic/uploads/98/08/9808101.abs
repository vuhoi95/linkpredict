Title: Non-standard embedding and five-branes in heterotic M-Theory
Authors: Andre Lukas and Burt A. Ovrut and Daniel Waldram
Abstract: We construct vacua of M-theory on S^1/Z_2 associated with Calabi-Yau three-folds. These vacua are appropriate for compactification to N=1 supersymmetry theories in both four and five dimensions. We allow for general E_8 x E_8 gauge bundles and for the presence of five-branes. The five-branes span the four-dimensional uncompactified space and are wrapped on holomorphic curves in the Calabi-Yau space. Properties of these vacua, as well as of the resulting low-energy theories, are discussed. We find that the low-energy gauge group is enlarged by gauge fields that originate on the five-brane world-volumes. In addition, the five-branes increase the types of new E_8 x E_8 breaking patterns allowed by the non-standard embedding. Characteristic features of the low-energy theory, such as the threshold corrections to the gauge kinetic functions, are significantly modified due to the presence of the five-branes, as compared to the case of standard or non-standard embeddings without five-branes.
