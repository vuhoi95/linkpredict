Title: Infrared Behaviour of Softly Broken SQCD and Its Dual
Authors: Andreas Karch and Tatsuo Kobayashi and Jisuke Kubo and George Zoupanos
Abstract: Applying the recently obtained results on the renormalization of soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters, we investigate the infrared behaviour of the softly broken supersymmetric QCD as well as its dual theory in the conformal window. Under general assumptions on $\beta$-functions, it is shown that the soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters asymptotically vanish in the infrared limit so that superconformal symmetry in softly broken supersymmetric QCD and in its dual theory revives at the infrared fixed point, provided the soft scalar masses satisfy certain renormalization group invariant relations. If these relations are not satisfied, there exist marginal operators in both theories that lead to the breaking of supersymmetry and also colour symmetry.
