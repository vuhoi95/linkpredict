Title: Vacuum defects without a vacuum
Authors: Inyong Cho and Alexander Vilenkin
Abstract: Topological defects can arise in symmetry breaking models where the scalar field potential $V(\phi)$ has no minima and is a monotonically decreasing function of $|\phi|$. The properties of such vacuumless defects are quite different from those of the ``usual'' strings and monopoles. In some models such defects can serve as seeds for structure formation, or produce an appreciable density of mini-black holes.
