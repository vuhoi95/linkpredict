Title: On Some One-Parameter Families of Three-Body Problems in One Dimension:  Exchange Operator Formalism in Polar Coordinates and Scattering Properties
Authors: Avinash Khare and C. Quesne
Abstract: We apply the exchange operator formalism in polar coordinates to a one-parameter family of three-body problems in one dimension and prove the integrability of the model both with and without the oscillator potential. We also present exact scattering solution of a new family of three-body problems in one dimension.
