Title: Quantum Geometry and Diffusion
Authors: J. Ambjorn and K. N. Anagnostopoulos and T. Ichihara and L. Jensen and Y. Watabiki
Abstract: We study the diffusion equation in two-dimensional quantum gravity, and show that the spectral dimension is two despite the fact that the intrinsic Hausdorff dimension of the ensemble of two-dimensional geometries is very different from two. We determine the scaling properties of the quantum gravity averaged diffusion kernel.
