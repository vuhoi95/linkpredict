Title: Massive-Scalar Effective Actions on Anti-de Sitter Spacetime
Authors: M. Kamela and C. P. Burgess
Abstract: Closed forms are derived for the effective actions for free, massive spinless fields in anti-de Sitter spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions. The results have simple expressions in terms of elementary functions (for odd dimensions) or multiple Gamma functions (for even dimensions). We use these to argue against the quantum validity of a recently-proposed duality relating such theories with differing masses and cosmological constants.
