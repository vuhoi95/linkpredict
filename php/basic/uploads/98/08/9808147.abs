Title: Matter coupling and anomaly cancellation in supersymmetric sigma-models
Authors: S. Groot Nibbelink and J. W. van Holten
Abstract: Generalized matter couplings to four-dimensional supersymmetric sigma models on general Kaehler manifolds are presented, preserving all holomorphic symmetries. Our generalization allows assignment of arbitrary U(1) charges to additional matter fermions, in all representations of (the holomorphic part of) the isometry group. This can be used to eliminate unwanted gamma_5 anomalies, in particular for the U(1) symmetry arising from the complex structure of the target space. A consistent gauging of this isometry group, or any of its subgroups, then becomes possible. When gauged in the presence of a chiral scalar multiplet, the U(1) symmetry is broken spontaneously, generating a mass for the U(1) vector multiplet via the supersymmetric Higgs effect. As an example we discuss the case of the homogeneous coset space E6/SO(10) x U(1).
