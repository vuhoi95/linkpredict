Title: Large N Phases, Gravitational Instantons and the Nuts and Bolts of AdS  Holography
Authors: Andrew Chamblin and Roberto Emparan and Clifford V. Johnson and Robert C. Myers
Abstract: Recent results in the literature concerning holography indicate that the thermodynamics of quantum gravity (at least with a negative cosmological constant) can be modeled by the large N thermodynamics of quantum field theory. We emphasize that this suggests a completely unitary evolution of processes in quantum gravity, including black hole formation and decay; and even more extreme examples involving topology change. As concrete examples which show that this correspondence holds even when the space-time is only locally asymptotically AdS, we compute the thermodynamical phase structure of the AdS-Taub-NUT and AdS-Taub-Bolt spacetimes, and compare them to a 2+1 dimensional conformal field theory (at large N) compactified on a squashed three sphere, and on the twisted plane.
