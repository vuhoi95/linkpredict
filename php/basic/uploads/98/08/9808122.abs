Title: Moduli Stabilization in Heterotic $M$-theory
Authors: Kiwoon Choi and Hang Bae Kim and Hyungdo Kim
Abstract: We examine the stabilization of the two typical moduli, the length $\rho$ of the eleventh segment and the volume $V$ of the internal six manifold, in compactified heterotic $M$-theory. It is shown that, under certain conditions, the phenomenologically favored vacuum expectation values of $\rho$ and $V$ can be obtained by the combined effects of multi-gaugino condensations on the hidden wall and the membrane instantons wrapping the three cycle of the internal six manifold.
