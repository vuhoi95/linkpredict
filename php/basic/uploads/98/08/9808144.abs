Title: Factorization and q-Deformed Algebra of Quantum Anharmonic Oscillator
Authors: Dongsu Bak and Sang Pyo Kim and Sung Ku Kim and Kwang-Sup Soh and Jae Hyung Yee
Abstract: We have studied the underlying algebraic structure of the anharmonic oscillator by using the variational perturbation theory. To the first order of the variational perturbation, the Hamiltonian is found to be factorized into a supersymmetric form in terms of the annihilation and creation operators, which satisfy a q-deformed algebra. This algebraic structure is used to construct all the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian.
