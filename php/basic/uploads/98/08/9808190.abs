Title: M(ysterious) Patterns in SO(9)
Authors: T. Pengpan and P. Ramond
Abstract: The light-cone little group, SO(9), classifies the massless degrees of freedom of eleven-dimensional supergravity, with a triplet of representations. We observe that this triplet generalizes to four-fold infinite families with the quantum numbers of massless higher spin states. Their mathematical structure stems from the three equivalent ways of embedding SO(9) into the exceptional group $F_4$.
