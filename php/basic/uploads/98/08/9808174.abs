Title: Anti-symmetric Tensor Matter Fields and Non-Linear Sigma-Model
Authors: M. G. Negrao and A. Penna-Firme and J. A. Helayel-Neto
Abstract: The equivalence between rank-2 anti-symmetric tensor fields, considered as gauge potentials, and torsionless non-linear $\sigma$-models suggests us to study the possibility of coupling tensorial matter with Yang-Mills fields, through the gauging of the isometries of the target space. We show that this coupling is actually possible; however, the matter appears no longer as an elementary field, but rather as a composite one, expressed in terms of the bosonic degrees of freedom of the $\sigma$-model. A possible phenomenological application is presented that describes the interactions among vector mesons in terms of the geometrical properties of the target manifold. Also, spin-2 meson resonances may naturally be accommodated whenever the $\sigma$-model's target manifold is non-symmetric.
