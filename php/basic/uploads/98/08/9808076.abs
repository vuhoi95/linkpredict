Title: Manifestly covariant action for symmetric Chern-Simons field theory
Authors: Won Tae Kim and Myung Seok Yoon
Abstract: We study a three-dimensional symmetric Chern-Simons field theory with a general covariance and it turns out that the original Chern-Simons theory is just a gauge fixed action of the symmetric Chern-Simons theory whose constraint algebra belongs to fully first class constraint system. The Abelian Chern-Simons theory with matter coupling is studied for the construction of anyon operators without any ordering ambiguity with the help of this symmetric Chern-Simons action. Finally we shall discuss some connections between the present symmetric formulation of Chern-Simons theory and the St\"ukelberg mechanism.
