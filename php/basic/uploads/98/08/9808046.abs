Authors: K. Kaviani and S. Parvizi and A. H. Fatollahi
Abstract: Interactions of relatively rotated Dp-branes in 1, 2, 3 and 4 angles in M(atrix) model are calculated and it is found to be in agreement with string theory calculations. In 4 angles case the agreement is achieved after subtracting the contribution of the single chiral fermionic zero mode.
