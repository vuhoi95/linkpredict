Title: Complex Monopoles in YM + Chern-Simons Theory in 3 Dimensions
Authors: Bayram Tekin and Kamran Saririan and Yutaka Hosotani
Abstract: In this talk, we give a brief discussion of complex monopole solutions in the three dimensional Georgi-Glashow model with a Chern-Simons term. We find that there exist complex monopole solutions of finite action. They dominate the path integral and disorder the Higgs vacuum, but electric charges are not confined. Subtleties in the model and issues related to Gribov copies are also noted.
