Authors: Takuhiro Kitao and Kazutoshi Ohta and Nobuyoshi Ohta
Abstract: We study three-dimensional gauge dynamics by using type IIB superstring brane configurations, which can be obtained from the M-theory configuration of M2-branes stretched between two M5-branes with relative angles. Our construction of brane configurations includes (p,q)5-brane and gives a systematic classification of possible three-dimensional gauge theories. The explicit identification of gauge theories are made and their mirror symmetry is discussed. As a new feature, our theories include interesting Maxwell-Chern-Simons system whose vacuum structure is also examined in detail, obtaining results consistent with the brane picture.
