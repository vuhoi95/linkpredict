Title: Supersymmetry Constraints on Type IIB Supergravity
Authors: Michael B. Green and Savdeep Sethi
Abstract: Supersymmetry is used to derive conditions on higher derivative terms in the effective action of type IIB supergravity. Using these conditions, we are able to prove earlier conjectures that certain modular invariant interactions of order alpha' **3 relative to the Einstein-Hilbert term are proportional to eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator on the fundamental domain of SL(2,Z). We also discuss how these arguments generalize to terms of higher order in alpha', as well as to compactifications of supergravity.
