Title: Simplifying superstring action on AdS_5 x S^5
Authors: R. Kallosh and A. A. Tseytlin
Abstract: Type IIB string action on AdS_5 x S^5 constructed in hep-th/9805028 is put into a form where it becomes quadratic in fermions. This is achieved by performing 2-d duality (T-duality) on the action in which kappa-symmetry was fixed in the Killing gauge in hep-th/9808038. We discuss some properties and possible applications of the resulting action.
