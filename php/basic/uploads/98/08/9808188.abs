Title: Equations of Motion and Galilei Invariance in D-Particle Dynamics
Authors: Yuji Okawa and Tamiaki Yoneya
Abstract: As a continuation of our previous work on the multi-body forces of D-particles in supergravity and Matrix theory, we investigate the problem of motion. We show that the scattering of D-particles including recoil derived in Matrix theory is precisely reproduced by supergravity with the discrete light-cone prescription up to the second order in 11 dimensional Newton constant. An intimate connection of recoil and Galilei invariance in supergravity is pointed out and elucidated.
