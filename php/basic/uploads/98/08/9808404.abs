Title: General Relativistic effects in preheating
Authors: Bruce A. Bassett and David I. Kaiser and Roy Maartens
Abstract: General relativistic effects in the form of metric perturbations are usually neglected in the preheating era that follows inflation. We argue that in realistic multi-field models these effects are in fact crucial, and the fully coupled system of metric and quantum field fluctuations needs to be considered. Metric perturbations are resonantly amplified, breaking the scale-invariance of the primordial spectrum, and in turn stimulate scalar field resonances via gravitational rescattering. This non-gravitationally dominated nonlinear growth of gravitational fluctuations may have significant effects on the Doppler peaks in the cosmic background radiation, primordial black hole formation, gravitational waves and nonthermal symmetry restoration.
