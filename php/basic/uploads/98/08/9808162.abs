Title: 3-Point Functions in N=4 Yang-Mills
Authors: P. S. Howe and E. Sokatchev and P. C. West
Abstract: Three-point functions of analytic (chiral primary) operators in N=4 Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions are calculated using the harmonic superspace formulation of this theory. In the case of the energy-momentum tensor multiplet anomaly considerations determine the coefficient. Analyticity in N=2 harmonic superspace is explicitly checked in a two-loop calculation.
