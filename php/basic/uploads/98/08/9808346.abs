Title: Critical Behaviour of a Homogeneous Bose Gas at Finite Temperature
Authors: Jens O. Andersen and Michael Strickland
Abstract: A homogeneous non-relativistic Bose gas is investigated at finite temperature using renormalization group methods. The phase transition is shown to be second order and the effective chemical potential and the effective quartic coupling vanish at the critical temperature. We obtain the critical exponent $\nu =0.73$ at leading order in the derivative expansion.
