Title: Hamiltonian Reduction of SU(2) Yang-Mills Field Theory
Authors: A. M. Khvedelidze and H. -P. Pavel
Abstract: The unconstrained system equivalent to SU(2) Yang-Mills field theory is obtained in the framework of the generalized Hamiltonian formalism using the method of Hamiltonian reduction. The reduced system is expressed in terms of fields which transform as spin zero and spin two under spatial rotations.
