Title: SO(2N) (0,2) SCFT and M Theory on $AdS_7 \times {RP}^4$
Authors: Changhyun Ahn and Hoil Kim and Hyun Seok Yang
Abstract: We study M theory on $AdS_7 \times \RP^4$ corresponding to 6 dimensional SO(2N) $(0, 2)$ superconformal field theory on a circle which becomes 5 dimensional super Yang-Mills theory at low energies. For SU(N) (0,2) theory, a wrapped D4 brane on $\S^4$ which is connected to a D4 brane on the boundary of $AdS_7$ by N fundamental strings can be interpreted as baryon vertex. For SO(2N) (0,2) theory, by using the property of homology of $\RP^4$, we classify various wrapping branes. Then we consider particles, strings, twobranes, domain walls and the baryon vertex in Type IIA string theory.
