Title: Dual Actions for Chiral Bosons
Authors: Alexey Maznytsia and Christian R. Preitschopf and Dmitri Sorokin
Abstract: We study duality properties of actions for chiral boson fields in various space-time dimensions using D=2 and D=6 cases as examples. As a result we get dual covariant formulations of chiral bosons.
