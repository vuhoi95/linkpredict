Title: Some Aspects of Generalized Contact Interaction in One-Dimensional  Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Taksu Cheon and T. Shigehara
Abstract: We construct a one-dimensional contact interaction ($\epsilon$ potential) which induces the discontinuity of the wave function while keeping its derivative continuous. By combining the $\epsilon$ potential and the Dirac's $\delta$ function, we construct most general one-dimensional contact interactions allowable under the time reversal symmetry. We present some elementary results for the scattering problem which suggest a dual relation between $\delta$ and $\epsilon$ potentials.
