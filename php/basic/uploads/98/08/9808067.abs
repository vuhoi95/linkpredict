Title: Finite VEVs from a Large Distance Vacuum Wave Functional
Authors: A. Jaramillo and P. Mansfield
Abstract: We show how to compute vacuum expectation values from derivative expansions of the vacuum wave functional. Such expansions appear to be valid only for slowly varying fields, but by exploiting analyticity in a complex scale parameter we can reconstruct the contribution from rapidly varying fields.
