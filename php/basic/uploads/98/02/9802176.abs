Title: Non-Abelian Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz String Theory
Authors: Hyun Seok Yang and Inbo Kim and Bum-Hoon Lee
Abstract: We construct a locally supersymmetric worldsheet formulation of a non-Abelian Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz (NARNS) string theory where the string coordinates are noncommuting matrices in a group U(N). This is described by the two dimensional supergravity coupled to supersymmetric Yang-Mills fields and adjoint matters in the gauge group U(N). We show that our NARNS string theory has a free string limit where it becomes N-copies of usual RNS string which can be described by the orbifold conformal field theory corresponding to the covariant worldsheet version of the Matrix string theory of Dijkgraaf, Verlinde and Verlinde. In the weak coupling limit, i.e. $g_s \to 0$ where $g_s$ is the coupling constant of our theory related with the Yang-Mills coupling as $g_{YM}^{-2}=\alpha' g_s^2$, a new additional dimension appears in the string spectrum and it can be speculatively interpreted as the compactified eleven dimensional coordinate whose dynamics is given by an orbifold O(N) sigma model.
