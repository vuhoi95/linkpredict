Title: On brane solutions in M(atrix) theory
Authors: V. P. Nair and S. Randjbar-Daemi
Abstract: In this paper we consider brane solutions of the form $G/H$ in M(atrix) theory, showing the emergence of world volume coordinates for the cases where $G=SU(N)$. We examine a particular solution with a world volume geometry of the form ${\bf CP}^2 \times S^1$ in some detail and show how a smooth manifold structure emerges in the large $N$ limit. In this limit the solution becomes static; it is not supersymmetric but is part of a supersymmetric set of configurations. Supersymmetry in small locally flat regions can be obtained, but this is not globally defined. A general group theoretic analysis of the previously known spherical membrane solutions is also given.
