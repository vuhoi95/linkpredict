Title: Particle Creation in the Marginally Bound, Self Similar Collapse of  Inhomogeneous Dust
Authors: S. Barve and T. P. Singh and Cenalo Vaz and Louis Witten
Abstract: We consider the evaporation of the (shell focusing) naked singularity formed during the self-similar collapse of a marginally bound inhomogeneous dust cloud, in the geometric optics approximation. We show that, neglecting the back reaction of the spacetime, the radiation on $\scrip$ tends to infinity as the Cauchy Horizon is approached. Two consequences can be expected from this result: (a) that the back reaction of spacetime will be large and eventually halt the formation of a naked singularity thus preserving the Cosmic Censorship Hypothesis and (b) matter attempting to collapse into a naked singularity will radiate away energy at an intense rate, thereby possibly providing experimental signatures of quantum effects in curved spacetimes.
