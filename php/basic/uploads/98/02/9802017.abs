Title: Higgs Lagrangian from Gauge Theories
Authors: N. Kitazawa and F. Sannino
Abstract: We explore a novel way of deriving the effective Higgs Lagrangian from strongly interacting vector-like gauge theories. We consider the N=1 supersymmetric extension of gauge theories and interpret the auxiliary field associated with the low energy effective "meson" superfield as the Higgs field. By introducing an explicit supersymmetry breaking term and computing the one-loop effective action at the effective theory level we show that the kinetic term for the Higgs field is generated, while the negative mass squared term is already present at the tree level. We further propose a scenario by which the complete Higgs potential can be generated and the fermion in the low energy effective theory acquires a mass.
