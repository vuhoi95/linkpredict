Title: Chiral Solitons in Generalized Korteweg-de Vries Equations
Authors: D. Bazeia and F. Moraes
Abstract: Generalizations of the Korteweg-de Vries equation are considered, and some explicit solutions are presented. There are situations where solutions engender the interesting property of being chiral, that is, of having velocity determined in terms of the parameters that define the generalized equation, with a definite sign.
