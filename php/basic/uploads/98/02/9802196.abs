Title: Wilson Renormalization Group for Supersymmetric Gauge Theories and Gauge  Anomalies
Authors: M. Bonini and F. Vian
Abstract: We extend the Wilson renormalization group (RG) to supersymmetric theories. As this regularization scheme preserves supersymmetry, we exploit the superspace technique. To set up the formalism we first derive the RG flow for the massless Wess-Zumino model and deduce its perturbative expansion. We then consider N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills and show that the local gauge symmetry -broken by the regularization- can be recovered by a suitable choice of the RG flow boundary conditions. We restrict our analysis to the first loop, the generalization to higher loops presenting no difficulty due to the iterative nature of the procedure. Furthermore, adding matter fields, we reproduce the one-loop supersymmetric chiral anomaly to the second order in the vector field.
