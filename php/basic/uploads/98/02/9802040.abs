Title: Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory Solutions of Two Dimensional  Magnetohydrodynamics
Authors: Spyros Skoulakis and Steven Thomas
Abstract: We consider the application of logarithmic conformal field theory in finding solutions to the turbulent phases of 2-dimensional models of magnetohydrodynamics. These arise upon dimensional reduction of standard (infinite conductivity) 3-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics, after taking various simplifying limits. We show that solutions of the corresponding Hopf equations and higher order integrals of motion can be found within the solutions of ordinary turbulence proposed by Flohr, based on the tensor product of the logarithmic extension ${\tilde c}_{6,1} $ of the non-unitary minimal model $c_{6,1} $. This possibility arises because of the existence of a continuous hidden symmetry present in the latter models, and the fact that there appear several distinct dimension -1 and -2 primary fields.
