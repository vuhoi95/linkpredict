Title: Quantum Number Fractionalization in Antiferromagnets
Authors: R. B. Laughlin and D. Giuliano and R. Caracciolo and O. White
Abstract: This is a pedagogical introduction to the mathematics of 1-dimensional spin-1/2 antiferromagnets. Topics covered include the Haldane-Shastry Hamiltonian, vector ``supercharges'', conserved spin currents, spinons, the supersymmetric Kuramoto-Yokoyama Hamiltonian, and holons.
