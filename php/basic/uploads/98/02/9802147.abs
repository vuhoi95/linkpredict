Abstract: We consider the problem of extremizing the tension for BPS strings in D=6 supergravities with different number of supersymmetries. General formulae for fixed scalars and a discussion of degenerate directions is given. Quantized moduli, according to recent analysis, are supposed to be related to conformal field theories which are the boundary of three dimensional anti-de Sitter space time.
