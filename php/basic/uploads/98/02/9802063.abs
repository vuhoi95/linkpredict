Title: Gravitational Duality in MacDowell-Mansouri Gauge Theory
Authors: H. Garcia-Compean and O. Obregon and C. Ramirez
Abstract: Strong-weak duality invariance can only be defined for particular sectors of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. Nevertheless, for full non-Abelian non-supersymmetric theories, dual theories with inverted couplings, have been found. We show that an analogous procedure allows to find the dual action to the gauge theory of gravity constructed by the MacDowell-Mansouri model plus the superposition of a $\Theta$ term.
