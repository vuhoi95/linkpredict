Title: Extension of sine-Gordon field theory from generalized Clifford algebras
Authors: P. Baseilhac and P. Grang√© and M. Rausch de Traubenberg
Abstract: Linearization of homogeneous polynomials of degree n and k variables leads to generalized Clifford algebras. Multicomplex numbers are then introduced in analogy to complex numbers with respect to usual Clifford algebra. In turn multicomplex extensions of trigonometric functions are constructed in terms of `compact' and `non-compact' variables. It gives rise to the natural extension of the d-dimensional sine-Gordon field theory in the n-dimensional multicomplex space. In dimension 2, the cases n=1,2,3,4 are identified as the quantum integrable Liouville, sine-Gordon and known deformed Toda models. The general case is discussed.
