Title: Novel classical ground state of a many body system in arbitrary  dimensions
Authors: G. Date and Pijush K. Ghosh and M. V. N. Murthy
Abstract: The classical ground state of a D- dimensional many body system with two and three body interactions is studied as a function of the strength of the three body interaction. We prove exactly that beyond a critical strength of the three body interaction, the classical ground state of the system is one in which all the particles are on a line. The positions of the particles in this string configuration are uniquely determined by the zeros of the Hermite polynomials.
