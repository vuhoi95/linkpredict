Title: Polyakov Loop Dynamics in the Center Symmetric Phase
Authors: F. Lenz and M. Thies
Abstract: A study of the center symmetric phase of SU(2) Yang Mills theory is presented. Realization of the center symmetry is shown to result from non-perturbative gauge fixing. Dictated by the center symmetry, this phase exhibits already at the perturbative level confinement like properties. The analysis is performed by investigating the dynamics of the Polyakov loops. The ultralocality of these degrees of freedom implies significant changes in the vacuum structure of the theory. General properties of the confined phase and of the transition to the deconfined phase are discussed. Perturbation theory built upon the vacuum of ultralocal Polyakov loops is presented and used to calculate, via the Polyakov loop correlator, the static quark-antiquark potential.
