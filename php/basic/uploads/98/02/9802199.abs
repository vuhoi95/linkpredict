Title: The Massive Kaluza-Klein Monopole
Authors: Eric Bergshoeff and Eduardo Eyras and Yolanda Lozano
Abstract: We construct the (bosonic) effective worldvolume action of an M-theory Kaluza-Klein monopole in a background given by the bosonic sector of eleven-dimensional massive supergravity, i.e. a "massive Kaluza-Klein monopole". As a consistency check we show that the direct dimensional reduction along the isometry direction of the Taub-NUT space leads to the massive D-6-brane. We furthermore perform a double dimensional reduction in the massless case and obtain the effective worldvolume action of a type IIA Kaluza-Klein monopole.
