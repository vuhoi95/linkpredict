Title: Induced Angular Momentum in (2+1)-Dimensional Spinor Electrodynamics in  Curved Space
Authors: Yu. A. Sitenko and D. G. Rakityansky
Abstract: Effects due to fermion-vacuum polarization by an external static magnetic field are considered in a two-dimensional noncompact curved space with a nontrivial topology. An expression for the vacuun angular momentum is obtained. Like the vacuum fermion number, it proves to be dependent on the global characteristics of the field and space.
