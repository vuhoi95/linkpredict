Title: The Supercurrent Trace Identities of the N=1, D=4 Super-Yang-Mills  Theory in the Wess-Zumino Gauge
Authors: Olivier Piguet and Sylvain Wolf
Abstract: The supercurrent components of the N=1, D=4 Super-Yang-Mills theory in the Wess-Zumino gauge are coupled to the components of a background supergravitation field in the ``new minimal'' representation, in order to describe the various conservation laws in a functional way through the Ward identities for the diffeomorphisms and for the local supersymmetry, Lorentz and R-transformations. We also incorporate in the same functional formalism the supertrace identities, which leads however to a slight modification of the new minimal representation for supergravity, thus leading to a conformal version of it. The most general classical action obeying all the symmetry constraints is constructed.
