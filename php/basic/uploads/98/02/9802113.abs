Title: Effective Average Action in N=1 Super-Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: S. Falkenberg and B. Geyer
Abstract: For N=1 Super-Yang-Mills theory we generalize the effective average action Gamma_k in a manifest supersymmetric way using the superspace formalism. The exact evolution equation for Gamma_k is derived and, introducing as an application a simple truncation, the standard one-loop beta-function of N=1 SYM theory is obtained.
