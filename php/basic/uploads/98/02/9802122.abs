Title: Solutions of the Modified Chiral Model in (2+1) Dimensions
Authors: Theodora Ioannidou and Wojtek Zakrzewski
Abstract: This paper deals with classical solutions of the modified chiral model on $R^{2+1}$. Such solutions are shown to correspond to products of various factor which we call time-dependent unitons. Then the problem of solving the system of second-order partial differential equations for the chiral field is reduced to solving a sequence of systems of first-order partial differential equations for the unitons.
