Title: Matrix Model for Dirichlet Open String
Authors: K. Ezawa and Y. Matsuo and K. Murakami
Abstract: We discuss the open string ending on D $p$-branes in IKKT framework. First we determine the boundary conditions of Green-Schwarz superstring which are consistent with supersymmetry and $\kappa$-symmetry. We point out some subtleties arising from taking the Schild gauge and show that in this gauge the system incorporates the limited dimensional D $p$-branes ($p=3,7$). The matrix regularization for the Dirichlet open string is given by gauge group SO(N). When $p=3$, the matrix model becomes the dimensional reduction of a 6 dimensional ${\cal N}=1$ super Yang-Mills theory.
