Title: Bottom-up approach to B-parameter in minimal supersymmetric standard  model
Authors: Yoshiharu Kawamura and Tatsuo Kobayashi and Manabu Watanabe
Abstract: We study $\mu$ and $B$-parameters in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) based on the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking scenario using $\lq\lq$bottom-up" approach and show how useful our approach is to select a phenomenologically viable model beyond the MSSM under the assumption that the underlying theory is a string model or a gauge-Yukawa unified gauge model.
