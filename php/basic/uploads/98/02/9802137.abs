Title: Breathers in the weakly coupled topological discrete sine-Gordon system
Authors: M. Haskins and J. M. Speight
Abstract: Existence of breather (spatially localized, time periodic, oscillatory) solutions of the topological discrete sine-Gordon (TDSG) system, in the regime of weak coupling, is proved. The novelty of this result is that, unlike the systems previously considered in studies of discrete breathers, the TDSG system does not decouple into independent oscillator units in the weak coupling limit. The results of a systematic numerical study of these breathers are presented, including breather initial profiles and a portrait of their domain of existence in the frequency-coupling parameter space. It is found that the breathers are uniformly qualitatively different from those found in conventional spatially discrete systems.
