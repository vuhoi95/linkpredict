Title: "Integrating in" and Effective Lagrangian for Non-Supersymmetric  Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Igor Halperin and Ariel Zhitnitsky
Abstract: Recently a non-supersymmetric analog of Veneziano-Yankielowicz (VY) effective Lagrangian has been proposed and applied for the analysis of the theta dependence in pure Yang-Mills theory. This effective Lagrangian is similar in many respects to the VY construction and, in particular, exhibits a kind of low energy holomorphy which is absent in the full YM theory. Here we incorporate a heavy fermion into this effective theory by using the "integrating in" technique. We find that, in terms of this extended theory, holomorphy of the effective Lagrangian for pure YM theory naturally implies a holomorphic dependence on the heavy fermion mass. It is shown that this analysis fixes, under certain assumptions, a dimensionless parameter which enters the effective Lagrangian and determines the number of nondegenerate vacuum sectors in pure YM theory. We also compare our results for the vacuum structure and theta dependence to those obtained recently by Witten on the basis of AdS/CFT correspondence.
