Title: A Signature of Inflation from Dynamical Supersymmetry Breaking
Authors: William H. Kinney and Antonio Riotto
Abstract: In models of cosmological inflation motivated by dynamical supersymmetry breaking, the potential driving inflation may be characterized by inverse powers of a scalar field. These models produce observables similar to those typical of the hybrid inflation scenario: negligible production of tensor (gravitational wave) modes, and a blue scalar spectral index. In this short note, we show that, unlike standard hybrid inflation models, dynamical supersymmetric inflation (DSI) predicts a measurable deviation from a power-law spectrum of fluctuations, with a variation in the scalar spectral index $|dn / d(\ln k)|$ may be as large as 0.05. DSI can be observationally distinguished from other hybrid models with cosmic microwave background measurements of the planned sensitivity of the ESA's Planck Surveyor.
