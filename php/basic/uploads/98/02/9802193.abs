Title: New N=1 Supersymmetric 3-dimensional Superstring Vacua from U-manifolds
Authors: G. Curio and D. Lust
Abstract: Making use of non-perturbative U-duality symmetries of type II strings we construct new `superstring' vacua in three dimensions with N=1 supersymmetry. This has an interpretation as compactifying formally from 13 dimensions (S-theory) on Calabi-Yau 5-folds possessing a $T^3 \x T^2$ fibration. We describe some part of the massless multiplets, given by the Hodge spectrum, and point to a corresponding 5-brane configuration.
