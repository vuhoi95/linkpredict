Abstract: We consider pure Yang Mills theory on the four torus. A set of non-Abelian transition functions is presented which encompass all instanton sectors. It is argued that these transition functions are a convenient starting point for gauge fixing. In particular, we give an extended Abelian projection with respect to the Polyakov loop, where $A_0$ is independent of time and in the Cartan subalgebra. In the non-perturbative sectors such gauge fixings are necessarily singular. These singularities can be restricted to Dirac strings joining monopole and anti-monopole like ``defects''.
