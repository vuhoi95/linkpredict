Title: Ward-Takahashi Identity and Dynamical Mass Generation in Abelian Gauge  Theories
Authors: Kun Shen and Yu-Ping Kuang
Abstract: We derive Ward-Takahashi identities including composite fields in Abelian gauge theories and the matching condition between the elementary field description and the composite field description. With these we develop an approach to dynamical symmetry breaking in Abelian gauge theories including the study of the dynamically generated masses of the gauge boson, the fermions and the composite Higgs field. The Cornwall-Norton, Jackiw-Johnson and Schwinger models are taken as examples of the application. The obtained gauge boson masses are in agreement with the existing results. In this appraoch, we are able to further obtain new results for the mass of the composite Higgs boson and the goldstone boson decay constant.
