Title: QCD in the Infrared with Exact Angular Integrations
Authors: D. Atkinson and J. C. R. Bloch
Abstract: In a previous paper we have shown that in quantum chromodynamics the gluon propagator vanishes in the infrared limit, while the ghost propagator is more singular than a simple pole. These results were obtained after angular averaging, but in the current paper we go beyond this approximation and perform an exact calculation of the angular integrals. The powers of the infrared behaviour of the propagators are changed substantially. We find the very intriguing result that the gluon propagator vanishes in the infrared exactly like p^2, whilst the ghost propagator is exactly as singular as 1/p^4. We also find that the value of the infrared fixed point of the QCD coupling is much decreased from the y-max estimate: it is now equal to 4\pi/3.
