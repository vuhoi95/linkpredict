Title: Numerical Study of the Double Scaling Limit in Two-Dimensional Large N  Reduced Model
Authors: Takayuki Nakajima and Jun Nishimura
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional Eguchi-Kawai model as a toy model of the IIB matrix model, which has been recently proposed as a nonperturbative definition of the type IIB superstring theory. While the planar limit of the model is known to reproduce the two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory, we find through Monte Carlo simulation that the model allows a different large N limit, which can be considered as the double scaling limit in matrix models.
