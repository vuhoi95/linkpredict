Title: Study of Wilson loop functionals in 2D Yang-Mills theories
Authors: J. M. Aroca and Yu. A. Kubyshin
Abstract: The derivation of the explicit formula for the vacuum expectation value of the Wilson loop functional for an arbitrary gauge group on an arbitrary orientable two-dimensional manifold is considered both in the continuum case and on the lattice. A contribution to this quantity, coming from the space of invariant connections, is also analyzed and is shown to be similar to the contribution of monopoles.
