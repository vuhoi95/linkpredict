Title: Non-Abelian Bosonization and Haldane's Conjecture
Authors: D. C. Cabra and P. Pujol and C. von Reichenbach
Abstract: We study the long wavelength limit of a spin S Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain. The fermionic Lagrangian obtained corresponds to a perturbed level 2S SU(2) Wess-Zumino-Witten model. This effective theory is then mapped into a compact U(1) boson interacting with Z_{2S} parafermions. The analysis of this effective theory allows us to show that when S is an integer there is a mass gap to all excitations, whereas this gap vanishes in the half-odd-integer spin case. This gives a field theory treatment of the so-called Haldane's conjecture for arbitrary values of the spin S.
