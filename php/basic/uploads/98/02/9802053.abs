Title: Scale Factor Dualities in Anisotropic Cosmologies
Authors: Dominic Clancy and James E. Lidsey and Reza Tavakol
Abstract: The concept of scale factor duality is considered within the context of the spatially homogeneous, vacuum Brans-Dicke cosmologies. In the Bianchi class A, it is found that duality symmetries exist for the types I, II, VI_0, VII_0, but not for types VIII and IX. The Kantowski-Sachs and locally rotationally symmetric Bianchi type III models also exhibit a scale factor duality, but no such symmetries are found for the Bianchi type V. In this way anisotropy and spatial curvature may have important effects on the nature of such dualities.
