Title: A topological mechanism of discretization for the electric charge
Authors: A. F. Ranada and J. L. Trueba
Abstract: We present a topological mechanism of discretization, which gives for the fundamental electric charge a value equal to the square root of the Planck constant times the velocity of light, which is about 3.3 times the electron charge. Its basis is the following recently proved property of the standard linear classical Maxwell equations: they can be obtained by change of variables from an underlying topological theory, using two complex scalar fields, the level curves of which coincide with the magnetic and the electric lines, respectively.
