Abstract: Superfield equations of motion for D=10 type IIB Dirichlet super-9-brane are obtained from the generalized action principle. The geometric equations containing fermionic superembedding equations and constraints on the generalized field strength of Abelian gauge field are separated from the proper dynamical equations and are found to contain these dynamical equations among their consequences. The set of superfield equations thus obtained involves a Spin(1,9) group valued superfield $h_\a^{~\b}$ whose leading component appears in the recently obtained simplified expression for the kappa-symmetry projector of the D9-brane. The Cayley image of this superfield coincides (on the mass shell) with the field strength tensor of the world volume gauge field characteristic for the Dirichlet brane. The superfield description of the super-9-brane obtained in this manner is known to be, on the one hand, the nonlinear (Born-Infeld) generalization of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and, on the other hand, the theory of partial spontaneous breaking of D=10, N=IIB supersymmetry down to D=10, N=1.
