Title: Quantization of the String Inspired Dilaton Gravity and the Birkhoff  Theorem
Authors: Marco Cavaglia and Vittorio de Alfaro and Alexandre T. Filippov
Abstract: We develop a simple scheme of quantization for the dilaton CGHS model without scalar fields, that uses the Gupta-Bleuler approach for the string fields. This is possible because the constraints can be linearized classically, due to positivity conditions that are present in the model (and not in the general string case). There is no ambiguity nor anomalies in the quantization. The expectation values of the metric and dilaton fields obey the classical requirements, thus exhibiting at the quantum level the Birkhoff theorem.
