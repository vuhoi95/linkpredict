Title: Instability of 1-loop superstring cosmology
Authors: Shinsuke Kawai and Masa-aki Sakagami and Jiro Soda
Abstract: A stability analysis is made in the context of the previously discovered non-singular cosmological solution from 1-loop corrected superstring effective action. We found that this solution has an instability in graviton mode, which is shown to have a close relation to the avoidance of initial singularity via energy condition. We also estimate the condition for the breakdown of the background solution due to the overdominance of the graviton.
