Title: Free Field Realization of Cylindrically Symmetric Einstein Gravity
Authors: J. Cruz and A. Mikovic and J. Navarro-Salas
Abstract: Cylindrically reduced Einstein gravity can be regarded as an $SL(2,R)/SO(2)$ sigma model coupled to 2D dilaton gravity. By using the corresponding 2D diffeomorphism algebra of constraints and the asymptotic behaviour of the Ernst equation we show that the theory can be mapped by a canonical transformation into a set of free fields with a Minkowskian target space. We briefly discuss the quantization in terms of these free-field variables, which is considerably simpler than in the other approaches.
