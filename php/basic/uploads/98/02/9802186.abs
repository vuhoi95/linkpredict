Title: The Moduli Spaces of Worldvolume Brane Solitons
Authors: J. Gutowski and G. Papadopoulos
Abstract: We compute the moduli metrics of worldvolume 0-brane solitons of D-branes and the worldvolume self-dual string solitons of the M-5-brane and examine their geometry. We find that the moduli spaces of 0-brane solitons of D-4-branes and D-8-branes are hyper-K\"ahler manifolds with torsion and octonionic K\"ahler manifolds with torsion, respectively. The moduli space of the self-dual string soliton of the M-5-brane is also a hyper-K\"ahler manifold with torsion.
