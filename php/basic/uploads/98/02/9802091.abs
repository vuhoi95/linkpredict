Title: Matrix Theory in Curved Space
Authors: I. Ya. Aref'eva and I. V. Volovich
Abstract: According to the Matrix theory proposal of Banks, Fischler, Shenker and Susskind M-theory in the infinite momentum frame is the large N limit of super Yang-Mills theory in a flat background. To address some physical issues of classical gravity such as gravitational collapse and cosmological expansion we consider an extension of the BFSS proposal by defining M-theory in curved space as the large N limit of super Yang-Mills theory in a curved background. Motivations and possible implications of this extension are discussed.
