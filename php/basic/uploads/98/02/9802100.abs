Title: Solution of the Odderon Problem
Authors: R. A. Janik and J. Wosiek
Abstract: The intercept of the odderon trajectory is derived, by finding the spectrum of the second integral of motion of the three reggeon system in high energy QCD. When combined with earlier solution of the appropriate Baxter equation, this leads to the determination of the low lying states of that system. In particular, the energy of the lowest state gives the intercept of the odderon alpha_O(0)=1-0.2472 alpha_s N_c/pi.
