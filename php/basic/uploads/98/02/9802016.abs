Title: Topological Gravity as Large N Topological Gauge Theory
Authors: Rajesh Gopakumar and Cumrun Vafa
Abstract: We consider topological closed string theories on Calabi-Yau manifolds which compute superpotential terms in the corresponding compactified type II effective action. In particular, near certain singularities we compare the partition function of this topological theory (the Kodaira-Spencer theory) to $SU(\infty)$ Chern-Simons theory on the vanishing 3-cycle. We find agreement between these theories, which we check explicitly for the case of shrinking $S^3$ and Lens spaces, at the perturbative level. Moreover, the gauge theory has non-perturbative contributions which have a natural interpretation in the Type IIB picture. We provide a heuristic explanation for this agreement as well as suggest further equivalences in other topological gravity/gauge systems.
