Title: Lax pairs for N=2,3 Supersymmetric KdV Equations and their Extensions
Authors: S. Krivonos and A. Pashnev and Z. Popowicz
Abstract: We present the Lax operator for the N=3 KdV hierarchy and consider its extensions. We also construct a new infinite family of N=2 supersymmetric hierarchies by exhibiting the corresponding super Lax operators. The new realization of N=4 supersymmetry on the two general N=2 superfields, bosonic spin 1 and fermionic spin 1/2, is discussed.
