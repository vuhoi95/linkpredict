Title: Electrically Charged Vortex Solution in Born-Infeld Theory
Authors: E. Moreno and C. Nu√±ez and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We obtain electrically charged vortex solutions for the Born-Infeld Higgs system with a Chern Simons term. We analyse numerically these solutions, comparing their properties with those of ``normal'' Nielsen-Olesen vortices and also show that no charged vortex solutions exist in Born-Infeld theory when the Chern Simons term is absent.
