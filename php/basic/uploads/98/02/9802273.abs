Title: Field Strength Correlators and Dual Effective Dynamics in QCD
Authors: M. Baker and N. Brambilla and H. G. Dosch and A. Vairo
Abstract: We establish a relation between the two-point field strength correlator in QCD and the dual field propagator of an effective dual Abelian Higgs model describing the infrared behaviour of QCD. We find an analytic approximation to the dual field propagator without sources and in presence of quark sources. In the latter situation we also obtain an expression for the static $q \bar{q}$ potential. Our derivation sheds some light on the dominance and phenomenological relevance of the two-point field strength correlator.
