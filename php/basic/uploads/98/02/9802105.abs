Title: Nonlinear Sigma Models in (1+2)-Dimensions and An Infinite Number of  Conserved Currents
Authors: Kazuyuki Fujii and Tatsuo Suzuki
Abstract: We treat in this paper non-linear sigma models such as $CP^1$-model, $QP^1$-model and etc, in 1+2 dimensions. For submodels of such ones we definitely construct an infinite number of nontrivial conserved currents. Our result is a generalization of that of authors (Alvarez, Ferreira and Guillen).
