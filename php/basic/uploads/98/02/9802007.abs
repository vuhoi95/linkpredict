Title: RG Equations from Whitham Hierarchy
Authors: A. Gorsky and A. Marshakov and A. Mironov and A. Morozov
Abstract: The second derivatives of prepotential with respect to Whitham time-variables in the Seiberg-Witten theory are expressed in terms of Riemann theta-functions. These formulas give a direct transcendental generalization of algebraic ones for the Kontsevich matrix model. In particular case they provide an explicit derivation of the renormalization group (RG) equation proposed recently in papers on the Donaldson theory.
