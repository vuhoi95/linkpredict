Title: Supergravity and The Large N Limit of Theories With Sixteen Supercharges
Authors: Nissan Itzhaki and Juan M. Maldacena and Jacob Sonnenschein and Shimon Yankielowicz
Abstract: We consider field theories with sixteen supersymmetries, which includes U(N) Yang-Mills theories in various dimensions, and argue that their large N limit is related to certain supergravity solutions. We study this by considering a system of D-branes in string theory and then taking a limit where the brane worldvolume theory decouples from gravity. At the same time we study the corresponding D-brane supergravity solution and argue that we can trust it in certain regions where the curvature (and the effective string coupling, where appropriate) are small. The supergravity solutions typically have several weakly coupled regions and interpolate between different limits of string-M-theory.
