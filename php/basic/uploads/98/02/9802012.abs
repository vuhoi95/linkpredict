Title: Particle-Like Solutions of the Einstein-Dirac-Maxwell Equations
Authors: Felix Finster and Joel Smoller and Shing-Tung Yau
Abstract: We consider the coupled Einstein-Dirac-Maxwell equations for a static, spherically symmetric system of two fermions in a singlet spinor state. Soliton-like solutions are constructed numerically. The stability and the properties of the ground state solutions are discussed for different values of the electromagnetic coupling constant. We find solutions even when the electromagnetic coupling is so strong that the total interaction is repulsive in the Newtonian limit. Our solutions are regular and well-behaved; this shows that the combined electromagnetic and gravitational self-interaction of the Dirac particles is finite.
