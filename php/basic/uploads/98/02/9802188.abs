Title: Exact Operator Solution of $A_2$-Toda Field Theory
Authors: T. Fujiwara and H. Igarashi and Y. Takimoto
Abstract: Quantum $A_2$-Toda field theory in two dimensions is investigated based on the method of quantizing canonical free field. Toda exponential operators associated with the fundamental weights are constructed to the fourth order in the cosmological constant. This leads us to a conjecture for the exact operator solution.
