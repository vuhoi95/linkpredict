Authors: S. Deser and G. Dunne and L. Griguolo and K. Lee and C. Lu and D. Seminara
Abstract: We point out that the claims made in the paper ``Non-thermalizability of a Quantum Field Theory'' (hep-th/9802008) by C. R. Hagen are irrelevant to our recent results concerning large gauge invariance of the effective action in thermal QED.
