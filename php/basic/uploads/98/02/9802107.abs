Title: Eight-Dimensional Self-Dual Spaces
Authors: E. G. Floratos and A. Kehagias
Abstract: We discuss higher-dimensional gravitational instantons by studying appropriate self-duality equations for the spin connection. In seven and in eight dimensions, the corresponding spaces admit a covariantly constant spinor and have holonomies in G_2 and Spin(7), respectively. We find a non-compact solution to the self-duality equations in eight dimensions in which the self-dual space has an elliptically-fibered structure.
