Title: The dynamical twisting and nondynamical r-matrix structure of elliptic  Ruijsenaars-Schneider model
Authors: Bo-yu Hou and Wen-Li Yang
Abstract: From the dynamical twisting of the classical r-matrix, we obtain a new Lax operator for the elliptic Ruijsenaars-Schneider model (cf. Ruijsenaars'). The corresponding r-matrix is shown to be the classical $Z_n$-symmetric elliptic r-matrix, which is the same as that obtained in the study of the nonrelativistic version---the $A_{n-1}$ Calogero-Moser model.
