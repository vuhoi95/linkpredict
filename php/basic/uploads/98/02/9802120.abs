Title: Pauli--Villars as a Nonperturbative Ultraviolet Regulator in Discretized  Light-Cone Quantization
Authors: S. J. Brodsky and J. R. Hiller and G. McCartor
Abstract: We propose a solution to the problem of renormalizing light-cone Hamiltonian theories while maintaining Lorentz invariance and other symmetries. The method uses generalized Pauli--Villars regulators to render the theory finite. We discuss the method in the context of Yukawa theory at one loop and for a soluble model in 3+1 dimensions. The model is studied nonperturbatively. Numerical results obtained with use of discretized light-cone quantization, special integration weighting factors, and the complex symmetric Lanczos diagonalization algorithm compare well with the analytic answers.
