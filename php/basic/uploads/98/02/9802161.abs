Title: The partition function versus boundary conditions and confinement in the  Yang-Mills theory
Authors: N. A. Sveshnikov and E. G. Timoshenko
Abstract: We analyse dependence of the partition function on the boundary condition for the longitudinal component of the electric field strength in gauge field theories. In a physical gauge the Gauss law constraint may be resolved explicitly expressing this component via an integral of the physical transversal variables. In particular, we study quantum electrodynamics with an external charge and SU(2) gluodynamics. We find that only a charge distribution slowly decreasing at spatial infinity can produce a nontrivial dependence in the Abelian theory. However, in gluodynamics for temperatures below some critical value the partition function acquires a delta-function like dependence on the boundary condition, which leads to colour confinement.
