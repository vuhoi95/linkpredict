Title: Non-Local Charges and their Algebra in Topological Field Theory
Authors: J. C. Brunelli and A. Das
Abstract: With the third order Monge-Amp\`ere equation as an example, we show that there exists an infinite number of nonlocal conserved charges associated with the Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde equations. A general prescription for the construction of these charges is given and the charge algebra is calculated bringing out various other interesting features associated with such systems.
