Title: Lagrangian Formulation of the General Modified Chiral Model
Authors: Theodora Ioannidou and Wojtek Zakrzewski
Abstract: We present a Lagrangian formulation for the general modified chiral model. We use it to discuss the Hamiltonian formalism for this model and to derive the commutation relations for the chiral field. We look at some explicit examples and show that the Hamiltonian, containing a contribution involving a Wess-Zumino term, is conserved, as required.
