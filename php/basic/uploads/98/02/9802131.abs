Title: A Note on Ward's Chiral Model
Authors: Theodora Ioannidou and Wojtek Zakrzewski
Abstract: A one parameter generalization of Ward's chiral model in 2+1 dimensions is given. Like the original model the present one is integrable and possesses a positive-definite and conserved energy and $y$-momentum. The details of the scattering depend on the value of the parameter of the generalisation.
