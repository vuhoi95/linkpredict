Title: Probing the QCD Vacuum with Static Sources in Maximal Abelian Projection
Authors: Gunnar S. Bali and Christoph Schlichter and Klaus Schilling
Abstract: Various field strength correlators are investigated in the maximal Abelian projection of pure SU(2) lattice gauge theory. High precision measurements of the colour fields, monopole currents, their curls and divergences allow for detailed checks of the dual superconductor scenario. On this basis, we perform a Ginzburg-Landau type analysis of the flux tube profile from which we derive the size of the penetration length, LAMBDA = 0.16(2) fm, and coherence length of the monopole condensate wave function, XI = 0.27(3) fm. The ratio of these numbers is KAPPA = LAMBDA/XI = 0.59(13) which is below the value 1/SQRT(2) where type II superconductivity sets in.
