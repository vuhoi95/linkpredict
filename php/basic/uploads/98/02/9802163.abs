Abstract: Non-extremal overlapping p-brane supergravity solutions localised in their relative transverse coordinates are constructed. The construction uses an algebraic method of solving the bosonic equations of motion. It is shown that these non-extremal solutions can be obtained from the extremal solutions by means of the superposition of two deformation functions defined by vacuum solutions of M-theory. Vacuum solutions of M-theory including irrational powers of harmonic functions are discussed.
