Title: Minimal subtraction and the Callan-Symanzik equation
Authors: J. Naud and I. Nemenman and M. Van Raamsdonk and V. Periwal
Abstract: The usual proof of renormalizability using the Callan-Symanzik equation makes explicit use of normalization conditions. It is shown that demanding that the renormalization group functions take the form required for minimal subtraction allows one to prove renormalizability using the Callan-Symanzik equation, without imposing normalization conditions. Scalar field theory and quantum electrodynamics are treated.
