Title: A Note on the Supersymmetries of the Self-Dual Supermembrane
Authors: E. G. Floratos and G. K. Leontaris
Abstract: In this letter we discuss the supersymmetry issue of the self dual supermembranes in (8+1) and (4+1)-dimensions. We find that all genuine solutions of the (8+1)-dimensional supermembrane, based on the exceptional group G_2, preserve one of the sixteen supersymmetries while all solutions in (4+1)-dimensions preserve eight of them.
