Abstract: We study the role played by the compactness and the degree of connectedness in the time evolution of the energy of a radiating system in the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) space-times whose $t=const $ spacelike sections are the Euclidean 3-manifold ${\cal R}^3$ and six topologically non-equivalent flat orientable compact multiply connected Riemannian 3-manifolds. An exponential damping of the energy $E(t)$ is present in the ${\cal R}^3$ case, whereas for the six compact flat 3-spaces it is found basically the same pattern for the evolution of the energy, namely relative minima and maxima occurring at different times (depending on the degree of connectedness) followed by a growth of $E(t)$. Likely reasons for this divergent behavior of $E(t)$ in these compact flat 3-manifolds are discussed and further developments are indicated. A misinterpretation of Wolf's results regarding one of the six orientable compact flat 3-manifolds is also indicated and rectified.
