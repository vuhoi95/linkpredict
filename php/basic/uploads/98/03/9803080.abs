Title: Dynamical Behavior of the BTZ Black Hole
Authors: H. W. Lee and N. J. Kim and Y. S. Myung
Abstract: We study the dynamical behavior of the BTZ (Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli) black hole with the low-energy string effective action. The perturbation analysis around the BTZ black hole reveals a mixing between the dilaton and other fields. Introducing the new gauge (dilaton gauge), we disentangle this mixing completely and obtain one decoupled dilaton equation. We obtain the decay rate $\Gamma$ of BTZ black hole.
