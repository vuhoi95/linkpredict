Title: Smeared heat-kernel coefficients on the ball and generalized cone
Authors: J. S. Dowker and Klaus Kirsten
Abstract: We consider smeared zeta functions and heat-kernel coefficients on the bounded, generalized cone in arbitrary dimensions. The specific case of a ball is analysed in detail and used to restrict the form of the heat-kernel coefficients $A_n$ on smooth manifolds with boundary. Supplemented by conformal transformation techniques, it is used to provide an effective scheme for the calculation of the $A_n$. As an application, the complete $A_{5/2}$ coefficient is given.
