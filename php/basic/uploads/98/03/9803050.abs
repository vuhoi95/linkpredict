Title: Matrix Description of Intersecting M5 Branes
Authors: Shamit Kachru and Yaron Oz and Zheng Yin
Abstract: Novel 3+1 dimensional N=2 superconformal field theories (with tensionless BPS string solitons) are believed to arise when two sets of M5 branes intersect over a 3+1 dimensional hyperplane. We derive a DLCQ description of these theories as supersymmetric quantum mechanics on the Higgs branch of suitable 4d N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories. Our formulation allows us to determine the scaling dimensions of certain chiral primary operators in the conformal field theories. We also discuss general criteria for quantum mechanical DLCQ descriptions of supersymmetric field theories (and the resulting multiplicities and scaling dimensions of chiral primary operators).
