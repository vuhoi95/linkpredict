Title: SO/Sp Monopoles and Branes with Orientifold 3 Plane
Authors: Changhyun Ahn and Bum-Hoon Lee
Abstract: We study BPS monopoles in 4 dimensional N=4 SO(N) and $Sp(N)$ super Yang-Mills theories realized as the low energy effective theory of $N$ (physical and its mirror) parallel D3 branes and an {\it Orientifold 3 plane} with D1 branes stretched between them in type IIB string theory. Monopoles on D3 branes give the natural understanding by embedding in SU(N) through the constraints on both the asymptotic Higgs field (corresponding to the horizontal positions of D3 branes) and the magnetic charges (corresponding to the number of D1 branes) imposed by the O3 plane. The compatibility conditions of Nahm data for monopoles for these groups can be interpreted very naturally through the D1 branes in the presence of O3 plane.
