Title: Exceptional Seiberg-Witten Geometry with Massive Fundamental Matters
Authors: Seiji Terashima and Sung-Kil Yang
Abstract: We propose Seiberg-Witten geometry for N=2 gauge theory with gauge group $E_6$ with massive $N_f$ fundamental hypermultiplets. The relevant manifold is described as a fibration of the ALE space of $E_6$ type. It is observed that the fibering data over the base ${\bf CP}^1$ has an intricate dependence on hypermultiplet bare masses.
