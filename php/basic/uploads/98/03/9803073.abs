Title: Supersymmetric Sum Rules for Electromagnetic Multipoles
Authors: Ioannis Giannakis and James T. Liu and Massimo Porrati
Abstract: We derive model independent, non-perturbative supersymmetric sum rules for the magnetic and electric multipole moments of any theory with N=1 supersymmetry. We find that in any irreducible N=1 supermultiplet the diagonal matrix elements of the l-multipole moments are completely fixed in terms of their off-diagonal matrix elements and the diagonal (l-1)-multipole moments.
