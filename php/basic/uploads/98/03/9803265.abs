Authors: G. Moore and N. Nekrasov and S. Shatashvili
Abstract: We compute the principal contribution to the index in the supersymmetric quantum mechanical systems which are obtained by reduction to 0+1 dimensions of $\CN=1$, $D=4,6,10$ super-Yang-Mills theories with gauge group SU(N). The results are: ${1\over{N^{2}}}$ for $D=4,6$, $\sum_{d | N} {1\over{d^{2}}}$ for D=10. We also discuss the D=3 case.
