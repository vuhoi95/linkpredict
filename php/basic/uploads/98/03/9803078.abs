Title: Hawking Radiation from Four-dimensional Schwarzschild Black Holes in  M-theory
Authors: Sumit R. Das and Samir D. Mathur and P. Ramadevi
Abstract: Recently a method has been developed for relating four dimensional Schwarzschild black holes in M-theory to near-extremal black holes in string theory with four charges, using suitably defined ``boosts'' and T-dualities. We show that this method can be extended to obtain the emission rate of low energy massless scalars for the four dimensional Schwarzschild hole from the microscopic picture of radiation from the near extremal hole.
