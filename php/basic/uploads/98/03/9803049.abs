Title: Born-Infeld-Einstein Actions?
Authors: S. Deser and G. W. Gibbons
Abstract: We present some obvious physical requirements on gravitational avatars of non-linear electrodynamics and illustrate them with explicit determinantal Born-Infeld-Einstein models. A related procedure, using compensating Weyl scalars, permits us to formulate conformally invariant versions of these systems as well.
