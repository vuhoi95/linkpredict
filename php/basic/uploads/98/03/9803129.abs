Title: Discrete symmetries of unitary minimal conformal theories
Authors: P. Ruelle and O. Verhoeven
Abstract: We classify the possible discrete (finite) symmetries of two--dimensional critical models described by unitary minimal conformally invariant theories. We find that all but six models have the group Z_2 as maximal symmetry. Among the six exceptional theories, four have no symmetry at all, while the other two are the familiar critical and tricritical 3--Potts models, which both have an S_3 symmetry. These symmetries are the expected ones, and coincide with the automorphism groups of the Dynkin diagrams of simply--laced simple Lie algebras ADE. We note that extended chiral algebras, when present, are almost never preserved in the frustrated sectors.
