Title: On the Low-Energy Effective Action of N=2 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills  Theory
Authors: M. Chaichian and W. F. Chen and C. Montonen
Abstract: We investigate the perturbative part of Seiberg's low-energy effective action of N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in Wess-Zumino gauge in the conventional effective field theory technique. Using the method of constant field approximation and restricting the effective action with at most two derivatives and not more than four-fermion couplings, we show some features of the low-energy effective action given by Seiberg based on $U(1)_R$ anomaly and non-perturbative $\beta$-function arguments.
