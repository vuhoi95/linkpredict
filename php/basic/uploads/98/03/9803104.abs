Title: Truncated Conformal Space at c=1, Nonlinear Integral Equation and  Quantization Rules for Multi-Soliton States
Authors: G. Feverati and F. Ravanini and G. Takacs
Abstract: We develop Truncated Conformal Space (TCS) technique for perturbations of c=1 Conformal Field Theories. We use it to give the first numerical evidence of the validity of the non-linear integral equation (NLIE) derived from light-cone lattice regularization at intermediate scales. A controversy on the quantization of Bethe states is solved by this numerical comparison and by using the locality principle at the ultra- violet fixed point. It turns out that the correct quantization for pure hole states is the one with half-integer quantum numbers originally proposed by Mariottini et al. Once the correct rule is imposed, the agreement between TCS and NLIE for pure hole states turns out to be impressive.
