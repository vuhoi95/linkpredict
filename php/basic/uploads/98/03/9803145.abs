Title: Type IIB $R^4 H^{4g-4}$ Conjectures
Authors: Nathan Berkovits and Cumrun Vafa
Abstract: We propose $SL(2,Z)$ (and $SL(3,Z)$) invariant conjectures for all $R^4 H^{4g-4}$ couplings of Type IIB strings on $R^{10}$ (and $R^{8}\times T^2$), generalizing conjectures of Green and Gutperle (and Kiritsis and Pioline) for the $R^4$ coupling. A strong check for our conjectures is that on $T^2$ at weak coupling, they reproduce the multiloop scattering amplitudes which had been previously computed using N=2 strings in the N=4 topological formalism. Applications to $(p,q)$ string production in a background $H$ field, generalizing Schwinger's computation for pair production in constant $F$ field, are suggested.
