Title: New Algebra of Local Symmetries for Regge Limit of Yang-Mills Theories
Authors: Victor A. Matveev and Grigorii B. Pivovarov
Abstract: Local effective action is derived to describe Regge asymptotic of Yang-Mills theories. Local symmetries of the effective action originating from the gauge symmetry of the underlying Yang-Mills theory are studied. Multicomponent effective action is introduced to express the symmetry transformations as field transformations. The algebra of these symmetries is decomposed onto a semi-direct sum of commutative algebras and four copies of the gauge algebra of the underlying Yang-Mills theory. Possibility of existence of solitons corresponding to the commutative subalgebra of the symmetry algebra is mentioned.
