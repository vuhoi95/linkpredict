Title: Non-divergence of gravitational self-interactions for Goto-Nambu strings
Authors: B. Carter and R. A. Battye
Abstract: The classical linearised gravitational self interaction of a Goto-Nambu string is examined in four spacetime dimensions. Using a conveniently gauge independent tensorial treatment, the divergent part of the self-force is shown to be exactly zero. This is due to cancelation by a contribution that was neglected in the previous treatments. This result has implications for many applications.
