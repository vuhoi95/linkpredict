Title: On the Complementarity of F-theory, Orientifolds, and Heterotic Strings
Authors: P. Berglund and E. G. Gimon
Abstract: We study F-theory duals of six dimensional heterotic vacua in extreme regions of moduli space where the heterotic string is very strongly coupled. We demonstrate how to use orientifold limits of these F-theory duals to regain a perturbative string description. As an example, we reproduce the spectrum of a $T^4/\ZZ_{4}$ orientifold as an F-theory vacuum with a singular $K3$ fibration. We relate this vacuum to previously studied heterotic $E_8\times E_8$ compactifications on $K3$.
