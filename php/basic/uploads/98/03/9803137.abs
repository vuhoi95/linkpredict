Title: Wilson Loops in the Large N Limit at Finite Temperature
Authors: A. Brandhuber and N. Itzhaki and J. Sonnenschein and S. Yankielowicz
Abstract: Using a proposal of Maldacena we compute in the framework of the supergravity description of N coincident D3 branes the energy of a quark anti-quark pair in the large N limit of U(N) N=4 SYM in four dimensions at finite temperature.
