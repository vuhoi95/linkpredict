Title: Systematic Study of Theories with Quantum Modified Moduli II
Authors: Benjamin Grinstein and Detlef R. Nolte
Abstract: We complete the process of classifying all supersymmetric theories with quantum modified moduli. We present all the supersymmetric gauge theories based on a simple orthogonal or exceptional group that exhibit a quantum modified moduli space. The quantum modified constraints of theories derived from s-confining theories are invariant under all symmetries. However, theories that cannot be obtained by a deformation of an s-confining theory may have constraints that are covariant, rather than invariant.
