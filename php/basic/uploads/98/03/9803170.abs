Title: Non-Perturbative Spectrum of Two Dimensional (1,1) Super Yang-Mills at  Finite and Large N
Authors: F. Antonuccio and O. Lunin and S. Pinsky
Abstract: We consider the dimensional reduction of N = 1 SYM_{2+1} to 1+1 dimensions, which has (1,1) supersymmetry. The gauge groups we consider are U(N) and SU(N), where N is a finite variable. We implement Discrete Light-Cone Quantization to determine non-perturbatively the bound states in this theory. A careful analysis of the spectrum is performed at various values of N, including the case where N is large (but finite), allowing a precise measurement of the 1/N effects in the quantum theory. The low energy sector of the theory is shown to be dominated by string-like states. The techniques developed here may be applied to any two dimensional field theory with or without supersymmetry.
