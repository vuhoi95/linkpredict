Title: Lattice Gauge Theories with polynomial Action and their canonical  Formulation on the Light Front
Authors: V. A. Franke and S. A. Paston and E. V. Prokhvatilov
Abstract: A lattice gauge theory with an action polynomial in independent field variables is considered. The link variables are described by unconstrained complex matrices instead of unitary ones. A mechanism which permits to switch off in the continuous limit the arising extra fields is discussed. The Euclidean version of the theory with an 4-dimensional lattice is described. The canonical form of this theory in Lorentz coordinates with continuous time is given. The canonical formulation in the light-front coordinates is investigated for the lattice in 2-dimensional transverse space and for the 3-dimensional lattice including one of the light-like coordinates. The light-front zero mode problem is considered in the framework of this canonical formulation.
