Title: A note on brane boxes at finite string coupling
Authors: Eric G. Gimon and Martin Gremm
Abstract: We consider N=1 supersymmetric SU(N_c) gauge theories, using the type IIB brane construction recently proposed by Hanany and Zaffaroni. At non-zero string coupling, we find that the bending of branes imposes consistency conditions that allow only non-anomalous gauge theories with stable vacua, i.e., N_f >= N_c, to be constructed. We find qualitative differences between the brane configurations for N_f <= 3N_c and N_f > 3N_c, corresponding to asymptotically free and infrared free theories respectively. We also discuss some properties of the brane configurations that may be relevant to constructing Seiberg's duality in this framework.
