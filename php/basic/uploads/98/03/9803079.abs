Title: Causal Theory for the Gauged Thirring Model
Authors: L. A. Manzoni and B. M. Pimentel and J. L. Tomazelli
Abstract: We consider the (2+1)-dimensional massive Thirring model as a gauge theory, with one fermion flavor, in the framework of the causal perturbation theory and address the problem of dynamical mass generation for the gauge boson. In this context we get an unambiguous expression for the coefficient of the induced Chern-Simons term.
