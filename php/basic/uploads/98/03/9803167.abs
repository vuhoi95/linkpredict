Title: Orbifolds of AdS_5xS^5 and 4d Conformal Field Theories
Authors: Yaron Oz and John Terning
Abstract: We study the relation between the large Nc limit of four dimensional N=2,1,0 conformal field theories and supergravity on orbifolds of AdS_5xS^5. We analyze the Kaluza-Klein states of the supergravity theory and relate them to the spectrum of (chiral) primary operators of the (super) conformal field theories.
