Title: Description of the higher massless irreducible integer spins in the BRST  approach
Authors: A. Pashnev and M. Tsulaia
Abstract: The BRST approach is applied to the description of irreducible massless higher spins representations of the Poincare group in arbitrary dimensions. The total system of constraints in such theory includes both the first and the second class constraints. The corresponding nilpotent BRST charge contains terms up to the seventh degree in ghosts.
