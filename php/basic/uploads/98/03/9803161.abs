Title: Phase Transition in a Self--Gravitating Planar Gas
Authors: Elcio Abdalla and M. Reza Rahimi Tabar
Abstract: We consider a gas of Newtonian self-gravitating particles in two-dimensional space, finding a phase transition, with a high temperature homogeneous phase and a low temperature clumped one. We argue that the system is described in terms of a gas with fractal behaviour.
