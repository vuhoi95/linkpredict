Title: Probing the BTZ black hole with test fields
Authors: H. W. Lee and N. J. Kim and Y. S. Myung
Abstract: We introduce a set of scalar fields as test fields to study the dynamical behaviors of the BTZ (Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli) black hole. These include minimally coupled scalar, conformally coupled scalar, dilaton, and tachyon. To calculate the decay rate of the BTZ black hole, we consider both the Dirichlet boundary condition at spatial infinity and the stability condition. It turns out that the tachyon may be a relevant field to get information of the BTZ black hole.
