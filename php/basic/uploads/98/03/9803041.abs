Abstract: Open branes ending on other branes, which may be referred to as the host branes, are studied in the superembedding formalism. The open brane, host brane and the target space in which they are both embedded are all taken to be supermanifolds. It is shown that the superspace constraints satisfied by the open brane are sufficient to determine the corresponding superspace constraints for the host branes, whose dynamics are determined by these constraints. As a byproduct, one also obtains information about the boundary of the open brane propagating in the host brane.
