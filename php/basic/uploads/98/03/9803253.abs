Title: On realizations of nonlinear Lie algebras by differential operators
Authors: J. Beckers and Y. Brihaye and N. Debergh
Abstract: We study realizations of polynomial deformations of the sl(2,R)- Lie algebra in terms of differential operators strongly related to bosonic operators. We also distinguish their finite- and infinite-dimensional representations. The linear, quadratic and cubic cases are explicitly visited but the method works for arbitrary degrees in the polynomial functions. Multi-boson Hamiltonians are studied in the context of these ``nonlinear'' Lie algebras and some examples dealing with quantum optics are pointed out.
