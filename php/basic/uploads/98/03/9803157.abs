Title: The exact formula for neutrino oscillations
Authors: Massimo Blasone and Peter A. Henning and Giuseppe Vitiello
Abstract: We present the exact formula for neutrino oscillations. By resorting to recent results of Quantum Field Theory of fermion mixing, we work out the Green's function formalism for mixed neutrinos. The usual quantum mechanical Pontecorvo formula is recovered in the relativistic limit.
