Title: Functional derivation of Casimir energy at non-zero temperature
Authors: Avijit K. Ganguly and Palash B. Pal
Abstract: Performing functional integration of the free Lagrangian, we find the vacuum energy of a field. The functional integration is performed in a way which easily generalizes to systems at non-zero temperature. We use this technique to obtain the Casimir energy density and pressure at arbitrary temperatures.
