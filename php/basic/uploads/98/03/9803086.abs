Title: Equivalence of black hole thermodynamics between a generalized theory of  gravity and the Einstein theory
Authors: Jun-ichirou Koga and Kei-ichi Maeda
Abstract: We analyze black hole thermodynamics in a generalized theory of gravity whose Lagrangian is an arbitrary function of the metric, the Ricci tensor and a scalar field. We can convert the theory into the Einstein frame via a "Legendre" transformation or a conformal transformation. We calculate thermodynamical variables both in the original frame and in the Einstein frame, following the Iyer--Wald definition which satisfies the first law of thermodynamics. We show that all thermodynamical variables defined in the original frame are the same as those in the Einstein frame, if the spacetimes in both frames are asymptotically flat, regular and possess event horizons with non-zero temperatures. This result may be useful to study whether the second law is still valid in the generalized theory of gravity.
