Title: On the QCD Phase Transition at Finite Baryon Density
Authors: Stephen D. H. Hsu and Myckola Schwetz
Abstract: We investigate the QCD chiral phase transition at finite chemical potential $\mu$, using the renormalization group (RG) to characterize the infrared behavior of sigma models constrained by the flavor and spacetime symmetries. The results are similar to those obtained from RG analysis of the finite temperature transition at zero baryon density. When there are more than two massless flavors of quarks, a first order transition is predicted for the entire phase boundary. In the two flavor case, a boundary with first and second order regions separated by a tricritical point seems most likely. We discuss the real-world case with two light quarks and an intermediate mass strange quark. Improved lattice data on the temperature transition will strongly constrain the possibilities for the phase boundary.
