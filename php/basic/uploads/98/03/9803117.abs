Title: Monte Carlo Approach to M-Theory
Authors: Werner Krauth and Hermann Nicolai and Matthias Staudacher
Abstract: We discuss supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory dimensionally reduced to zero dimensions and evaluate the SU(2) and SU(3) partition functions by Monte Carlo methods. The exactly known SU(2) results are reproduced to very high precision. Our calculations for SU(3) agree closely with an extension of a conjecture due to Green and Gutperle concerning the exact value of the SU(N) partition functions.
