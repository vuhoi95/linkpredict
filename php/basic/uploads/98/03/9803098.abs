Title: The Faddeev-Popov term reviewed
Authors: D. E. Jaramillo and J. H. Munoz and A. Zepeda
Abstract: Some textbooks and reports claim that the Jacobian which arises in the discussion of the Faddeev-Popov method to quantize non-Abelian gauge theories and which is given by the derivative of the gauge fixing conditions over the gauge group parameters, is gauge invariant. Other references however prove the opposite. In this brief report we present a discussion about this matter.
