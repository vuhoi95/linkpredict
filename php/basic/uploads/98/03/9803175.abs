Title: SU(2) Poisson-Lie T duality
Authors: M. A. Lledo and V. S. V. Varadarajan
Abstract: Poisson-Lie target space duality is a framework where duality transformations are properly defined. In this letter we investigate the pair of sigma models defined by the double SO(3,1) in the Iwasawa decomposition.
