Title: Duality and Moduli Spaces for Time-Like Reductions
Authors: C. M. Hull and B. Julia
Abstract: We consider the dimensional reduction/compactification of supergravity, string and M-theories on tori with one time-like circle. We find the coset spaces in which the massless scalars take their values, and identify the discrete duality groups.
