Title: Drived diffusion of vector fields
Authors: S. Marculescu and F. Ruiz Ruiz
Abstract: A model for the diffusion of vector fields driven by external forces is proposed. Using the renormalization group and the $\epsilon$-expansion, the dynamical critical properties of the model with gaussian noise for dimensions below the critical dimension are investigated and new transport universality classes are obtained.
