Title: Asymptotically exact solutions of Harper equation
Authors: A. G. Abanov and J. C. Talstra and P. B. Wiegmann
Abstract: We present asymptotically exact solutions of an incommensurate Harper equation---one-dimensional Schroedinger equation of one particle on a lattice in a cosine potential. The wave functions can be written as an infinite product of string polynomials. The roots of these polynomials are solutions of Bethe equations. They are classified according to the string hypothesis. The string hypothesis gives asymptotically exact values of roots and reveals the hierarchical structure of the spectrum of the Harper equation.
