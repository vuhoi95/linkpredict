Title: Chaos and Statistical Mechanics in the Hamiltonian Mean Field Model
Authors: Vito Latora and Andrea Rapisarda and Stefano Ruffo
Abstract: We study the dynamical and statistical behavior of the Hamiltonian Mean Field (HMF) model in order to investigate the relation between microscopic chaos and phase transitions. HMF is a simple toy model of $N$ fully-coupled rotators which shows a second order phase transition. The canonical thermodynamical solution is briefly recalled and its predictions are tested numerically at finite $N$. The Vlasov stationary solution is shown to give the same consistency equation of the canonical solution and its predictions for rotator angle and momenta distribution functions agree very well with numerical simulations. A link is established between the behavior of the maximal Lyapunov exponent and that of thermodynamical fluctuations, expressed by kinetic energy fluctuations or specific heat. The extensivity of chaos in the $N \to \infty$ limit is tested through the scaling properties of Lyapunov spectra and of the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. Chaotic dynamics provides the mixing property in phase space necessary for obtaining equilibration; however, the relaxation time to equilibrium grows with $N$, at least near the critical point. Our results constitute an interesting bridge between Hamiltonian chaos in many degrees of freedom systems and equilibrium thermodynamics.
