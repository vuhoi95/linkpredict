Title: New Non-Symmetric Orthogonal Basis for the Calogero Model with  Distinguishable Particles
Authors: Hideaki Ujino and Akinori Nishino and Miki Wadati
Abstract: We demonstrate an algebraic construction of all the simultaneous eigenfunctions of the conserved operators for distinguishable particles governed by the Calogero Hamiltonian. Our construction is completely parallel to the construction of the Fock space for decoupled quantum harmonic oscillators. The simultaneous eigenfunction does not coincide with the non-symmetric Hi-Jack polynomial, which shows that the conserved operators derived from the number operators of the decoupled quantum harmonic oscillators are algebraically different from the known ones derived by the Dunkl operator formulation.
