Title: Quantum modified moduli spaces and field dependent gauge couplings
Authors: Matthias Klein and Jan Louis
Abstract: In this paper we discuss quantum modified moduli spaces in supergravity. We examine a model suggested by Izawa and Yanagida and by Intriligator and Thomas that breaks global supersymmetry by a quantum deformation of the classical moduli space. We determine the minimum of the supergravity potential when the gauge coupling is taken to depend on a dynamical field, typically a modulus of string theory. We find that the only minimum is at the trivial configuration of vanishing coupling constant and unbroken supersymmetry. We also discuss models involving more complicated superpotentials and find that the gauge coupling is only stabilized in a supersymmetric ground state.
