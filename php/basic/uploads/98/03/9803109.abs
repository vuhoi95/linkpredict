Authors: S. Ferrara and A. Kehagias and H. Partouche and A. Zaffaroni
Abstract: We consider superconformal field theories in three and six dimensions with eight supercharges which can be realized on the world-volume of M-theory branes sitting at orbifold singularities. We find that they should admit a N=4 and N=2 supergravity dual in AdS_4 and AdS_7, respectively. We discuss the characteristics of the corresponding gauged supergravities.
