Title: Nonperturbative SUSY Correlators at Finite Temperature
Authors: J. Grundberg and J. Wirstam
Abstract: We calculate finite temperature effects on a correlation function in the two dimensional supersymmetric nonlinear O(3) sigma model. The correlation function violates chiral symmetry and at zero temperature it has been shown to be a constant, which gives rise to a double-valued condensate. Within the bilinear approximation we find an exact result in a one-instanton background at finite temperature. In contrast to the result at zero temperature we find that the correlation function decays exponentially at large distances.
