Title: Initial singularity free quantum cosmology in two-dimensional  Brans-Dicke theory
Authors: Won Tae Kim and Myung Seok Yoon
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional Brans-Dicke theory to study the initial singularity problem. It turns out that the initial curvature singularity can be finite for a certain Brans-Dicke constant $\omega$ by considering the quantum back reaction of the geometry. For $\omega=1$, the universe starts with the finite curvature scalar and evolves into the flat spacetime. Furthermore the divergent gravitational coupling at the initial time can be finite effectively with the help of quantum correction. The other type of universe is studied for the case of $0<\omega<1$.
