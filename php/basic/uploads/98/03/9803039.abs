Abstract: We prove the existence of a new class of BPS saturated M-branes. They are in one-to-one correspondence with the Freund--Rubin compactifications of M-theory on either (AdS_4) x (G/H) or (AdS_7) x (G/H), where G/H is the seven (or four) dimensional Einstein coset manifolds classified long ago in the context of Kaluza Klein supergravity. The G/H M-branes are solitons that interpolate between flat space at infinity and the old Kaluza-Klein compactifications at the horizon. They preserve N/2 supersymmetries where N is the number of Killing spinors of the (AdS) x (G/H) vacuum. A crucial ingredient in our discussion is the identification of a solvable Lie algebra parametrization of the Lorentzian non compact coset SO(2,p+1)/SO(1,p+1) corresponding to anti de Sitter space AdS_{p+2} . The solvable coordinates are those naturally emerging from the near horizon limit of the G/H p-brane and correspond to the Bertotti Robinson form of the anti-de-Sitter metric. The pull-back of anti-de-Sitter isometries on the p-brane world-volume contain, in particular, the broken conformal transformations recently found in the literature.
