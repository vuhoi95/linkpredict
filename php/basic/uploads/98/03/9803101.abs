Title: Hitchin Systems at Low Genera
Authors: Krzysztof Gawedzki and Pascal Tran-Ngoc-Bich
Abstract: The paper gives a quick account of the simplest cases of the Hitchin integrable systems and of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard connection at genus 0, 1 and 2. In particular, we construct the action-angle variables of the genus 2 Hitchin system with group SL(2) by exploiting its relation to the classical Neumann integrable systems.
