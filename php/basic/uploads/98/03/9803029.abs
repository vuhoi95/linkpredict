Title: SU(3) Revisited
Authors: Mark S. Byrd and E. C. G. Sudarshan
Abstract: The ``$D$'' matrices for all states of the two fundamental representations and octet are shown in the generalized Euler angle parameterization. The raising and lowering operators are given in terms of linear combinations of the left invariant vector fields of the group manifold in this parameterization. Using these differential operators the highest weight state of an arbitrary irreducible representation is found and a description of the calculation of Clebsch-Gordon coefficients is given.
