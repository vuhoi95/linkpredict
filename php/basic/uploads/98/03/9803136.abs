Title: Tricritical Ising Model with a Boundary
Authors: A. De Martino and M. Moriconi
Abstract: We study the integrable and supersymmetric massive $\hat\phi_{(1,3)}$ deformation of the tricritical Ising model in the presence of a boundary. We use constraints from supersymmetry in order to compute the exact boundary $S$-matrices, which turn out to depend explicitly on the topological charge of the supersymmetry algebra. We also solve the general boundary Yang-Baxter equation and show that in appropriate limits the general reflection matrices go over the supersymmetry preserving solutions. Finally, we briefly discuss the possible connection between our reflection matrices and boundary perturbations within the framework of perturbed boundary conformal field theory.
