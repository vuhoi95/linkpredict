Title: Twisted higher index theory on good orbifolds and fractional quantum  numbers
Authors: Matilde Marcolli and Varghese Mathai
Abstract: The twisted Connes-Moscovici higher index theorem is generalized to the case of good orbifolds. The higher index is shown to be a rational number, and in fact non-integer in specific examples of 2-orbifolds. This results in a non-commutative geometry model that predicts the occurrence of fractional quantum numbers in the Hall effect on the hyperbolic plane.
