Title: 3-String Junction and BPS Saturated Solutions in SU(3) Supersymmetric  Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Koji Hashimoto and Hiroyuki Hata and Naoki Sasakura
Abstract: We construct BPS saturated regular configurations of N=4 SU(3) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory carrying non-parallel electric and magnetic charges. These field theory BPS states correspond to the string theory BPS states of 3-string junctions connecting three different D3-branes by regarding the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory as an effective field theory on parallel D3-branes.
