Title: Mixed Branes and M(atrix) Theory on Noncommutative Torus
Authors: F. Ardalan and H. Arfaei and M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari
Abstract: We derive the noncommutative torus compactification of M(atrix) theory directly from the string theory by imposing mixed boundary conditions on the membranes. The relation of various dualities in string theory and M(atrix) theory compactification on the noncommutative torus are studied.
