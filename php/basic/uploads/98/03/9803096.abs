Title: Black holes as D3-branes on Calabi-Yau threefolds
Authors: Matteo Bertolini and Pietro Fre` and Roberto Iengo and Claudio A. Scrucca
Abstract: We show how an extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black hole can be obtained by wrapping a dyonic D3-brane on a Calabi-Yau manifold. In the orbifold limit T^6/Z_3, we explicitly show the correspondence between the solution of the supergravity equations of motion and the D-brane boundary state description of such a black hole.
