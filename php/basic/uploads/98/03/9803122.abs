Title: $SU(2,R)_q $ Symmetries of Non-Abelian Toda Theories
Authors: J. F. Gomes and G. M. Sotkov and A. H. Zimerman
Abstract: The classical and quantum algebras of a class of conformal NA-Toda models are studied. It is shown that the $SL(2,R)_q$ Poisson brackets algebra generated by certain chiral and antichiral charges of the nonlocal currents and the global U(1) charge appears as an algebra of the symmetries of these models.
