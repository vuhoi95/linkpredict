Title: On the value of coupling constant
Authors: P. Pronin and K. Stepanyantz
Abstract: Using an analogy between Bogomol'nyi bound and the harmonic oscillator in quantum mechanics we propose a possible explanation of the coupling constant numerical value at the grand unification scale. It is found to be $1/8\pi$.
