Title: Duality in cosmological perturbation theory
Authors: R. Brustein and M. Gasperini and G. Veneziano
Abstract: Cosmological perturbation equations derived from low-energy effective actions are shown to be invariant under a duality transformation reminiscent of electric-magnetic, strong-weak coupling, S-duality. A manifestly duality-invariant approximation for perturbations far outside the horizon is introduced, and it is argued to be useful even during a high curvature epoch. Duality manifests itself through a remnant symmetry acting on the classical moduli of cosmological models, and implying lower bounds on the number and energy density of produced particles.
