Title: K-K excitations on AdS_5 x S^5 as N=4 ``primary'' superfields
Authors: Laura Andrianopoli and Sergio Ferrara
Abstract: We show that the K-K spectrum of IIB string on AdS_5 x S_5 is described by ``twisted chiral'' N=4 superfields, naturally described in ``harmonic superspace'', obtained by taking suitable gauge singlets polynomials of the D3-brane boundary SU(n) superconformal field theory. To each p-order polynomial is associated a massive K-K short representation with 256 x 1/12 p^2(p^2 -1) states. The p=2 quadratic polynomial corresponds to the ``supercurrent multiplet'' describing the ``massless'' bulk graviton multiplet.
