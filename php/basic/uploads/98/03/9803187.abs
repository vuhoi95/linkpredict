Title: A Dynamical Approach to a Self-similar Universe
Authors: E. Abdalla and N. Afshordi and K. Khodjasteh and R. Mohayaee
Abstract: We write a non-relativistic Lagrangian for a hierarchical universe. The equations of motion are solved numerically and the evolution of the fractal dimension is obtained for different initial conditions. We show that our model is homogeneous at the time of the last scattering, but evolves into a self-similar universe with a remarkably constant fractal dimension. We also show that the Hubble law is implied by this model and make an estimate for the age of the universe.
