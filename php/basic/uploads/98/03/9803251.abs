Title: Spinors and the AdS/CFT correspondence
Authors: Mans Henningson and Konstadinos Sfetsos
Abstract: We consider a free massive spinor field in Euclidean Anti-de Sitter space. The usual Dirac action in bulk is supplemented by a certain boundary term. The boundary conditions of the field are parametrized by a spinor on the boundary, subject to a projection. We calculate the dependence of the partition function on this boundary spinor. The result agrees with the generating functional of the correlation functions of a quasi-primary spinor operator, of a certain scaling dimension, in a free conformal field theory on the boundary.
