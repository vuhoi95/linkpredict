Title: Inverse scattering and solitons in $A_{n-1}$ affine Toda field theories  II
Authors: E. J. Beggs and P. R. Johnson
Abstract: New single soliton solutions to the affine Toda field theories are constructed, exhibiting previously unobserved topological charges. This goes some of the way in filling the weights of the fundamental representations, but nevertheless holes in the representations remain. We use the group doublecross product form of the inverse scattering method, and restrict ourselves to the rank one solutions.
