Title: Five-loop \sqrtÎµ-expansions for random Ising model and marginal  spin dimensionality for cubic systems
Authors: B. N. Shalaev and S. A. Antonenko and A. I. Sokolov
Abstract: The \sqrt\epsilon-expansions for critical exponents of the weakly-disordered Ising model are calculated up to the five-loop order and found to possess coefficients with irregular signs and values. The estimate n_c = 2.855 for the marginal spin dimensionality of the cubic model is obtained by the Pade-Borel resummation of corresponding five-loop \epsilon-expansion.
