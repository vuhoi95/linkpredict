Title: New bosonization scheme for spin systems in any dimension
Authors: Alexandra Ilinskaia and Kirill Ilinski
Abstract: We present a new representation of spin operators in terms of bosonic creation-annihilation operators. This representation allows us to formulate a new field-theoretical description of spin systems which is free of any constraints. The corresponding functional integral representations for thermodynamic quantities are given and the application to investigations of Long Range Order in the system is discussed.
