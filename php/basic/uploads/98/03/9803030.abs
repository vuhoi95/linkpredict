Title: Analysis of chiral and thermal susceptibilities
Authors: D. Blaschke and A. Hoell and C. D. Roberts and S. Schmidt
Abstract: We calculate the chiral and thermal susceptibilities for two confining Dyson-Schwinger equation models of QCD with two light flavours, a quantitative analysis of which yields the critical exponents, beta and delta, that characterise the second-order chiral symmetry restoration transition. The method itself is of interest, minimising the influence of numerical noise in the calculation of the order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking near the critical temperature. For the more realistic of the two models we find: T_c approx. 153 MeV, and the non-mean-field values: beta = 0.46 +/- 0.04, delta = 4.3 +/- 0.3 and 1/(beta delta)= 0.54 +/- 0.05, which we discuss in comparison with the results of other models.
