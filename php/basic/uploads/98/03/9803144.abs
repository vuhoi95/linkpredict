Title: The effective two-loop Euler-Heisenberg action for scalar and spinor QED  in a general constant background field
Authors: Boris KÃ¶rs and Michael G. Schmidt
Abstract: Using the Worldline formalism of QED we compute the two-loop effective action induced by a charged scalar, respectively spinor particle in a general constant electromagnetic field.
