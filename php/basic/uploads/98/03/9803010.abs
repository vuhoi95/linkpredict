Title: The solution of the N=(0|2) superconformal f-Toda lattice
Authors: V. B. Derjagin and A. N. Leznov and A. Sorin
Abstract: The general solution of the two-dimensional integrable generalization of the f-Toda chain with fixed ends is explicitly presented in terms of matrix elements of various fundamental representations of the SL(n|n-1) supergroup. The dominant role of the representation theory of graded Lie algebras in the problem of constructing integrable mappings and lattices is demonstrated.
