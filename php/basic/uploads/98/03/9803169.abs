Title: Exactly solvable dynamical systems in the neighborhood of the Calogero  model
Authors: Oliver Haschke and Werner Ruehl
Abstract: The Hamiltonian of the $N$-particle Calogero model can be expressed in terms of generators of a Lie algebra for a definite class of representations. Maintaining this Lie algebra, its representations, and the flatness of the Riemannian metric belonging to the second order differential operator, the set of all possible quadratic Lie algebra forms is investigated. For N=3 and N=4 such forms are constructed explicitly and shown to correspond to exactly solvable Sutherland models. The results can be carried over easily to all $N$.
