Title: Anomalies and nonperturbative results
Authors: P. Pronin and K. Stepanyantz
Abstract: We investigate nonperturbative effects in N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric theories using a relation between perturbative and exact anomalies as a starting point. For N=2 supersymmetric SU(n) Yang-Mills theory we derive the general structure of the Picard-Fuchs equations; for N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories we find holomorphic part of the superpotential (with gluino condensate) exactly.
