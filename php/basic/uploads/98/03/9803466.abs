Title: Extra Spacetime Dimensions and Unification
Authors: Keith R. Dienes and Emilian Dudas and Tony Gherghetta
Abstract: We study the effects of extra spacetime dimensions at intermediate mass scales, as expected in string theories with large-radius compactifications, and focus on the gauge and Yukawa couplings within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. We find that extra spacetime dimensions naturally lead to the appearance of grand unified theories at scales substantially below the usual GUT scale. Furthermore, we show that extra spacetime dimensions provide a natural mechanism for explaining the fermion mass hierarchy by permitting the Yukawa couplings to receive power-law corrections. We also discuss how proton-decay constraints may be addressed in this scenario, and suggest that proton-decay amplitudes may be exactly cancelled to all orders in perturbation theory as a result of new Kaluza-Klein selection rules corresponding to the extra spacetime dimensions.
