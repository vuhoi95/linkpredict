Title: Comments on (Non-)Chiral Gauge Theories and Type IIB Branes
Authors: A. Armoni and A. Brandhuber
Abstract: We use type IIB brane configurations which were recently suggested by Hanany and Zaffaroni to study four dimensional N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories. We calculate the one loop beta function and realize Seiberg's duality using a particular configuration. We also comment on the anomaly cancelation condition in the case of chiral theories and the beta function in the case of chiral and SO/Sp theories.
