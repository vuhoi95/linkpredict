Title: Branes and Calibrated Geometries
Authors: Jerome P. Gauntlett and Neil D. Lambert and Peter C. West
Abstract: The fivebrane worldvolume theory in eleven dimensions is known to contain BPS threebrane solitons which can also be interpreted as a fivebrane whose worldvolume is wrapped around a Riemann surface. By considering configurations of intersecting fivebranes and hence intersecting threebrane solitons, we determine the Bogomol'nyi equations for more general BPS configurations. We obtain differential equations, generalising Cauchy-Riemann equations, which imply that the worldvolume of the fivebrane is wrapped around a calibrated geometry.
