Title: Parafermionic Representation of the Affine $sl(2/1)$ Algebra at  Fractional Level
Authors: P. Bowcock and M. Hayes and A. Taormina
Abstract: The four fermionic currents of the affine superalgebra $sl(2/1)$ at fractional level $k=1/u-1$, u positive integer, are shown to be realised in terms of a free scalar field, an $sl(2)$ doublet field and a primary field of the parafermionic algebra $Z_{u-1}$.
