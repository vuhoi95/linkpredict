Title: Explicit Multimonopole Solutions in SU(N) Gauge Theory
Authors: Erick J. Weinberg and Piljin Yi
Abstract: We construct multimonopole solutions containing N-1 distinct fundamental monopoles in SU(N) gauge theory. When the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken to U(1)^{N-1}, the monopoles are all massive, and we show that the fields can be written in terms of elementary function for all values of the monopole positions and phases. In the limit of unbroken U(1) X SU(N-2) X U(1) symmetry, the configuration can be viewed as containing a pair of massive monopoles, each carrying both U(1) and SU(N-2) magnetic charges, together with N-3 massless monopoles that condense into a cloud of non-Abelian fields. We obtain explicit expressions for the fields in the latter case and use these to analyze the properties of the non-Abelian cloud.
