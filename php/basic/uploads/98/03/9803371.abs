Abstract: The magnetic catalysis of discrete chiral symmetry breaking in the 2+1 dimensional Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model is analyzed. A particular attention is paid to a possible application of the effect in solid state physics. The fermion contribution to the thermal conductivity as a function of the dynamical mass (energy gap in the spectrum) is estimated and is shown to be suppressed when a non-zero order parameter develops.
