Title: Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz with Haldane Statistics
Authors: A. G. Bytsko and A. Fring
Abstract: We derive the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equation for the situation inwhich the statistical interaction of a multi-particle system is governed by Haldane statistics. We formulate a macroscopical equivalence principle for such systems. Particular CDD-ambiguities play a distinguished role in compensating the ambiguity in the exclusion statistics. We derive Y-systems related to generalized statistics. We discuss several fermionic, bosonic and anyonic versions of affine Toda field theories and Calogero-Sutherland type models in the context of generalized statistics.
