Title: The WDVV Equations in N=2 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Katsushi Ito and Sung-Kil Yang
Abstract: We present a simple proof of the WDVV equations for the prepotential of four-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with all ADE gauge groups. According to our proof it is clearly seen that the WDVV equations in four dimensions have their origin in the associativity of the chiral ring in two-dimensional topological Landau-Ginzburg models. The WDVV equations for the BC gauge groups are also studied in the Landau-Ginzburg framework. We speculate about the topological field theoretic interpretation of the Seiberg-Witten solution of N=2 Yang-Mills theory.
