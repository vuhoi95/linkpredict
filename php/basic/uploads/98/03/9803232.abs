Title: Equivalence of Geometric Engineering and Hanany-Witten via Fractional  Branes
Authors: Andreas Karch and Dieter Lust and Douglas J. Smith
Abstract: We present an explicit relation between the Hanany-Witten and Geometric Engineering approaches of realising gauge theories in string theory. The last piece in the puzzle is a T-duality relating arbitrary Hanany-Witten setups and fractional branes.
