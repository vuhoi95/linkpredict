Title: Note on the point-splitting procedure to evaluate vacuum fluctuation in  certain cylindrically symmetric backgrounds
Authors: I. Brevik and G. E. A. Matsas and E. S. Moreira Jr
Abstract: We revisit two-point function approaches used to study vacuum fluctuation in wedge-shaped regions and conical backgrounds. Appearance of divergent integrals is discussed and circumvented. The issue is considered in the context of a massless scalar field in cosmic string spacetime.
