Title: Bound States of Dimensionally Reduced {SYM}_{2+1} at Finite N
Authors: Francesco Antonuccio and Oleg Lunin and Stephen S. Pinsky
Abstract: We consider the dimensional reduction of N=1 {SYM}_{2+1} to 1+1 dimensions. The gauge groups we consider are U(N) and SU(N), where N is finite. We formulate the continuum bound state problem in the light-cone formalism, and show that any normalizable SU(N) bound state must be a superposition of an infinite number of Fock states. We also discuss how massless states arise in the DLCQ formulation for certain discretizations.
