Title: Quantization of Chern-Simons Coefficient
Authors: Han-Ying Guo and Wan-Yun Zhao
Abstract: The relation between the Dirac quantization condition of magnetic charge and the quantization of the Chern-Simons coefficient is obtained. It implies that in a (2+1)-dimensional QED with the Chern-Simons topological mass term and the existence of a magnetic monopole with magnetic charge $g$, the Chern-Simons coefficient must be also quantized, just as in the non-Abelian case.
