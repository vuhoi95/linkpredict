Title: Field-antifield formalism in a non-Abelian theory with one and two form  gauge fields coupled in a topological way
Authors: R. Amorim and J. Barcelos-Neto
Abstract: We make a systematic development of the non-Abelian formulation of two-form gauge fields with topological coupling with the Yang-Mills one-form connection. An analysis of the gauge structure, reducibility conditions and physical degrees of freedom is presented. We employ the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism to quantize the resulting theory.
