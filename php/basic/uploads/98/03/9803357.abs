Title: Universal sextic effective interaction at criticality
Authors: A. I. Sokolov and E. V. Orlov and V. A. Ul'kov
Abstract: The renormalization group approach in three dimensions is used to estimate the universal critical value g_6^* of the dimensionless sextic effective coupling constant for the Ising model. The four-loop RG expansion for g_6 is calculated and resummed by means of the Pade-Borel and Pade-Borel-Leroy procedures resulting in g_6^* = 1.596, while the most accurate estimate for g_6^* is argued to be equal to 1.61.
