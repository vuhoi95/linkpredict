Title: A remarkable connection between Yangians and finite W-algebras
Authors: E. Ragoucy and P. Sorba
Abstract: For a large class of finite W algebras, the defining relations of a Yangian are proved to be satisfied. Therefore such finite W algebras appear as realisations of Yangians. This result is useful to determine properties of such W algebra representations.
