Title: Dynamical Supersymmetry Breaking
Authors: Erich Poppitz and Sandip P. Trivedi
Abstract: Dynamical supersymmetry breaking is a fascinating theoretical problem. It is also of phenomenological significance. A better understanding of this phenomenon can help in model building, which in turn is useful in guiding the search for supersymmetry. In this article, we review the recent developments in the field. We discuss a few examples, which allow us to illustrate the main ideas in the subject. In the process, we also show how the techniques of holomorphy and duality come into play. Towards the end we indicate how these developments have helped in the study of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking. The review is intended for someone with a prior knowledge of supersymmetry who wants to find out about the recent progress in this field.
