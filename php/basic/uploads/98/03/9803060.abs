Title: N=1,2 4D Superconformal Field Theories and Supergravity in $AdS_5$
Authors: S. Ferrara and A. Zaffaroni
Abstract: We consider D3 branes world-volume theories substaining $N=1,2$ superconformal field theories. Under the assumption that these theories are dual to $N=2,4$ supergravities in $AdS_5$, we explore the general structure of the latter and discuss some issues when comparing the bulk theory to the boundary singleton theory.
