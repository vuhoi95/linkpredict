Title: Large N limit of orbifold field theories
Authors: Michael Bershadsky and Andrei Johansen
Abstract: We consider certain orbifoldization of the ${\cal N}=4$ field theories that leads to ${\cal N}=2,1,0$ field theories in 4 dimensions. These theories were recently analyzed using the string theory perturbation technique. It was found that in the large $N$ limit all correlation functions of the orbifold theories coincide with those of ${\cal N}=4$, modulo the rescaling of the gauge coupling constant. In this paper we repeat the same analysis using the field theoretical language.
