Title: Geometric Realizations of BPS States in N=2 Theories
Authors: Andrei Mikhailov and Nikita Nekrasov and Savdeep Sethi
Abstract: We study the BPS spectrum of the theory on a D3-brane probe in F theory. The BPS states are realized by multi-string configurations in spacetime. Only certain configurations obeying a selection rule give rise to BPS states in the four-dimensional probe theory. Using these string configurations, we determine the spectrum of N=2 SU(2) Yang-Mills. We also explore the relation between multi-string configurations, M theory membranes and self-dual strings.
