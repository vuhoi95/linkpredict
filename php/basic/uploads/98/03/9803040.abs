Title: Brane-Intersection Dynamics from Branes in Brane Backgrounds
Authors: Joaquim Gomis and David Mateos and Joan Sim√≥n and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: We derive the dynamics of M-brane intersections from the worldvolume action of one brane in the background supergravity solution of another one. In this way we obtain an effective action for the self-dual string boundary of an M2-brane in an M5-brane, and show that the dynamics of the 3-brane intersection of two M5-branes is described by a Dirac-Born-Infeld action.
