Title: Minimal optimal generalized quantum measurements
Authors: J. I. Latorre and P. Pascual and R. Tarrach
Abstract: Optimal and finite positive operator valued measurements on a finite number $N$ of identically prepared systems have been presented recently. With physical realization in mind we propose here optimal and minimal generalized quantum measurements for two-level systems. We explicitly construct them up to N=7 and verify that they are minimal up to N=5. We finally propose an expression which gives the size of the minimal optimal measurements for arbitrary $N$.
