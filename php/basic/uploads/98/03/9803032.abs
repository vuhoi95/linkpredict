Title: Bursts and Shocks in a Continuum Shell Model
Authors: K. H. Andersen and T. Bohr and M. H. Jensen and P. Olesen
Abstract: We study a "burst" event, i. e. the evolution of an initial condition having support only in a finite interval of k-space, in the continuum shell model due to Parisi. We show that the continuum equation without forcing or dissipation can be explicitly written in characteristic form and that the right and left moving parts can be solved exactly. When this is supplemented by the appropriate shock condition it is possible to find the asymptotic form of the burst.
