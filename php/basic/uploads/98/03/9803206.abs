Title: Excitations in the dilute A_L lattice model: E_6, E_7 and E_8 mass  spectra
Authors: M. T. Batchelor and K. A. Seaton
Abstract: On the basis of features observed in the exact perturbation approach solution for the eigenspectrum of the dilute A_3 model, we propose expressions for excitations in the dilute A_4 and A_6 models. Principally, we require that these expressions satisfy the appropriate inversion relations. We demonstrate that they give the expected E_7 and E_6 mass spectra, and universal amplitudes, and agree with numerical expressions for the eigenvalues.
