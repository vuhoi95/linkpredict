Title: Admissible sl(2/1) Characters and Parafermions
Authors: M. Hayes and A. Taormina
Abstract: The branching functions of the affine superalgebra $sl(2/1)$ characters into characters of the affine subalgebra $sl(2)$ are calculated for fractional levels $k=1/u-1$, u positive integer. They involve rational torus $A_{u(u-1)}$ and $Z_{u-1}$ parafermion characters.
