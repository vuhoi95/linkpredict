Title: Supersymmetry in the AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: M. Nishimura and Y. Tanii
Abstract: We study how local symmetry transformations of (p, q) anti de Sitter supergravities in three dimensions act on fields on the two-dimensional boundary. The boundary transformation laws are shown to be the same as those of two-dimensional (p, q) conformal supergravities for p, q \leq 2. Weyl and super Weyl transformations are generated from three-dimensional general coordinate and super transformations.
