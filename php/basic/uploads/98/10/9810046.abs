Title: Non-Local Virasoro Symmetries in the mKdV Hierarchy
Authors: Davide Fioravanti and Marian Stanishkov
Abstract: We generalize the dressing symmetry construction in mKdV hierarchy. This leads to non-local vector fields (expressed in terms of vertex operators) closing a Virasoro algebra. We argue that this algebra realization should play an important role in the study of 2D integrable field theories and in particular should be related to the Deformed Virasoro Algebra (DVA) when the construction is perturbed out of the critical theory.
