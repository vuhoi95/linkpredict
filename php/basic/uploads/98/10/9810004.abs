Title: D-brane Scattering in IIB String Theory and IIB Matrix Model
Authors: Yoshihisa Kitazawa and Hiroyuki Takata
Abstract: We consider two Dirichlet p-branes with lower dimensional brane charges and their scattering. We first calculate the cylinder amplitude of open string with suitable boundary conditions. We compare this result with that in the IIB matrix model. We find the agreement between them in the long distance, low velocity, or large field limit. We also find a way to investigate more general boundary conditions for open string.
