Title: Two different gauge-invariant models in the Lagrangian approach
Authors: Seung-Kook Kim and Yong-Wan Kim and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: We show how to systematically derive the complete set of the gauge transformations of different types of the gauge invariant models, which are the chiral Schwinger and CP$^1$ with Chern-Simons term, in the Lagrangian Formalism.
