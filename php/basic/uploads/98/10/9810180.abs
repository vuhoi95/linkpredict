Title: On the Exotic Phases of M-theory
Authors: R. Argurio and L. Houart
Abstract: We study aspects of the new phases of M-theory recently conjectured using generalised dualities such as timelike T-duality. Our focus is on brane solutions. We derive the intersection rules in a general framework and then specialise to the new phases of M-theory. We discuss under which conditions a configuration with several branes leads to a regular extremal black hole under compactification. We point out that the entropy seems not to be constant when the radius of the physical timelike direction is varied. This could be interpreted as a non-conservation of the entropy (and the mass) under at least some of the new dualities.
