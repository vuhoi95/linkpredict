Title: The Measure from Schwinger-Dyson Equations
Authors: Aleksandar Bogojevic and Dragan S. Popovic
Abstract: We review a new prescription for calculating the Lagrangian path integral measure directly from the Hamiltonian Schwinger-Dyson equations. The method agrees with the usual way of deriving the measure in which one has to perform the path integration over momenta.
