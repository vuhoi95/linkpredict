Title: Properties of Gauged Sigma Models
Authors: R. Percacci and E. Sezgin
Abstract: Nonlinear sigma models arise in supergravity theories with or without matter couplings in various dimensions and they are important in understanding the duality symmetries of M-theory. With this motivation in mind, we review the salient features of gauged and ungauged nonlinear sigma models with or without Wess-Zumino terms for general target spaces in a minimal as well as lifted formulation. Relevant to the question of finding interesting vacua of gauged supergravity theories is the highly constrained potential which arises naturally in these theories. Motivated by this fact, we derive a general and simple formula for a gauge invariant potential of this kind.
