Title: D0-brane description of the charged black hole
Authors: Yuriko Kato and Shin'ichi Nojiri and Akio Sugamoto
Abstract: The charged black hole is considered from the viewpoint of D0-brane in the Matrix theory. It can be obtained from the Kaluza-Klein mechanism by boosting the Schwarzschild black hole in a circle, which is the compactified one dimensional space. Especially, how the extremal limit is realized by the Boltzmann gas of D0-brane, has been shown. In the course of our discussion, the Virial theorem for the statistical average plays an important role.
