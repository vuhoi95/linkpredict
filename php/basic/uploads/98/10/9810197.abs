Title: A Soluble Theory of Massless Scalar QED_2
Authors: F. T. Brandt and Ashok Das and J. Frenkel
Abstract: In this brief report, we analyze a generalized theory of massless scalar QED_2 and show that, unlike the conventional scalar QED_2, it is free from infrared divergence problems. The model is exactly soluble and may describe, in an 1+1 dimensional space-time, noninteracting spin-one tachyons.
