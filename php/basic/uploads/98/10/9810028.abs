Title: The Dynamics of Relativistic Hypersurfaces
Authors: M. D. Maia and E. M. Monte
Abstract: A dynamical theory of hypersurface deformations is presented. It is shown that a (n+1)-dimensional space-time can be always foliated by pure deformations, governed by a non zero Hamiltonian. Quantum deformations states are defined by Schroedinger's equation constructed with the corresponding deformation Hamiltonian operator, interpreted as the generator of the deformation diffeomorphism group. Applications to quantum gravity and to a modified Kaluza-Klein theory are proposed.
