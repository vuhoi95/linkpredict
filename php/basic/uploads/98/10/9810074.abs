Abstract: For nonrelativistic Hamiltonians which are shape invariant, analytic expressions for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be derived using the well known method of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Most of these Hamiltonians also possess spectrum generating algebras and are hence solvable by an independent group theoretic method. In this paper, we demonstrate the equivalence of the two methods of solution by developing an algebraic framework for shape invariant Hamiltonians with a general change of parameters, which involves nonlinear extensions of Lie algebras.
