Title: Minimal coupling and Feynman's proof
Authors: Merced Montesinos and Abdel PÃ©rez-Lorenzana
Abstract: The non quantum relativistic version of the proof of Feynman for the Maxwell equations is discussed in a framework with a minimum number of hypotheses required. From the present point of view it is clear that the classical equations of motion corresponding to the gauge field interactions can be deduced from the minimal coupling rule, and we claim here resides the essence of the proof of Feynman.
