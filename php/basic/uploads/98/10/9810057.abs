Abstract: The algebraic conditions that specific gauged G/H-WZW model have to satisfy in order to give rise to Non-Abelian Toda models with singular metric with or without torsion are found. The classical algebras of symmetries corresponding to grade one rank 2 and 3 singular NA-Toda models are derived.
