Title: Differential dispersion relations with an arbitrary number of  subtractions: a recursive approach
Authors: M. J. Menon and A. E. Motter and B. M. Pimentel
Abstract: Making use of a recursive approach, derivative dispersion relations are generalized for an arbitrary number of subtractions. The results for both cross even and odd amplitudes are theoretically consistent at sufficiently high energies and in the region of small momentum transfer.
