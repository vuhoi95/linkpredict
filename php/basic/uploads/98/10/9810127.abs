Title: Quenched Supersymmetry
Authors: A. Donini and E. Gabrielli and B. Gavela
Abstract: We study the effects of quenching in Super-Yang-Mills theory. While supersymmetry is broken, the lagrangian acquires a new flavour U(1 | 1) symmetry. The anomaly structure thus differs from the unquenched case. We derive the corresponding low-energy effective lagrangian. As a consequence, we predict the mass splitting expected in numerical simulations for particles belonging to the lowest-lying supermultiplet. An estimate of the systematic error due to quenching follows.
