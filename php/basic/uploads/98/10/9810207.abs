Title: Duality, Time-asymmetry and the Condensation of Vacuum
Authors: H. Salehi and H. R. Sepangi
Abstract: A variant of the divergence theory for vacuum-condensation developed in a previous communication is analyzed from the viewpoint of a 'time' asymmetric law in vacuum. This law is found to establish a substantial distinction between dynamically allowed vacuum-configurations related by signature changing duality transformations.
