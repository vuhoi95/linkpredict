Title: Non-Supersymmetric Conformal Field Theories from Stable Anti-de Sitter  Spaces
Authors: Jacques Distler and Frederic Zamora
Abstract: We describe new non-supersymmetric conformal field theories in three and four dimensions, using the CFT/AdS correspondence. In order to believe in their existence at large N_c and strong 't Hooft coupling, we explicitly check the stability of the corresponding non-supersymmetric anti-de Sitter backgrounds. Cases of particular interest are the relevant deformations of the N=4 SCFT in SU(3) and SO(5) invariant directions. It turns out that the former is a stable, and the latter an unstable non-supersymmetric type IIB background.
