Title: Framework for a theory that underlies the standard model
Authors: Marijan Ribaric and Luka Sustersic
Abstract: We put forward the following, physically motivated premise for constructing a theory that underlies the standard model in four-dimensional space-time: The Euler-Lagrange equations of such a theory formally resemble some equations of motion underlying fluid-dynamics equations in the kinetic theory of gases. Following this premise, we point out Lorentz-invariant Lagrangians whose Euler-Lagrange equations contain a subsystem equivalent to the Euler-Lagrange equations of the standard model with covariantly regularized propagators.
