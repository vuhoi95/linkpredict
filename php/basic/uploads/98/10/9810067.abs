Title: Integrable theories in any dimension and homogenous spaces
Authors: Luiz A. Ferreira and Erica E. Leite
Abstract: We construct local zero curvature representations for non-linear sigma models on homogeneous spaces, defined on a space-time of any dimension, following a recently proposed approach to integrable theories in dimensions higher than two. We present some sufficient conditions for the existence of integrable submodels possessing an infinite number of local conservation laws. Examples involving symmetric spaces and group manifolds are given. The $CP^N$ models are discussed in detail.
