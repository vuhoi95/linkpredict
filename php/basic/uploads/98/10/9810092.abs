Title: Creation of photons in an oscillating cavity with two moving mirrors
Authors: Diego A. R. Dalvit and Francisco D. Mazzitelli
Abstract: We study the creation of photons in a one dimensional oscillating cavity with two perfectly conducting moving walls. By means of a conformal transformation we derive a set of generalized Moore's equations whose solution contains the whole information of the radiation field within the cavity. For the case of resonant oscillations we solve these equations using a renormalization group procedure that appropriately deals with the secular behaviour present in a naive perturbative approach. We study the time evolution of the energy density profile and of the number of created photons inside the cavity.
