Title: Dualities of the Matrix Model from T-Duality of the Type II String
Authors: Daniel Brace and Bogdan Morariu and Bruno Zumino
Abstract: We investigate in the Matrix theory framework, the subgroup of dualities of the DLCQ of M-theory compactified on three-tori, which corresponds to T-duality in the auxiliary Type II string theory. We show how these dualities are realized in the supersymmetric Yang-Mills gauge theories on dual noncommutative three-tori.
