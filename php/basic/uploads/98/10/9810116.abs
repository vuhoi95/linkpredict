Title: U-Duality of Born-Infeld on the Noncommutative Two-Torus
Authors: C. Hofman and E. Verlinde
Abstract: We discuss Born-Infeld on the noncommutative two-torus as a description of compactified string theory. We show that the resulting theory, including the fluctuations, is manifestly invariant under the T-duality group SO(2,2;Z). The BPS mass even has a full SL(3,Z)xSL(2,Z) U-duality symmetry. The direct identification of the noncommutative parameter \theta with the B-field modulus however seems to be problematic at finite volume.
