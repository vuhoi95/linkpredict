Title: Topological Twistons in Crystalline Polyethylene
Authors: D. Bazeia and E. Ventura
Abstract: We introduce an alternate model to describe twistons in crystalline polyethylene. The model couples torsional and longitudinal degrees of freedom and appears as an extension of a model that describes only the torsional motion. We find exact solutions that describe stable topological twistons, in good agreement with the torsional and longitudinal interactions in polyethylene.
