Title: Exclusion Statistics in Conformal Field Theory -- generalized fermions  and spinons for level-1 WZW theories
Authors: P. Bouwknegt and K. Schoutens
Abstract: We systematically study the exclusion statistics for quasi-particles for Conformal Field Theory spectra by employing a method based on recursion relations for truncated spectra. Our examples include generalized fermions in c<1 unitary minimal models, Z_k parafermions, and spinons for the su(n)_1, so(n)_1 and sp(2n)_1 Wess-Zumino-Witten models. For some of the latter examples we present explicit expressions for finitized affine characters and for the N-spinon decomposition of affine characters.
