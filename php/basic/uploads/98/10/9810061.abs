Title: Vortices and extreme black holes: the question of flux expulsion
Authors: Filipe Bonjour and Roberto Emparan and Ruth Gregory
Abstract: It has been claimed that extreme black holes exhibit a phenomenon of flux expulsion for abelian Higgs vortices, irrespective of the relative width of the vortex to the black hole. Recent work by two of the authors showed a subtlety in the treatment of the event horizon, which cast doubt on this claim. We analyse in detail the vortex/extreme black hole system, showing that while flux expulsion can occur, it does not do so in all cases. We give analytic proofs for both expulsion and penetration of flux, in each case deriving a bound for that behaviour. We also present extensive numerical work backing up, and refining, these claims, and showing in detail how a vortex can end on a black hole in all situations. We also calculate the backreaction of the vortex on the geometry, and comment on the more general vortex-black hole system.
