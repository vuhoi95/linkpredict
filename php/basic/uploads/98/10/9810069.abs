Title: The Hagedorn Transition, Deconfinement and the AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: S. Kalyana Rama and B. Sathiapalan
Abstract: A connection between the Hagedorn transition in string theory and the deconfinement transition in (non-supersymmetric) Yang-Mills theory is made using the AdS/CFT correspondence. We modify the model of zero temperature QCD proposed by Witten by compactifying an additional space-time coordinate with supersymmetry breaking boundary conditions thus introducing a finite temperature in the boundary theory. There is a Hagedorn-like transition associated with winding modes around this coordinate, which signals a topology changing phase transition to a new AdS/Schwarzschild blackhole where this coordinate is the time coordinate. In the boundary gauge theory time like Wilson loops acquire an expectation value above this temperature.
