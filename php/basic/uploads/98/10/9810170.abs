Title: Thermodynamics of D0-branes in matrix theory
Authors: J. Ambj√∏rn and Yu. M. Makeenko and G. W. Semenoff
Abstract: We examine the matrix theory representation of D0-brane dynamics at finite temperature. In this case, violation of supersymmetry by temperature leads to a non-trivial static potential between D0-branes at any finite temperature. We compute the static potential in the 1-loop approximation and show that it is short-ranged and attractive. We compare the result with the computations in superstring theory. We show that thermal states of D0-branes can be reproduced by matrix theory only when certain care is taken in integration over the moduli space of classical solutions in compactified time.
