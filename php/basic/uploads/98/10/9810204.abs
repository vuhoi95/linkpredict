Title: Black Holes of D=5 Supergravity
Authors: J. P. Gauntlett and R. C. Myers and P. K. Townsend
Abstract: We discuss some general features of black holes of five-dimensional supergravity, such as the first law of black hole mechanics. We also discuss some special features of rotating supersymmetric black holes. In particular, we show that the horizon is a non-singular, and {\sl non-rotating}, null hypersurface whose intersection with a Cauchy surface is a squashed 3-sphere. We find the Killing spinors of the near-horizon geometry and thereby determine the near-horizon isometry supergroup.
