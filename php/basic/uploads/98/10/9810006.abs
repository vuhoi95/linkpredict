Authors: A. A. Andrianov and M. V. Ioffe and D. N. Nishnianidze
Abstract: A class of integrable 2-dim classical systems with integrals of motion of fourth order in momenta is obtained from the quantum analogues with the help of deformed SUSY algebra. With similar technique a new class of potentials connected with Lax method is found which provides the integrability of corresponding 2-dim hamiltonian systems. In addition, some integrable 2-dim systems with potentials expressed in elliptic functions are explored.
