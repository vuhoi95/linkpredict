Title: D-particles, Matrix Integrals and KP hierachy
Authors: Vladimir A. Kazakov and Ivan K. Kostov and Nikita Nekrasov
Abstract: We study the regularized correlation functions of the light-like coordinate operators in the reduction to zero dimensions of the matrix model describing $D$-particles in four dimensions. We investigate in great detail the related matrix model originally proposed and solved in the planar limit by J. Hoppe. It also gives the solution of the problem of 3-coloring of planar graphs. We find interesting strong/weak 't Hooft coupling dependence. The partition function of the grand canonical ensemble turns out to be a tau-function of KP hierarchy. As an illustration of the method we present a new derivation of the large-N and double-scaling limits of the one-matrix model with cubic potential.
