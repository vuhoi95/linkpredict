Title: Quantum Caustics for Systems with Quadratic Lagrangians
Authors: K. Horie and H. Miyazaki and I. Tsutsui and S. Tanimura
Abstract: We study caustics in classical and quantum mechanics for systems with quadratic Lagrangians. We derive a closed form of the transition amplitude on caustics and discuss their physical implications in the Gaussian slit (gedanken-)experiment. Application to the quantum mechanical rotor casts doubt on the validilty of Jevicki's correspondence hypothesis which states that in quantum mechanics, stationary points(instantons) arise as simple poles.
