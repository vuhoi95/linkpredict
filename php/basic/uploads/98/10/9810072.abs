Title: Noncommutative Geometry From Strings and Branes
Authors: F. Ardalan and H. Arfaei and M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari
Abstract: Noncommutative torus compactification of Matrix model is shown to be a direct consequence of quantization of the open strings attached to a D-membrane with a non-vanishing background $B$ field. We calculate the BPS spectrum of such a brane system using both string theory results and DBI action. The DBI action leads to a new transformation property of the compactification radii under the $SL(2,Z)_N$ transformations.
