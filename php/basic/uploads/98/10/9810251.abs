Title: Entropy of 2D black holes from counting microstates
Authors: Mariano Cadoni and Salvatore Mignemi
Abstract: We present a microscopical derivation of the entropy of the black hole solutions of the Jackiw-Teitelboim theory. We show that the asymptotic symmetry of two-dimensional (2D) Anti-de Sitter space is generated by a central extension of the Virasoro algebra. Using a canonical realization of this symmetry and Cardy's formula we calculate the statistical entropy of 2D black holes, which turns out to agree, up to a factor $\sqrt 2$, with the thermodynamical result.
