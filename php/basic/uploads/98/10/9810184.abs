Title: On the Integrability of the Bukhvostov-Lipatov Model
Authors: Marco Ameduri and Costas J. Efthimiou and Bogomil Gerganov
Abstract: The integrability of the Bukhvostov-Lipatov four-fermion model is investigated. It is shown that the classical model possesses a current of Lorentz spin 3, conserved both in the bulk and on the half-line for specific types of boundary actions. It is then established that the conservation law is spoiled at the quantum level -- a fact that might indicate that the quantum Bukhvostov-Lipatov model is not integrable, contrary to what was previously believed.
