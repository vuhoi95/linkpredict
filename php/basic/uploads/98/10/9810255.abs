Title: Calogero model and sL(2,R) algebra
Authors: C. Gonera and P. Kosinski
Abstract: The Calogero model with external harmonic oscillator potential is discussed from sL(2,R) algebra point of view. Explicit formulae for functions with exponential time behaviour are given; in particular, the integrals of motion are constructed and their involutiveness demonstrated. The superintegrability of the model appears to be a simple consequence of the formalism.
