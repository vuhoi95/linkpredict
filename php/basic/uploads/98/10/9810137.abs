Title: The CNM-Hypermultiplet Nexus
Authors: S. James Gates, Jr. and Sergei M. Kuzenko
Abstract: We consider additional properties of CNM (chiral-nonminimal) models. We show how 4D, N = 2 nonlinear sigma-models can be described solely in terms of N = 1 superfield CNM doublets. These actions are described by a Kahler potential together with an infinite number (in the general case) of terms involving its successively higher derivatives. We briefly discuss how N = 2 supersymmetric extension of the previously proposed N = 1 CNM low-energy QCD effective action can be achieved
