Title: Wigner Trajectory Characteristics in Phase Space and Field Theory
Authors: Thomas Curtright and Cosmas Zachos
Abstract: Exact characteristic trajectories are specified for the time-propagating Wigner phase-space distribution function. They are especially simple---indeed, classical---for the quantized simple harmonic oscillator, which serves as the underpinning of the field theoretic Wigner functional formulation introduced. Scalar field theory is thus reformulated in terms of distributions in field phase space. Applications to duality transformations in field theory are discussed.
