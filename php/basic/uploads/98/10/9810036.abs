Title: Baryonic thermal fluctuations in finite temperature QCD
Authors: Vicente Azcoiti and Angelo Galante
Abstract: We show how, contrary to physical intuition, thermal fluctuations of physical states having a non-vanishing baryonic number can be fully neglected in the thermodynamics of QCD at any physical temperature. We also discuss on the consistency between our results and the CPT theorem. The last part of this article is devoted to comment some interesting physical features which follow from this result.
