Authors: I. Bandos and E. Ivanov and A. Kapustnikov and S. Ulanov
Abstract: We present the general solution of the system of coupled nonlinear equations describing dynamics of $D$--dimensional bosonic string in the geometric (or embedding) approach. The solution is parametrized in terms of two sets of the left- and right-moving Lorentz harmonic variables providing a special coset space realization of the product of two (D-2)- dimensional spheres $S^{D-2}={SO(1,D-1) \over SO(1,1) \times SO(D-2) \semiprod K_{D-2}}.$
