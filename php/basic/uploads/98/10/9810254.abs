Title: N=1 Supersymmetric Gauge Theories and Supersymmetric 3-cycles
Authors: Andreas Karch and Dieter Lust and Andre Miemiec
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the strong coupling limit of chiral N=1 supersymmetric gauge theory via their embedding into M-theory. In particular we focus on the brane box models of Hanany and Zaffaroni and show that after a T-duality transformation their M-theory embedding is described by supersymmetric 3-cycles; its geometry will encode the holomorphic non-perturbative information about the gauge theory.
