Title: Quantum Measurements, Information and Entropy Production
Authors: Y. N. Srivastava and G. Vitiello and A. Widom
Abstract: In order to understand the Landau-Lifshitz conjecture on the relationship between quantum measurements and the thermodynamic second law, we discuss the notion of ``diabatic'' and ``adiabatic'' forces exerted by the quantum object on the classical measurement apparatus. The notion of heat and work in measurements is made manifest in this approach, and the relationship between information entropy and thermodynamic entropy is explored.
