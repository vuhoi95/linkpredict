Title: New Confining N=1 Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
Authors: Csaba Csaki and Hitoshi Murayama
Abstract: We examine N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories which confine in the presence of a tree-level superpotential. We show the confining spectra which satisfy the 't Hooft anomaly matching conditions and give a simple method to find the confining superpotential. Using this method we fix the confining superpotentials in the simplest cases, and show how these superpotentials are generated by multi-instanton effects in the dual theory. These new type of confining theories may be useful for model building, since the size of the matter content is not restricted by an index constraint. Therefore, one expects that a large variety of new confining spectra can be obtained using such models.
