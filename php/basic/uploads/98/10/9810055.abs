Title: The q-characters of representations of quantum affine algebras and  deformations of W-algebras
Authors: Edward Frenkel and Nicolai Reshetikhin
Abstract: We propose the notion of q-characters for finite-dimensional representations of quantum affine algebras. It is motivated by our theory of deformed W-algebras. We show that the q-characters give rise to a homomorphism from the Grothendieck ring of representations of a quantum affine algebra to a polynomial ring. We conjecture that the image of this homomorphism is equal to the intersection of certain "screening operators". We also discuss the connection between q-characters and Bethe Ansatz.
