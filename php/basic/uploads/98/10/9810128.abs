Title: On The Field Theory Limit Of D-Instantons
Authors: Hirosi Ooguri and Kostas Skenderis
Abstract: We study the dilaton/axion configuration near D-instantons in type IIB superstring theory. In the field theory limit, the metric near the instantons becomes flat in the string frame as well as in the Einstein frame. In the large N limit, the string coupling constant becomes zero except near the origin. The supersymmetry of this configuration is analyzed. An implication of this result to the IIB Matrix Model is discussed.
