Title: D3-branes dynamics and black holes
Authors: M. Bertolini and P. Fre` and R. Iengo and C. A. Scrucca
Abstract: Using the D3-brane as the fundamental tool, we adress two aspects of D-branes physics. The first regards the interaction between two electromagnetic dual D-branes in 10 dimensions. In particular, we give a meaning to {\it both} even and odd spin structure contributions, the latter being non vanishing for non zero relative velocity $v$ (and encoding the Lorentz-like contribution). The second aspect regards the D-brane/black holes correspondence. We show how the 4 dimensional configuration corresponding to a {\it single} D3-brane wrapped on the orbifold T^6/Z_3 represents a regular Reissner-Nordstrom solution of d=4 N=2 supergravity
