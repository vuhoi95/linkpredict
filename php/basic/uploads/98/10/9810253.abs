Title: Calculable Dynamical Supersymmetry Breaking on Deformed Moduli Spaces
Authors: Z. Chacko and Markus A. Luty and Eduardo Ponton
Abstract: We consider models of dynamical supersymmetry breaking in which the extremization of a tree-level superpotential conflicts with a quantum constraint. We show that in such models the low-energy effective theory near the origin of moduli space is an O'Raifeartaigh model, and the sign of the mass-squared for the pseudo-flat direction at the origin is calculable. We analyze vector-like models with gauge groups SU(N) and Sp(2N) with and without global symmetries. In all cases there is a stable minimum at the origin with an unbroken U(1)_R symmetry.
