Title: Generalized Rarita-Schwinger Equations
Authors: I. Lovas and K. Sailer and W. Greiner
Abstract: The Rarita-Schwinger equations are generalised for the delta baryon having spin 3/2 and isospin 3/2. The coupling of the nucleon and the delta fields is studied. A possible generalisation of the Walecka model is proposed.
