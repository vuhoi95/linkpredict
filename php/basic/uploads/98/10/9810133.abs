Title: Effective action for Dirac spinors in the uniform electromagnetic  background fields
Authors: Roberto Soldati and Lorenzo Sorbo
Abstract: Some new expressions are found, concerning the effective action as a regularized path-integral for Dirac's spinors in {\it 3+1} dimensions, in the presence of general uniform (i.e., constant and homogeneous) electric and magnetic fields. The rate of $e^+e^-$ pairs production is computed and briefly discussed.
