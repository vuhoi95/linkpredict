Title: Dual D-Brane Actions on $AdS^5 \times S^5$
Authors: Jaemo Park and Soo-Jong Rey
Abstract: Utilizing coset superspace approach, dual actions of super D1-and D3-branes on $AdS_5 \times S^5$ are constructed by carrying out duality transformation of world-volume U(1) gauge field. Resulting world-volume actions are shown to possess expected SL(2,{\bf Z}) properties. Crucial ingredient for deriving SL(2, {\bf Z}) transformation property of the D-brane actions is covariance of SU(2,2|4) coset superspace algebra under SO(2) rotation between two ten-dimensional Type IIB Majorana-Weyl spinors.
