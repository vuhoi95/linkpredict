Title: Multidimensional Bosonization
Authors: A. Houghton and H. -J. Kwon and J. B. Marston
Abstract: Bosonization of degenerate fermions yields insight both into Landau Fermi liquids, and into non-Fermi liquids. We begin our review with a pedagogical introduction to bosonization, emphasizing its applicability in spatial dimensions greater than one. After a brief historical overview, we present the essentials of the method. Well known results of Landau theory are recovered, demonstrating that this new tool of many-body theory is robust. Limits of multidimensional bosonization are tested by considering several examples of non-Fermi liquids, in particular the composite fermion theory of the half-filled Landau level. Nested Fermi surfaces present a different challenge, and these may be relevant in the cuprate superconductors. We conclude by discussing the future of multidimensional bosonization.
