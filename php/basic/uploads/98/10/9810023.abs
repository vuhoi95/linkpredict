Title: Minimal conditions for the creation of a Friedman-Robertson-Walker  universe from a "bounce"
Authors: Carmen Molina-Paris and Matt Visser
Abstract: We investigate the minimal conditions under which the creation of our universe might arise due to a "bounce" from a previous collapse, rather than an explosion from a big-bang singularity. Such a bounce is sometimes referred to as a Tolman wormhole. We subject the bounce to a general model-independent analysis along the lines of that applied to the Morris-Thorne traversable wormholes, and show that there is always an open temporal region surrounding the bounce over which the strong energy condition (SEC) must be violated. On the other hand, all the other energy conditions can easily be satisfied. In particular, we exhibit an inflation-inspired model in which a big bounce is "natural".
