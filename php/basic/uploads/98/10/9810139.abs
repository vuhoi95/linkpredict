Title: Resonance NLS Solitons as Black Holes in Madelung Fluid
Authors: Oktay K. Pashaev and Jyh-Hao Lee
Abstract: A new resonance version of NLS equation is found and embedded to the reaction-diffusion system, equivalent to the anti-de Sitter valued Heisenberg model, realizing a particular gauge fixing condition of the Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. The space-time points where dispersion change the sign correspond to the event horizon, and the soliton solutions to the AdS black holes. The soliton with velocity bounded above describes evolution on the hyperboloid with nontrivial winding number and create under collisions the resonance states with a specific life time.
