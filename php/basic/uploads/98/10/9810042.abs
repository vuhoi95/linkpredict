Title: Octonionic Gravitational Instantons
Authors: I. Bakas and E. Floratos and A. Kehagias
Abstract: We construct eight-dimensional gravitational instantons by solving appropriate self-duality equations for the spin-connection. The particular gravitational instanton we present has $Spin(7)$ holonomy and, in a sense, it is the eight-dimensional analog of the Eguchi-Hanson 4D space. It has a removable bolt singularity which is topologically S^4 and its boundary at infinity is the squashed S^7. We also lift our solutions to ten and eleven dimensions and construct fundamental string and membrane configurations that preserve 1/16 of the original supersymmetries.
