Title: Weyl Anomaly in Higher Dimensions and Feynman Rules in Coordinate Space
Authors: Shoichi Ichinose and Noriaki Ikeda
Abstract: An algorithm to obtain the Weyl anomaly in higher dimensions is presented. It is based on the heat-kernel method. Feynman rules, such as the vertex rule and the propagator rule, are given in (regularized) coordinate space. Graphical calculation is introduced. The 6 dimensional scalar-gravity theory is taken as an example, and its explicit result is obtained.
