Title: New IR Dualities in Supersymmetric Gauge Theory in Three Dimensions
Authors: Micha Berkooz and Anton Kapustin
Abstract: We present nontrivial examples of d=3 gauge theories with sixteen and eight supercharges which are infrared dual at special points in the moduli space. This duality is distinct from mirror symmetry. To demonstrate duality we construct the gauge theories of interest using D2-branes and orientifolds and then consider their lift to M-theory. We also discuss the strong coupling limit of orientifold two-planes and orbifolds of orientifold six-planes.
