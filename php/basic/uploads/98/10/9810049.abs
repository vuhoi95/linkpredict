Title: Gravitational field of vacuumless defects
Authors: Inyong Cho and Alexander Vilenkin
Abstract: It has been recently shown that topological defects can arise in symmetry breaking models where the scalar field potential $V(\phi)$ has no minima and is a monotonically decreasing function of $|\phi|$. Here we study the gravitational fields produced by such vacuumless defects in the cases of both global and gauge symmetry breaking. We find that a global monopole has a strongly repulsive gravitational field, and its spacetime has an event horizon similar to that in de Sitter space. A gauge monopole spacetime is essentially that of a magnetically charged black hole. The gravitational field of a global string is repulsive and that of a gauge string is attractive at small distances and repulsive at large distances. Both gauge and global string spacetimes have singularities at a finite distance from the string core.
