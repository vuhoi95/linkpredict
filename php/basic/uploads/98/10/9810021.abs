Title: Tree Level Supergravity and the Matrix Model
Authors: Michael Dine and Robert Echols and Joshua P. Gray
Abstract: It has recently been shown that the Matrix model and supergravity give the same predictions for three graviton scattering. This contradicts an earlier claim in the literature (hep-th/9710174). We explain the error in this earlier work, and go on to show that certain terms in the $n$-graviton scattering amplitude involving $v^{2n}$ are given correctly by the Matrix model. The Matrix model also generates certain $v^6$ terms in four graviton scattering at three loops, which do not seem to have any counterparts in supergravity. The connection of these results with nonrenormalization theorems is discussed.
