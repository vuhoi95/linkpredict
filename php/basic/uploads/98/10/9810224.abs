Abstract: The complete phase diagram of objects in M-theory compactified on tori $T^p$, $p=1,2,3$, is elaborated. Phase transitions occur when the object localizes on cycle(s) (the Gregory-Laflamme transition), or when the area of the localized part of the horizon becomes one in string units (the Horowitz-Polchinski correspondence point). The low-energy, near-horizon geometry that governs a given phase can match onto a variety of asymptotic regimes. The analysis makes it clear that the matrix conjecture is a special case of the Maldacena conjecture.
