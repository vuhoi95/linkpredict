Title: 3-Sasakian Manifolds
Authors: Charles P. Boyer and Krzysztof Galicki
Abstract: This is an expository paper describing the geometry of certain Sasakian-Einstein manifolds. Such manifolds have recently become of interest due to Maldacena's AdS/CFT conjecture. They describe near-horizon geometries of branes at conical singularities.
