Title: A Modified Scheme of Triplectic Quantization
Authors: B. Geyer and D. M. Gitman and P. M. Lavrov
Abstract: A modified version of triplectic quantization, first introduce by Batalin and Martnelius, is proposed which makes use of two independent master equations, one for the action and one for the gauge functional such that the initial classical action also obeys that master equation.
