Title: Numerical study of the decay amplitudes in two dimensional QCD
Authors: E. Abdalla and N. Alves
Abstract: After presenting a survey of theoretical results concerning the structure of two-dimensional QCD, we present a numerical study related to the mass eigenstates and the decay amplitudes of higher mesonic states. We discuss in detail the fate of important dynamical points such as stability of the spectrum and the problem of screening versus confinement in this context. We point out differences in the large distance behaviour of the potential, which can be responsible for the question of stability of the spectrum, as well as whether it is finite.
