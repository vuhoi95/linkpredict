Title: The Role of Conformal Symmetry in Abelian Bosonization of the Massive  Thirring Model
Authors: Aleksandar Bogojevic and Branislav Sazdovic and Olivera Miskovic
Abstract: We show equivalence between the massive Thirring model and the sine-Gordon theory by gauge fixing a wider gauge invariant theory in two different ways. The exact derivation of the equivalence hinges on the existence of an underlying conformal symmetry. Previous derivations were all perturbative in mass (althought to all orders).
