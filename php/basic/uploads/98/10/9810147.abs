Title: On noncommutative Nahm transform
Authors: A. Astashkevich and N. Nekrasov and A. Schwarz
Abstract: Motivated by the recently observed relation between the physics of $D$-branes in the background of $B$-field and the noncommutative geometry we study the analogue of Nahm transform for the instantons on the noncommutative torus.
