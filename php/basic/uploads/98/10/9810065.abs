Title: Effective Actions for 0+1 Dimensional Scalar QED and its SUSY  Generalization at $T\neq 0$
Authors: J. Barcelos-Neto and Ashok Das
Abstract: We compute the effective actions for the 0+1 dimensional scalar field interacting with an Abelian gauge background, as well as for its supersymmetric generalization at finite temperature.
