Abstract: In 2+1 dimensions, for low momenta, using dimensional renormalization we study the effect of a Chern-Simons field on the perturbative expansion of fermions self interacting through a Gross Neveu coupling. For the case of just one fermion field, we verify that the dimension of operators of canonical dimension lower than three decreases as a function of the Chern-Simons coupling.
