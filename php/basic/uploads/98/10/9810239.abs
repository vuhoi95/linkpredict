Title: Non-holomorphic effective potential in N = 4 SU(n) SYM
Authors: E. I. Buchbinder and I. L. Buchbinder and S. M. Kuzenko
Abstract: We compute the one-loop non-holomorphic effective potential for the N=4 SU(n) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with the gauge symmetry broken down to the maximal torus. Our approach remains powerful for arbitrary gauge groups and is based on the use of N=2 harmonic superspace formulation for general N=2 Yang-Mills theories along with the superfield background field method.
