Title: On Vanishing Two Loop Cosmological Constants in Nonsupersymmetric  Strings
Authors: Shamit Kachru and Eva Silverstein
Abstract: It has recently been suggested that in certain special nonsupersymmetric type II string compactifications, at least the first two perturbative contributions to the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ vanish. Support for perturbative vanishing beyond 1-loop (as well as evidence for the absence of some nonperturbative contributions) has come from duality arguments. There was also a direct 2-loop computation which was incomplete; in this note we explain the deficiency of the previous 2-loop calculation and discuss the complete 2-loop computation in two different models. The corrected analysis yields a vanishing 2-loop contribution to $\Lambda$ in these models.
