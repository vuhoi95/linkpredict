Title: Harmonic Sums and Mellin Transforms up to two-loop Order
Authors: J. Bl√ºmlein and S. Kurth
Abstract: A systematic study is performed on the finite harmonic sums up to level four. These sums form the general basis for the Mellin transforms of all individual functions $f_i(x)$ of the momentum fraction $x$ emerging in the quantities of massless QED and QCD up to two--loop order, as the unpolarized and polarized splitting functions, coefficient functions, and hard scattering cross sections for space and time-like momentum transfer. The finite harmonic sums are calculated explicitly in the linear representation. Algebraic relations connecting these sums are derived to obtain representations based on a reduced set of basic functions. The Mellin transforms of all the corresponding Nielsen functions are calculated.
