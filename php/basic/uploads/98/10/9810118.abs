Title: Aspects of the Supersymmetry Algebra in Four Dimensional Euclidean Space
Authors: D. G. C. McKeon and T. N. Sherry
Abstract: The simplest supersymmetry (SUSY) algebra in four dimensional Euclidean space ($4dE$) has been shown to closely resemble the $N = 2$ SUSY algebra in four dimensional Minkowski space ($4dM$). The structure of the former algebra is examined in greater detail in this paper. We first present its Clifford algebra structure. This algebra shows that the momentum Casimir invariant of physical states has an upper bound which is fixed by the central charges. Secondly, we use reduction of the $N = 1$ SUSY algebra in six dimensional Minkowski space ($6dM$) to $4dE$; this reproduces our SUSY algebra in $4dE$. Moreover, this same reduction of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (SSYM) in $6dM$ reproduces Zumino's SSYM in $4dE$. We demonstrate how this dimensional reduction can be used to introduce additional generators into the SUSY algebra in $4dE$.
