Title: Fermionic flows and tau function of the N=(1|1) superconformal Toda  lattice hierarchy
Authors: Olaf Lechtenfeld and Alexander Sorin
Abstract: An infinite class of fermionic flows of the N=(1|1) superconformal Toda lattice hierarchy is constructed and their algebraic structure is studied. We completely solve the semi-infinite N=(1|1) Toda lattice and chain hierarchies and derive their tau functions, which may be relevant for building supersymmetric matrix models. Their bosonic limit is also discussed.
