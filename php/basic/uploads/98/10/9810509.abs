Title: Quintessential inflation
Authors: P. J. E. Peebles and A. Vilenkin
Abstract: We present an explicit observationally acceptable model for evolution from inflation to the present epoch under the assumption that the entropy and matter of the familiar universe are from gravitational particle production at the end of inflation. This eliminates the problem of finding a satisfactory coupling of the inflaton and matter fields. Since the inflaton potential $V(\phi)$ may be a monotonic function of the inflaton $\phi$, the inflaton energy could produce an observationally significant effective cosmological constant, as in quintessence.
