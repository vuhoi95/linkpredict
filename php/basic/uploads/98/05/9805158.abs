Title: Supersymmetric Gauge Theories from Branes and Orientifold Six-planes
Authors: Karl Landsteiner and Esperanza Lopez and David A. Lowe
Abstract: We study brane configurations in the presence of orientifold six-planes. After deriving the curves for N=2 supersymmetric SU(Nc) gauge theories with one flavor in the symmetric or antisymmetric representation and Nf fundamental flavors, we rotate the brane configuration, reducing the supersymmetry to N=1. For the case of an antisymmetric flavor and less than two fundamental flavors, nonperturbative effects lead to a brane configuration that is topologically a torus. Using the description of the orientifold six-planes as Dn singularities we discuss the Higgs branches for N=2 brane configurations with Sp/SO gauge groups and the related N=1 theories with tensor representations.
