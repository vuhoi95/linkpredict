Title: Invariant Regularization of Supersymmetric Chiral Gauge Theory. II
Authors: Takuya Hayashi and Yoshihisa Ohshima and Kiyoshi Okuyama and Hiroshi Suzuki
Abstract: By undertaking additional analyses postponed in a previous paper, we complete our construction of a manifestly supersymmetric gauge-covariant regularization of supersymmetric chiral gauge theories. We present the following: An evaluation of the covariant gauge anomaly; a proof of the integrability of the covariant gauge current in anomaly-free cases; a calculation of a one-loop superconformal anomaly in the gauge supermultiplet sector. On the last point, we find that the ghost-anti-ghost supermultiplet and the Nakanishi-Lautrup supermultiplet give rise to BRST exact contributions which, due to ``tree-level'' Slavnov-Taylor identities in our regularization scheme, can safely be neglected, at least at the one-loop level.
