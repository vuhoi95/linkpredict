Title: Interference Phenomenon for Different Chiral Bosonization Schemes
Authors: Everton M. C. Abreu and Clovis Wotzasek
Abstract: We study, in the framework put forward by Siegel\cite{WS} and by Floreanini and Jackiw\cite{FJ} (FJ), the relationship between different chiral bosonization schemes (CBS). This is done in the context of the soldering formalism\cite{MS}, that considers the phenomenon of interference in the quantum field theory\cite{ABW}. We propose a field redefinition that discloses the presence of a noton, a nonmover field, in Siegel's formulation for chiral bosons. The presence of a noton in the Siegel CBS is a new and surprising result, that separates dynamics from symmetry. While the FJ component describes the dynamics, it is the noton that carries the symmetry contents, acquiring dynamics upon quantization and is fully responsible for the Siegel anomaly. The diagonal representation proposed here is used to study the effect of quantum interference between gauged rightons and leftons.
