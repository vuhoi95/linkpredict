Title: Whitham Hierarchies, Instanton Corrections and Soft Supersymmetry  Breaking in N=2 SU(N) Super Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Jose D. Edelstein and Marcos Marino and Javier Mas
Abstract: We study N=2 super Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU(N) from the point of view of the Whitham hierarchy. We develop a new recursive method to compute the whole instanton expansion of the prepotential using the theta function associated to the root lattice of the group. Explicit results for the one and two-instanton corrections in SU(N) are presented. Interpreting the slow times of the hierarchy as additional couplings, we show how they can be promoted to spurion superfields that softly break N=2 supersymmetry down to N=0. This provides a family of nonsupersymmetric deformations of the theory, associated to higher Casimir operators of the gauge group. The SU(3) theory is analyzed in some detail.
