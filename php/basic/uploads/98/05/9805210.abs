Title: The Wilson Renormalization Group Approach of the Principal Chiral Model  around Two Dimensions
Authors: B. Delamotte and D. Mouhanna and P. Lecheminant
Abstract: We study the Principal Chiral Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson model around two dimensions within the Local Potential Approximation of an Exact Renormalization Group equation. This model, relevant for the long distance physics of classical frustrated spin systems, exhibits a fixed point of the same universality class that the corresponding Non-Linear Sigma model. This allows to shed light on the long-standing discrepancy between the different perturbative approaches of frustrated spin systems.
