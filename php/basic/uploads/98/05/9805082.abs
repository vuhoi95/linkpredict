Title: Critical energy flux and mass in solvable theories of 2d dilaton gravity
Authors: A. Fabbri and J. Navarro-Salas
Abstract: In this paper we address the issue of determining the semiclassical threshold for black hole formation in the context of a one-parameter family of theories which continuously interpolates between the RST and BPP models. We find that the results depend significantly on the initial static configuration of the spacetime geometry before the influx of matter is turned on. In some cases there is a critical energy density, given by the Hawking rate of evaporation, as well as a critical mass $m_{cr}$ (eventually vanishing). In others there is neither $m_{cr}$ nor a critical flux.
