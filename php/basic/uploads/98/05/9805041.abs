Title: Vacua of M-theory and string theory
Authors: R. Kallosh and A. Rajaraman
Abstract: We argue that supersymmetric higher-dimension operators in the effective actions of M-theory and IIB string theory do not affect the maximally supersymmetric vacua: $adS_4\times S^7$ and $adS_7\times S^4$ in M-theory and $adS_5\times S^5$ in IIB string theory. All these vacua are described in superspace by a fixed point with all components of supertorsion and supercurvature being supercovariantly constant. This follows from 32 unbroken supersymmetries and allows us to prove that such vacua are exact.
