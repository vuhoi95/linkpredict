Title: Self-Duality and New TQFTs for Forms
Authors: Laurent Baulieu and Eliezer Rabinovici
Abstract: We discuss theories containing higher-order forms in various dimensions. We explain how Chern--Simons-type theories of forms can be defined from TQFTs in one less dimension. We also exhibit new TQFTs with interacting Yang--Mills fields and higher--order forms. They are obtained by the dimensional reduction of TQFTs whose gauge functions are free self-duality equations. Interactions are due to the gauging of global internal symmetries after dimensional reduction. We list possible symmetries and give a brief discussion on the possible relation of such systems to interacting field theories.
