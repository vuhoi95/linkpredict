Authors: Maximo Banados and Karin Bautier and Olivier Coussaert and Marc Henneaux and Miguel Ortiz
Abstract: Anti-de Sitter supergravity models are considered in three dimensions. Precise asymptotic conditions involving a chiral projection are given on the Rarita-Schwinger fields. Together with the known boundary conditions on the bosonic fields, these ensure that the asymptotic symmetry algebra is the superconformal algebra. The classical central charge is computed and found to be equal to the one of pure gravity. It is also indicated that the asymptotic degrees of freedom are described by 2D "induced supergravity" and that the boundary conditions "transmute" the non-vanishing components of the WZW supercurrent into the supercharges.
