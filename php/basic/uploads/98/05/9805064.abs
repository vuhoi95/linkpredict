Title: Absorption of partial waves by three-branes
Authors: Samir D. Mathur and Alec Matusis
Abstract: We study the absorption of a class of fields in the geometry produced by extremal three-branes. We consider fields that do not mix with the ten-dimensional graviton. For these fields we solve the wave equations and find the absorption probabilities for all partial waves at leading order in the energy. We note that in some of these cases one needs an `intermediate' region which interpolates between flat Minkowski space at infinity and the AdS geometry near the branes.
