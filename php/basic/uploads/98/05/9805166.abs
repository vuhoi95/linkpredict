Abstract: The magnetic monopole condensate is calculated in the dual Monopole Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with dual Dirac strings suggested in Refs.[1,2] as a functional of the dual Dirac string shape. The calculation is carried out in the tree approximation in the scalar monopole-antimonopole collective excitation field. The integration over quantum fluctuations of the dual-vector monopole-antimonopole collective excitation field around the Abrikosov flux line and string shape fluctuations are performed explicitly. We claim that there are important contributions of quantum and string shape fluctuations to the magnetic monopole condensate.
