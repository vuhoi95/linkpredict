Title: Phase Transition in Anyon Superconductivity at Finite Temperature
Authors: Efrain J. Ferrer and Vivian de la Incera
Abstract: The magnetic response of the charged anyon fluid at temperatures larger than the fermion energy gap is investigated in the self-consistent field approximation. In this temperature region a new phase, characterized by an inhomogeneous magnetic penetration, is found. The inhomogeneity is linked to the existence of an imaginary magnetic mass which increases with the temperature. The system stability in the new phase is proved by investigating the electromagnetic field rest-energy spectrum.
