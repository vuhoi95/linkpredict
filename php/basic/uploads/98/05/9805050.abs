Abstract: A 5D black hole(M$_5$) is investigated in the type IIB superstring theory compactified on S$^1 \times $T$^4$. This corresponds to AdS$_3 \times $S$^3 \times $T$^4$ in the near horizon with asymptotically flat space. Here the harmonic gauge is introduced to decouple the mixing between the dilaton and others. On the other hand we obtain the BTZ balck hole(AdS$_3\times$S$^3\times$T$^4$) as the non-dilatonic solution. We calculate the greybody factor of the dilaton as a test scalar both for a 5D black hole(M$_5 \times $S$^1 \times $T$^4$) and the BTZ black hole(AdS$_3 \times $S$^3 \times $T$^4$). The result of the BTZ black hole agrees with the greybody factor of the dilaton in the dilute gas approximation of a 5D black hole.
