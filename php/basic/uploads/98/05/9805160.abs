Title: Graded Parafermions
Authors: J. M. Camino and A. V. Ramallo and J. M. Sanchez de Santos
Abstract: A graded generalization of the Z_k parafermionic current osp(1|2)/U(1) coset conformal field theory. The structure of the parafermionic highest-weight modules is analyzed and the dimensions of the fields of the theory are determined. A free field realization of the graded parafermionic system is obtained and the structure constants of the current algebra are found. Although the theory is not unitary, it presents good reducibility properties.
