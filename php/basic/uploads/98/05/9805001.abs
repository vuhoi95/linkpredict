Title: Super Liouville action for Regge surfaces
Authors: Pietro Menotti and Giuseppe Policastro
Abstract: We compute the super Liouville action for a two dimensional Regge surface by exploiting the invariance of the theory under the superconformal group for sphere topology and under the supermodular group for torus topology. For sphere topology and torus topology with even spin structures, the action is completely fixed up to a term which in the continuum limit goes over to a topological invariant, while the overall normalization of the action can be taken from perturbation theory. For the odd spin structure on the torus, due to the presence of the fermionic supermodulus, the action is fixed up to a modular invariant quadratic polynomial in the fermionic zero modes.
