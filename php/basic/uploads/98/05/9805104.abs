Title: Flux Tube Solution in 5D Kaluza-Klein Theory
Authors: V. Dzhunushaliev and D. Singleton
Abstract: Spherically symmetric, vacuum solutions in 5D and 7D Kaluza-Klein theory are obtained. These solutions are flux tubes with constant cross-sectional size, located between (+) and (-) Kaluza-Klein's ``electrical'' and ``magnetic'' charges disposed respectively at $\pm\infty$ and filled by constant Kaluza-Klein ``electrical'' and ``magnetic'' fields. These objects are surprisingly similar to the flux tubes which forms between two monopoles in Type-II superconductors and also the hypothesized color field flux tube that is thought to form between two quarks in the QCD vacuum.
