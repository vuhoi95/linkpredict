Title: Near Horizon Superspace
Authors: R. Kallosh and J. Rahmfeld and A. Rajaraman
Abstract: The adS_{p+2} x S^{d-p-2} geometry of the near horizon branes is promoted to a supergeometry: the solution of the supergravity constraints for the vielbein, connection and form superfields are found. This supergeometry can be used for the construction of new superconformal theories. We also discuss the Green-Schwarz action for a type IIB string on adS_5 x S_5.
