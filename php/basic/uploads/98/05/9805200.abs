Title: Six-Dimensional TQFTs and Twisted Supersymmetry
Authors: Laurent Baulieu and Peter West
Abstract: We describe a generalization of Yang--Mills topological field theory for Abelian two-forms in six dimensions. The connection of this theory by a twist to Poincar\'e supersymmetric theories is given. We also briefly consider interactions and the case of self-dual three-forms in eight dimensions.
