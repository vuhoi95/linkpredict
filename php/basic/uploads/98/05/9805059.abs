Title: Dyon-Skyrmion Lumps
Authors: Y. Brihaye and B. Kleihaus and D. H. Tchrakian
Abstract: We make a numerical study of the classical solutions of the combined system consisting of the Georgi-Glashow model and the SO(3) gauged Skyrme model. Both monopole-Skyrmion and dyon-Skyrmion solutions are found. A new bifurcation is shown to occur in the gauged Skyrmion solution sector.
