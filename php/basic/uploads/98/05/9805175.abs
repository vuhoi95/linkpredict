Title: Monopole-antimonopole interaction in Abelian Higgs model
Authors: F. V. Gubarev and M. I. Polikarpov and V. I. Zakharov
Abstract: We consider interaction of a probe monopole-antimonopole pair in the vacuum of the Abelian Higgs model. For simplicity, the mass of the Higgs particle is assumed to be much larger than the mass of the photon (London limit). In case of a massive photon the straightforward application of the Zwanziger formalism to accommodate both magnetic and electric charges is known to result in gauge dependence and infrared instabilities. We argue that the use of the string representation of the Abelian Higgs model allows to ameliorate both difficulties. In particular, we arrive at a well defined expression for the potential energy of the static monopole sources. We argue that the monopole-antimonopole interaction cannot be described by a massive photon exchange with a definite propagator having simple analytical properties.
