Title: Two-dimensional N=1,2 Supersymmetric Chiral and Dual Models
Authors: C. P. Constantinidis and F. P. Devecchi and F. Toppan
Abstract: Two-dimensional N=1,2 supersymmetric chiral models and their dual extensions are introduced and canonically quantized. Working within a superspace formalism, the non-manifest invariance under 2D-superPoincare' transformations is proven. The N=1,2 superVirasoro algebras are recovered as current algebras. The non-anomalous quantum invariances under 1D-superdiffeomorphisms (for chiral models) and N=1,2 superconformal transformations (for dual models) are shown to be a consequence of an N=1,2 super-Coulomb gas representation.
