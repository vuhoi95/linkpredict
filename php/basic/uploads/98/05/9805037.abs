Title: On Torsion and Nieh-Yan Form
Authors: Han-Ying Guo and Ke Wu and Wei Zhang
Abstract: Using the well-known Chern-Weil formula and its generalization, we systematically construct the Chern-Simons forms and their generalization induced by torsion as well as the Nieh-Yan (N-Y) forms. We also give an argument on the vanishing of integration of N-Y form on any compact manifold without boundary. A systematic construction of N-Y forms in D=4n dimension is also given.
