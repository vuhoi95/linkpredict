Title: Near Horizon Geometry of Rotating Black Holes in Five Dimensions
Authors: Mirjam Cvetic and Finn Larsen
Abstract: We interpret the general rotating black holes in five dimensions as rotating black strings in six dimensions. In the near horizon limit the geometry is locally AdS_3 x S_3, as in the nonrotating case. However, the global structure couples the AdS_3 and the S_3, giving angular velocity to the S_3. The asymptotic geometry is exploited to count the microstates and recover the precise value of the Bekenstein- Hawking entropy, with rotation taken properly into account. We discuss the perturbation spectrum of the rotating black hole, and its relation to the underlying conformal field theory.
