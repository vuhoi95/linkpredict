Title: Non-Commutative Corepresentations of Quantum Groups
Authors: H. Montani and R. Trinchero
Abstract: We consider a twisted version of quantum groups corepresentations. This generalization amounts to include in the theory the case where quantum space coordinates and its endomorphism matrix entries belong to a non-commutative quadratic algebra.
