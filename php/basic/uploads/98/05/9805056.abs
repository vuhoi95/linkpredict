Title: Gravitational Wave Radiation from Compact Binary Systems in the  Jordan-Brans-Dicke Theory
Authors: M. Brunetti and E. Coccia and V. Fafone and F. Fucito
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the signal emitted by a compact binary system in the Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory. We compute the scalar and tensor components of the power radiated by the source and study the scalar waveform. Eventually we consider the detectability of the scalar component of the radiation by interferometers and resonant-mass detectors.
