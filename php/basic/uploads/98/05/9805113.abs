Title: Sigma-model Solutions and Intersecting p-Branes Related to Lie Algebras
Authors: M. A. Grebeniuk and V. D. Ivashchuk
Abstract: A family of Majumdar-Papapetrou type solutions in sigma-model of p-brane origin is obtained for all direct sums of finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras. Several examples of p-brane dyonic configurations in D=10 (IIA) and D=11 supergravities corresponding to the Lie algebra sl(3,C) are considered.
