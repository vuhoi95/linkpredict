Title: Derivative expansion and large gauge invariance at finite temperature
Authors: J. Barcelos-Neto and Ashok Das
Abstract: We study the 0+1 dimensional Chern-Simons theory at finite temperature within the framework of derivative expansion. We obtain various interesting relations, solve the theory within this framework and argue that the derivative expansion is not a suitable formalism for a study of the question of large gauge invariance.
