Title: Conformal Field Theory Correlators from Classical Field Theory on  Anti-de Sitter Space II. Vector and Spinor Fields
Authors: W. MÃ¼ck and K. S. Viswanathan
Abstract: We use the AdS/CFT correspondence to calculate CFT correlation functions of vector and spinor fields. The connection between the AdS and boundary fields is properly treated via a Dirichlet boundary value problem.
