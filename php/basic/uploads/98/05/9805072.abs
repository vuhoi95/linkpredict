Title: Some New Non-Abelian 2D Dualities
Authors: H. Gustafsson and S. E. Hjelmeland and U. Lindstrom
Abstract: Starting from certain 3D non-abelian dual systems, we discuss a number of related dual systems in 2D, some of which are obtained by dimensional reduction. The dualities relate massive scalar and vector fields, and may be relevant for string theory in the context of massive type IIA supergravity. Supersymmetric extensions of the models are also presented.
