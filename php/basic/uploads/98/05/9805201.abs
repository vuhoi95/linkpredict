Title: New Instanton Solutions at Finite Temperature
Authors: Thomas C. Kraan and Pierre van Baal
Abstract: We discuss the newly found exact instanton solutions at finite temperature with a non-trivial Polyakov loop at infinity. They can be described in terms of monopole constituents and we discuss in this context an old result due to Taubes how to make out of monopoles non-trivial topological charge configurations, with possible applications to abelian projection.
