Title: Vortex solutions of the Liouville equation
Authors: P. A. Horváthy and J. -C. Yéra
Abstract: The most general vortex solution of the Liouville equation (which arises in non-relativistic Chern-Simons theory) is associated with rational functions, $f(z)=P(z)/Q(z)$ where $P(z)$ and $Q(z)$ are both polynomials, $\deg P<\deg Q\equiv N$. This allows us to prove that the solution depends on $4N$ parameters without the use of an index theorem, as well as the flux quantization~: $\Phi=-4N\pi(sign \kappa)$.
