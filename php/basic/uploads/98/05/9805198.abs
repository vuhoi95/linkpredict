Authors: Xu-Dong Luo and Xing-Chang Song and Shi-Kun Wang and Ke Wu
Abstract: A quantum dynamical $\check{R}$-matrix with spectral parameter is constructed by fusion procedure. This spin-1 $\check{R}$-matrix is connected with Lie algebra $so(3)$ and does not satisfy the condition of translation invariance.
