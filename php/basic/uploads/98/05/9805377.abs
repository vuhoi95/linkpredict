Title: Five-Dimensional Aspects of M-Theory Dynamics and Supersymmetry Breaking
Authors: John Ellis and Zygmunt Lalak and Stefan Pokorski and Witold Pokorski
Abstract: We discuss the reduction of the eleven-dimensional M-theory effective Lagrangian, considering first compactification from eleven to five dimensions on a Calabi-Yau manifold, followed by reduction to four dimensions on an S_1/Z_2 line segment at a larger distance scale. The Calabi-Yau geometry leads to a structure of the five-dimensional Lagrangian that has more freedom than the eleven-dimensional theory. In five dimensions one obtains a non-linear sigma-model coupled to gravity, which implies non-trivial dynamics for the scalar moduli fields in the bulk of the Z_2 orbifold. We discuss solutions to the five-dimensional equations of motion in the presence of sources localized on the boundaries of the Z_2 orbifold that may trigger supersymmetry breaking, e.g., gaugino condensates. The transmission of supersymmetry breaking from the hidden wall to the visible wall is demonstrated in specific models. The role of the messenger of supersymmetry breaking may be played by the gravity supermultiplet and/or by scalar hypermultiplets. The latter include the universal hypermultiplet associated with the Calabi-Yau volume, and also the hypermultiplets associated with deformations of its complex structure, which mix in general.
