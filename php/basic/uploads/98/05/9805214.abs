Title: The State-Vector Space for Two-Mode Parabosons and Charged Parabose  Coherent States
Authors: Sicong Jing and Charles A. Nelson
Abstract: The structure of the state-vector space for the two-mode parabose system is investigated and a complete set of state-vectors is constructed. The basis vectors are orthonormal in order $p=2$. In order $p=2$, conserved-charge parabose coherent states are constructed and an explicit completeness relation is obtained.
