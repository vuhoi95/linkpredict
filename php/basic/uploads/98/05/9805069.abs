Title: Space-Time Uncertainty Principle and Conformal Symmetry in D-Particle  Dynamics
Authors: Antal Jevicki and Tamiaki Yoneya
Abstract: Motivated by the space-time uncertainty principle, we establish a conformal symmetry in the dynamics of D-particles. The conformal symmetry, combined with the supersymmetric non-renormalization theorem, uniquely determines the classical form of the effective action for a probe D-particle in the background of a heavy D-particle source, previously constructed by Becker-Becker-Polchinski-Tseytlin. Our results strengthen the conjecture proposed by Maldacena on the correspondence, in the case of D-particles, between the supergravity and the supersymmetric Yang-Mills matrix models in the large $N$-limit, the latter being the boundary conformal field theory of the former in the classical D-particle background in the near horizon limit.
