Title: Integrability of three-particle evolution equations in QCD
Authors: V. M. Braun and S. E. Derkachov and A. N. Manashov
Abstract: We show that Brodsky-Lepage evolution equation for the leading twist spin 3/2 baryon distribution amplitude is completely integrable and reduces to the three-particle XXX_{s=-1} Heisenberg spin chain. Trajectories of the anomalous dimensions are identified and calculated using the 1/N expansion. Extending this result, we prove integrability of the evolution equations for twist 3 quark-gluon operators in the large N_c limit and derive explicit expressions for the corresponding integrals of motion.
