Title: Black String Entropy from Anomalous D-brane Couplings
Authors: David D. Song and Richard J. Szabo
Abstract: The quantum corrections to the counting of statistical entropy for the 5+1-dimensional extremal black string in type-IIB supergravity with two observers are studied using anomalous Wess-Zumino actions for the corresponding intersecting D-brane description. The electric-magnetic duality symmetry of the anomalous theory implies a new symmetry between D-string and D-fivebrane sources and renders opposite sign for the RR charge of one of the intersecting D-branes relative to that of the black string. The electric-magnetic symmetric Hilbert space decomposes into subspaces associated with interior and exterior regions and it is shown that, for an outside observer, the expectation value of a horizon area operator agrees with the deviation of the classical horizon area in going from extremal to near-extremal black strings.
