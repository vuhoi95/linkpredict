Title: Matrix String Theory, 2D SYM Instantons and affine Toda systems
Authors: G. Bonelli and L. Bonora and F. Nesti
Abstract: Extending a recent result of S.B. Giddings, F. Hacquebord and H. Verlinde, we show that in the U(N) SYM Matrix theory there exist classical BPS instantons which interpolate between different closed string configurations via joining/splitting interactions similar to those of string field theory. We construct them starting from branched coverings of Riemann surfaces. For the class of them which we analyze in detail the construction can be made explicit in terms U(N) affine Toda field theories.
