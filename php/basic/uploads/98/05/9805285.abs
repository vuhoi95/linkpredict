Title: Constant versus Field Dependent Gauge Couplings in Supersymmetric  Theories
Authors: C. P. Burgess and A. de la Macorra and I. Maksymyk and F. Quevedo
Abstract: We briefly discuss the differences between considering the gauge coupling as a constant or as a field, the dilaton, in N=1 supersymmetric theories. We emphasize the differences regarding supersymmetry breaking. Recent developments on the nonperturbative dynamics of these theories provide new ideas on the induced dilaton potential and its stabilization.
