Title: On the Transition from Confinement to Screening in QCD_{1+1} Coupled to  Adjoint Fermions at Finite N
Authors: F. Antonuccio and S. Pinsky
Abstract: We consider SU(N) QCD_{1+1} coupled to massless adjoint Majorana fermions, where N is finite but arbitrary. We examine the spectrum for various values of N, paying particular attention to the formation of multi-particle states, which were recently identified by Gross, Hashimoto and Klebanov in the N -> infinity limit of the theory. It is believed that in the limit of vanishing fermion mass, there is a transition from confinement to screening in which string-like states made out of adjoint fermion bits dissociate into stable constituent ``single particles''. In this work, we provide numerical evidence that such a transition into stable constituent particles occurs not only at large N, but for any finite value of N. In addition, we discuss certain issues concerning the ``topological'' properties exhibited by the DLCQ spectrum.
