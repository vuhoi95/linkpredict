Title: Isolated vacua in supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories
Authors: A. Keurentjes and A. Rosly and A. V. Smilga
Abstract: An explicit proof of the existence of nontrivial vacua in the pure supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories with higher orthogonal SO(N), N>=7 or the G_2 gauge group defined on a 3-torus with periodic boundary conditions is given. Extra vacuum states are separated by an energy barrier from the perturbative vacuum A_i=0 and its gauge copies.
