Title: Localized Branes and Black Holes
Authors: Sumati Surya and Donald Marolf
Abstract: We address the delocalization of low dimensional D-branes and NS-branes when they are a part of a higher dimensional BPS black brane, and the homogeneity of the resulting horizon. We show that the effective delocalization of such branes is a classical effect that occurs when localized branes are brought together. Thus, the fact that the few known solutions with inhomogeneous horizons are highly singular need not indicate a singularity of generic D- and NS-brane states. Rather, these singular solutions are likely to be unphysical as they cannot be constructed from localized branes which are brought together from a finite separation.
