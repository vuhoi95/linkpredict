Title: A modification of the 10d superparticle action inspired by the  Gupta-Bleuler quantization scheme method
Authors: S. Bellucci and A. Galajinsky
Abstract: We reconsider the issue of the existence of a complex structure in the Gupta-Bleuler quantization scheme. We prove an existence theorem for the complex structure associated with the $d=10$ Casalbuoni-Brink-Schwarz superparticle, based on an explicitly constructed Lagrangian that allows a holomorphic-antiholomorphic splitting of the fermionic constraints consistent with the vanishing of all first class constraints on the physical states.
