Title: Aspects of Confinement and Screening in M theory
Authors: Shmuel Elitzur and Oskar Pelc and Eliezer Rabinovici
Abstract: Confinement and Screening are investigated in SUSY gauge theories, realized by an M5 brane configuration, extending an approach applied previously to N=1 SYM theory, to other models. The electric flux tubes are identified as M2 branes ending on the M5 branes and the conserved charge they carry is identified as a topological property. The group of charges carried by the flux tubes is calculated and the results agree in all cases considered with the field theoretical expectations. In particular, whenever the dynamical matter is expected to screen the confining force, this is reproduced correctly in the M theory realization.
