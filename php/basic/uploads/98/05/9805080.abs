Title: Asymptotic Ground State for 10 Dimensional Reduced Supersymmetric SU(2)  Yang Mills Theory
Authors: G. M. Graf and J. Hoppe
Abstract: We calculate the power law decay, and asymptotic form of a (unique) SO(9) and SU(2) invariant wave function satisfying, to leading and sub-leading order, $Q_{\hat{\beta}} \psi = 0$ for all 16 supercharges of the matrix model corresponding to supermembranes in 11 space-time dimensions.
