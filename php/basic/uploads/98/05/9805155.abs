Abstract: Massless $QCD_2$ is dominated by classical configurations in the large $N_f$ limit. We use this observation to study the theory by finding solutions to equations of motion, which are the non-Abelian generalization of the Schwinger equation. We find that the spectrum consists of massive mesons with $M^2={e^2 N_f\over 2\pi}$ which correspond to Abelian solutions. We generalize previously discovered non-Abelian solutions and discuss their interpretation. We prove a no-go theorem ruling out the existence of soliton solutions. Thus the semi-classical approximation shows no baryons in the case of massless quarks, a result derived before in the strong-coupling limit only.
