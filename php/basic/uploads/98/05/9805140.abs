Title: E-B Mixing in T-violating Superconductors
Authors: J. Goryo and K. Ishikawa
Abstract: We analyze time reversal violating processes of the p-wave superconductor. The Landau-Ginzuburg effective action has an induced T-violating term of electromagnetic potentials which resembles the Chern-Simons term and causes a mixing between the electric field and the magnetic field. Several T-violating electromagnetic phenomena caused by this term, such as unusual Meissner effect, Hall effect without magnetic field, and Farady rotation without magnetic field are investigated.
