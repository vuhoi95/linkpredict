Abstract: We find self-dual vortex solutions in a Maxwell-Chern-Simons model with anomalous magnetic moment. From a recently developed N=2-supersymmetric extension, we obtain the proper Bogomol'nyi equations together with a Higgs potential allowing both topological and non-topological phases in the theory.
