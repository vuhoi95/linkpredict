Title: Dynamics of the Born-Infeld dyons
Authors: Dariusz Chruscinski and Hartmann Roemer
Abstract: The approach to the dynamics of a charged particle in the Born-Infeld nonlinear electrodynamics developed in [Phys. Lett. A 240 (1998) 8] is generalized to include a Born-Infeld dyon. Both Hamiltonian and Lagrangian structures of many dyons interacting with nonlinear electromagnetism are constructed. All results are manifestly duality invariant.
