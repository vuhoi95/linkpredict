Title: On the Twisted (2,0) and Little-String Theories
Authors: Yeuk-Kwan E. Cheung and Ori J. Ganor and Morten Krogh
Abstract: We study the compactification of the $(2,0)$ and type-II little-string theories on $S^1$, $T^2$ and $T^3$ with an R-symmetry twist that preserves half the supersymmetry. We argue that it produces the same moduli spaces of vacua as compactification of the $(1,0)$ theory with $E_8$ Wilson lines given by a maximal embedding of SU(2). In certain limits, this reproduces the moduli space of SU(2) with a massive adjoint hyper-multiplet. In the type-II little-string theory case, we observe a peculiar phase transition where the strings condense. We conjecture a generalization to more than two 5-branes which involves instantons on non-commutative $T^4$. We conclude with open questions.
