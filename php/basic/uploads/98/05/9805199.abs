Title: The Linear Vector-Tensor Multiplet with Gauged Central Charge
Authors: N. Dragon and U. Theis
Abstract: We derive consistent superfield constraints for the linear vector-tensor multiplet with gauged central charge. The central charge transformations and the action turn out to be nonpolynomial in the gauge field.
