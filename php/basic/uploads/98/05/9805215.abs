Title: The Complete Solution of the Classical SL(2,R)/U(1) Gauged WZNW Field  Theory
Authors: Uwe Mueller and Gerhard Weigt
Abstract: We prove that any gauged WZNW model has a Lax pair representation, and give explicitly the general solution of the classical equations of motion of the SL(2,R)/U(1) theory. We calculate the symplectic structure of this solution by solving a differential equation of the Gelfand-Dikii type with initial state conditions at infinity, and transform the canonical physical fields non-locally onto canonical free fields. The results will, finally, be collected in a local B\"acklund transformation. These calculations prepare the theory for an exact canonical quantization.
