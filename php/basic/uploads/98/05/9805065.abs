Title: The M5-brane Hamiltonian
Authors: E. Bergshoeff and D. Sorokin and P. K. Townsend
Abstract: We obtain the Hamiltonian form of the worldvolume action for the M5-brane in a general D=11 supergravity background. We use this result to obtain a new version of the covariant M5-brane Lagrangian in which the tension appears as a dynamical variable, although this Lagrangian has some unsatisfactory features which we trace to peculiarities of the null limit. We also show that the M5-brane action is invariant under all (super)isometries of the background.
