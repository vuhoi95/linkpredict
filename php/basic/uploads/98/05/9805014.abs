Title: Path Integral Quantization and Riemannian-Symplectic Manifolds
Authors: Sergei V. Shabanov and John R. Klauder
Abstract: We develop a mathematically well-defined path integral formalism for general symplectic manifolds. We argue that in order to make a path integral quantization covariant under general coordinate transformations on the phase space and involve a genuine functional measure that is both finite and countably additive, the phase space manifold should be equipped with a Riemannian structure (metric). A suitable method to calculate the metric is also proposed.
