Title: Analytic Torsion on Hyperbolic Manifolds and the Semiclassical  Approximation for Chern-Simons Theory
Authors: A. A. Bytsenko and A. E. Goncalves and W. da Cruz
Abstract: The invariant integration method for Chern-Simons theory for gauge group SU(2) and manifold \Gamma\H^3 is verified in the semiclassical approximation. The semiclassical limit for the partition function associated with a connected sum of hyperbolic 3-manifolds is presented. We discuss briefly L^2 - analytical and topological torsions of a manifold with boundary.
