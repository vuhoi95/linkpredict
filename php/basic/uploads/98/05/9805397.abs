Title: Relic Abundance of Neutralinos in Heterotic String Theory: Weak Coupling  vs. Strong Coupling
Authors: Y. Kawamura and H. P. Nilles and M. Olechowski and M. Yamaguchi
Abstract: The relic abundance of stable neutralinos is investigated in $E_8 \times E_8'$ heterotic string theory when supersymmetry is spontaneously broken by hidden-sector gaugino condensates. In the weak coupling regime, very large scalar masses (compared to gaugino masses) are shown to lead to a too large relic abundance of the neutralinos, incompatible with cosmological observations in most of parameter space. The problem does not arise in the strong coupling regime (heterotic M-theory) because there scalar and gaugino masses are generically of the same order of magnitude.
