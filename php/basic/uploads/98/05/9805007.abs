Title: Integrable Top Equations associated with Projective Geometry over Z_2
Authors: David B. Fairlie and Tatsuya Ueno
Abstract: We give a series of integrable top equations associated with the projective geometry over Z_2 as a (2^n-1)-dimensional generalisation of the 3D Euler top equations. The general solution of the (2^n-1)D top is shown to be given by an integration over a Riemann surface with genus (2^{n-1}-1)^2.
