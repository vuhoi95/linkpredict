Title: Open inflation from non-singular instantons: Wrapping the universe with  a membrane
Authors: Raphael Bousso and Andrew Chamblin
Abstract: The four-form field recently considered by Hawking and Turok couples naturally to a charged membrane, across which the effective cosmological constant has a discontinuity. We present instantons for the creation of an open inflationary universe surrounded by a membrane. They can also be used to describe the nucleation of a membrane on a pre-existing inflationary background. This process typically decreases the value of the effective cosmological constant and may lead to a novel scenario of eternal inflation. Moreover, by coupling the inflaton field to the membrane, the troublesome singularities which arise in the Hawking-Turok model can be eliminated.
