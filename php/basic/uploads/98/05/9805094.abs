Title: Integrable Chiral Theories in 2+1 Dimensions
Authors: D. Gianzo and J. O. Madsen and J. Sanchez Guillen
Abstract: Following a recent proposal for integrable theories in higher dimensions based on zero curvature, new Lorentz invariant submodels of the principal chiral model in 2+1 dimensions are found. They have infinite local conserved currents, which are explicitly given for the su(2) case. The construction works for any Lie algebra and in any dimension, and it is given explicitly also for su(3). We comment on the application to supersymmetric chiral models.
