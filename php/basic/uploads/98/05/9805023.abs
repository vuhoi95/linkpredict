Title: Sonoluminescence: Bogolubov coefficients for the QED vacuum of a  time-dependent dielectric bubble
Authors: Matt Visser and S. Liberati and F. Belgiorno and D. W. Sciama
Abstract: We extend Schwinger's ideas regarding sonoluminescence by explicitly calculating the Bogolubov coefficients relating the QED vacuum states associated with changes in a dielectric bubble. Sudden (non-adiabatic) changes in the refractive index lead to an efficient production of real photons with a broadband spectrum, and a high-frequency cutoff that arises from the asymptotic behaviour of the dielectric constant.
