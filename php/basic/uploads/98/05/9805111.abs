Title: CP-violating phases in the CKM matrix in orbifold compactifications
Authors: D. Bailin and G. V. Kraniotis and A. Love
Abstract: The picture of CP-violation in orbifold compactifications in which the $T$-modulus is at a complex fixed point of the modular group is studied. CP-violation in the neutral kaon system and in the neutron electric dipole moment are both discussed. The situation where the $T$-modulus takes complex values on the unit circle which are not at a fixed point is also discussed.
