Title: Principal Realization for the extended affine Lie algebra of type $sl_2$  with coordinates in a simple quantum torus with two generators
Authors: Stephen Berman and Jacek Szmigielski
Abstract: We construct an irreducible representation for the extended affine algebra of type $sl_2$ with coordinates in a quantum torus. We explicitly give formulas using vertex operators similar to those found in the theory of the infinite rank affine algebra $A_{\infty}$.
