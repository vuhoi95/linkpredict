Title: Anti-de Sitter space and black holes
Authors: Maximo Banados and Andres Gomberoff and Cristian Martinez
Abstract: Anti-de Sitter space with identified points give rise to black-hole structures. This was first pointed out in three dimensions, and generalized to higher dimensions by Aminneborg et al. In this paper, we analyse several aspects of the five dimensional anti-de Sitter black hole including, its relation to thermal anti-de Sitter space, its embedding in a Chern-Simons supergravity theory, its global charges and holonomies, and the existence of Killing spinors.
