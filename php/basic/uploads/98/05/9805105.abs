Title: R-Current Correlators in N=4 Super Yang-Mills Theory from Anti-de Sitter  Supergravity
Authors: G. Chalmers and H. Nastase and K. Schalm and R. Siebelink
Abstract: We test the conjectured relationship between N=4 super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions and IIB supergravity compactified on $AdS_5\times S_5$ by computing the two- and three-point functions of R-symmetry currents. We observe that the integral expressions describing the general three-point correlator on the supergravity side have a structure similar to one-loop triangle diagrams in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. This allows us to compare the expressions on both sides of the AdS/CFT correspondence without the technical complications of the loop integrations. We confirm that the two- and three-point correspondence arises at only one-loop in the N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. Higher-point functions as well as further three-point functions may be analyzed similarly.
