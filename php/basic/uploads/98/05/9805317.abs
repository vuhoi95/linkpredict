Title: Low-temperature effective potential of the Ising model
Authors: A. Pelissetto and E. Vicari
Abstract: We study the low-temperature effective potential of the Ising model. We evaluate the three-point and four-point zero-momentum renormalized coupling constants that parametrize the expansion of the effective potential near the coexistence curve. These results are obtained by a constrained analysis of the $\epsilon$-expansion that uses accurate estimates for the two-dimensional Ising model.
