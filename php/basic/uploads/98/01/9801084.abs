Title: USp(2k) Matrix Model: Nonperturbative Approach to Orientifolds
Authors: H. Itoyama and A. Tokura
Abstract: We discuss theoretical implications of the large k USp(2k) matrix model in zero dimension. The model appears as the matrix model of type IIB superstrings on a large $T^{6}/Z^{2}$ orientifold via the matrix twist operation. In the small volume limit, the model behaves four dimensional and its T dual is six-dimensional worldvolume theory of type I superstrings in ten spacetime dimensions. Several theoretical considerations including the analysis on planar diagrams, the commutativity of the projectors with supersymmetries and the cancellation of gauge anomalies are given, providing us with the rationales for the choice of the Lie algebra and the field content. A few classical solutions are constructed which correspond to Dirichlet p-branes and some fluctuations are evaluated. The particular scaling limit with matrix T duality transformation is discussed which derives the F theory compactification on an elliptic fibered K3.
