Title: BPS and non-BPS Domain Walls in Supersymmetric QCD with SU(3) Gauge  Group
Authors: A. V. Smilga and A. I. Veselov
Abstract: We study the spectrum of the domain walls interpolating between different chirally asymmetric vacua in supersymmetric QCD with the SU(3) gauge group and including 2 pairs of chiral matter multiplets in fundamental and anti-fundamental representations. For small enough masses m < m* = .286... (in the units of \Lambda), there are two different domain wall solutions which are BPS-saturated and two types of ``wallsome sphalerons''. At m = m*, two BPS branches join together and, in the interval m* < m < m** = 3.704..., BPS equations have no solutions but there are solutions to the equations of motion describing a non-BPS domain wall and a sphaleron. For m > m**, there are no solutions whatsoever.
