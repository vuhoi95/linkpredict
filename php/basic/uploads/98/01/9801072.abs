Title: g=1 for Dirichlet 0-branes
Authors: M. J. Duff and James T. Liu and J. Rahmfeld
Abstract: Dirichlet 0-branes, considered as extreme Type IIA black holes with spin carried by fermionic hair, are shown to have the anomalous gyromagnetic ratio g=1, consistent with their interpretation as Kaluza-Klein modes.
