Title: The Coulomb Branch of N=2 Supersymmetric Product Group Theories from  Branes
Authors: J. Erlich and A. Naqvi and L. Randall
Abstract: We determine the low energy description of N=2 supersymmetric SU(k) product group theories with bifundamental and fundamental matter based on M-theory fivebrane configurations. The dependence on moduli and scales of the coefficients in the non-hyperelliptic Seiberg-Witten curves for these theories is determined by considering various field theory and brane limits. A peculiarity in the interpretation of these curves for the vanishing beta-function case is noted.
