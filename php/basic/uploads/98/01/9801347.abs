Title: Strange Multiskyrmions
Authors: M. Schvellinger and N. N. Scoccola
Abstract: Using the recently proposed approximation for multiskyrmion fields based on rational maps we study the masses and baryonic radii of some strange multibaryons within the bound state soliton model. We find the tetralambda binding to be stronger than previously expected. In addition, the model predicts the existence of a ``heptalambda'' which is stable against strong decays.
