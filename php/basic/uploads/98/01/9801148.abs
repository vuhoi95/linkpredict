Title: Geometric quantization of N=2, D=3 superanyon
Authors: I. V. Gorbunov and S. L. Lyakhovich
Abstract: A classical model of N=2, D=3 fractional spin superparticle (superanyon) is presented, whose first-quantization procedure combines the Berezin quantization for the superspin degrees of freedom and the canonical quantization for the space-time ones. To provide the supersymmetry for the quantised theory, certain quantum corrections are required to the N=2 supersymmetry generators as compared to the Berezin procedure. The renormalized generators are found and the first quantised theory of N=2 superanyon is constructed.
