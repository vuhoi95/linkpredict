Title: On Simulating Liouvillian Flow From Quantum Mechanics Via Wigner  Functions
Authors: A. N. Mitra and R. Ramanathan
Abstract: The interconnection between quantum mechanics and probabilistic classical mechanics for a free relativistic particle is derived in terms of Wigner functions (WF) for both Dirac and Klein-Gordon (K-G) equations. Construction of WF is achieved by first defining a bilocal 4-current and then taking its Fourier transform w.r.t. the relative 4-coordinate. The K-G and Proca cases also lend themselves to a closely parallel treatment provided the Kemmer- Duffin beta-matrix formalism is employed for the former. Calculation of WF is carried out in a Lorentz-covariant fashion by standard `trace' techniques. The results are compared with a recent derivation due to Bosanac.
