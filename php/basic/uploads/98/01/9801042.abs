Title: Universality in Chiral Random Matrix Theory at $β=1$ and $β=4$
Authors: M. K. Sener and J. J. M. Verbaarschot
Abstract: In this paper the kernel for the spectral correlation functions of the invariant chiral random matrix ensembles with real ($\beta =1$) and quaternion real ($\beta = 4$) matrix elements is expressed in terms of the kernel of the corresponding complex Hermitean random matrix ensembles ($\beta=2$). Such identities are exact in case of a Gaussian probability distribution and, under certain smoothness assumptions, they are shown to be valid asymptotically for an arbitrary finite polynomial potential. They are proved by means of a construction proposed by Br\'ezin and Neuberger. Universal behavior at the hard edge of the spectrum for all three chiral ensembles then follows from microscopic universality for $\beta =2$ as shown by Akemann, Damgaard, Magnea and Nishigaki.
