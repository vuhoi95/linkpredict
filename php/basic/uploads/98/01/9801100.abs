Title: The Holomorphic Anomaly of Topological Strings
Authors: Carlo Becchi and Stefano Giusto and Camillo Imbimbo
Abstract: We show that the BRS operator of the topological string B model is not holomorphic in the complex structure of the target space. This implies that the so-called holomorphic anomaly of topological strings should not be interpreted as a BRS anomaly.
