Title: Z_3 Strings and their Interactions
Authors: Junseong Heo and Tanmay Vachaspati
Abstract: We construct Z_3 vortex solutions in a model in which SU(3) is spontaneously broken to Z_3. The model is truncated to one in which there are only two dimensionless free parameters and the interaction of vortices within this restricted set of models is studied numerically. We find that there is a curve in the two dimensional space of parameters for which the energy of two asymptotically separated vortices equals the energy of the vortices at vanishing separation. This suggests that the inter-vortex potential for Z_3 strings might be flat for these couplings, much like the case of U(1) strings in the Bogomolnyi limit. However, we argue that the intervortex potential is attractive at short distances and repulsive at large separations leading to the possibility of unstable bound states of Z_3 vortices.
