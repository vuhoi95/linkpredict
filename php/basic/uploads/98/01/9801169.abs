Title: The Configuration Space of Low-dimensional Yang-Mills Theories
Authors: T. Pause and T. Heinzl
Abstract: We discuss the construction of the physical configuration space for Yang-Mills quantum mechanics and Yang-Mills theory on a cylinder. We explicitly eliminate the redundant degrees of freedom by either fixing a gauge or introducing gauge invariant variables. Both methods are shown to be equivalent if the Gribov problem is treated properly and the necessary boundary identifications on the Gribov horizon are performed. In addition, we analyze the significance of non-generic configurations and clarify the relation between the Gribov problem and coordinate singularities.
