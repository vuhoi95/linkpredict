Title: Branes, Orientifolds and Chiral Gauge Theories
Authors: Shmuel Elitzur and Amit Giveon and David Kutasov and David Tsabar
Abstract: We discuss some aspects of the physics of branes in the presence of orientifolds and the corresponding worldvolume gauge dynamics. We show that at strong coupling orientifolds sometimes turn into bound states of orientifolds and branes, and give a worldsheet argument for the flip of the sign of an orientifold plane split into two disconnected parts by an NS fivebrane. We also describe the moduli space of vacua of N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories with symplectic and orthogonal gauge groups, and analyze a set of four dimensional N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories with chiral matter content using branes.
