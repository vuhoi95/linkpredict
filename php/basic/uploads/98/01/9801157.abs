Title: Chiral symmetry breaking and effective lagrangians for softly broken  supersymmetric QCD
Authors: Stephen P. Martin and James D. Wells
Abstract: We study supersymmetric QCD with N_f<N_c in the limit of small supersymmetry-breaking masses and smaller quark masses using the weak-coupling Kahler potential. We calculate the full spectrum of this theory, which manifests a chiral symmetry breaking pattern similar to that caused by the strong interactions of the standard model. We derive the chiral effective lagrangian for the pion degrees of freedom, and discuss the behavior in the formal limit of large squark and gluino masses and for large N_c. We show that the resulting scalings of the pion decay constant and pion masses in these limits differ from those expected in ordinary nonsupersymmetric QCD. Although there is no weak coupling expansion with N_f=N_c, we extend our results to this case by constructing a superfield quantum modified constraint in the presence of supersymmetry breaking.
