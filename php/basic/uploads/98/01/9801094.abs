Title: Quantization of the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation on the Half Line
Authors: M. Gattobigio and A. Liguori and M. Mintchev
Abstract: We establish the second quantized solution of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation on the half line with a mixed boundary condition. The solution is based on a new algebraic structure, which we call boundary exchange algebra and which substitutes, in the presence of boundaries, the familiar Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra.
