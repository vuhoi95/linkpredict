Abstract: We discuss some properties of abelian monopoles in the Maximal Abelian projection of the SU(2) lattice gluodynamics. We show that in the maximal abelian projection abelian monopoles carry fluctuating electric charge and that the monopole currents are correlated with the magnetic and the electric parts of the SU(2) action density.
