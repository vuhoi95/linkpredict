Title: Noncommutative Gauge Theories in Matrix Theory
Authors: Pei-Ming Ho and Yong-Shi Wu
Abstract: We present a general framework for Matrix theory compactified on a quotient space R^n/G, with G a discrete group of Euclidean motions in R^n. The general solution to the quotient conditions gives a gauge theory on a noncommutative space. We characterize the resulting noncommutative gauge theory in terms of the twisted group algebra of G associated with a projective regular representation. Also we show how to extend our treatments to incorporate orientifolds.
