Title: Super Black Hole from Cosmological Supergravity with a Massive  Superparticle
Authors: M. E. Knutt-Wehlau and R. B. Mann
Abstract: We describe in superspace a classical theory of two dimensional $(1,1)$ cosmological dilaton supergravity coupled to a massive superparticle. We give an exact non-trivial superspace solution for the compensator superfield that describes the supergravity, and then use this solution to construct a model of a two-dimensional supersymmetric black hole.
