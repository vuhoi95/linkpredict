Title: The superspace geometry of gravitational Chern-Simons forms and their  couplings to linear multiplets : a review
Authors: Georges Girardi and Richard Grimm
Abstract: The superspace geometry of Chern-Simons forms is shown to be closely related to that of the 3-form multiplet. This observation allows to simplify considerably the geometric structure of supersymmetric Chern-Simons forms and their coupling to linear multiplets. The analysis is carried through in U_K(1) superspace, relevant at the same time for supergravity-matter couplings and for chirally extended supergravity.
