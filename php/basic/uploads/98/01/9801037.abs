Title: A Rule of Thumb Derivation of Born-Infeld Action for D-branes
Authors: Rika Endo and Rie Kuriki and Shin'ichi Nojiri and Akio Sugamoto
Abstract: A rule of thumb derivation of the Dirac-Born-Infeld action for D-branes is studied \`a la Fradkin and Tseytlin, by simply integrating out of the superstring coordinates in a narrow strip attached to the D-branes. In case of superstrings, the coupling of Ramond-Ramond fields as well as the Dirac-Born-Infeld type coupling of the Neveu Schwarz-Neveu Schwarz fields come out in this way.
