Title: Statistical Entropy of the Four Dimensional Schwarzschild Black Hole
Authors: R. Argurio and F. Englert and L. Houart
Abstract: The entropy of the four dimensional Schwarzschild black hole is derived by mapping it onto a configuration of intersecting branes with four charges. This configuration is obtained by performing several boosts and dualities on a neutral black brane of M-theory to which the Schwarzschild black hole is related by trivial compactification. The infinite boost limit is well-defined and corresponds to extremality where the intersecting brane configuration is a marginal one on which a standard microscopic counting of the entropy can be safely performed. The result reproduces exactly the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the four dimensional black hole.
