Abstract: Correlations of the topological charge Q, the electric current J^e and the magnetic current J^m in SU(2) lattice gauge theory in the Maximal Abelian projection are investigated. It occurs that the correlator <<QJ^e J^m>> is nonzero for a wide range of values of the bare charge. It is shown that: (i) the abelian monopoles in the Maximal Abelian projection are dyons which carry fluctuating electric charge; (ii) the sign of the electric charge e(x) coincides with that of the product of the monopole charge m(x) and the topological charge density Q(x).
