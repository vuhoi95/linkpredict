Title: Temperature Corrections to Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Fabian H. L. Essler and Vladimir E. Korepin and Franck T. Latremoliere
Abstract: We consider finite temperature dynamical correlation functions in the interacting delta-function Bose gas. In the low-temperature limit the asymptotic behaviour of correlation functions can be determined from conformal field theory. In the present work we determine the deviations from conformal behaviour at low temperatures.
