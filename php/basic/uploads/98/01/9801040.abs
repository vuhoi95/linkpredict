Abstract: We test a new parametrization of a suitably truncated classically perfect action for SU(2) pure gauge theory with respect to self-consistency and locate the deconfinement transition on a 12^3X4 lattice. Using the technique of smoothing (blocking followed by inverse blocking) we demonstrate clustering of action and topological charge density. Concentrating on the Abelian monopoles found in smoothed configurations after Abelian projection from the maximally Abelian gauge, we present evidence for their role as carriers of non-Abelian action and topological charge.
