Abstract: The theory of the strong interactions, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), has been addressed by a variety of non-perturbative techniques over the decades since its introduction. We have investigated Hamiltonian formulations with different quantization methods and approximation schemes. In one method, we utilize light-front coordinates to investigate the role of bosonic zero modes in leading to confinement. In another method we are able to obtain spectra for the mesons and baryons using constituent quark masses but no phenomenological confinement. We survey our principal accomplishments to date and indicate our future directions.
