Title: Special Geometry and Compactification on a Circle
Authors: B. de Wit and B. Kleijn and S. Vandoren
Abstract: We discuss some consequences of our previous work on rigid special geometry in hypermultiplets in 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime for supersymmetric gauge dynamics when one of the spatial dimensions is compactified on a circle.
