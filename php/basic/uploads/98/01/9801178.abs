Title: Off shell $Îº$-symmetry of the superparticle and the spinning  superparticle
Authors: P. D. Jarvis and J. W. van Holten and J. Kowalski-Glikman
Abstract: The spinorial local world-line $\kappa$-symmetry of the covariant Brink-Schwarz formulation of the 4-$D$ superparticle is abelian in an off-shell phase-space formulation. The result is shown to generalize to the extended spinorial transformations of the spinning superparticle.
