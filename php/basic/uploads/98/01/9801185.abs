Title: The Pole Part of the 1PI Four-Point Function in Light-Cone Gauge  Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: G. Leibbrandt and A. Richardson and C. P. Martin
Abstract: The complete UV-divergent contribution to the one-loop 1PI four-point function of Yang-Mills theory in the light-cone gauge is computed in this paper. The formidable UV-divergent contributions arising from each four-point Feynman diagram yield a succinct final result which contains nonlocal terms as expected. These nonlocal contributions are consistent with gauge symmetry, and correspond to a nonlocal renormalization of the wave function. Renormalization of Yang-Mills theory in the light-cone gauge is thus shown explicitly at the one-loop level.
