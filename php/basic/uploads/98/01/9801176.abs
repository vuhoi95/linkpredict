Title: On zero modes of the eleven dimensional superstring
Authors: A. A. Deriglazov and D. M. Gitman
Abstract: It is shown that recently pointed out by Berkovits on-shell degrees of freedom of the D=11 superstring do not make contributions into the quantum states spectrum of the theory. As a consequence, the spectrum coincides with that of the D=10 type IIA superstring.
