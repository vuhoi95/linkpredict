Title: Testing Seiberg-Witten Solution
Authors: Andrei Losev and Nikita Nekrasov and Samson Shatashvili
Abstract: We propose a few tests of Seiberg-Witten solutions of $\CN=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories by the instanton calculus in twisted gauge theories. We re-examine the low-energy effective abelian theory in the presence of sources and present the formalism which makes duality transformations transparent and easily fixes all the contact terms in a broad class of theories. We also discuss ADHM integration and its relevance to the stated problems.
