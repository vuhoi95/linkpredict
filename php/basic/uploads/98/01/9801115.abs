Title: Fractal Dimensions and Scaling Laws in the Interstellar Medium and  Galaxy Distributions: a new Field Theory Approach
Authors: H. J. de Vega and N. SÃ¡nchez and F. Combes
Abstract: We develop a field theoretical approach to the cold interstellar medium (ISM) and large structure of the universe. We show that a non-relativistic self- gravitating gas in thermal equilibrium with variable number of atoms or fragments is exactly equivalent to a field theory of a scalar field phi(x) with exponential self-interaction. We analyze this field theory perturbatively and non-perturbatively through the renormalization group(RG).We show scaling behaviour (critical) for a continuous range of the physical parameters as the temperature. We derive in this framework the scaling relation M(R) \sim R^{d_H} for the mass on a region of size R, and Delta v \sim R^\frac12(d_H -1) for the velocity dispersion. For the density-density correlations we find a power-law behaviour for large distances \sim |r_1 - r_2|^{2D - 6}.The fractal dimension D turns to be related with the critical exponent \nu by D = 1/ \nu. Mean field theory yields \nu = 1/2, D = 2. Both the Ising and the mean field values are compatible with the present ISM observational data:1.4\leq D \leq 2. We develop a field theoretical approach to the galaxy distribution considering a gas of self-gravitating masses on the FRW background, in quasi-thermal equi- librium. We show that it exhibits scaling behaviour by RG methods. The galaxy correlations are computed without assuming homogeneity. We find <\rho({\vec r_0})\rho({\vec r_0} + {\vec r}) > \sim r^{D-3} $. The theory allows to compute the three and higher density correlators without any assumption.We find that the connected N-points density scales as r_1^{N(D-3)}, when $ r_1 >> r_i, 2\leq i \leq N $. There are no free parameters in this theory.
