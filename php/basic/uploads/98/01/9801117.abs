Title: On the Self-Dual Geometry of N=2 Strings
Authors: Chandrashekar Devchand and Olaf Lechtenfeld
Abstract: We discuss the precise relation of the open N=2 string to a self-dual Yang-Mills (SDYM) system in 2+2 dimensions. In particular, we review the description of the string target space action in terms of SDYM in a ``picture hyperspace'' parametrised by the standard vectorial R^{2,2} coordinate together with a commuting spinor of SO(2,2). The component form contains an infinite tower of prepotentials coupled to the one representing the SDYM degree of freedom. The truncation to five fields yields a novel one-loop exact lagrangean field theory.
