Title: Non-transversal colliding singularities in F-theory
Authors: S. Penati and A. Santambrogio and D. Zanon
Abstract: This is a short introduction to the study of compactifications of F-theory on elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds near colliding singularities. In particular we consider the case of non-transversal intersections of the singular fibers.
