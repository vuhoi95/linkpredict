Title: Classifying algebras for boundary conditions and traces on spaces of  conformal blocks
Authors: C. Schweigert and J. Fuchs
Abstract: The boundary conditions of a non-trivial string background are classified. To this end we need traces on various spaces of conformal blocks, for which generalizations of the Verlinde formula are presented.
