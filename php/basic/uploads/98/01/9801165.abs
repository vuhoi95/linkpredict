Title: Gauged Supergravity Vacua From Intersecting Branes
Authors: P. M. Cowdall and P. K. Townsend
Abstract: Domain wall and electrovac solutions of gauged N=4 D=4 supergravity, with gauge group SU(2) or SU(2)xSU(2), are interpreted as supersymmetric Kaluza-Klein vacua of N=1 D=10 supergravity. These vacua are shown to be the near-horizon geometries of certain intersecting brane solutions.
