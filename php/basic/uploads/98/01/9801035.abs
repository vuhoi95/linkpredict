Title: Fusion Rules in N=1 Superconformal Minimal Models
Authors: Pablo Minces and Ali Namazie and Carmen Nunez
Abstract: The generalization to N=1 superconformal minimal models of the relation between the modular transformation matrix and the fusion rules in rational conformal field theories, the Verlinde theorem, is shown to provide complete information about the fusion rules, including their fermionic parity. The results for the superconformal Tricritical Ising and Ashkin-Teller models agree with the known rational conformal formulation. The Coulomb gas description of correlation functions in the Ramond sector of N=1 minimal models is also discussed and a previous formulation is completed.
