Title: On stable compactification with Casimir-like potential
Authors: U. Guenther and S. Kriskiv and A. Zhuk
Abstract: Multidimensional cosmological models with a higher dimensional space-time manifold are investigated under dimensional reduction. In the Einstein conformal frame, the effective potential for the internal scale factors is obtained. The stable compactification of the internal spaces is achieved due to the Casimir effect. In the case of more than one internal space a Casimir-like ansatz for the energy density of the massless scalar field fluctuations is proposed. Stable configurations with respect to the internal scale factor excitations are found in the cases of one and two internal spaces.
