Title: Event horizons and ergoregions in 3He
Authors: T. A. Jacobson and G. E. Volovik
Abstract: Event horizons for fermion quasiparticles naturally arise in moving textures in superconductors and Fermi superfluids. We discuss the example of a planar soliton moving in superfluid 3He-A, which is closely analogous to a charged rotating black hole. The moving soliton will radiate quasiparticles via the Hawking effect at a temperature of about 5 \mu K, and via vacuum polarization induced by the effective `electromagnetic field' and `ergoregion'. Superfluid 3He-A thus appears to be a useful system for experimental and theoretical simulations of quantum effects related to event horizons and ergoregions.
