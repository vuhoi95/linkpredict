Title: Ward Identities in Non-equilibrium QED
Authors: M. E. Carrington and Hou Defu and Markus H. Thoma
Abstract: We verify the QED Ward identity for the two- and three -point functions at non-equilibrium in the HTL limit. We use the Keldysh formalism of real time finite temperature field theory. We obtain an identity of the same form as the Ward identity for a set of one loop self-energy and one loop three-point vertex diagrams which are constructed from HTL effective propagators and vertices.
