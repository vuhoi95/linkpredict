Title: A polymer gas on a random surface
Authors: Bergfinnur Durhuus and Thordur Jonsson
Abstract: Using the observation that configurations of N polymers with hard core interactions on a closed random surface correspond to random surfaces with N boundary components we calculate the free energy of a gas of polymers interacting with fully quantized two-dimensional gravity. We derive the equation of state for the polymer gas and find that all the virial coefficients beyond the second one vanish identically.
