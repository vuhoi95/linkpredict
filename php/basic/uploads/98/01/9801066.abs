Title: N=4 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory on a Kaehler Surface
Authors: Robbert Dijkgraaf and Jae-Suk Park and Bernd Schroers
Abstract: We study N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on a Kaehler manifold with $b_2^+ \geq 3$. Adding suitable perturbations we show that the partition function of the N=4 theory is the sum of contributions from two branches: (i) instantons, (ii) a special class of Seiberg-Witten monopoles. We determine the partition function for the theories with gauge group SU(2) and SO(3), using S-duality. This leads us to a formula for the Euler characteristic of the moduli space of instantons.
