Title: Two-Dimensional Dilaton-Gravity Coupled to Massless Spinors
Authors: Marco Cavaglia and Lorenzo Fatibene and Mauro Francaviglia
Abstract: We apply a global and geometrically well-defined formalism for spinor-dilaton-gravity to two-dimensional manifolds. We discuss the general formalism and focus attention on some particular choices of the dilatonic potential. For constant dilatonic potential the model turns out to be completely solvable and the general solution is found. For linear and exponential dilatonic potentials we present the class of exact solutions with a Killing vector.
