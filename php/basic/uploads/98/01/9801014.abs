Title: On Generalized Self-Duality Equations Towards Supersymmetric Quantum  Field Theories Of Forms
Authors: Laurent Baulieu and Celine Laroche
Abstract: We classify possible `self-duality' equations for p-form gauge fields in space-time dimension up to D=16, generalizing the pioneering work of Corrigan et al. (1982) on Yang-Mills fields (p=1) for D from 5 to 8. We impose two crucial requirements. First, there should exist a 2(p+1)-form T invariant under a sub-group H of SO(D). Second, the representation for the SO(D) curvature of the gauge field must decompose under H in a relevant way. When these criteria are fulfilled, the `self-duality' equations can be candidates as gauge functions for SO(D)-covariant and H-invariant topological quantum field theories. Intriguing possibilities occur for dimensions greater than 9, for various p-form gauge fields.
