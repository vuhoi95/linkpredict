Title: Branes and anti-de Sitter spacetimes
Authors: Harm Jan Boonstra and Bas Peeters and Kostas Skenderis
Abstract: We consider a series of duality transformations that leads to a constant shift in the harmonic functions appearing in the description of a configuration of branes. This way, for several intersections of branes, we can relate the original brane configuration which is asymptotically flat to a geometry which is locally isometric to adS_k x E^l x S^m. These results imply that certain branes are dual to supersingleton field theories. We also discuss the implications of our results for supersymmetry enhancement and for supergravity theories in diverse dimensions.
