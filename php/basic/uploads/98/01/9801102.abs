Abstract: We consider N=2 supersymmetric nonlinear sigma-models in two dimensions defined in terms of the nonminimal scalar multiplet. We compute in superspace the one-loop beta function and show that the classical duality between these models and the standard ones defined in terms of chiral superfields is maintained at the quantum one-loop level. Our result provides an explicit application of the recently proposed quantization of the nonminimal scalar multiplet via the Batalin-Vilkovisky procedure.
