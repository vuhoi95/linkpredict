Title: Excitations and S-matrix for su(3) spin chain combining ${3}$ and  ${3^{*}}
Authors: J. Abad and M. RÃ­os
Abstract: The associated Hamiltonian for a su(3) spin chain combining ${3}$ and ${3^{*}}$ representations is calculated. The ansatz equations for this chain are obtained and solved in the thermodynamic limit, and the ground state and excitations are described. Thus, relations between the number of roots and the number of holes in each level have been found . The excited states are characterized by means of these quantum numbers. Finally, the exact S matrix for a state with two holes is found.
