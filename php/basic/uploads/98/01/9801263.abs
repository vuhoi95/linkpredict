Title: New String Excitations in the Two-Higgs Standard Model
Authors: C. Bachas and B. Rai and T. N. Tomaras
Abstract: We establish the existence of a static, classically stable string solution in a region of parameters of the generic two-Higgs Standard Model. In an appropriate limit of parameters, the solution reduces to the well-known soliton of the O(3) non-linear sigma model.
