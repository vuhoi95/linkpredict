Title: Probing Matrix Black Holes
Authors: Miao Li and Emil Martinec
Abstract: Black holes in matrix theory may consist of interacting clusters (correlated domains) which saturate the uncertainty principle. We show that this assumption qualitatively accounts for the thermodynamic properties of both charged and neutral black holes, and reproduces the asymptotic geometry seen by probes.
