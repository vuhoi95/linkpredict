Abstract: We calculate vacuum energy for twisted SUSY D-brane on toroidal background with constant magnetic or constant electric field. Its behaviour for toroidal D-brane (p=2) in constant electric field shows the presence of stable minimum for twisted versions of the theory. That indicates such a background maybe reasonable groundstate.
