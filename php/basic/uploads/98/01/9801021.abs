Title: Supersymmetric KP Hierarchy: ``Ghost'' Symmetry Structure, Reductions  and Darboux-Backlund Solutions
Authors: H. Aratyn and E. Nissimov and S. Pacheva
Abstract: This paper studies Manin-Radul supersymmetric KP hierarchy (MR-SKP) in three related aspects: (i) We find an infinite set of additional (``ghost'') symmetry flows spanning the same (anti-)commutation algebra as the ordinary MR-SKP flows; (ii) The latter are used to construct consistent reductions of the initial unconstrained MR-SKP hierarchy which involves a nontrivial modification for the fermionic flows; (iii) For the simplest constrained MR-SKP hierarchy we show that the orbit of Darboux-Backlund transformations lies on a supersymmetric Toda lattice being a square-root of the standard one-dimensional Toda lattice, and also we find explicit Wronskian-ratio solutions for the super-tau function.
