Title: On the realization of chiral four-dimensional gauge theories using  branes
Authors: A. Hanany and A. Zaffaroni
Abstract: We consider a general brane construction for realizing chiral four-dimensional gauge theories. The advantage of the construction is the simplicity and the possibility of realizing a large class of models existing in the literature. We start the study of these models by determining the matter content and the superpotential which naturally arise in the brane construction.
