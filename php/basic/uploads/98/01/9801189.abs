Title: Spin-Spin Interaction In Matrix Theory
Authors: M. Barrio and R. Helling and G. Polhemus
Abstract: We calculate the spin dependent static force between two D0-branes in Matrix theory. Supersymmetry relates velocity dependent potentials to spin dependent potentials. The well known v^4/r^7 term is related to a theta^8/r^11 term, where theta is the relative spin of the D0-branes. We calculate this term, confirming that it is the lowest order contribution to the static potential, and find its structure consistent with supergravity.
