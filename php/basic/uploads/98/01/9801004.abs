Title: Chiral anomaly and unambiguous rational terms
Authors: Jifeng Yang and Guang-jiong Ni
Abstract: Through more detailed calculations on QED$_{1+1}$ and QED$_{3+1}$ emplying a new treatment of Feynman Amplitudes, we attribute the regularization independent and hence definite origin of chiral anomaly in perturbation theory to an unambiguous term which is a rational function in momentum space. Some relevant remarks are presented.
