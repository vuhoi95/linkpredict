Title: Effective potential in three-dimensional O(N) models
Authors: A. Pelissetto and E. Vicari
Abstract: We consider the effective potential in three-dimensional models with O(N) symmetry. For generic values of N, and in particular for the physically interesting cases N=0,1,2,3, we determine the six-point and eight-point renormalized coupling constants which parametrize its small-field expansion. These estimates are obtained from the analysis of their $\epsilon$-expansion, taking into account the exact results in one and zero dimensions, and, for the Ising model (i.e. N=1), the accurate high-temperature estimates in two dimensions. They are compared with the available results from other approaches. We also obtain corresponding estimates for the two-dimensional O($N$) models.
