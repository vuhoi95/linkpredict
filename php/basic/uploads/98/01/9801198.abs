Title: SU(2) -- Monopole: Interbasis Expansion
Authors: L. G. Mardoyan and A. N. Sissakian
Abstract: This article deals with a nonrelativistic quantum mechanical study of a charge-dyon system with the SU(2)--monopole in five dimensions. The Schr\"odinger equation for this system is separable in the hyperspherical and parabolic coordinates. The problem of interbasis expansion of the wave functions is completely solved. The coefficients for the expansion of the parabolic basis in terms of the hyperspherical basis can be expressed through the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of the group SU(2).
