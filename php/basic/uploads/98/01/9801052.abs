Title: Conformal anomaly for dilaton coupled electromagnetic field
Authors: S. Nojiri and S. D. Odintsov
Abstract: The derivation of the conformal anomaly for dilaton coupled electromagnetic field in curved space is presented. The models of this sort naturally appear in stringy gravity or after spherical reduction of multidimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory. It is shown that unlike the case of minimal vector in curved space or dilaton coupled scalar the anomaly induced effective action cannot be derived. The reason is the same why anomaly induced effective action cannot be constructed for interacting theories (like QED) in curved space.
