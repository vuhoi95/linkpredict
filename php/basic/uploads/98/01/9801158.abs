Title: The generalized multi-channel Kondo model: Thermodynamics and fusion  equations
Authors: N. Andrei and P. Zinn-Justin
Abstract: The SU(N) generalization of the multi-channel Kondo model with arbitrary rectangular impurity representations is considered by means of the Bethe Ansatz. The thermodynamics of the model is analyzed by introducing modified fusion equations for the impurity, leading to a simple description of the different IR fixed points of the theory. The entropy at zero temperature is discussed; in particular the overscreened case is explained in terms of quantum group representation.
