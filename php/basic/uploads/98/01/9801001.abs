Title: Forced Topological Nontrivial Field Configurations
Authors: V. G. Kiselev and Ya. M. Shnir
Abstract: The motion of a one-dimensional kink and its energy losses are considered as a model of interaction of nontrivial topological field configurations with external fields. The approach is based on the calculation of the zero modes excitation probability in the external field. We study in the same way the interaction of the t'Hooft-Polyakov monopole with weak external fields. The basic idea is to treat the excitation of a monopole zero mode as the monopole displacement. The excitation is found perturbatively. As an example we consider the interaction of the t'Hooft-Polyakov monopole with an external uniform magnetic field.
