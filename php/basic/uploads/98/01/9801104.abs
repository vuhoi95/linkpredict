Title: q-Deformed Minkowski Space based on a q-Lorentz Algebra
Authors: B. L. Cerchiai and J. Wess
Abstract: The Hilbert space representations of a non-commutative q-deformed Minkowski space, its momenta and its Lorentz boosts are constructed. The spectrum of the diagonalizable space elements shows a lattice-like structure with accumulation points on the light-cone.
