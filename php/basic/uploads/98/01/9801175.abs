Title: On extremal transitions of Calabi-Yau threefolds and the singularity of  the associated 7-space from rolling
Authors: Volker Braun and Chien-Hao Liu
Abstract: M-theory compactification leads one to consider 7-manifolds obtained by rolling Calabi-Yau threefolds in the web of Calabi-Yau moduli spaces. The resulting 7-space in general has singularities governed by the extremal transition undergone. After providing some background in Sec. 1, the simplest case of conifold transitions is studied in Sec. 2. In Sec. 3 we employ topological methods, Smale's classification theorem of smooth simply-connected spin closed 5-manifolds, and a computer code in the Appendix to understand the 5-manifolds that appear as the link of the singularity of a singuler Calabi-Yau threefolds from a Type II primitive contraction of a smooth one. From this we obtain many locally admissible extremal transition pairs of Calabi-Yau threefolds, listed in Sec. 4. Their global realization will require further study. As a mathematical byproduct in the pursuit of the subject, we obtain a formula to compute the topology of the boundary of the tubular neighborhood of a Gorenstein rational singular del Pezzo surface embedded in a smooth Calabi-Yau threefold as a divisor.
