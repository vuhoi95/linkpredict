Title: Stability analysis and absorption cross-section in three-dimensional  black string
Authors: H. W. Lee and N. J. Kim and Y. S. Myung and Jin Young Kim
Abstract: It is shown that all string fields except dilaton are non-propagating in the (2+1)-dimensional black string. One finds that the perturbation around the black string reveals a mixing between the dilaton and other fields. Under the new gauge(dilaton gauge), we disentangle this mixing and obtain one decoupled dilaton equation. It turns out that this black string is stable. From the scattering of dilaton off the neutral black string(N=0), we find the absorption cross-section. Further the absorption cross-section for minimally coupled scalar is obtained and we compared it with that of dilaton.
