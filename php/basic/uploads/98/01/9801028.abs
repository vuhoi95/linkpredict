Abstract: We derive the Feynman rules for the graviton in the presence of a flat Robertson-Walker background and give explicit expressions for the propagator in the physically interesting cases of inflation, radiation domination, and matter domination. The aforementioned background is generated by a scalar field source which should be taken to be dynamical. As an elementary application, we compute the corrections to the Newtonian gravitational force in the present matter dominated era and conclude -- as expected -- that they are negligible except for the largest scales.
