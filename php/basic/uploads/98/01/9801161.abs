Authors: A. H. Chamseddine and W. A. Sabra
Abstract: BPS black hole configurations which break half of supersymmetry in the theory of N=2, d=5 supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of abelian vector multiplets are discussed. A general class of solutions comprising all known BPS rotating black hole solutions is obtained.
