Title: Bogomolnyi Bound with a Cosmological Constant
Authors: Yoonbai Kim and Kyoungtae Kimm
Abstract: Bogomolnyi-type bound is constructed for the topological solitons in O(3) nonlinear $\sigma$ model coupled to gravity with a negative cosmological constant. Spacetimes made by self-dual solutions form a class of G\"{o}del-type universe. In the limit of a spinless massive point particle, the obtained stationary metric does not violate the causality and it is a new point particle solution different from the known static hyperboloid and black hole. We also showed that static Nielsen-Olesen vortices saturate Bogomolnyi-type bound only when the cosmological constant vanishes.
