Title: Temperature correlators in the one-dimensional Hubbard model in the  strong coupling limit
Authors: A. G. Izergin and A. G. Pronko and N. I. Abarenkova
Abstract: We consider the one-dimensional Hubbard model with the infinitely strong repulsion. The two-point dynamical temperature correlation functions are calculated. They are represented as Fredholm determinants of linear integrable integral operators.
