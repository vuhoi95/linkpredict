Title: D=26 and Exact Solution to the Conformal-Gauge Two-Dimensional Quantum  Gravity
Authors: Mitsuo Abe and Noboru Nakanishi
Abstract: The conformal-gauge two-dimensional quantum gravity is formulated in the framework of the BRS quantization and solved completely in the Heisenberg picture: All n-point Wightman functions are explicitly obtained. The field-equation anomaly is shown to exist as in other gauges, but there is no other subtlety. At the critical dimension D=26 of the bosonic string, the field-equation anomaly is shown to be absent. However, this result is not equivalent to the statement that the conformal anomaly is proportional to D-26. The existence of the FP-ghost number current anomaly is seen to be an illusion.
