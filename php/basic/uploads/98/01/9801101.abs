Title: Coulomb gas representation of quantum Hall effect on Riemann surfaces
Authors: M. Alimohammadi and H. Mohseni Sadjadi
Abstract: Using the correlation function of chiral vertex operators of the Coulomb gas model, we find the Laughlin wavefunctions of quantum Hall effect, with filling factor $\nu =1/m$, on Riemann sufaces with Poincare metric. The same is done for quasihole wavefunctions. We also discuss their plasma analogy.
