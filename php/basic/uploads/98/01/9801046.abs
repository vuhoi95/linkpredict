Title: The determinant representation for quantum correlation functions of the  sinh-Gordon model
Authors: V. E. Korepin and N. A. Slavnov
Abstract: We consider the quantum sinh-Gordon model in this paper. Using known formulae for form factors we sum up all their contributions and obtain a closed expression for a correlation function. This expression is a determinant of an integral operator. Similar determinant representations were proven to be useful not only in the theory of correlation functions, but also in the matrix models.
