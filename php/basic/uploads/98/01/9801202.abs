Title: Strings and D-Branes with Boundaries
Authors: C. S. Chu and P. S. Howe and E. Sezgin
Abstract: The covariant field equations of ten-dimensional super D-branes are obtained by considering fundamental strings whose ends lie in the superworldsurface of the D-brane. By considering in a similar fashion Dp-branes ending on D(p+2)-branes we derive equations describing D-branes with dual potentials, as well as the vector potentials.
