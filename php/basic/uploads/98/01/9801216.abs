Title: On The Deser-Siegel-Townsend Notivarg
Authors: Malgorzata Bakalarska and Waclaw Tybor
Abstract: The interaction of the notivarg with an external Weyl current is discussed. The continuity equation for the Weyl current is obtained. The canonical analysis of the theory of the notivarg interacting with the external Weyl current is performed. The covariant propagator of the notivarg is found.
