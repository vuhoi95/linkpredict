Title: D-brane conformal field theory
Authors: J. Fuchs and C. Schweigert
Abstract: We outline the structure of boundary conditions in conformal field theory. A boundary condition is specified by a consistent collection of reflection coefficients for bulk fields on the disk together with a choice of an automorphism \omega of the fusion rules that preserves conformal weights. Non-trivial automorphisms \omega correspond to D-brane configurations for arbitrary conformal field theories.
