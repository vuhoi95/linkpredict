Title: Quantum Transformations
Authors: Alon E. Faraggi and Marco Matone
Abstract: We show that the stationary quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation of non-relativistic 1D systems, underlying Bohmian mechanics, takes the classical form with $\partial_q$ replaced by $\partial_{\hat q}$ where $d\hat q={dq\over \sqrt{1-\beta^2}}$. The $\beta^2$ term essentially coincides with the quantum potential that, like $V-E$, turns out to be proportional to a curvature arising in projective geometry. In agreement with the recently formulated equivalence principle, these ``quantum transformations'' indicate that the classical and quantum potentials deform space geometry.
