Title: Canonical Equivalence between Super D-string and Type IIB Superstring
Authors: Yuji Igarashi and Katsumi Itoh and Kiyoshi Kamimura and Rie Kuriki
Abstract: We show that the super D-string action is canonically equivalent to the type IIB superstring action with a world-sheet gauge field. Canonical transformation to the type IIB theory with dynamical tension is also constructed to establish the SL(2,Z) covariance beyond the semi-classical approximations.
