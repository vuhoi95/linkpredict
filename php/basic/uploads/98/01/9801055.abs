Title: Disordered Dirac Fermions: Multifractality Termination and Logarithmic  Conformal Field Theories
Authors: J. -S. Caux and N. Taniguchi and A. M. Tsvelik
Abstract: We reexamine in detail the problem of fermions interacting with a non-Abelian random vector potential. Without resorting to the replica or supersymmetry approaches, we show that in the limit of infinite disorder strength the theory possesses an exact solution which takes the form of a logarithmic conformal field theory. We show that the proper treatment of the locality conditions in the SU(2) theory leads to the termination of the multifractal spectrum, or in other words to the termination of the infinite hierarchies of negative-dimensional operators that were thought to occur. Based on arguments of logarithmic degeneracies, we conjecture that such a termination mechanism should be present for general SU(N). Moreover, our results lead to the conclusion that the previous replica solution of this problem yields incorrect results.
