Title: Modifying N=2 Supersymmetry via Partial Breaking
Authors: Evgeny Ivanov and Boris Zupnik
Abstract: We study realization of N=2 SUSY in N=2 abelian gauge theory with electric and magnetic $FI$ terms within a manifestly supersymmetric formulation. We find that after dualization of even one $FI$ term N=2 SUSY is realized in a partial breaking mode off shell. In the case of two $FI$ terms, this regime is preserved on shell. The N=2 SUSY algebra is shown to be modified on gauge-variant objects.
