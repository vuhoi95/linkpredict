Title: Summing one- and two-dimensional series related to the Euler series
Authors: Odd Magne Ogreid and Per Osland
Abstract: We present results for some infinite series appearing in Feynman diagram calculations, many of which are similar to the Euler series. These include both one-dimensional and two-dimensional series. Most of these series can be expressed in terms of zeta(2), zeta(3), the Catalan constant G and Cl{2}(pi/3) where Cl{2}(theta) is Clausen's function.
