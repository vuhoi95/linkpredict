Title: Top Quark Seesaw Theory of Electroweak Symmetry Breaking
Authors: R. Sekhar Chivukula and Bogdan A. Dobrescu and Howard Georgi and Christopher T. Hill
Abstract: We study electroweak symmetry breaking involving the seesaw mechanism of quark condensation. These models produce a composite Higgs boson involving the left-handed top quark, yet the top mass arises naturally at the observed scale. We describe a schematic model which illustrates the general dynamical ideas. We also consider a generic low-energy effective theory which includes several composite scalars, and we use the effective potential formalism to compute their spectrum. We develop a more detailed model in which certain features of the schematic model are replaced by additional dynamics.
