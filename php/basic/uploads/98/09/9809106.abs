Title: Aspects of QCD Dynamics from String Theory
Authors: Akikazu Hashimoto and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We study dynamical aspects of large N QCD_4 via supergravity on Anti de Sitter black hole geometry. We compute the mass spectrum, the topological susceptibility and the gluon condensate and make a comparison to lattice simulations. We present analogous results for QCD_3.
