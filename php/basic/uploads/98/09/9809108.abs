Title: Quaternionic Taub-NUT from the harmonic space approach
Authors: Evgeny Ivanov and Galliano Valent
Abstract: We use the harmonic space technique to construct explicitly a quaternionic extension of the Taub-NUT metric. It depends on two parameters, the first being the Taub-NUT `mass' and the second one the cosmological constant.
