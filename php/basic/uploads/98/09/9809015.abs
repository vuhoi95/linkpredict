Title: Kink-antikink interactions in the double sine-Gordon equation and the  problem of resonance frequencies
Authors: V. A. Gani and A. E. Kudryavtsev
Abstract: We studied the kink-antikink collision process for the "double sine-Gordon" (DSG) equation in 1+1 dimensions at different values of the potential parameter $R>0$. For small values of $R$ we discuss the problem of resonance frequencies. We give qualitative explanation of the frequency shift in comparison with the frequency of the discrete level in the potential well of isolated kink. We show that in this region of the parameter $R$ the effective long-range interaction between kink and antikink takes place.
