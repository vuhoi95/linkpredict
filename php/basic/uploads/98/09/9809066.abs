Title: The perturbation $Ï†_{2,1}$ of the M(p,p+1) models of conformal field  theory and related polynomial character identities
Authors: Alexander Berkovich and Barry M. McCoy
Abstract: Using $q$-trinomial coefficients of Andrews and Baxter along with the technique of telescopic expansions, we propose and prove a complete set of polynomial identities of Rogers-Ramanujan type for M(p, p+1) models of conformal field theory perturbed by the operator $phi_{2,1}$. The bosonic form of our polynomials is closely related to corner transfer matrix sums which arise in the computation of the order parameter in the regime $1^+$ of $A_{p-1}$ dilute models. In the limit where the degree of the polynomials tends to infinity our identities provide new companion fermionic representations for all Virasoro characters of unitary minimal series.
