Title: Dynamical symmetry breaking in Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model under the  influence of external electromagnetic and gravitational fields
Authors: E. Elizalde and Yu. I. Shil'nov
Abstract: Dynamical symmetry breaking is investigated for a four-fermion Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in external electromagnetic and gravitational fields. An effective potential is calculated in the leading order of the large-N expansion using the proper-time Schwinger formalism. Phase transitions accompanying a chiral symmetry breaking in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model are studied in detail. A magnetic calalysis phenomenon is shown to exist in curved spacetime but it turns out to lose its universal character because the chiral symmetry is restored above some critical positive value of the spacetime curvature.
