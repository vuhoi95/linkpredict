Title: A q-analogue of Nahm's formalism for self-dual gauge fields
Authors: Masaru Kamata and Atsushi Nakamula
Abstract: We present a q-analogue of Nahm's formalism for the BPS monopole, which gives self-dual gauge fields with a deformation parameter q. The theory of the basic hypergeometric series is used in our formalism. In the limit q -> 1 the gauge fields approach the BPS monopole and Nahm's result is reproduced.
