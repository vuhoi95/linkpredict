Title: Hopf Structure in Nambu-Lie n-Algebras
Authors: A. E. Santana and R. Muradian
Abstract: We give a definition and study Hopf structures in ternary (and n-ary) Nambu-Lie algebra. The fundamental concepts of 3-coalgebra, 3-bialgebra and Hopf 3- algebra are introduced. Some examples of Hopf structures are analyzed.
