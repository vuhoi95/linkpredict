Title: U-duality and M-Theory
Authors: N. A. Obers and B. Pioline
Abstract: This work is intended as a pedagogical introduction to M-theory and to its maximally supersymmetric toroidal compactifications, in the frameworks of 11D supergravity, type II string theory and M(atrix) theory. U-duality is used as the main tool and guideline in uncovering the spectrum of BPS states. We review the 11D supergravity algebra and elementary 1/2-BPS solutions, discuss T-duality in the perturbative and non-perturbative sectors from an algebraic point of view, and apply the same tools to the analysis of U-duality at the level of the effective action and the BPS spectrum, with a particular emphasis on Weyl and Borel generators. We derive the U-duality multiplets of BPS particles and strings, U-duality invariant mass formulae for 1/2- and 1/4-BPS states for general toroidal compactifications on skew tori with gauge backgrounds, and U-duality multiplets of constraints for states to preserve a given fraction of supersymmetry. A number of mysterious states are encountered in D<=3, whose existence is implied by T-duality and 11D Lorentz invariance. We then move to the M(atrix) theory point of view, give an introduction to Discrete Light Cone Quantization (DLCQ) in general and DLCQ of M-theory in particular. We discuss the realization of U-duality as electric-magnetic dualities of the Matrix gauge theory, display the Matrix gauge theory BPS spectrum in detail, and discuss the conjectured extended U-duality group in this scheme.
