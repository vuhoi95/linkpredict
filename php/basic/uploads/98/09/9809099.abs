Title: A way to get a well-defined derivative expansion of real-time thermal  effective actions
Authors: Maria Asprouli and Victor Galan-Gonzalez
Abstract: We compute the quadratic part of the thermal effective action for real scalar fields which are initially in thermal equilibrium and vary slowly in time using a generalised real-time formalism proposed by Le Bellac and Mabilat \cite{belmab}. We derive both Real Time and Imaginary Time Formalisms and find that the result is analytic at the limits of zero external four-momenta when using our full time contour. We expand the fields in time up to the second derivative and discuss the initial time dependence of our result before and after the expansion in terms of equilibrium.
