Authors: S. V. Molodtsov and A. M. Snigirev and G. M. Zinovjev
Abstract: The phonon-like excitations of (anti)-instanton liquid ($\bar II$) due to adiabatic variations of vacuum wave functions are studied in this paper. The kinetic energy term is found and proper effective Lagrangian for such excitations is evaluated.The properties of their spectrum, while the corresponding masses are defined by $\Lambda_{QCD}$ with prevailing chromoelectric component, are investigated based on the phenomenology of QCD vacuum already developed.
