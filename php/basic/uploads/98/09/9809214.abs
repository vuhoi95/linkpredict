Title: Bosonic Casimir effect in external magnetic field
Authors: M. V. Cougo-Pinto and C. Farina and M. R. Negrao and A. C. Tort
Abstract: We compute the influence of an external magnetic field on the Casimir energy of a massive charged scalar field confined between two parallel infinite plates. For this case the obtained result shows that the magnetic field inhibits the Casimir effect.
