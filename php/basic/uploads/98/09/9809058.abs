Title: Finite Size Formula in the XYZ Spin Chain
Authors: Yasuhiro Fujii and Miki Wadati
Abstract: The XYZ spin chain with boundaries is studied. We construct the vacuum state by the vertex operators in the level one modules of the elliptic algebra, and compact it through a geometric symmetry of the model called the turning symmetry. From this simplified expression the ``finite size formula'' for magnetizations in the bounded and in the half-infinite chains is deduced. Applying this formula we calculate the spontaneous magnetization in the bounded XYZ model.
