Title: The Glue Around Quarks and the Interquark Potential
Authors: Emili Bagan and Robin Horan and Martin Lavelle and David McMullan
Abstract: The quarks of quark models cannot be identified with the quarks of the QCD Lagrangian. We review the restrictions that gauge field theories place on any description of physical (colour) charges. A method to construct charged particles is presented. The solutions are applied to a variety of applications. Their Green's functions are shown to be free of infra-red divergences to all orders in perturbation theory. The interquark potential is analysed and it is shown that the interaction responsible for anti-screening results from the force between two separately gauge invariant constituent quarks. A fundamental limit on the applicability of quark models is identified.
