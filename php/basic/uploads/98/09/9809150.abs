Title: Gauge connection between the WZNW system and 2D induced gravity
Authors: M. Blagojevic and B. Sazdovic
Abstract: We introduce a consistent gauge extension of the SL(2,R) WZNW system, defined by a difference of two simple WZNW actions. By integrating out some dynamical variables in the functional integral, we show that the resulting effective theory coincides with the induced gravity in 2D. General solutions of both theories are found and related to each other.
