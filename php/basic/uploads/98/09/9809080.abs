Abstract: We study bosonisation in the massive Thirring and sine-Gordon models at finite temperature and nonzero fermion chemical potential. Both canonical operator and path integral approaches are used to prove the equality of the partition functions of the two models at finite $T$ and zero chemical potential, as it has been recently shown. This enables the relationship between thermal normal ordering and path-integral renormalisation to be specified. Furthermore, we prove that thermal averages of zero-charge operators can also be identified. At nonzero chemical potential and temperature we show, in perturbation theory around the massless case, that the bosonised theory is the sine-Gordon model plus an additional topological term, accounting for the existence of zero charge excitations (the fermions or the kinks) in the thermal bath. This result is the 2D version of the low-energy lagrangian at finite baryon density.
