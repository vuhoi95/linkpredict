Title: Two Phase Transitions in Chiral Gross-Neveu Model in $2+ ε$  Dimensions at Low N
Authors: H. Kleinert and E. Babaev
Abstract: We show that the chiral Gross-Neveu model in $2+ \epsilon$ dimensions has for a small number $N$ of fermions two phase transitions corresponding to pair formation and pair condensation. In the first transition, fermions and antifermions acquire spontaneously a mass and are bound to pairs which behave like a Bose liquid in a chirally symmetric state. In the second transition, the Bose liquid condenses into a coherent state which breaks chiral symmetry. This suggests the possibility that in particle physics, the generation of quark masses may also happen separately from the breakdown of chiral symmetry.
