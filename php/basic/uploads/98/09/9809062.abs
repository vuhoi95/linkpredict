Title: On the Nonabelian Aharonov Bohm Scattering of Spinless Particles
Authors: M. Gomes and L. C. Malacarne and A. J. da Silva
Abstract: The Aharonov Bohm scattering for spinless, isospin 1/2, particles interacting through a nonabelian Chern-Simons field is studied. Starting from the relativistic quantum field theory and using a Coulomb gauge formulation, the one loop renormalization program is implemented. Through the introduction of an intermediary cutoff, separating the regions of high and low integration momentum, the nonrelativistic limit is derived. The next to leading relativistic approximation is also determined. In this approach quantum field theory vacuum polarization effects are automatically incorporated.
