Title: Cosmological Supergravity from a Massive Superparticle and Super  Cosmological Black Holes
Authors: M. E. Knutt-Wehlau and R. B. Mann
Abstract: We describe in superspace a classical theory of two dimensional $(1,1)$ dilaton supergravity with a cosmological constant, both with and without coupling to a massive superparticle. We give general exact non-trivial superspace solutions for the compensator superfield that describes the supergravity in both cases. We then use these compensator solutions to construct models of two-dimensional supersymmetric cosmological black holes.
