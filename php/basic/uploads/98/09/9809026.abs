Title: Characteristic uncertainty relations
Authors: D. A. Trifonov and S. G. Donev
Abstract: New uncertainty relations for n observables are established. The relations take the invariant form of inequalities between the characteristic coefficients of order r, r = 1,2,...,n, of the uncertainty matrix and the matrix of mean commutators of the observables. It is shown that the second and the third order characteristic inequalities for the three generators of SU(1,1) and SU(2) are minimized in the corresponding group-related coherent states with maximal symmetry.
