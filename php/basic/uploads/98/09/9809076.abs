Title: Correlations in the impenetrable electron gas
Authors: F. GÃ¶hmann and A. R. Its and V. E. Korepin
Abstract: We consider non-relativistic electrons in one dimension with infinitely strong repulsive delta function interaction. We calculate the long-time, large-distance asymptotics of field-field correlators in the gas phase. The gas phase at low temperatures is characterized by the ideal gas law. We calculate the exponential decay, the power law corrections and the constant factor of the asymptotics. Our results are valid at any temperature. They simplify at low temperatures, where they are easily recognized as products of free fermionic correlation functions with corrections arising due to the interaction.
