Title: Seiberg-Witten Systems and Whitham Hierarchies: a Short Review
Authors: A. Marshakov and A. Mironov
Abstract: We briefly review the Whitham hierarchies and their applications to integrable systems of the Seiberg-Witten type. The simplest example of the N=2 supersymmetric SU(2) pure gauge theory is considered in detail and the corresponding Whitham solutions are found explicitely.
