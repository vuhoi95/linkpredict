Title: Highest weight irreducible representations of the Lie superalgebra  $gl(1/\infty)$
Authors: T. D. Palev and N. I. Stoilova
Abstract: Two classes of irreducible highest weight modules of the general linear Lie superalgebra $gl(1/\infty)$ are constructed. Within each module a basis is introduced and the transformation relations of the basis under the action of the algebra generators are written down.
