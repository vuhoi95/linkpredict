Title: Hyperelliptic curves for multi-channel quantum wires and the  multi-channel Kondo problem
Authors: P. Fendley and H. Saleur
Abstract: We study the current in a multi-channel quantum wire and the magnetization in the multi-channel Kondo problem. We show that at zero temperature they can be written simply in terms of contour integrals over a (two-dimensional) hyperelliptic curve. This allows one to easily demonstrate the existence of weak-coupling to strong-coupling dualities. In the Kondo problem, the curve is the same for under- and over-screened cases; the only change is in the contour.
