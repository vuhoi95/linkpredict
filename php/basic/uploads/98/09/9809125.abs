Title: Equivalence Principle, Planck Length and Quantum Hamilton-Jacobi  Equation
Authors: Alon E. Faraggi and Marco Matone
Abstract: The Quantum Stationary HJ Equation (QSHJE) that we derived from the equivalence principle, gives rise to initial conditions which cannot be seen in the Schroedinger equation. Existence of the classical limit leads to a dependence of the integration constant $\ell=\ell_1+i\ell_2$ on the Planck length. Solutions of the QSHJE provide a trajectory representation of quantum mechanics which, unlike Bohm's theory, has a non-trivial action even for bound states and no wave guide is present. The quantum potential turns out to be an intrinsic potential energy of the particle which, similarly to the relativistic rest energy, is never vanishing.
