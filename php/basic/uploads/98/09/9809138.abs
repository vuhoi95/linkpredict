Title: Colour Charges and Anti-Screening
Authors: Emili Bagan and Robin Horan and Martin Lavelle and David McMullan
Abstract: If constituent quarks are to emerge from QCD they must have well defined colour and be energetically favoured. After reviewing the general properties of charges in gauge theories, a method for constructing charges is presented and applied to the infra-red structure of the theory and to the interquark potential. Both of these applications supply a physical interpretation of the structures found in the construction of charges. We will see that constituent structures arise in QCD.
