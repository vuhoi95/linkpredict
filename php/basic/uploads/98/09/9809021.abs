Title: The stationary KdV hierarchy and so(2,1) as a spectrum generating  algebra
Authors: H. -D. Doebner and R. Z. Zhdanov
Abstract: The family F of all potentials V(x) for which the Hamiltonian H in one space dimension possesses a high order Lie symmetry is determined. A sub-family F', which contains a class of potentials allowing a realization of so(2,1) as spectrum generating algebra of H through differential operators of finite order, is identified. Furthermore and surprisingly, the families F and F' are shown to be related to the stationary KdV hierarchy. Hence, the "harmless" Hamiltonian H connects different mathematical objects, high order Lie symmetry, realization of so(2,1)-spectrum generating algebra and families of nonlinear differential equations. We describe in a physical context the interplay between these objects.
