Title: Heat Kernel Coefficients for Chern-Simons Boundary Conditions in QED
Authors: E. Elizalde and D. V. Vassilevich
Abstract: We consider the four dimensional Euclidean Maxwell theory with a Chern-Simons term on the boundary. The corresponding gauge invariant boundary conditions become dependent on tangential derivatives. Taking the four-sphere as a particular example, we calculate explicitly a number of the first heat kernel coefficients and obtain the general formulas that yields any desired coefficient. A remarkable observation is that the coefficient $a_2$, which defines the one-loop counterterm and the conformal anomaly, does not depend on the Chern-Simons coupling constant, while the heat kernel itself becomes singular at a certain (critical) value of the coupling. This could be a reflection of a general property of Chern-Simons theories.
