Title: A Simple Derivation of the Hard Thermal Loop Effective Action
Authors: Per Elmfors and T. H. Hansson and Ismail Zahed
Abstract: We use the background field method along with a special gauge condition, to derive the hard thermal loop effective action in a simple manner. The new point in the paper is to relate the effective action explicitly to the S-matrix from the onset.
