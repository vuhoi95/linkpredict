Title: The Operator Product Expansion for Wilson Loops and Surfaces in the  Large N Limit
Authors: David Berenstein and Richard Corrado and Willy Fischler and Juan Maldacena
Abstract: The operator product expansion for ``small'' Wilson loops in {\cal N}=4, d=4 SYM is studied. The OPE coefficients are calculated in the large N and g_{YM}^2 N limit by exploiting the AdS/CFT correspondence. We also consider Wilson surfaces in the (0,2), d=6 superconformal theory. In this case, we find that the UV divergent terms include a term proportional to the rigid string action.
