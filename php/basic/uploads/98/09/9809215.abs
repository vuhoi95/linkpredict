Title: Optimized Perturbation Theory at Finite Temperature --- Renormalization  and Nambu-Goldstone theorem in O(N) phi^4 Theory ---
Authors: S. Chiku and T. Hatsuda
Abstract: The optimized perturbation theory (OPT) at finite temperature recently developed by the present authors is reviewed by using O(N) phi^4 theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking. The method resums automatically higher loops (including the hard thermal loops) at high $T$ and simultaneously cures the problem of tachyonic poles at relatively low $T$. We prove that (i) the renormalization of the ultra-violet divergences can be carried out systematically in any given order of OPT, and (ii) the Nambu-Goldstone theorem is satisfied for arbitrary $N$ and for any given order of OPT.
