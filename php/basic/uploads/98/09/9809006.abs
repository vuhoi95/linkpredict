Title: Spectrum of the 2-Flavor Schwinger Model from the Heisenberg Spin Chain
Authors: F. Berruto and G. Grignani and G. W. Semenoff and P. Sodano
Abstract: We study the strong coupling limit of the 2-flavor lattice Schwinger model in the Hamiltonian formalism using staggered fermions. We show that the problem of finding the low-lying states is equivalent to solving the Heisenberg antiferromagnetic spin chain. We find good agreement with the continuum theory.
