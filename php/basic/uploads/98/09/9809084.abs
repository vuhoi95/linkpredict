Title: Influence Action and decoherence of hydrodynamic modes
Authors: Esteban Calzetta and Bei-lok Hu
Abstract: We derive an influence action for the heat diffusion equation and from its spectral dependence show that long wavelength hydrodynamic modes are most readily decohered. The result is independent of the details of the microscopic dynamics, and follows from general principles alone.
