Title: The elastic QCD dipole amplitude at one-loop
Authors: H. Navelet and R. Peschanski
Abstract: We derive the analytic expression of the two one-loop dipole contributions to the elastic 4-gluon amplitude in QCD. The first one corresponds to the double QCD pomeron exchange, the other to an order alpha^2 correction to one-pomeron exchange. Both are expressed in terms of the square of the recently derived triple QCD pomeron vertex and involve a summation over all conformal Eigenvectors of the BFKL kernel.
