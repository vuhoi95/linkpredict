Title: Particles as singularities within the unified algebraic field dynamics
Authors: V. V. Kassandrov and J. A. Rizcalla
Abstract: We consider a nonlinear generalization of Cauchy-Riemann eqs. to the algebra of biquaternions. From here we come to "universal generating equations" (1) which deal with 2-spinor and gauge fields and form the basis of some unified algebraic field theory. For each solution of eqs.(1) the components of spinor field satisfy the eikonal and d'Alembert eqs., and the strengths of gauge field - both Maxwell and Yang-Mills eqs. We reduce eqs.(1) to that of shear-free geodesic null congruence and integrate them in twistor variables. Particles are treated as concurrent singularities of the effective metric and the electromagnetic field. For unisingular solutions the electric charge is quantized, and the metric is of Schwarzschild or Kerr type. Bisingular solutions are announced too.
