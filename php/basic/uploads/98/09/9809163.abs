Title: Perturbative Relationships Between QCD and Gravity and Some Implications
Authors: Z. Bern and L. Dixon and D. C. Dunbar and M. Perelstein and J. S. Rozowsky
Abstract: We discuss nontrivial examples illustrating that perturbative gravity is in some sense the `square' of gauge theory. This statement can be made precise at tree-level using the Kawai, Lewellen and Tye relations between open and closed string tree amplitudes. These relations, when combined with modern methods for computing amplitudes, allow us to obtain loop-level relations, and thereby new supergravity loop amplitudes. The amplitudes show that N=8 supergravity is less ultraviolet divergent than previously thought. As a different application, we show that the collinear splitting amplitudes of gravity are essentially squares of the corresponding ones in QCD.
