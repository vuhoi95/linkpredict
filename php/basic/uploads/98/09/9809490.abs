Title: Parametric Amplification of Gravitational Fluctuations During Reheating
Authors: F. Finelli and R. Brandenberger
Abstract: We demonstrate that cosmological perturbations can undergo amplification by parametric resonance during the preheating period following inflation, even on scales larger than the Hubble radius, without violating causality. A unified description of gravitational and matter fluctuations is crucial in order to determine the strength of the instability. To extract specific signatures of the oscillating inflaton field during reheating, it is essential to focus on a variable describing metric fluctuations which is constant in the standard analyses of inflation. When doing this in the case of a massive inflaton without self coupling, we find no additional growth of super-horizon modes during reheating beyond what the usual analyses of the growth of fluctuations predict. However, for a massless self coupled inflaton, there is an initial increase in the value of the gravitational potential, which may lead to different predictions for observations.
