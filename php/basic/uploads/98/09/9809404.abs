Title: GUT Cosmic Magnetic Fields in a Warm Inflationary Universe
Authors: Arjun Berera and Thomas W. Kephart and Stuart D. Wick
Abstract: Sources of magnetic fields from grand unified theories are studied in the warm inflation regime. A ferromagnetic Savvidy vacuum scenario is presented that yields observationally interesting large scale magnetic fields. As an intermediate step, a general analysis is made of defect production at the onset of warm inflation and monopole constraints are obtained. Many features of this Savvidy vacuum scenario are applicable within a supercooled inflation regime and these points are discussed.
