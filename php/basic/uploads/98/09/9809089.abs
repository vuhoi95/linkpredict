Title: Nilpotent Marsh and SUSY QM
Authors: V. P. Akulov and Steven Duplij
Abstract: We consider the nilpotent additions to classical trajectories in supersymmetric and nonsupersymmetric theories. The condition of anilpotence of action on some generalized solutions leads to the Witten supersymmetric Lagrangian. The condition of anilpotence of topological charge is the same as one of superpotential with spontaneous broken supersymmetry. We should vanish half of Grassmann constants of integration, because in this case only we obtain the same number of normalized bosonic and fermionic zero modes.
