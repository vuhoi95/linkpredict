Title: Integrating Geometry in General 2D Dilaton Gravity with Matter
Authors: W. Kummer and H. Liebl and D. V. Vassilevich
Abstract: General 2d dilaton theories, containing spherically symmetric gravity and hence the Schwarzschild black hole as a special case, are quantized by an exact path integral of their geometric (Cartan-) variables. Matter, represented by minimally coupled massless scalar fields is treated in terms of a systematic perturbation theory. The crucial prerequisite for our approach is the use of a temporal gauge for the spin connection and for light cone components of the zweibeine which amounts to an Eddington Finkelstein gauge for the metric. We derive the generating functional in its most general form which allows a perturbation theory in the scalar fields. The relation of the zero order functional to the classical solution is established. As an example we derive the effective (gravitationally) induced 4-vertex for scalar fields.
