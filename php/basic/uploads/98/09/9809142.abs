Title: Massive Higher Spin States in String Theory and the Principle of  Equivalence
Authors: Ioannis Giannakis and James T. Liu and Massimo Porrati
Abstract: In this paper we study three point functions of the Type II superstring involving one graviton and two massive states, focusing in particular on the spin-7/2 fermions at the first mass level. Defining a gravitational quadrupole ``h-factor'', we find that the non-minimal interactions of string states in general are parametrized by $h\ne1$, in contrast to the preferred field theory value of h=1 (for tree-level unitarity). This difference arises from the fact that consistent gravitational interactions of strings are related to the presence of a complete tower of massive states, not present in the ordinary field theory case.
