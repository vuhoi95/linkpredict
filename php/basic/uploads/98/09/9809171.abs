Title: New supersymmetry algebras from partial supersymmetry breaking
Authors: Jonathan A. Bagger and Richard Altendorfer
Abstract: In this talk we will study the partial breaking of supersymmetry in flat and anti de Sitter space. We will see that partial breaking in flat space can be accomplished using either of two representations for the massive N=1 spin-3/2 multiplet. We will "unHiggs" each representation and find a new N=2 supergravity and a new N=2 supersymmetry algebra. We will also see that partial supersymmetry breaking in AdS space can give rise to a new N=2 supersymmetry algebra, one that is necessarily nonlinearly realized.
