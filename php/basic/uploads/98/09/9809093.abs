Title: Classical Teichmuller theory and (2+1) gravity
Authors: R. Benedetti and E. Guadagnini
Abstract: We consider classical Teichmuller theory and the geodesic flow on the cotangent bundle of the Teichmuller space. We show that the corresponding orbits provide a canonical description of certain (2+1) gravity systems in which a set of point-like particles evolve in universes with topology S_g x R where S_g is a Riemann surface of genus g >1. We construct an explicit York's slicing presentation of the associated spacetimes, we give an interpretation of the asymptotic states in terms of measured foliations and discuss the structure of the phase spaces.
