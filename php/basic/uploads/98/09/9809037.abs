Title: Self-dual vortex-like configurations in SU(2) Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: A. Gonzalez-Arroyo and A. Montero
Abstract: We show that there are solutions of the SU(2) Yang-Mills classical equations of motion in R^4, which are self-dual and vortex-like(fluxons). The action density is concentrated along a thick two-dimensional wall (the world sheet of a straight infinite vortex line). The configurations are constructed from self-dual R^2 x T^2 configurations.
