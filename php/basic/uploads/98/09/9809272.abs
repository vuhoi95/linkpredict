Title: The Dualized Standard Model and its Applications
Authors: HM Chan and J Bordes and ST Tsou
Abstract: The Dualized Standard Model offers a natural explanation for Higgs fields and 3 generations of fermions plus a perturbative method for calculating SM parameters. By adjusting only 3 parameters, 14 quark and lepton masses and mixing parameters (including $\nu$ oscillations) are calculated with general good success. Further predictions are obtained in post-GZK air showers and FCNC decays.
