Title: Anyonic physical observables and spin phase transition
Authors: Hyun Seok Yang and Bum-Hoon Lee
Abstract: The quantization of charged matter system coupled to Chern-Simons gauge fields is analyzed in a covariant gauge fixing, and gauge invariant physical anyon operators satisfying fractional statistics are constructed in a symmetric phase, based on Dirac's recipe performed on QED. This method provides us a definite way of identifying physical spectrums free from gauge ambiguity and constructing physical anyon operators under a covariant gauge fixing. We then analyze the statistical spin phase transition in a symmetry-broken phase and show that the Higgs mechanism transmutes an anyon satisfying fractional statistics into a canonical boson, a spin 0 Higgs boson or a topologically massive photon.
