Title: Nonlocally-Correlated Disorder and Delocalization in One Dimension:  Density of States
Authors: Ikuo Ichinose and Masaomi Kimura
Abstract: We study delocalization transition in a one-dimensional electron system with quenched disorder by using supersymmetric (SUSY) methods. Especially we focus on effects of nonlocal correlation of disorder, for most of studies given so far considered $\delta$-function type white noise disorder. We obtain wave function of the "lowest-energy" state which dominates partition function in the limit of large system size. Density of states is calculated in the scaling region. The result shows that delocalization transition is stable against nonlocal short-ranged correlation of disorder. Especially states near the band center are enhanced by the correlation of disorder which partially suppresses random fluctuation of disorder. Physical picture of the localization and the delocalization transition is discussed.
