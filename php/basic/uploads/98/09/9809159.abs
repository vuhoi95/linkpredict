Title: Mapping Hawking into Unruh Thermal Properties
Authors: S. Deser and Orit Levin
Abstract: By globally embedding curved spaces into higher dimensional flat ones, we show that Hawking thermal properties map into their Unruh equivalents: The relevant curved space detectors become Rindler ones, whose temperature and entropy reproduce the originals. Specific illustrations include Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild-(anti)deSitter, Reissner-Nordstrom and BTZ spaces.
