Title: Conservation Laws in a First Order Dynamical System of Vortices
Authors: N. S. Manton and S. M. Nasir
Abstract: Gauge invariant conservation laws for the linear and angular momenta are studied in a certain 2+1 dimensional first order dynamical model of vortices in superconductivity. In analogy with fluid vortices it is possible to express the linear and angular momenta as low moments of vorticity. The conservation laws are compared with those obtained in the moduli space approximation for vortex dynamics.
