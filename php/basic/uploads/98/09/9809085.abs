Abstract: We introduce a new class of duality symmetries amongst quantum field theories. The new class is based upon global spacetime symmetries, such as Poincare invariance and supersymmetry, in the same way as the existing duality transformations are based on global internal symmetries. We illustrate these new duality transformations by dualizing several scalar and spin-half theories in 1+1 spacetime dimensions, involving nonsupersymmetric as well as (1,1) and (2,2) supersymmetric models. For (2,2) models the new duality transformations can interchange chiral and twisted-chiral multiplets.
