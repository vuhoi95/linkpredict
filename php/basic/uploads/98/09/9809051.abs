Title: Twisted Classical Phase Space
Authors: Piotr Czerhoniak and Anatol Nowicki
Abstract: We consider relativistic phase space constructed by the twist procedure from the translation sector of the standard, nondeforned Poincare algebra. Using the concept of cross product algebra we derive two kinds of phase space with noncommuting configuration space. The generalized uncertainty relations are formulated.
