Title: The classical and Quantum Analysis of a Charged Particle on the  Spacetime Produced by a Global Monopole
Authors: A. A. Rodrigues Sobreira and E. R. Bezerra de Mello
Abstract: We study the classical and quantum motion of a relativistic charged particle on the spacetime produced by a global monopole. The self-potential, which is present in this spacetime, is considered as an external electrostatic potential. We obtain classical orbits and quantum states for a spin-1/2 and spin-0 particles.
