Title: Supersymmetry of Rotating Branes
Authors: Jerome P. Gauntlett and Robert C. Myers and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: We present a new 1/8 supersymmetric intersecting M-brane solution of D=11 supergravity with two independent rotation parameters. The metric has a non-singular event horizon and the near-horizon geometry is $adS_3\times S^3\times S^3\times\bE^2$ (just as in the non-rotating case). We also present a method of determining the isometry supergroup of supergravity solutions from the Killing spinors and use it to show that for the near horizon solution it is $D(2|1,\alpha)\times D(2|1,\alpha)$ where $\alpha$ is the ratio of the two 3-sphere radii. We also consider various dimensional reductions of our solution, and the corresponding effect of these reductions on the Killing spinors and the isometry supergroups.
