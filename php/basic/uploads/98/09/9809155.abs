Title: Vacuum Radiation in Conformally Invariant Quantum Field Theory
Authors: V. Aldaya and M. Calixto and J. M. Cervero
Abstract: Although the whole conformal group $SO(4,2)$ can be considered as a symmetry in a classical massless field theory, the subgroup of special conformal transformations (SCT), usually related to transitions to uniformly accelerated frames, causes vacuum radiation in the corresponding quantum field theory, in analogy to the Fulling-Unruh effect. The spectrum of the outgoing particles can be calculated exactly and proves to be a generalization of the Planckian one.
