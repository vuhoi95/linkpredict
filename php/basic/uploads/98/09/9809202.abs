Title: Gravitational corrections to N=2 supersymmetric lagrangians
Authors: Sergio Cacciatori and Daniela Zanon
Abstract: In the framework of special Kahler geometry we consider the supergravity-matter system which emerges on a K3-fibered Calabi-Yau manifold. By applying the rigid limit procedure in the vicinity of a conifold singularity we compute the Kahler potential of the scalars and the kinetic matrix of the vectors to first order in the gravitational coupling.
