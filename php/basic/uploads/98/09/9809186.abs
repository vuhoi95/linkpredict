Title: On the relation of the gravitino mass and the GUT parameters
Authors: V. I. Tkach and J. J. Rosales and J. Torres
Abstract: In this article we consider the local supersymmetry breaking and the broken SU(5) symmetry permisible by dilaton vacuum configuration in supergravity theories. We establish the parameter relation of spontaneuos breaking of supersymmetry and of the GUT theory.
