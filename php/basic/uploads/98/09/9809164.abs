Title: The GS String Action on AdS(3)xS(3) with Ramond-Ramond Charge
Authors: J. Rahmfeld and A. Rajaraman
Abstract: We derive the classical kappa-symmetric Type IIB string action on AdS(3) x S(3) by employing the SU(1,1|2)^2 algebra. We then gauge fix kappa-symmetry in the background adapted Killing spinor gauge and present the action in a very simple form.
