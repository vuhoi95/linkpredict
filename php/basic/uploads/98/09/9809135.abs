Title: On the Interacting Chiral Gauge Field Theory in D=6 and the Off-Shell  Equivalence of Dual Born-Infeld-Like Actions
Authors: A. De Castro and A. Restuccia
Abstract: A canonical action describing the interaction of chiral gauge fields in D=6 Minkowski space-time is constructed. In a particular partial gauge fixing it reduces to the action found by Perry and Schwarz. The additional gauge symmetries are used to show the off-shell equivalence of the dimensional reduction to D=5 Minkowski space-time of the chiral gauge field canonical action and the Born-Infeld canonical action describing an interacting D=5 Abelian vector field. Its extension to improve the on-shell equivalence arguments of dual D-brane actions to off-shell ones is discussed.
