Title: On the Classification of Bulk and Boundary Conformal Field Theories
Authors: R. Behrend and P. Pearce and V. Petkova and J. -B. Zuber
Abstract: The classification of rational conformal field theories is reconsidered from the standpoint of boundary conditions. Solving Cardy's equation expressing the consistency condition on a cylinder is equivalent to finding integer valued representations of the fusion algebra. A complete solution not only yields the admissible boundary conditions but also gives valuable information on the bulk properties.
