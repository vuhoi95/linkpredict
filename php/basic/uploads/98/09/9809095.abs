Title: Matrix string states in pure 2d Yang Mills theories
Authors: M. Billo' and M. Caselle and A. D'Adda and P. Provero
Abstract: We quantize pure 2d Yang-Mills theory on a torus in the gauge where the field strength is diagonal. Because of the topological obstructions to a global smooth diagonalization, we find string-like states in the spectrum similar to the ones introduced by various authors in Matrix string theory. We write explicitly the partition function, which generalizes the one already known in the literature, and we discuss the role of these states in preserving modular invariance. Some speculations are presented about the interpretation of 2d Yang-Mills theory as a Matrix string theory.
