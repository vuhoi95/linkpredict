Title: String representation of SU(3) gluodynamics in the abelian projection
Authors: M. N. Chernodub and D. A. Komarov
Abstract: A dual Ginzburg-Landau model corresponding to SU(3) gluodynamics in abelian projection is studied. A string theory describing QCD string dynamics is obtained in this model. The interaction of static quarks in mesons and baryons is investigated in an approximation to leading order.
