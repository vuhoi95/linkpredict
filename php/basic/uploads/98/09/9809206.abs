Title: Zeta functions, renormalization group equations, and the effective  action
Authors: David Hochberg and Carmen Molina-Paris and Juan Perez-Mercader and Matt Visser
Abstract: We demonstrate how to extract all the one-loop renormalization group equations for arbitrary quantum field theories from knowledge of an appropriate Seeley--DeWitt coefficient. By formally solving the renormalization group equations to one loop, we renormalization group improve the classical action, and use this to derive the leading-logarithms in the one-loop effective action for arbitrary quantum field theories.
