Title: Dualities between Poisson brackets and antibrackets
Authors: Igor Batalin and Robert Marnelius
Abstract: Recently it has been shown that antibrackets may be expressed in terms of Poisson brackets and vice versa for commuting functions in the original bracket. Here we also introduce generalized brackets involving higher antibrackets or higher Poisson brackets where the latter are of a new type. We give generating functions for these brackets for functions in arbitrary involutions in the original bracket. We also give master equations for generalized Maurer-Cartan equations. The presentation is completely symmetric with respect to Poisson brackets and antibrackets.
