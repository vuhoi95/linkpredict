Title: Coherent-state path-integral approach for constrained fermion systems
Authors: Georg Junker and John R. Klauder
Abstract: The coherent-state path-integral representation for the propagator of fermionic systems subjected to first-class constraints is constructed. As in the bosonic case the importance of path-integral measures for Lagrange multipliers is emphasized. One example is discussed in some detail.
