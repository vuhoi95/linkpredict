Title: Nonlinear $Ïƒ$-model, form factors and universality
Authors: Adrian Patrascioiu and Erhard Seiler
Abstract: We report the results of a very high statistics Monte Carlo study of the continuum limit of the two dimensional O(3) non-linear $\sigma$ model. We find a significant discrepancy between the continuum extrapolation of our data and the form factor prediction of Balog and Niedermaier, inspired by the Zamolodchikovs' S-matrix ansatz. On the other hand our results for the O(3) and the dodecahedron model are consistent with our earlier finding that the two models possess the same continuum limit.
