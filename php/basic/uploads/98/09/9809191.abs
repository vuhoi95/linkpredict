Title: The relativistic particle with curvature and torsion of world trajectory
Authors: S. A. Gogilidze and Yu. S. Surovtsev
Abstract: Local symmetries of the action for a relativistic particle with curvature and torsion of its world curve in the (2+1)-dimensional space-time are studied. With the help of the method, worked out recently by the authors (Phys.Rev., D56, 1135, 1142 (1997)), first the local-symmetry transformations are obtained both in the phase and configuration space. At the classical level, the dependence of the particle mass on the parameters of curvature and torsion and the Regge trajectory are obtained. It is shown that the tachyonic sector can be removed by a proper gauge choice.
