Title: String Islands
Authors: Atish Dabholkar and Jeffrey A. Harvey
Abstract: We discuss string theories with small numbers of non-compact moduli and describe constructions of string theories whose low-energy limit is described by various pure supergravity theories. We also construct a D=4,N=4 compactification of type II string theory with 34 vector fields.
