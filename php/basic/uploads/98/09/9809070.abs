Title: D=11 SUGRA as the Low Energy Effective Action of Matrix Theory: Three  Form Scattering
Authors: Jan Plefka and Marco Serone and Andrew Waldron
Abstract: We employ the LSZ reduction formula for Matrix Theory introduced in our earlier work to compute the t-pole S-matrix for three form-three form scattering. The result agrees completely with tree level D=11 SUGRA. Taken together with previous results on graviton-graviton scattering this shows that Matrix Theory indeed reproduces the bosonic sector of the D=11 SUGRA action including the Chern-Simons term. Furthermore we provide a detailed account of our framework along with the technology to compute any Matrix Theory one-loop t-pole scattering amplitude at vanishing p^- exchange.
