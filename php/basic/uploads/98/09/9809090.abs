Title: Geometrical Superconformal Anomalies
Authors: Johanna Erdmenger and Christian Rupp
Abstract: We determine the structure of geometrical superconformal anomalies for N=1 supersymmetric quantum field theories on curved superspace to all orders in h bar. For the massless Wess-Zumino model we show how these anomalies contribute to the local Callan-Symanzik equation which expresses the breakdown of superconformal symmetry in terms of the usual beta and gamma functions.
