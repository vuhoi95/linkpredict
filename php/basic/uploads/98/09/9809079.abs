Title: Quantum gravity correction, evolution of scalar field and inflation
Authors: J. Acacio de Barros and N. Pinto-Neto and I. L. Shapiro
Abstract: We take the first nontrivial coefficient of the Schwinger-DeWitt expansion as a leading correction to the action of the second-derivative metric-dilaton gravity. To fix the ambiguities related with an arbitrary choice of the gauge fixing condition and the parametrization for the quantum field, one has to use the classical equations of motion. As a result, the only corrections are the ones to the potential of the scalar field. It turns out that the parameters of the initial classical action may be chosen in such a way that the potential satisfies most of the conditions for successful inflation.
