Abstract: Anti-self-dual (ASD) Maxwell solutions on 4-dimensional hyperk\"ahler manifolds are constructed. The N=2 supersymmetric half-flat equations are derived in the context of the Ashtekar formulation of N=2 supergravity. These equations show that the ASD Maxwell solutions have a direct connection with the solutions of the reduced N=2 supersymmetric ASD Yang-Mills equations with a special choice of gauge group. Two examples of the Maxwell solutions are presented.
