Title: The D(2,1;Î±) Particle
Authors: S P Corney and P D Jarvis and D S McAnally
Abstract: The exceptional superalgebra $D(2,1;\alpha)$ has been classified as a candidate conformal supersymmetry algebra in two dimensions. We propose an alternative interpretation of it as extended BFV-BRST quantisation superalgebras in 2D ($D(2,1;1) \simeq osp(2,2|2)$). A superfield realization is presented wherein the standard extended phase space coordinates can be identified. The physical states are studied via the cohomology of the BRST operator. It is conjectured that the underlying model giving rise to this `quantisation' is that of a scalar relativistic particle in 1+1 dimensions, for which the light cone coordinates $x_R$, $x_L$ transform under worldline diffeomorphisms as scalar densities of appropriate weight.
