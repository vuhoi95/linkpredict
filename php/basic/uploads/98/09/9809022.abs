Title: UV/IR Relations in AdS Dynamics
Authors: Amanda W. Peet and Joseph Polchinski
Abstract: We point out that two distinct distance--energy relations have been discussed in the AdS/CFT correspondence. In conformal backgrounds they differ only in normalization, but in nonconformal backgrounds they differ in functional form. We discuss the relation to probe processes, the holographic principle, and black hole entropies.
