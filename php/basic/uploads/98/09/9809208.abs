Title: Quantum Sp(2)-antibrackets and open groups
Authors: Igor Batalin and Robert Marnelius
Abstract: The recently presented quantum antibrackets are generalized to quantum Sp(2)-antibrackets. For the class of commuting operators there are true quantum versions of the classical Sp(2)-antibrackets. For arbitrary operators we have a generalized bracket structure involving higher Sp(2)-antibrackets. It is shown that these quantum antibrackets may be obtained from generating operators involving operators in arbitrary involutions. A recently presented quantum master equation for operators, which was proposed to encode generalized quantum Maurer-Cartan equations for arbitrary open groups, is generalized to the Sp(2) formalism. In these new quantum master equations the generalized Sp(2)-brackets appear naturally.
