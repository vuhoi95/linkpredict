Title: Non-analyticity of the Callan-Symanzik beta-function of O(N) models
Authors: A. Pelissetto and E. Vicari
Abstract: In the framework of the 1/N-expansion we show that the Callan-Symanzik beta- function associated with the four-point coupling g is non-analytic at its zero, i.e. at the fixed-point value g^* of g. This behavior can be interpreted by renormalization group arguments, and written in terms of scaling correction exponents. We obtain accurate determinations of g^* in 3-d and 2-d by exploiting two alternative approaches: the (4-d)-expansion and the high-temperature expansion. These results are compared with the available estimates by other approaches, such as the fixed-dimension perturbative expansion, Monte Carlo simulations, etc... We also present results for the n-point renormalized coupling constants that parameterize the behavior of the effective potential in the high- and low- temperature phases.
