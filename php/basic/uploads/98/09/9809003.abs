Title: Modular Theory and Geometry
Authors: B. Schroer and H. -W. Wiesbock
Abstract: In this letter we present some new results on modular theory and its application in quantum field theory. In doing this we develop some new proposals how to generalize concepts of geometrical action. Therefore the spirit of this letter is more on a programmatic side with many details remaining to be elaborated.
