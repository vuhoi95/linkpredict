Abstract: SU(2) gluodynamics is investigated numerically and analytically in the (Indirect) Maximal Center gauge at finite temperature. The center vortices are shown to be condensed in the confinement phase and dilute in the deconfinement phase. A new physical object, center monopole, is constructed. We show that the center monopole condensate is the order parameter of deconfinement phase transition. The linking of the vortex worldsheets and quark trajectories is identified with the Aharonov-Bohm interaction in an effective Abelian Higgs theory. We conclude that the confinement in the Maximal Center gauge can be explained by a new mechanism called "the real superconductor mechanism".
