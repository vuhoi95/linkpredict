Abstract: We develop the formalism to study the hyperon-nucleon interaction potential within the bound state approach to the SU(3) Skyrme model. The general framework is illustrated by applying it to the diagonal $\Lambda N$ potential. The central, spin-spin and tensor components of this interaction are obtained and compared with those derived using alternative schemes.
