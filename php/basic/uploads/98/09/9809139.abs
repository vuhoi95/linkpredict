Title: Supermultiplets of AdS Black Holes in 2+1 Dimensions
Authors: Sharmanthie Fernando and Freydoon Mansouri
Abstract: We construct super AdS black holes in 2+1 dimensions in terms of Chern Simons gauge theory of N=(1,1) super AdS group coupled to a (super)source. We take the source to be a super AdS state specified by its Casimir invariants. We show that the corresponding space-time is a supermultiplet of AdS space-times related to each other by supersymmetry transformations. We give explicit expressions for the masses and the angular momenta of the black holes in a supermultiplet. With one exception, for N=(1,1) one pair of extremal black holes can be accommodated in such all-black hole supermultiplets. The requirement that the source be a unitary representation leads to a discrete tower of excited states which provide a microscopic model for the super black hole.
