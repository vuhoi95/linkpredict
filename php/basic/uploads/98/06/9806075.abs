Title: String Representation of Wilson Loops
Authors: E. Alvarez and C. Gomez and T. Ortin
Abstract: We explore the consequences of imposing Polyakov's zig/zag-invariance in the search for a confining string. We first find that the requirement of zig/zag-invariance seems to be incompatible with spacetime supersymmetry. We then try to find zig/zag-invariant string backgrounds on which to implement the minimal-area prescription for the calculation of Wilson loops considering different possibilities.
