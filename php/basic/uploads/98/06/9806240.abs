Title: Short-Distance Space-Time Structure and Black Holes in String Theory : A  Short Review of the Present Status
Authors: Miao Li and Tamiaki Yoneya
Abstract: We briefly review the present status of string theory from the viewpoint of its implications on the short-distance space-time structure and black hole physics. Special emphases are given on two closely related issues in recent developments towards nonperturbative string theory, namely, the role of the space-time uncertainty relation as a qualitative but universal characterization of the short-distance structure of string theory and the microscopic formulation of black-hole entropies. We will also suggest that the space-time uncertainty relation can be an underlying principle for the holographic property of M theory, by showing that the space-time uncertainty relation naturally explains the UV/IR relation used in a recent derivation of the holographic bound for D3 brane by Susskind and Witten.
