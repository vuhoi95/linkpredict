Title: Quantum (in)stability of 2D charged dilaton black holes and 3D rotating  black holes
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: The quantum properties of charged black holes (BHs) in 2D dilaton-Maxwell gravity (spontaneously compactified from heterotic string) with $N$ dilaton coupled scalars are studied. We first investigate 2D BHs found by McGuigan, Nappi and Yost. Kaluza-Klein reduction of 3D gravity with minimal scalars leads also to 2D dilaton-Maxwell gravity with dilaton coupled scalars and the rotating BH solution found by Ba\~nados, Teitelboim and Zanelli (BTZ) which can be also described by 2D charged dilatonic BH. Evaluating the one-loop effective action for dilaton coupled scalars in large $N$ (and s-wave approximation for BTZ case), we show that quantum-corrected BHs may evaporate or else anti-evaporate similarly to 4D Nariai BH as is observed by Bousso and Hawking. Higher modes may cause the disintegration of BH in accordance with recent observation by Bousso.
