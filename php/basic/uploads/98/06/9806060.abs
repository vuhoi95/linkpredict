Title: Generating new supergravity solutions using Ehlers-Harrison-type  transformations
Authors: H. Gustafsson and P. Haggi-Mani
Abstract: The technique of generating new solutions to 4D gravity/matter systems by dimensional reduction to a sigma-model is extended to supersymmetric configurations of supergravity. The conditions required for the preservation of supersymmetry under isometry transformations in the sigma-model target space are found. Some examples illustrating the technique are given.
