Title: Geometrical features of (4+d) gravity
Authors: A. G. Agnese and M. La Camera
Abstract: We obtain the vacuum spherical symmetric solutions for the gravitational sector of a (4+d)-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory. In the various regions of parameter space, the solutions can describe either naked singularities or black-holes or wormholes. We also derive, by performing a conformal rescaling, the corresponding picture in the four-dimensional space-time.
