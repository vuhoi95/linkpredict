Title: On time-dependent quasi-exactly solvable models
Authors: Dieter Mayer and Alexander Ushveridze and Zbigniew Walczak
Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate that there exists a close relationship between quasi-exactly solvable quantum models and two special classes of classical dynamical systems. One of these systems can be considered a natural generalization of the multi-particle Calogero-Moser model and the second one is a classical matrix model.
