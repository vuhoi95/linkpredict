Title: Remarks on self-dual formulation of Born-Infeld-Chern-Simons theory
Authors: Won Tae Kim and Hyeonjoon Shin and Myung Seok Yoon
Abstract: We study the self-duality of Born-Infeld-Chern-Simons theory which can be interpreted as a massive D2 brane in IIA string theory and exhibit the self-dual formulation in terms of the gauge invariant master Lagrangian. The proposed master Lagrangian contains the nonlocal auxiliary field and approaches self-dual formulation of Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory in a point-particle limit with the weak string-coupling limit. The consistent canonical brackets of dual system are derived.
