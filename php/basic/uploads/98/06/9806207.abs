Authors: I. A. Batalin and S. L. Lyakhovich and I. V. Tyutin
Abstract: Existence theorem is proven for the generating equations of the split involution constraint algebra. The structure of the general solution is established, and the characteristic arbitrariness in generating functions is described.
