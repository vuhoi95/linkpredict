Authors: Youngjai Kiem and Chang-Yeong Lee and Dahl Park
Abstract: We study the doubly charged Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger (CGHS) model, which has black hole solutions that were found to be U-dual to the D1-D5-KK black holes of the IIB supergravity. We derive the action of the model via a spontaneous compactification on S^3 of the IIB supergravity on S^1*T^4 and obtain the general static solutions including black holes corresponding to certain non-asymptotically flat black holes in the IIB supergravity. Thermodynamics of them is established by computing the entropy, temperature, chemical potentials, and mass in the two-dimensional setup, and the first law of thermodynamics is explicitly verified. The entropy is in precise agreement with that of the D1-D5-KK black holes, and the mass turns out to be consistent with the infinite Lorentz boost along the M theory circle that is a part of the aforementioned U-dual chain.
