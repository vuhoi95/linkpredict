Title: String Representation of Field Correlators in the Dual Abelian Higgs  Model
Authors: Dmitri Antonov and Dietmar Ebert
Abstract: By making use of the path integral duality transformation, we derive the string representation for the partition function of an extended Dual Abelian Higgs Model containing gauge fields of external currents of electrically charged particles. By the same method, we obtain the corresponding representations for the generating functionals of gauge field and monopole current correlators. In the case of bilocal correlators, the obtained results are found to be in agreement with the dual Meissner scenario of confinement and with the Stochastic Model of the QCD vacuum.
