Title: Open groups of constraints - Integrating arbitrary involutions
Authors: Igor Batalin and Robert Marnelius
Abstract: A new type of quantum master equation is presented which is expressed in terms of a recently introduced quantum antibracket. The equation involves only two operators: an extended nilpotent BFV-BRST charge and an extended ghost charge. It is proposed to determine the generalized quantum Maurer-Cartan equations for arbitrary open groups. These groups are the integration of constraints in arbitrary involutions. The only condition for this is that the constraint operators may be embedded in an odd nilpotent operator, the BFV-BRST charge. The proposal is verified at the quasigroup level. The integration formulas are also used to construct a generating operator for quantum antibrackets of operators in arbitrary involutions.
