Title: Variational principle and a perturbative solution of non-linear string  equations in curved space
Authors: S. N. Roshchupkin and A. A. Zheltukhin
Abstract: String dynamics in a curved space-time is studied on the basis of an action functional including a small parameter of rescaled tension $\epsilon=\gamma/\alpha^{\prime}$, where $\gamma$ is a metric parametrizing constant. A rescaled slow worldsheet time $T=\epsilon\tau$ is introduced, and general covariant non-linear string equation are derived. It is shown that in the first order of an $\epsilon $-expansion these equations are reduced to the known equation for geodesic derivation but complemented by a string oscillatory term. These equations are solved for the de Sitter and Friedmann -Robertson-Walker spaces. The primary string constraints are found to be split into a chain of perturbative constraints and their conservation and consistency are proved. It is established that in the proposed realization of the perturbative approach the string dynamics in the de Sitter space is stable for a large Hubble constant $H (\alpha^{\prime}H^{2}\gg1)$.
