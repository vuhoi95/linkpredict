Title: Charging Symmetries and Linearizing Potentials for Einstein-Maxwell  Dilaton-Axion Theory
Authors: Alfredo Herrera-Aguilar and Oleg Kechkin
Abstract: We derive a set of complex potentials which linearize the action of charging symmetries of the stationary Einstein-Maxwell dilaton-axion theory.
