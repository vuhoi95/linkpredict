Title: The central charge in three dimensional anti-de Sitter space
Authors: M. Banados and M. Ortiz
Abstract: This paper collects the various ways of computing the central charge $c=3l/2G$ arising in 3d asymptotically anti-de Sitter spaces, in the Chern-Simons formulation. Their similarities and differences are displayed.
