Title: The Heterotic String, the Tangent Bundle, and Derived Categories
Authors: Paul S. Aspinwall and Ron Y. Donagi
Abstract: We consider the compactification of the E8xE8 heterotic string on a K3 surface with "the spin connection embedded in the gauge group" and the dual picture in the type IIA string (or F-theory) on a Calabi-Yau threefold X. It turns out that the same X arises also as dual to a heterotic compactification on 24 point-like instantons. X is necessarily singular, and we see that this singularity allows the Ramond-Ramond moduli on X to split into distinct components, one containing the (dual of the heterotic) tangent bundle, while another component contains the point-like instantons. As a practical application we derive the result that a heterotic string compactified on the tangent bundle of a K3 with ADE singularities acquires nonperturbatively enhanced gauge symmetry in just the same fashion as a type IIA string on a singular K3 surface. On a more philosophical level we discuss how it appears to be natural to say that the heterotic string is compactified using an object in the derived category of coherent sheaves. This is necessary to properly extend the notion of T-duality to the heterotic string on a K3 surface.
