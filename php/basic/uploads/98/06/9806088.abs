Title: Interaction Energies of Generalised Monopoles
Authors: B. Kleihaus and D. O'Keeffe and D. H. Tchrakian
Abstract: Generalisations of the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole which can exhibit repulsion only, attraction only, and both attraction and repulsion, between like monopoles, are studied numerically. The models supporting these solitons are SO(3) gauged Higgs models featuring Skyrme-like terms.
