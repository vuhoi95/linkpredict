Title: Casimir Energy of a Spherical Shell
Authors: M. E. Bowers and C. R. Hagen
Abstract: The Casimir energy for a conducting spherical shell of radius $a$ is computed using a direct mode summation approach. An essential ingredient is the implementation of a recently proposed method based on Cauchy's theorem for an evaluation of the eigenfrequencies of the system. It is shown, however, that this earlier calculation uses an improper set of modes to describe the waves exterior to the sphere. Upon making the necessary corrections and taking care to ensure that no mathematically ill-defined expressions occur, the technique is shown to leave numerical results unaltered while avoiding a longstanding criticism raised against earlier calculations of the Casimir energy.
