Title: Techniques for one-loop calculations in constrained differential  renormalization
Authors: F. del Aguila and A. Culatti and R. Munoz-Tapia and M. Perez-Victoria
Abstract: We describe in detail the constrained procedure of differential renormalization and develop the techniques required for one-loop calculations. As an illustration we renormalize Scalar QED and show that the two-, three- and four-point Ward identities are automatically satisfied.
