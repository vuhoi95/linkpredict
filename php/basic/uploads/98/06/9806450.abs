Title: Comment on ``Searching for Evolutions of Pure States into Mixed States  in the Two-State System K-K''
Authors: F. Benatti and R. Floreanini
Abstract: It has been recently proposed to study generic dynamical evolutions of the neutral kaon system that go beyond quantum mechanics. We explicitly show that, unless the condition of complete positivity is enforced, those dynamics are physically inconsistent and should be rejected.
