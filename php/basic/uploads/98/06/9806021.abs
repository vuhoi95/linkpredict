Title: Glueball Mass Spectrum From Supergravity
Authors: Csaba Csaki and Hirosi Ooguri and Yaron Oz and John Terning
Abstract: We calculate the spectrum of glueball masses in non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in three and four dimensions, based on a conjectured duality between supergravity and large N gauge theories. The glueball masses are obtained by solving supergravity wave equations in a black hole geometry. We find that the mass ratios are in good numerical agreement with the available lattice data. We also compute the leading (g_{YM}^2 N)^{-1} corrections to the glueball masses, by taking into account stringy corrections to the supergravity action and to the black hole metric. We find that the corrections to the masses are negative and of order (g_{YM}^2N)^{-3/2}. Thus for a fixed ultraviolet cutoff the masses decrease as we decrease the 't Hooft coupling, in accordance with our expectation about the continuum limit of the gauge theories.
