Title: Entanglement of Fock-space expansion and covariance in light-front  Hamiltonian dynamics

Abstract: We investigate in a model with scalar ``nucleons'' and mesons the contributions of higher Fock states that are neglected in the ladder approximation of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. This leads to a breaking of covariance, both in light-front and in instant-form Hamiltonian dynamics. The lowest Fock sector neglected has two mesons in the intermediate state and corresponds to the stretched box. First we show in a simplified example that the contributions of higher Fock states are much smaller on the light-front than in instant-form dynamics. Then we show for a scattering amplitude above threshold that the stretched boxes are small, however, necessary to retain covariance. For an off energy-shell amplitude covariance is not necessarily maintained and this is confirmed by our calculations. Again, the stretched boxes are found to be small.
