Title: Crumpled triangulations and critical points in 4D simplicial quantum  gravity
Authors: J. Ambjorn and M. Carfora and D. Gabrielli and A. Marzuoli
Abstract: This is an expanded and revised version of our geometrical analysis of the strong coupling phase of 4D simplicial quantum gravity. The main differences with respect to the former version is a full discussion of singular triangulations with singular vertices connected by a subsingular edge. In particular we provide analytical arguments which characterize the entropical properties of triangulations with a singular edge connecting two singular vertices. The analytical estimate of the location of the critical coupling at k_2\simeq 1.3093 is presented in more details. Finally we also provide a model for pseudo-criticality at finite N_4(S^4).
