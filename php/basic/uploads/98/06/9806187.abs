Title: A New Regularization Method in 3-Dimensional Momentum Space
Authors: Liang-gang Liu and Xiang-Qian Luo and Wei Chen
Abstract: We propose a new method to calculate the 4-dimensional divergent integrals. By calculating the one loop integral as an example, the regularization of the integrals in 3-dimension momentum space are given in details. We find that the new method gives the same results as the traditional dimensional regularization method gives, but the new method has the advantage that it gives the real and the imaginary part separately.
