Title: A relativistically covariant stochastic model for systems with a  fluctuating number of particles
Authors: L. M. Morato and L. Viola
Abstract: We construct a relativistically covariant stochastic model for systems of non-interacting spinless particles whose number undergoes random fluctuations. The model is compared with the canonical quantization of the free scalar field in the limit of infinite volume.
