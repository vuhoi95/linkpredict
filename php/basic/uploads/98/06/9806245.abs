Title: Evaporation of Schwarzschild Black Hole in the Large N Matrix Theory
Authors: Yi-hong Gao and Wei Zhang
Abstract: By using the D0-brane cluster picture, we consider the Hawking radiation of Schwarszchild black hole (SBH) in large N Matrix model. We get the correct formula for the the Hawing evaporation rate. Our results give some evidence on the Lorentz invariance of the physics of Matrix model.
