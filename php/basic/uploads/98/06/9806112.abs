Title: Pointlike structure for super p-branes
Authors: Hyun Seok Yang and Inbo Kim and Bum-Hoon Lee
Abstract: We present an efficient method to understand the p-brane dynamics in a unified framework. For this purpose, we reformulate the action for super p-branes in the form appropriate to incorporate the pointlike (parton) structure of higher dimensional p-branes and intend to interpret the p-brane dynamics as the collective dynamics of superparticles. In order to examine such a parton picture of super p-branes, we consider various superparticle configurations that can be reduced from super p-branes, especially, a supermembrane, and study the partonic structure of classical p-brane solutions.
