Title: The Matrix Theory S-Matrix
Authors: Jan C. Plefka and Marco Serone and Andrew K. Waldron
Abstract: The technology required for eikonal scattering amplitude calculations in Matrix theory is developed. Using the entire supersymmetric completion of the v^4/r^7 Matrix theory potential we compute the graviton-graviton scattering amplitude and find agreement with eleven dimensional supergravity at tree level.
