Title: Dark Matter Axions in Models of String Cosmology
Authors: Ram Brustein and Merav Hadad
Abstract: Axions are produced during a period of dilaton-driven inflation by amplification of quantum fluctuations. We show that for some range of string cosmology parameters and some range of axion masses, primordial axions may constitute a large fraction of the present energy density in the universe in the form of cold dark matter. Due to the periodic nature of the axion potential energy density fluctuations are strongly suppressed. The spectrum of primordial axions is not thermal, allowing a small fraction of the axions to remain relativistic until quite late.
