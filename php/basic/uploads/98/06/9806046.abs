Title: Complete set of electromagnetic corrections to strongly interacting  systems
Authors: A. N. Kvinikhidze and B. Blankleider
Abstract: We show how to obtain a complete set of electromagnetic corrections to a given nonperturbative model of strong interactions based on integral equations. The gauge invariance of these corrections is a consequence of their completeness.
