Title: Twisted N=4 SUSY Algebra in Topological Models of Schwarz Type
Authors: O. M. Del Cima and K. Landsteiner and M. Schweda
Abstract: We reinvestigate the twisted N=4 supersymmetry present in Schwarz type topological field models. We show that Chern-Simons theory in three dimensions can be untwisted to a kind of sigma-model with reversed statistics only in the free case. By dimensional reduction we define then the two-dimensional BF-model. We establish an analog result concerning the untwisting. As a consequence of the definition through dimensional reduction we find new fermionic scalar symmetries that have been overlooked so far in the literature.
