Title: Anomaly-Free Tensor-Yang-Mills System and Its Dual Formulation
Authors: P. S. Howe and E. Sezgin
Abstract: We consider the (1,0) supersymmetric Yang-Mills multiplet coupled to a self-dual tensor multiplet in six dimensions. It is shown that the counterterm required to cancel the one-loop gauge anomaly modifies the classical equations of motion previously obtained by Bergshoeff, Sezgin and Sokatchev (BSS). We discuss the supermultiplet structure of the anomalies exhibited in the resulting equations of motion. The anomaly corrected field equations agree with the global limit, recently obtained by Duff, Liu, Lu and Pope, of a matter coupled supergravity theory in six dimensions. We also obtain the dual formulation of the BSS model in which the tensor multiplet is free while the field equations of the Yang-Mills multiplet contain the fields of the tensor multiplet at the classical level.
