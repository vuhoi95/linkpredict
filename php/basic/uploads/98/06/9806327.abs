Title: Constraints on pre-big bang models for seeding large-scale anisotropy by  massive Kalb-Ramond axions
Authors: M. Gasperini and G. Veneziano
Abstract: We discuss the conditions under which pre-big bang models can fit the observed large-scale anisotropy with a primordial spectrum of massive (Kalb--Ramond) axion fluctuations. The primordial spectrum must be sufficiently flat at low frequency and sufficiently steeper at high frequency. For a steep and/or long enough high-frequency branch of the spectrum the bounds imposed by COBE's normalization allow axion masses of the typical order for a Peccei--Quinn--Weinberg--Wilczek axion. We provide a particular example in which an appropriate axion spectrum is obtained from a class of backgrounds satisfying the low-energy string cosmology equations.
