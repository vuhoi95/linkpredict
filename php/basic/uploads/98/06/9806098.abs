Title: Non-Abelian Stokes Theorem for Loop Variables Associated with Nontrivial  Loops
Authors: M. Hirayama and M. Kanno and M. Ueno and H. Yamakoshi
Abstract: The non-Abelian Stokes theorem for loop variables associated with nontrivial loops (knots and links) is derived. It is shown that a loop variable is in general different from unity even if the field strength vanishes everywhere on the surface surrounded by the loop.
