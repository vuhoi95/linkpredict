Title: Asymptotics of Elliptic Genera of Symmetric Products and Dyonic Black  Hole Degeneracy
Authors: A. A. Bytsenko and A. E. Goncalves and S. D. Odintsov
Abstract: We calculate asymptotic expansions of elliptic genera for a supersymmetric sigma model on the N - fold symmetric product S^NM of a Kahler manifold M and for N = 2 superconformal field theory. Asymptotic expansions for the degeneracy of dyonic black hole spectrum are also derived.
