Title: The fermionic contribution to the spectrum of the area operator in  nonperturbative quantum gravity
Authors: Merced Montesinos and Carlo Rovelli
Abstract: The role of fermionic matter in the spectrum of the area operator is analyzed using the Baez--Krasnov framework for quantum fermions and gravity. The result is that the fermionic contribution to the area of a surface $S$ is equivalent to the contribution of purely gravitational spin network's edges tangent to $S$. Therefore, the spectrum of the area operator is the same as in the pure gravity case.
