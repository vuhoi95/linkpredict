Title: The Large N Limit of ${\cal N} =2,1 $ Field Theories from Threebranes in  F-theory
Authors: Ofer Aharony and Ansar Fayyazuddin and Juan Maldacena
Abstract: We consider field theories arising from a large number of D3-branes near singularities in F-theory. We study the theories at various conformal points, and compute, using their conjectured string theory duals, their large $N$ spectrum of chiral primary operators. This includes, as expected, operators of fractional conformal dimensions for the theory at Argyres-Douglas points. Additional operators, which are charged under the (sometimes exceptional) global symmetries of these theories, come from the 7-branes. In the case of a $D_4$ singularity we compare our results with field theory and find agreement for large $N$. Finally, we consider deformations away from the conformal points, which involve finding new supergravity solutions for the geometry produced by the 3-branes in the 7-brane background. We also discuss 3-branes in a general background.
