Title: Tachyons and Black Hole Horizons in Gauge Theory
Authors: Daniel Kabat and Gilad Lifschytz
Abstract: Any probe which crosses the horizon of a black hole should be absorbed. In M(atrix) theory, for 0-brane probes of Schwarzschild black holes, we argue that the relevant absorption mechanism is a tachyon instability which sets in at the horizon. We give qualitative arguments, and some quantitative large-N calculations, in support of this claim. The tachyon instability provides an attractive mechanism for infalling matter to be captured and thermalized by a Schwarzschild black hole.
