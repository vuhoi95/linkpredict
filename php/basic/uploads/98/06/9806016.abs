Title: Phase space geometry for constrained Lagrangian systems
Authors: Vladimir Pavlov and Andrei Starinets
Abstract: We study geometry of the phase space for finite-dimensional dynamical systems with degenerate Lagrangians. The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian constraint formalisms are treated as different local-coordinate pictures of the same invariant procedure. The invariant description is given in terms of geometrical objects associated with the structure of foliation on the phase space.
