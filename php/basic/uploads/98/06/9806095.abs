Title: Jack polynomials with prescribed symmetry and hole propagator of spin  Calogero-Sutherland model
Authors: Yusuke Kato and Takashi Yamamoto
Abstract: We study the hole propagator of the Calogero-Sutherland model with SU(2) internal symmetry. We obtain the exact expression for arbitrary non-negative integer coupling parameter $\beta$ and prove the conjecture proposed by one of the authors. Our method is based on the theory of the Jack polynomials with a prescribed symmetry.
