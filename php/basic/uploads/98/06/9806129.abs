Title: Consistent and covariant anomalies in six-dimensional supergravity
Authors: Fabio Riccioni and Augusto Sagnotti
Abstract: In this note we clarify some issues in six-dimensional (1,0) supergravity coupled to vector and tensor multiplets. In particular, we show that, while the low-energy equations embody tensor-vector couplings that contribute only to gauge anomalies, the divergence of the energy-momentum tensor is properly non-vanishing. In addition, we show how to revert to a supersymmetric formulation in terms of covariant non-integrable field equations that embody corresponding covariant anomalies.
