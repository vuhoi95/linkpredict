Title: Pfaffian Solutions for the Manin-Radul-Mathieu SUSY KdV and SUSY  sine-Gordon Equations
Authors: Q. P. Liu and Manuel Manas
Abstract: We reduce the vectorial binary Darboux transformation for the Manin-Radul supersymmetric KdV system in such a way that it preserves the Manin-Radul-Mathieu supersymmetric KdV equation reduction. Expressions in terms of bosonic Pfaffians are provided for transformed solutions and wave functions. We also consider the implications of these results for the supersymmetric sine-Gordon equation.
