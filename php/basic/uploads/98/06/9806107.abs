Title: Superconformal Field Theory with Boundary:Spin Model
Authors: S. A. Apikyan and D. A. Sahakyan
Abstract: GSO projected Superconformal field theory (Spin Model) with boundary is considered. There were written the boundary states. For this model were derived one-point structure constants and "bootstrap" equations for boundary-bulk structure constants.
