Title: On Schwarzschild Black Hole in Large N Matrix theory
Authors: Yi-hong Gao and Wei Zhang
Abstract: D0-brane gas picture of Schwarzschild black hole (SBH) is considered in the large N regime of Matrix theory. An entropy formula, which reproduces the thermodynamics of SBH in the large N limit for all dimensions ($D\geq 6$), is proposed. The equations of states for low temperature are obtained. We also give a proof of the Newton gravitation law between two SBHs, whose masses are not equal. Our result in some extent supports that the physics of Matrix theory is Lorentz invariant.
