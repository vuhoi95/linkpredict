Title: The Coherence of Primordial Fluctuations Produced During Inflation
Authors: Claus Kiefer and Julien Lesgourgues and David Polarski and Alexei A. Starobinsky
Abstract: The behaviour of quantum metric perturbations produced during inflation is considered at the stage after the second Hubble radius crossing. It is shown that the classical correlation between amplitude and momentum of a perturbation mode, previously shown to emerge in the course of an effective quantum-to-classical transition, is maintained for a sufficiently long time, and we present the explicit form in which it takes place using the Wigner function. We further show with a simple diffraction experiment that quantum interference, non-expressible in terms of a classical stochastic description of the perturbations, is essentially suppressed. Rescattering of the perturbations leads to a comparatively slow decay of this correlation and to a complete stochastization of the system.
