Title: Monopole Constituents inside SU(n) Calorons
Authors: Thomas C. Kraan and Pierre van Baal
Abstract: We present a simple result for the action density of the SU(n) charge one periodic instantons - or calorons - with arbitrary non-trivial Polyakov loop P_oo at spatial infinity. It is shown explicitly that there are n lumps inside the caloron, each of which represents a BPS monopole, their masses being related to the eigenvalues of P_oo. A suitable combination of the ADHM construction and the Nahm transformation is used to obtain this result.
