Title: Potential analysis and absorption cross section in the D1-D5 brane  system
Authors: H. W. Lee and Y. S. Myung
Abstract: We analyze the potentials which arise from the D1--D5 brane (5D black hole). In the sufficiently low energy ($\omega \ll 1$), we can derive the Schrodinger-type equation with potential $V_N$ from the linearized equations. In this case one can understand the difference between absorption cross section for a free and two fixed scalars intuitively in terms of their potentials. In the low temperature limit ($\omega \gg T_H$), one expects the logarithmic correction to the cross section of a free scalar. However, we cannot obtain the Schrodinger equation with potential for this case. Finally we comment on the stability of 5D black hole.
