Title: Large N and the Dine-Rajaraman problem
Authors: Jim McCarthy and Leonard Susskind and Andy Wilkins
Abstract: We compute the effective action for scattering of three well-separated extremal brane solutions, in 11d supergravity, with zero p_ transfer and small transverse velocities. Using an interpretation of the conjecture of Maldacena, following Hyun, this can be viewed as the large N limit of the Matrix theory description of three supergraviton scattering at leading order. The result is consistent with the perturbative supergravity calculation.
