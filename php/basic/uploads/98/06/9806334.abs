Abstract: Recently Lin, Balents, and Fisher have demonstrated that two-leg Hubbard ladders and armchair carbon nanotubes renormalize onto the integrable SO(8) Gross-Neveu model. We exploit this integrability to examine these systems in their doped phase. Using thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, we compute exactly both the spin and single particle gaps and the Luttinger parameter describing low energy excitations. We show both the spin and particle gap do not vanish at finite doping, while the Luttinger parameter remains close to its free fermionic value of 1. A similar set of conclusions is drawn for the undoped systems' behaviour in a finite magnetic field. We also comment on the exisitence in these systems of the $\pi$-resonance, a hallmark of Zhang's SO(5) theory of high $T_c$ superconductivity.
