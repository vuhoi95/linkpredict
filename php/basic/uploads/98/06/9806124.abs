Title: Enhanced Symmetries and the Ground State of String Theory
Authors: Michael Dine and Yossi Nir and Yael Shadmi
Abstract: The ground state of string theory may lie at a point of ``maximally enhanced symmetry", at which all of the moduli transform under continuous or discrete symmetries. This hypothesis, along with the hypotheses that the theory at high energies has N=1 supersymmetry and that the gauge couplings are weak and unified, has definite consequences for low energy physics. We describe these, and offer some suggestions as to how these assumptions might be compatible.
