Title: Black Hole Entropy in Induced Gravity: Reduction to 2D Quantum Field  Theory on the Horizon
Authors: V. Frolov and D. Fursaev
Abstract: It is argued that degrees of freedom responsible for the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a black hole in induced gravity are described by two dimensional quantum field theory defined on the bifurcation surface of the horizon. This result is proved for a class of induced gravity models with scalar, spinor and vector heavy constituents.
