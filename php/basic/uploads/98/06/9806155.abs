Title: Stable non-BPS D-particles
Authors: O. Bergman and M. R. Gaberdiel
Abstract: It is shown that the orbifold of type IIB string theory by (-1)^{F_L} I_4 admits a stable non-BPS Dirichlet particle that is stuck on the orbifold fixed plane. It is charged under the SO(2) gauge group coming from the twisted sector, and transforms as a long multiplet of the D=6 supersymmetry algebra. This suggests that it is the strong coupling dual of the perturbative stable non-BPS state that appears in the orientifold of type IIB by \Omega I_4.
