Title: Chiral Fermions on the Lattice
Authors: V. Bornyakov and G. Schierholz and A. Thimm
Abstract: A recently proposed method for regularizing chiral gauge theories non-perturbatively is discussed in detail. The result is an effective action which can be computed from the lattice gauge field, and which is suited for numerical simulations.
