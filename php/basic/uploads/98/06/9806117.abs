Authors: B. Geyer and P. M. Lavrov and D. M"ulsch
Abstract: The osp(1,2)-covariant Lagrangian quantization of irreducible gauge theories [hep-th/9712204] is generalized to L-stage reducible theories. The dependence of the generating functional of Green's functions on the choice of gauge in the massive case is dicussed and Ward identities related to osp(1,2) symmetry are given. Massive first stage theories with closed gauge algebra are studied in detail. The generalization of the Chapline-Manton model and topological Yang-Mills theory to the case of massive fields is consedered as examples.
