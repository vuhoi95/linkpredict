Authors: Angel Ballesteros and Francisco J. Herranz and Preeti Parashar
Abstract: Multiparametric quantum deformations of $gl(2)$ are studied through a complete classification of $gl(2)$ Lie bialgebra structures. From them, the non-relativistic limit leading to harmonic oscillator Lie bialgebras is implemented by means of a contraction procedure. New quantum deformations of $gl(2)$ together with their associated quantum $R$-matrices are obtained and other known quantizations are recovered and classified. Several connections with integrable models are outlined.
