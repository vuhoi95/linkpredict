Title: Can the Type-IIB axion prevent Pre-big Bang inflation?
Authors: A. Feinstein and M. A. Vazquez-Mozo
Abstract: We look at the possibility of superinflationary behavior in a class of anisotropic Type-IIB superstring cosmologies in the context of Pre-big Bang scenario and find that there exists a rather narrow range of parameters for which these models inflate. We then show that, although in general this behavior is left untouched by the introduction of a Ramond-Ramond axion field through a SL(2,R) rotation, there exists a particular class of axions for which inflation disappears completely. Asymptotic past initial conditions are briefly discussed, and some speculations on the possible extension of Pre-big Bang ideas to gravitational collapse are presented.
