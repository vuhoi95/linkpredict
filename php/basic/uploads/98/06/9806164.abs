Title: Probability representation in quantum field theory
Authors: V. I. Man'ko and L. Rosa and P. Vitale
Abstract: The recently proposed probability representation of quantum mechanics is generalized to quantum field theory. We introduce a probability distribution functional for field configurations and find an evolution equation for such a distribution. The connection to the time-dependent generating functional of Green's functions is elucidated and the classical limit is discussed.
