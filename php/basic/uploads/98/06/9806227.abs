Title: Integrable Impurity Model with Spin and Flavour: Model Inspired by  Resonant Tunneling in Quantum Dot
Authors: Osamu Tsuchiya and Ikuo Ichinose and Yasuyuki Kayama
Abstract: We introduce an integrable impurity model in which both electrons and impurity have spin and flavour degrees of freedom. This model is a generalization of the multi-channel Kondo model and closely related with resonant tunneling through quantum dot. The Hamiltonian is exactly diagonalized by means of the Bethe ansatz.
