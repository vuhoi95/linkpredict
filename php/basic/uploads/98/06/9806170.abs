Title: Duality in SU(N) x SU(N') Product Group from M theory
Authors: Julian Lee and Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: We generalize the M-theoretic duality of Schmaltz and Sundrum to the product group SU(N) x SU(N') case. We show that the type IIA brane configurations for dual gauge theories are in fact two special limits of the same M-theory 5-brane, just as in the case of the simple SU(N) group.
