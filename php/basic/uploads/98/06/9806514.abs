Title: Renormalisation of the Nonperturbative Thermal Pressure
Authors: D Boedeker and P V Landshoff and O Nachtmann and A Rebhan
Abstract: We show how the fully resummed thermal pressure is rendered ultraviolet finite by standard zero-temperature renormalisation. The analysis is developed in a 6-dimensional scalar model that mimics QED and has $N$ flavours. The $N\to\infty$ limit of the model can be calculated completely. At a critical temperature, one of the degrees of freedom has vanishing screening mass like the transverse gauge bosons in four-dimensional finite-temperature perturbation theory. The renormalised nonperturbative interaction pressure of this model is evaluated numerically.
