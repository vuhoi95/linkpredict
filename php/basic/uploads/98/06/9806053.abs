Title: Superconformal Field Theory with Boundary: Fermionic Model
Authors: S. A. Apikyan and D. A. Sahakyan
Abstract: Fermionic model of Superconformal field theory with boundary is considered. There were written the ''boundary'' Ward Identity for this theory and also constructed boundary states for fermionic and spin models. For this model were derived ''bootstrap'' equations for boundary structure constants.
