Title: Comments on Chiral p-Forms
Authors: X. Bekaert and M. Henneaux
Abstract: Two issues regarding chiral $p$-forms are addressed. First, we investigate the topological conditions on spacetime under which the action for a non-chiral $p$-form can be split as the sum of the actions for two chiral $p$-forms, one of each chirality. When these conditions are not met, we exhibit explicitly the extra topological degrees of freedom and their couplings to the chiral modes. Second, we study the problem of constructing Lorentz-invariant self-couplings of a chiral $p$-form in the light of the Dirac-Schwinger condition on the energy-momentum tensor commutation relations. We show how the Perry-Schwarz condition follows from the Dirac-Schwinger criterion and point out that consistency of the gravitational coupling is automatic.
