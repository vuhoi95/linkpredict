Title: Duality after Supersymmetry Breaking
Authors: Yael Shadmi and Hsin-Chia Cheng
Abstract: Starting with two supersymmetric dual theories, we imagine adding a chiral perturbation that breaks supersymmetry dynamically. At low energy we then get two theories with soft supersymmetry-breaking terms that are generated dynamically. With a canonical Kahler potential, some of the scalars of the "magnetic" theory typically have negative mass-squared, and the vector-like symmetry is broken. Since for large supersymmetry breaking the "electric" theory becomes ordinary QCD, the two theories are then incompatible. For small supersymmetry breaking, if duality still holds, the magnetic theory analysis implies specific patterns of chiral symmetry breaking in supersymmetric QCD with small soft masses.
