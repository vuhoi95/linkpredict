Abstract: We consider the 1+1 dimensional N = (8,8) supersymmetric matrix field theory obtained from a dimensional reduction of ten dimensional N = 1 super Yang-Mills. The gauge groups we consider are U(N) and SU(N), where N is finite but arbitrary. We adopt light-cone coordinates, and choose to work in the light-cone gauge. Quantizing this theory via Discretized Light-Cone Quantization (DLCQ) introduces an integer, K, which restricts the light-cone momentum-fraction of constituent quanta to be integer multiples of 1/K. Solutions to the DLCQ bound state equations are obtained for K=2,3 and 4 by discretizing the light-cone super charges, which preserves supersymmetry manifestly. We discuss degeneracies in the massive spectrum that appear to be independent of the light-cone compactification, and are therefore expected to be present in the decompactified limit K -> infinity. Our numerical results also support the claim that the SU(N) theory has a mass gap.
