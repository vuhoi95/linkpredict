Title: The Standard Model from extra dimensions
Authors: A. Pomarol and M. Quiros
Abstract: We present a simple N=1 five-dimensional model where the fifth dimension is compactified on the orbifold $S^1/Z_2$. Non-chiral matter lives in the bulk of the fifth dimension (five dimensions) while chiral matter lives on the fixed points of the orbifold (four-dimensional boundaries). The massless sector constitutes the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model while the massive modes rearrange in N=2 supermultiplets. After supersymmetry breaking by the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism the zero modes can be reduced to the non-supersymmetric Standard Model.
