Title: Limits of Matrix Theory in Curved Space
Authors: Ph. Brax and T. Wynter
Abstract: We study curved space versions of matrix string theory taking as a definition of the theory a gauged matrix sigma model. By analyzing the divergent terms in the loop expansion for the effective action we reduce the problem to a simple matrix generalization of the standard string theory beta function calculation. It is then demonstrated that the model can only be consistent for Ricci flat manifolds with vanishing six-dimensional Euler density.
