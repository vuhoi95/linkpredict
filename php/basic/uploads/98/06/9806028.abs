Title: Virasoro Constraints For Quantum Cohomology
Authors: Xiaobo Liu and Gang Tian
Abstract: Eguchi-Hori-Xiong and S. Katz proposed a conjecture that the partition function of topological sigma model coupled to gravity is annihilated by infinitely many differential operators which form half branch of the Virasoro algebra. In this paper, we give a proof to this conjecture for the genus 0 part.
