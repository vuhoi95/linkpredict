Title: Partition functions of chiral gauge theories on the two dimensional  torus and their duality properties
Authors: L. Griguolo and D. Seminara
Abstract: Two different families of abelian chiral gauge theories on the torus are investigated: the aim is to test the consistency of two-dimensional anomalous gauge theories in the presence of global degrees of freedom for the gauge field. An explicit computation of the partition functions shows that unitarity is recovered in particular regions of parameter space and that the effective dynamics is described in terms of fermionic interacting models. For the first family, this connection with fermionic models uncovers an exact duality which is conjectured to hold in the nonabelian case as well.
