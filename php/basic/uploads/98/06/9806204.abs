Title: The Spectrum of Softly Broken N=1 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: G. R. Farrar and G. Gabadadze and M. Schwetz
Abstract: We study the spectrum of the softly broken generalized Veneziano-Yankielowicz effective action for N=1 SUSY Yang-Mills theory. Two dual formulations of the effective action are given. The spurion method is used for the soft SUSY breaking. Masses of the bound states are calculated and mixing patterns are discussed. Mass splittings of pure gluonic states are consistent with predictions of conventional Yang-Mills theory. The results can be tested in lattice simulations of the SUSY Yang-Mills model.
