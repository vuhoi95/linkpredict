Title: Dual gluons and monopoles in 2+1 dimensional Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Ramesh Anishetty and Pushan Majumdar and H. S. Sharatchandra
Abstract: 2+1-dimensional Yang-Mills theory is reinterpreted in terms of metrics on 3-manifolds. The dual gluons are related to diffeomorphisms of the 3-manifold. Monopoles are identified with points where the Ricci tensor has triply degenerate eigenvalues. The dual gluons have the desired interaction with these monopoles. This would give a mass for the dual gluons resulting in confinement.
