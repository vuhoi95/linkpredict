Title: Comment on Multigraviton Scattering in the Matrix Model
Authors: Robert Echols and Joshua P. Gray
Abstract: We show by explicit calculation that the matrix model effective action does not contain the term $v_{12}^2 v_{23}^2 v_{13}^2/{R^7 r^7}$, in the limit $R \gg r$, contradicting a result reported recently.
