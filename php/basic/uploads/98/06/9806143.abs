Title: Three Generations in Type I Compactifications
Authors: Zurab Kakushadze and S. -H. Henry Tye
Abstract: Generalizing the recent work on three-family Type I compactifications, we classify perturbative Type I vacua obtained via compactifying on the T^6/Z_2 X Z_2 X Z_3 orbifold with all possible Wilson lines. In particular, we concentrate on models with gauge groups containing the Standard Model gauge group SU(3)_c X SU(2)_w X U(1)_Y as a subgroup. All of the vacua we obtain contain D5-branes and are non-perturbative from the heterotic viewpoint. The models we discuss have three-chiral families. We study some of their phenomenological properties, and point out non-trivial problems arising in these models in the phenomenological context.
