Title: Quaternionic Electron Theory: Dirac's Equation
Authors: Stefano De Leo and Waldyr A. Rodrigues, Jr.
Abstract: We perform a one-dimensional complexified quaternionic version of the Dirac equation based on $i$-complex geometry. The problem of the missing complex parameters in Quaternionic Quantum Mechanics with $i$-complex geometry is overcome by a nice ``trick'' which allows to avoid the Dirac algebra constraints in formulating our relativistic equation. A brief comparison with other quaternionic formulations is also presented.
