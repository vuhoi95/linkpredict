Title: 4-string Junction and Its Network
Authors: J. X. Lu and Shibaji Roy
Abstract: We study a BPS configuration in which four strings (of different type) meet at a point in $N = 2, D = 8$ supergravity, i.e., the low energy effective theory of $T^2$-compactified type II string theory. We demonstrate that the charge conservation of the four strings implies the vanishing of the net force (due to the tensions of various strings) at the junction and vice versa, using the tension formula for $SL(3, Z)$ strings obtained recently by the present authors. We then show that a general 4-string junction preserves 1/8 of the spacetime supersymmetries. Using 4-string junctions as building blocks, we construct a string network which also preserves 1/8 of the spacetime supersymmetries.
