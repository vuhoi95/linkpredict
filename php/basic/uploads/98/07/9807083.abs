Title: Supersymmetric FRW model and the ground state of supergravity
Authors: V. I. Tkach and J. J. Rosales and J. Socorro
Abstract: In this work we construct the vacuum configuration of supergravity interacting with homogeneous complex scalar matter fields. The corresponding configuration is of the FRW model invariant under the $n=2$ local conformal time supersymmetry, which is a subgroup of the four dimensional space-time supersymmetry. We show, that the potential of the scalar matter fields is a function of the K\"ahler potential and of the arbitrary parameter $\alpha$. This parameter enumerates the vacuum states. The scalar matter potential induces the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry in supergravity. On the quantum level our model is a specific supersymmetric quantum mechanics, which admits quantum states in supergravity, and the states with zero energy are described by the wave function of the FRW universe.
