Title: Dual symmetry and the vacuum energy
Authors: V. I. Tkach and J. Socorro and J. J. Rosales and J. A. Nieto
Abstract: In this work we present a new hidden symmetry in gravity for the scale factor in the FRW model, for $k=0$. This exact symmetry vanishes the cosmological constant. We interpret this hidden symmetry as a dual symmetry in the sense that appears in the string theory.
