Title: Non-Supersymmetric Stable Vacua of M-Theory
Authors: M. Berkooz and Soo-Jong Rey
Abstract: We discuss stability of non-supersymmetric compactification of M-theory and string theory of the form AdS * X, and their dual non-supersymmetric interacting conformal field theories. We argue some of the difficulties in controlling 1/N-corrections disappear in the cases that the large-N dual conformal field theory has no invariant marginal operators (and in some cases with no exactly marginal operators only). We provide several examples of such compactifications of M-theory down to AdS4.
