Title: Weinberg propagator of a free massive particle with an arbitrary spin  from the BFV-BRST path integral
Authors: V. G. Zima and S. O. Fedoruk
Abstract: The transition amplitude is obtained for a free massive particle of arbitrary spin by calculating the path integral in the index-spinor formulation within the BFV-BRST approach. None renormalizations of the path integral measure were applied. The calculation has given the Weinberg propagator written in the index-free form with the use of index spinor. The choice of boundary conditions on the index spinor determines holomorphic or antiholomorphic representation for the canonical description of particle/antiparticle spin.
