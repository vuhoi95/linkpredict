Title: Proper time derivatives in quantum mechanics
Authors: Juan P. Aparicio and Fabian H. Gaioli and Edgardo T. Garcia Alvarez
Abstract: Several quantum proper time derivatives are obtained from the Beck one in the usual framework of relativistic quantum mechanics (spin 1/2 case). The ``scalar Hamiltonians'' of these derivatives should be thought of as the conjugate variables of the proper time. Then, the Hamiltonians would play the role of mass operators, suggesting the formulation of an adequate extended indefinite mass framework. We propose and briefly develop the framework corresponding to the Feynman parametrization of the Dirac equation. In such a case we derive the other parametrizations known in the literature, linking the extension of the different proposals of quantum proper time derivatives again.
