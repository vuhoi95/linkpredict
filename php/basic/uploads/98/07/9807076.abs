Title: Vacuum Energy Cancellation in a Non-supersymmetric String
Authors: Shamit Kachru and Jason Kumar and Eva Silverstein
Abstract: We present a nonsupersymmetric orbifold of type II string theory and show that it has vanishing cosmological constant at the one and two loop level. We argue heuristically that the cancellation persists at higher loops.
