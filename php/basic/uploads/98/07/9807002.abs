Title: Canonical Quantization and Expanding Metrics
Authors: E. Alfinito and G. Vitiello
Abstract: The canonical formalism for expanding metrics scenarios is presented. Non-unitary time evolution implied by expanding geometry is described as a trajectory over unitarily inequivalent representations at different times of the canonical commutation relations. Thermal properties of inflating Universe are also discussed.
