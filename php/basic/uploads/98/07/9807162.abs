Title: Zeta Function Method for Repulsive Casimir Forces at Finite Temperature
Authors: F. C. Santos and A. Ten√≥rio and A. C. Tort
Abstract: We compute the Casimir energy between an unusual pair of parallel plates at finite temperature, namely, a perfectely conducting plate ($\epsilon\to\infty$) and an infinitely permeable one ($\mu\to\infty$) by applying the generalized zeta function method. We also compute the Casimir pressure and discuss the high and the low temperature limits.
