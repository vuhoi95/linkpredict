Title: Large N Domain Walls as D-branes for ${\cal N}=1$ QCD String
Authors: Gia Dvali and Zurab Kakushadze
Abstract: We consider a model which in a certain limit reduces to the large N ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theory without matter. The gaugino condensate in this model is controlled by the dynamics of an additional singlet superfield. Using this model we explicitly construct BPS domain walls arising due to the chiral symmetry breaking. In particular, in the large N limit we obtain the exact shapes of the domain walls corresponding to solitons, and also of the domain walls interpreted as D-branes on which the SQCD string can end, whose existence was previously argued by Witten in the context of the large N SQCD. We also discuss various points which appear to support the consistency of the D-brane interpretation for these domain walls within the SQCD string context.
