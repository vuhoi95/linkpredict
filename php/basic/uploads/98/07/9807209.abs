Abstract: We explore the connection between D-branes and black holes in one particular case: a $D3$-brane compactified to four dimensions on $T^6/Z_3$. Using the $D$-brane boundary state description we show the equivalence with a double extremal N=2 black hole solution of four dimensional supergravity.
