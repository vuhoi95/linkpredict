Title: Separation of Variables in the Elliptic Gaudin Model
Authors: Evgueni K. Sklyanin and Takashi Takebe
Abstract: For the elliptic Gaudin model (a degenerate case of XYZ integrable spin chain) a separation of variables is constructed in the classical case. The corresponding separated coordinates are obtained as the poles of a suitably normalized Baker-Akhiezer function. The classical results are generalized to the quantum case where the kernel of separating integral operator is constructed. The simplest one-degree-of-freedom case is studied in detail.
