Title: Quantum corrections to the classical reflection factor in A2(1) Toda  Field Theory
Authors: Michael Perkins and Peter Bowcock
Abstract: The $O(\beta^2)$ quantum correction to the classical reflection factor is calculated for one of the integrable boundary conditions of $a_2^{(1)}$ affine Toda field theory. This is found to agree with the conjectured exact reflection factor of the quantum theory. We consider the existence of other exact reflection factors consistent with our perturbative answer and examine the question of how duality transformations might relate theories with different boundary conditions.
