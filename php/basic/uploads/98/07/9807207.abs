Title: Complete Wetting of Gluons and Gluinos
Authors: A. Campos and K. Holland and U. -J. Wiese
Abstract: Complete wetting is a universal phenomenon associated with interfaces separating coexisting phases. For example, in the pure gluon theory, at $T_c$ an interface separating two distinct high-temperature deconfined phases splits into two confined-deconfined interfaces with a complete wetting layer of confined phase between them. In supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, distinct confined phases may coexist with a Coulomb phase at zero temperature. In that case, the Coulomb phase may completely wet a confined-confined interface. Finally, at the high-temperature phase transition of gluons and gluinos, confined-confined interfaces are completely wet by the deconfined phase, and similarly, deconfined-deconfined interfaces are completely wet by the confined phase. For these various cases, we determine the interface profiles and the corresponding complete wetting critical exponents. The exponents depend on the range of the interface interactions and agree with those of corresponding condensed matter systems.
