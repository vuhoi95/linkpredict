Title: BRST-anti-BRST covariant theory for the second class constrained  systems. A general method and examples
Authors: I. Yu. Karataeva and S. L. Lyakhovich
Abstract: The BRST-anti-BRST covariant extension is suggested for the split involution quantization scheme for the second class constrained theories. The constraint algebra generating equations involve on equal footing a pair of BRST charges for second class constraints and a pair of the respective anti-BRST charges. Formalism displays explicit Sp(2) \times Sp(2) symmetry property. Surprisingly, the the BRST-anti-BRST algebra must involve a central element, related to the nonvanishing part of the constraint commutator and having no direct analogue in a first class theory. The unitarizing Hamiltonian is fixed by the requirement of the explicit BRST-anti-BRST symmetry with a much more restricted ambiguity if compare to a first class theory or split involution second class case in the nonsymmetric formulation. The general method construction is supplemented by the explicit derivation of the extended BRST symmetry generators for several examples of the second class theories, including self--dual nonabelian model and massive Yang Mills theory.
