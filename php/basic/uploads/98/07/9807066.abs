Title: BRS Invariance of Unoriented Open-Closed String Field Theory
Authors: Tsuguhiko Asakawa and Taichiro Kugo and Tomohiko Takahashi
Abstract: We present the full action for the unoriented open-closed string field theory which is based on the \alpha=p^+ HIKKO type vertices. The BRS invariance of the action is proved up to the terms which are expected to cancel the anomalous one-loop contributions. This implies that the system is invariant under the gauge transformations with open and closed string field parameters up to the anomalies.
