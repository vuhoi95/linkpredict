Title: $O(Î±)$ Radiative Correction to the Casimir Energy for Penetrable  Mirrors
Authors: M. Bordag and K. Scharnhorst
Abstract: The leading radiative correction to the Casimir energy for two parallel penetrable mirrors is calculated within QED perturbation theory. It is found to be of the order $\alpha$ like the known radiative correction for ideally reflecting mirrors from which it differs only by a monotonic, powerlike function of the frequency at which the mirrors become transparent. This shows that the $O(\alpha^2)$ radiative correction calculated recently by Kong and Ravndal for ideally reflecting mirrors on the basis of effective field theory methods remains subleading even for the physical case of penetrable mirrors.
