Title: TeV-scale GUTs
Authors: Keith R. Dienes and Emilian Dudas and Tony Gherghetta
Abstract: In this talk, we summarize our recent proposal for lowering the scale of grand unification to the TeV range though the appearance of extra spacetime dimensions. Particular emphasis is placed on the perturbativity and predictivity of our scenario, as well as its sensitivity to unification-scale effects.
