Title: On the Natural Gauge Fields of Manifolds
Authors: A. B. Pestov and Bijan Saha
Abstract: The gauge symmetry inherent in the concept of manifold has been discussed. Within the scope of this symmetry the linear connection or displacement field can be considered as a natural gauge field on the manifold. The gauge invariant equations for the displacement field have been derived. It has been shown that the energy-momentum tensor of this field conserves and hence the displacement field can be treated as one that transports energy and gravitates. To show the existence of the solutions of the field equations we have derived the general form of the displacement field in Minkowski space-time which is invariant under rotation and space and time inversion. With this anzats we found spherically-symmetric solutions of the equations in question.
