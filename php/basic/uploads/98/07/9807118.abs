Title: n-point functions at finite temperature
Authors: Defu Hou and Enke Wang and Ulrich Heinz
Abstract: We study $n$-point functions at finite temperature in the closed time path formalism. With the help of two basic column vectors and their dual partners we derive a compact decomposition of the time-ordered $n$-point functions with $2^n$ components in terms of $2^{n-1} -1$ independent retarded/advanced $n$-point functions. This representation greatly simplifies calculations in the real-time formalism.
