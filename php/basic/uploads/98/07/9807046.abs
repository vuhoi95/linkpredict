Title: Antisymmetric tensor field on $AdS_5$
Authors: G. E. Arutyunov and S. A. Frolov
Abstract: By using the Hamiltonian version of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we compute the two-point Green function of a local operator in D=4 N=4 super Yang-Mills theory, which corresponds to a massive antisymmetric tensor field of the second rank on the $AdS_{5}$ background. We discuss the conformal transformations induced on the boundary by isometries of $AdS_{5}$.
