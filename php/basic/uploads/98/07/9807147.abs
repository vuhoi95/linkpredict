Title: Self-dual gravity and self-dual Yang-Mills in the context of  Macdowell-Mansouri formalism
Authors: J. A. Nieto and J. Socorro
Abstract: In this work we propose an action which unifies self-dual gravity and self-dual Yang-Mills in the context of the Macdowell-Mansouri formalism. We claim that such an action may be used to find the S-dual action for both self-dual gravity and self-dual Yang-Mills.
