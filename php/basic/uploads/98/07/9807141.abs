Title: Observational Tests of Instanton Cosmology
Authors: R. E. Allen and J. Dumoit and A. Mondragon
Abstract: A new cosmological model leads to testable predictions that are different from those of both standard cosmology and models with a cosmological constant. The prediction that q_0=0 is the same as in other ``coasting universe'' models, but arises without the need for any exotic form of matter or other ad hoc assumptions.
