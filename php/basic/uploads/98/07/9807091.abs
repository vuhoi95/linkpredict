Title: A Local Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Matthias R. Gaberdiel and Horst G. Kausch
Abstract: The local logarithmic conformal field theory corresponding to the triplet algebra at c=-2 is constructed. The constraints of locality and crossing symmetry are explored in detail, and a consistent set of amplitudes is found. The spectrum of the corresponding theory is determined, and it is found to be modular invariant. This provides the first construction of a non-chiral rational logarithmic conformal field theory, establishing that such models can indeed define bona fide conformal field theories.
