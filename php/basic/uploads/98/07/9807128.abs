Title: Conformal Symmetry and the Three Point Function for the Gravitational  Axial Anomaly
Authors: Jiannis Pachos and Ricardo Schiappa
Abstract: This work presents a first study of a radiative calculation for the gravitational axial anomaly in the massless Abelian Higgs model. The two loop contribution to the anomalous correlation function of one axial current and two energy-momentum tensors, <A_alpha(z) T_\mu\nu(y) T_\rho\sigma(x)>, is computed at an order that involves only internal matter fields. Conformal properties of massless field theories are used in order to perform the Feynman diagram calculations in the coordinate space representation. The two loop contribution is found not to vanish, due to the presence of two independent tensor structures in the anomalous correlator.
