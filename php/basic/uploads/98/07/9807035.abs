Abstract: Meixner oscillators have a ground state and an `energy' spectrum that is equally spaced; they are a two-parameter family of models that satisfy a Hamiltonian equation with a {\it difference} operator. Meixner oscillators include as limits and particular cases the Charlier, Kravchuk and Hermite (common quantum-mechanical) harmonic oscillators. By the Sommerfeld-Watson transformation they are also related with a relativistic model of the linear harmonic oscillator, built in terms of the Meixner-Pollaczek polynomials, and their continuous weight function. We construct explicitly the corresponding coherent states with the dynamical symmetry group Sp(2,$\Re$). The reproducing kernel for the wavefunctions of these models is also found.
