Title: Superconformal 6D (2,0) theories in superspace
Authors: C. Grojean and J. Mourad
Abstract: A geometrical construction of superconformal transformations in six dimensional (2,0) superspace is proposed. Superconformal Killing vectors are determined. It is shown that the transformation of the tensor multiplet involves a zero curvature non-trivial cochain.
