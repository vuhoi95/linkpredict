Title: Dynamic Monte Carlo Study of the Two-Dimensional Quantum XY Model
Authors: H. P. Ying and H. J. Luo and L. Schuelke and B. Zheng
Abstract: We present a dynamic Monte Carlo study of the Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition for the spin-1/2 quantum XY model in two dimensions. The short-time dynamic scaling behaviour is found and the dynamical exponent $\theta$, $z$ and the static exponent $\eta$ are determined at the transition temperature.
