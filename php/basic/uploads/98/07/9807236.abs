Abstract: We obtain exactly the vacuum expectation values $<(\partial\phi)^2 ({\bar\partial}\phi) e^{i\alpha\phi}>$ in the sine-Gordon model and $<L_{-2}{\bar L}_{-2} \Phi_{l,k}>$ in $\Phi_{1,3}$ perturbed minimal CFT. We discuss applications of these results to short-distance expansions of two-point correlation functions.
