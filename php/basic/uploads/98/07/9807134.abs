Title: A Third-Quantized Approach to the Large-N Field Models
Authors: V. P. Maslov and O. Yu. Shvedov
Abstract: Large-N field systems are considered from an unusual point of view. The Hamiltonian is presented in a third-quantized form analogously to the second-quantized formulation of the quantum theory of many particles. The semiclassical approximation is applied to the third-quantized Hamiltonian. The advantages of this approach in comparison with 1/N-expansion are discussed.
