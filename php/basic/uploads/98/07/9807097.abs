Title: On Four-point Functions in the CFT/AdS Correspondence
Authors: Hong Liu and A. A. Tseytlin
Abstract: We discuss the properties of four-point functions in the context of the correspondence between a classical supergravity theory in the bulk of the Anti de Sitter space and quantum conformal field theory at the boundary. The contribution to a four-point function from the exchange of a scalar field of arbitrary mass in AdS space is explicitly identified with that of the corresponding operator in the conformal partial wave expansion of a four-point function on the CFT side. Integral representations are found for the massless vector and graviton exchanges. We also discuss some aspects of the four-point functions of Tr F^2 and Tr F F^* (`dilaton' and `axion') operators in the N =4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills.
