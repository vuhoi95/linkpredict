Title: Screening in Supersymmetric Gauge Theories in Two Dimensions
Authors: A. Armoni and Y. Frishman and J. Sonnenschein
Abstract: We show that the string tension in N=1 two-dimensional super Yang-Mills theory vanishes independently of the representation of the quark anti-quark external source. We argue that this result persists in SQCD_2 and in two-dimensional gauge theories with extended supersymmetry or in chiral invariant models with at least one massless dynamical fermion. We also compute the string tension for the massive Schwinger model, as a demonstration of the method of the calculation.
