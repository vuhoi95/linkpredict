Title: Ambiguity in the evaluation of the effective action on the cone
Authors: D. Iellici and E. S. Moreira Jr
Abstract: An ambiguity in the computation of the one-loop effective action for fields living on a cone is illustrated. It is shown that the ambiguity arises due to the non-commutativity of the regularization of ultraviolet and (conical) boundary divergencies.
