Title: Two-dimensional Liouville Gravity Theory with Non-Trivial Classical  Background
Authors: N. Ano and T. Suzuki
Abstract: We examine a possibility to introduce a non-trivial classical background metric into the 2-d Liouville gravity theory. The classical background appears as a part of the Weyl factor of the physical metric of 2-d surfaces with some conformal dimension. On the other hand, the rest part of the factor corresponds to the quantum fluctuating sector, having another conformal dimension such that these two conformal dimensions sum up to just (1,1). Consequently we conclude that, in the 2-d Liouville gravity, the target space dimensions D can be beyond 1.
