Title: A local (perturbative) construction of observables in gauge theories:  the example of QED
Authors: M. Duetsch and K. Fredenhagen
Abstract: Interacting fields can be constructed as formal power series in the framework of causal perturbation theory. The local field algebra $\tilde {\cal F}({\cal O})$ is obtained without performing the adiabatic limit; the (usually bad) infrared behavior plays no role. To construct the observables in gauge theories we use the Kugo-Ojima formalism; we define the BRST-transformation $\tilde s$ as a graded derivation on the algebra of interacting fields and use the implementation of $\tilde s$ by the Kugo-Ojima operator $Q_{\rm int}$. Since our treatment is local, the operator $Q_{\rm int}$ differs from the corresponding operator $Q$ of the free theory. We prove that the Hilbert space structure present in the free case is stable under perturbations. All assumptions are shown to be satisfied in QED.
