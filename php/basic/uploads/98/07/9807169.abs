Title: Gravitating Dyons and Dyonic Black Holes
Authors: Yves Brihaye and Betti Hartmann and Jutta Kunz
Abstract: We study static spherically symmetric gravitating dyon solutions and dyonic black holes in Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory. The gravitating dyon solutions share many features with the gravitating monopole solutions. In particular, gravitating dyon solutions and dyonic black holes exist up to a maximal coupling constant, and beside the fundamental dyon solutions there are excited dyon solutions.
