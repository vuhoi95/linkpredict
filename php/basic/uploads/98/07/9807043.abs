Title: Zero-point energy of massless scalar fields in the presence of soft and  semihard boundaries in D dimensions
Authors: F. Caruso and R. De Paola and N. F. Svaiter
Abstract: The renormalized energy density of a massless scalar field defined in a D-dimensional flat spacetime is computed in the presence of "soft" and "semihard" boundaries, modeled by some smoothly increasing potential functions. The sign of the renormalized energy densities for these different confining situations is investigated. The dependence of this energy on $D$ for the cases of "hard" and "soft/semihard" boundaries are compared.
