Title: Nonsingular Bianchi type I cosmological solutions from 1-loop  superstring effective action
Authors: Shinsuke Kawai and Jiro Soda
Abstract: Non-singular Bianchi type I solutions are found from the effective action with a superstring-motivated Gauss-Bonnet term. These anisotropic non-singular solutions evolve from the asymptotic Minkowski region, subsequently super-inflate, and then smoothly continue either to Kasner-type (expanding in two directions and shrinking in one direction) or to Friedmann-type (expanding in all directions) solutions. We also found a new kind of singularity which arises from the fact that the anisotropic expansion rates are multiple-valued function of time. The initial singularity in the isotropic limit of this model belongs to this new kind of singularity. In our analysis the anisotropic solutions are likely to be singular when the super-inflation is steep.
