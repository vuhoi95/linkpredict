Title: The Gamow vectors and the Schwinger effect
Authors: Fabian H. Gaioli and Edgardo T. Garcia Alvarez and Mario A. Castagnino
Abstract: We introduce a `proper time' formalism to study the instability of the vacuum in a uniform external electric field due to particle production. This formalism allows us to reduce a quantum field theoretical problem to a quantum-mechanical one in a higher dimension. The instability results from the inverted oscillator structure which appears in the Hamiltonian. We show that the `proper time' unitary evolution splits into two semigroups. The semigroup associated with decaying Gamov vectors is related to the Feynman boundary conditions for the Green functions and the semigroup associated with growing Gamov vectors is related to the Dyson boundary conditions.
