Abstract: We propose a way of protecting a Dirac fermion interacting with a scalar field from acquiring a mass from the vacuum. It is obtained through an implementation of translational symmetry when the theory is formulated with a momentum cutoff, which forbids the usual Yukawa term. We consider that this mechanism can help to understand the smallness of neutrino masses without a tuning of the Yukawa coupling. The prohibition of the Yukawa term for the neutrino forbids at the same time a gauge coupling between the right-handed electron and neutrino. We prove that this mechanism can be implemented on the lattice.
