Title: Symplectic structure free Chern-Simons Theory
Authors: Won Tae Kim and Yong-Wan Kim and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: The second class constraints algebra of the abelian Chern-Simons theory is rigorously studied in terms of the Hamiltonian embedding in order to obtain the first class constraint system. The symplectic structure of fields due to the second class constraints disappears in the resulting system. Then we obtain a new type of Chern-Simons action which has an infinite set of the irreducible first class constraints and exhibits new extended local gauge symmetries implemented by these first class constraints.
