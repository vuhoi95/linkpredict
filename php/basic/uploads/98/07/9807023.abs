Title: A Kaehler Structure of the Triplectic Geometry
Authors: M A Grigoriev and A M Semikhatov
Abstract: We study the geometry of the triplectic quantization of gauge theories. We show that underlying the triplectic geometry is a Kaehler manifold N endowed with a pair of transversal polarizations. The antibrackets can be brought to the canonical form if and only if N admits a flat symmetric connection that is compatible with the complex structure and the polarizations.
