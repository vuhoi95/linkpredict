Title: Towards a Relativistic KMS Condition
Authors: Jacques Bros and Detlev Buchholz
Abstract: It is shown that, under quite general conditions, thermal correlation functions in relativistic quantum field theory have stronger analyticity properties in configuration space than those imposed by the KMS-condition. These analyticity properties may be understood as a remnant of the relativistic spectrum condition in the vacuum sector and lead to a Lorentz-covariant formulation of the KMS-condition involving all space-time variables.
