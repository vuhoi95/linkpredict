Title: Pursuing Gravitational S-Duality
Authors: H. Garcia-Compean and O. Obregon and C. Ramirez
Abstract: Recently a strong-weak coupling duality in non-abelian non-supersymmetric theories in four dimensions has been found. An analogous procedure is reviewed, which allows to find the `dual action' to the gauge theory of dynamical gravity constructed by the MacDowell-Mansouri model plus the superposition of a $\Theta$ term.
