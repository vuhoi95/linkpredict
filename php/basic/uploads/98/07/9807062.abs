Title: Prepotentials, Bi-linear Forms on Periods and Enhanced Gauge Symmetries  in Type-II Strings
Authors: T. Masuda and H. Suzuki
Abstract: We construct a bi-linear form on the periods of Calabi-Yau spaces. These are used to obtain the prepotentials around conifold singularities in type-II strings compactified on Calabi-Yau space. The explicit construction of the bi-linear forms is achieved for the one-moduli models as well as two moduli models with K3-fibrations where the enhanced gauge symmetry is known to be observed at conifold locus. We also show how these bi-linear forms are related with the existence of flat coordinates. We list the resulting prepotentials in two moduli models around the conifold locus, which contains alpha' corrections of 4-D N=2 SUSY SU(2) Yang-Mills theory as the stringy effect.
