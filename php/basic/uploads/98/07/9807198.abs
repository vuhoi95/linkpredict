Title: Super Yang-Mills on the Noncomutative Torus
Authors: Bogdan Morariu and Bruno Zumino
Abstract: After a brief review of matrix theory compactification leading to noncommutative supersymmetric Yang-Mills gauge theory, we present solutions for the fundamental and adjoint sections on a two-dimensional twisted quantum torus in two different gauges. We also give explicit transformations connecting different representations which have appeared in the literature. Finally we discuss the more mathematical concept of Morita equivalence of C*-algebras as it applies to our specific case.
