Title: Branes in the bulk of Anti-de Sitter space
Authors: Michael R. Douglas and Washington Taylor IV
Abstract: We consider (3 + 1)-dimensional N=4 super Yang-Mills theory with a nonvanishing scalar Higgs vacuum expectation value, and compare this theory to AdS supergravity with branes in the bulk. We show that the one-loop effective potential for excitations of the Yang-Mills field agrees with the classical linearized potential for brane waves in the AdS picture in the limit of long wavelengths. This supports the idea that the AdS/CFT correspondance fits into string theory as expected from previous work.
