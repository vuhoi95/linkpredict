Title: Massive Vector Gauge Theory and Comparison with Higgs-Connes-Lott
Authors: Chang-Yeong Lee and Yuval Ne'eman
Abstract: A massive vector gauge theory constructed from the matrix derivative approach of noncommutative geometry is compared with the Higgs-Connes-Lott theory. In the massive vector gauge theory, a new extra shift-like symmetry which is due to the one form constant matrix derivative allows the theory to have a mass term while keeping the gauge symmetry intact. In the Higgs-Connes-Lott theory, the transformation of scalar field makes up the deficiency of symmetry due to the mass term. Thus, when the scalar field is absent there remains no gauge symmetry just like the Proca model. In the massive vector gauge theory, the shift-like symmetry makes up the deficiency of symmetry due to the mass term even in the absence of the scalar field.
