Title: Detection of Scalar Particles in Gravitational Waves from Resonant-Mass  Detectors of Spherical Shape
Authors: E. Coccia and F. Fucito
Abstract: We report on some recent work, which points out the relevance of future measurements of gravitational waves by resonant-mass detectors of spherical shape for theories of gravity of non-Einstein type.
