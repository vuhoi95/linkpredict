Title: The domain-wall/QFT correspondence
Authors: H. J. Boonstra and K. Skenderis and P. K. Townsend
Abstract: We extend the correspondence between adS-supergravities and superconformal field theories on the adS boundary to a correspondence between gauged supergravities (typically with non-compact gauge groups) and quantum field theories on domain walls.
