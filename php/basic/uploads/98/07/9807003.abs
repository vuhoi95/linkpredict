Title: BÃ¤cklund transformations in 2D dilaton gravity
Authors: D. J. Navarro and J. Navarro-Salas
Abstract: We give a B\"acklund transformation connecting a generic 2D dilaton gravity theory to a generally covariant free field theory. This transformation provides an explicit canonical transformation relating both theories.
