Title: A Model of Interacting Partons for Hadronic Structure Functions
Authors: G. S. Krishnaswami and S. G. Rajeev
Abstract: We present a model for the structure of baryons in which the valence partons interact through a linear potential. This model can be derived from QCD in the approximation where the transverse momenta are ignored. We compare the parton structure function predicted by our model with a standard global fit to Deep Inelastic Scattering data. The only parameter we can adjust is the fraction of the baryon momentum carried by the valence partons. Our prediction agrees well with data except for small values of the Bjorken scaling variable.
