Title: Supersymmetric quantum theory and non-commutative geometry
Authors: J. Froehlich and O. Grandjean and A. Recknagel
Abstract: Classical differential geometry can be encoded in spectral data, such as Connes' spectral triples, involving supersymmetry algebras. In this paper, we formulate non-commutative geometry in terms of supersymmetric spectral data. This leads to generalizations of Connes' non-commutative spin geometry encompassing non-commutative Riemannian, symplectic, complex-Hermitian and (Hyper-)Kaehler geometry. A general framework for non-commutative geometry is developed from the point of view of supersymmetry and illustrated in terms of examples. In particular, the non-commutative torus and the non-commutative 3-sphere are studied in some detail.
