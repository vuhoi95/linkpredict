Abstract: Motivated by the shape invariance condition in supersymmetric quantum mechanics, we develop an algebraic framework for shape invariant Hamiltonians with a general change of parameters. This approach involves nonlinear generalizations of Lie algebras. Our work extends previous results showing the equivalence of shape invariant potentials involving translational change of parameters with standard $SO(2,1)$ potential algebra for Natanzon type potentials.
