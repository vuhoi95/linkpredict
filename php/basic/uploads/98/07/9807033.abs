Title: Instantons in supersymmetric Yang-Mills and D-instantons in IIB  superstring theory
Authors: Massimo Bianchi and Michael B. Green and Stefano Kovacs and Giancarlo Rossi
Abstract: The one-instanton contributions to various correlation functions of supercurrents in four-dimensional N=4 supersymmetric SU(2) Yang-Mills theory are evaluated to the lowest order in perturbation theory.Expressions of the same form are obtained from the leading effects of a single D-instanton extracted from the IIB superstring effective action around the AdS5*S5 background. This is in line with the suggested AdS/Yang-Mills correspondence. The relation between Yang--Mills instantons and D-instantons is further confirmed by the explicit form of the classical D-instanton solution in the AdS5*S5 background and its associated supermultiplet of zero modes. Speculations are made concerning instanton effects in the large-N_c limit of the SU(N_c) Yang-Mills theory.
