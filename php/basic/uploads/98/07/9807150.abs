Title: ``Non chiral'' primary superfields in the AdS_{d+1}/CFT_d correspondence
Authors: Laura Andrianopoli and Sergio Ferrara
Abstract: We consider some long multiplets describing bulk massive excitations of M-theory two-branes and IIB string three-branes which correspond to ``non chiral'' primary operators of the boundary OSp(8/4) and SU(2,2/4) superconformal field theories. Examples of such multiplets are the ``radial'' modes on the branes, including up to spin 4 excitations, which may be then considered as prototypes of states which are not described by the K-K spectrum of the corresponding supergravity theories on AdS_4 x S_7 and AdS_5 x S_5 respectively.
