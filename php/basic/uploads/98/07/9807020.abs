Title: String Breaking in Non-Abelian Gauge Theories with Fundamental Matter  Fields
Authors: O. Philipsen and H. Wittig
Abstract: We present clear numerical evidence for string breaking in three-dimensional SU(2) gauge theory with fundamental bosonic matter through a mixing analysis between Wilson loops and meson operators representing bound states of a static source and a dynamical scalar. The breaking scale is calculated in the continuum limit. In units of the lightest glueball we find $r_{\rm b} m_G\approx13.6$. The implications of our results for QCD are discussed.
