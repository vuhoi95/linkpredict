Title: Seiberg-Witten Theory as d<1 Topological Strings
Authors: Katsushi Ito and Chuan-Sheng Xiong and Sung-Kil Yang
Abstract: In view of two-dimensional topological gravity coupled to matter, we study the Seiberg-Witten theory for the low-energy behavior of N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with ADE gauge groups. We construct a new solution of the Picard-Fuchs equations obeyed by the Seiberg-Witten periods. Our solution is expressed as the linear sum over the infinite set of one-point functions of gravitational descendants in $d<1$ topological strings. It turns out that our solution provides the power series expansion around the origin of the quantum moduli space of the Coulomb branch. For SU(N) gauge group we show how the Seiberg-Witten periods are reconstructed from the present solution.
