Title: The Self-Force of a Charged Particle in Classical Electrodynamics with a  Cut-off
Authors: Josif Frenkel and R B Santos
Abstract: We discuss, in the context of classical electrodynamics with a Lorentz invariant cut-off at short distances, the self-force acting on a point charged particle. It follows that the electromagnetic mass of the point charge occurs in the equation of motion in a form consistent with special relativity. We find that the exact equation of motion does not exhibit runaway solutions or non-causal behavior, when the cut-off is larger than half of the classical radius of the electron.
