Title: Master Equations for Master Amplitudes
Authors: M. Caffo and H. Czyz and S. Laporta and E. Remiddi
Abstract: The general lines of the derivation and the main properties of the master equations for the master amplitudes associated to a given Feynman graph are recalled. Some results for the 2-loop self-mass graph with 4 propagators are then presented.
