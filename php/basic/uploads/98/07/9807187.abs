Title: BPS black holes in N=2 five dimensional AdS supergravity
Authors: K. Behrndt and A. H. Chamseddine and W. A. Sabra
Abstract: BPS black hole solutions of U(1) gauged five-dimensional supergravity are obtained by solving the Killing spinor equations. These extremal static black holes live in an asymptotic AdS_5 space time. Unlike black holes in asymptotic flat space time none of them possess a regular horizon. We also calculate the influence, of a particular class of these solutions, on the Wilson loops calculation.
