Title: Graviton scattering in an M-orientifold background
Authors: Ulf H. Danielsson and Par Stjernberg and Martin Kruczenski
Abstract: In this paper we study the scattering of gravitons off a five orientifold in eleven dimensions. We compare the supergravity result with a two loop M(atrix) model calculation and find exact agreement. The supergravity calculation involves nonlinear three graviton effects.
