Title: IWP Solutions for Heterotic String in Five Dimensions
Authors: Alfredo Herrera-Aguilar and Oleg Kechkin
Abstract: We obtain extremal stationary solutions that generalize the Israel-Wilson-Perj\'es class for the low-energy limit of heterotic string theory with n>=3 U(1) gauge fields toroidally compactified from five to three dimensions. A dyonic solution is obtained using the matrix Ernst potential (MEP) formulation and expressed in terms of a single real 3X3-matrix harmonic function. By studying the asymptotic behaviour of the field configurations we define the physical charges of the field system. The extremality condition makes the charges to saturate the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bound.
