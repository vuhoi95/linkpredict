Title: Black Holes and Flop Transitions in M-Theory on Calabi-Yau Threefolds
Authors: Ingo Gaida and Swapna Mahapatra and Thomas Mohaupt and Wafic A. Sabra
Abstract: We present fivedimensional extreme black hole solutions of M-theory compactified on Calabi-Yau threefolds and study these solutions in the context of flop transitions in the extended Kahler cone. In particular we consider a specific model and present black hole solutions, breaking half of N=2 supersymmetry, in two regions of the extended Kahler cone, which are connected by a flop transition. The conditions necessary to match both solutions at the flop transition are analysed. Finally we also discuss the conditions to obtain massless black holes at the flop transition.
