Title: Inhomogeneous Magnetic Response in Anyon Fluid at High Temperature
Authors: Efrain J. Ferrer and Vivian de la Incera
Abstract: The charged anyon fluid in the presence of an externally applied constant and homogeneous magnetic field is investigated at temperatures larger than the energy gap ($T\gg \omega_{c}$). It is shown that the applied magnetic field inhomogeneously penetrates the sample with a spatial periodicity depending on a wavelength that decreases with temperature. The distribution of charges in the ($T\gg \omega_{c}$)-phase acquires a periodic spatial arrangement.
