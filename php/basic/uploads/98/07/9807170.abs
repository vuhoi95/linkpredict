Title: Calabi-Yau Spaces and Five Dimensional Field Theories with Exceptional  Gauge Symmetry
Authors: Duiliu-Emanuel Diaconescu and Rami Entin
Abstract: Five dimensional field theories with exceptional gauge groups are engineered from degenerations of Calabi-Yau threefolds. The structure of the Coulomb branch is analyzed in terms of relative K\"ahler cones. For low number of flavors, the geometric construction leads to new five dimensional fixed points.
