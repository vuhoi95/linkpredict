Title: Superluminal propagation of light in gravitational field and non-causal  signals
Authors: A. D. Dolgov and I. D. Novikov
Abstract: It has been found in several papers that, because of quantum corrections, light front can propagate with superluminal velocity in gravitational fields and even in flat space-time across two conducting plates. We show that, if this is the case, closed time-like trajectories would be possible and, in particular, in certain reference frames photons could return to their source of origin before they were produced there, in contrast to the opposite claim made in the literature.
