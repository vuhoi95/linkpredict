Title: General scalar interaction in the supersymmetric FRW model
Authors: V. I. Tkach and J. J. Rosales and J. Socorro
Abstract: In this work we have constructed the most general action for a set of complex homogeneous scalar supermultiplets interacting with the scale factor in the supersymmetric FRW model. It is shown, that local conformal time supersymmetry leads to the scalar fields potential, which is defined in the same combination: K\"ahler potential and superpotential as in supergravity (or effective superstring) theories. This scalar fields potential depends on arbitrary parameter $\alpha$, which is not fixed by conformal time supersymmetry.
