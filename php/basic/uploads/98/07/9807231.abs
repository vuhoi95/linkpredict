Title: The Nambu-Goto Theory of Closed Bosonic Strings Moving in  1+3-Dimensional Minkowski Space: The Construction of the Quantum Algebra of  Observables up to Degree Five
Authors: G. Handrich and C. Nowak
Abstract: The quantum algebra of observables postulated in hep-th/9805057 is constructed up to degree five. All independent relations of degree four are given; they involve three as yet undetermined parameters. Definitions and symbols are used as introduced in the above-mentioned article.
