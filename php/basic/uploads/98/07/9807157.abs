Title: Generalized Coordinate Gauge, Nonabelian Stokes Theorem and Dual QCD  Lagrangian
Authors: V. I. Shevchenko and Yu. A. Simonov
Abstract: This paper is an extended version of hep-th/9802134. Dual QCD Lagrangian is derived by making use of the generalized coordinate gauge, where 1-form (vector potential) is expressed as an integral of the 2-form (field strength) along an (arbitrary) contour. As another application a simple proof of the nonabelian Stokes theorem is given.
