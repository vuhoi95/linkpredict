Title: AdS(3) x R as a target space for the (2,1) string theory
Authors: M. J. O'Loughlin and S. Randjbar-Daemi
Abstract: We study a target space geometry of the form $AdS_3 \times {\bf R}$ for the $(2,1)$ heterotic string. This target space arises as the near horizon limit of a solitonic configuration in 2+2 dimensions. We investigate the null isometries of this space and discuss the reduction to 1+1 dimensions of the target space geometry arising from the consistent gauging of one of these isometries.
