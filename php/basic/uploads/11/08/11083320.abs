Title: Topological stability of broken symmetry on fuzzy spheres
Authors: S. Digal and T. R. Govindarajan
Abstract: We study the spontaneous symmetry breaking of O(3) scalar field on a fuzzy sphere $S_F^2$. We find that the fluctuations in the background of topological configurations are finite. This is in contrast to the fluctuations around a uniform configuration which diverge, due to Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg-Coleman theorem, leading to the decay of the condensate. Interesting implications of enhanced topological stability of the configurations are pointed out.
