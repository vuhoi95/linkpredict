Title: Superradiance and instability of the charged Myers-Perry black holes in  the GÃ¶del Universe
Authors: R. A. Konoplya and A. Zhidenko
Abstract: We consider scalar field perturbations of the asymptotically G\"odel 5-dimensional charged rotating black holes with two equal angular momenta. It is shown that the spectrum of proper oscillations of the perturbation includes superradiant unstable modes. The reason for the instability is the confining Dirichlet boundary condition at the asymptotically far region of the G\"odel Universe. The confining box makes superradiant modes extract rotational energy from the black hole and, after repeated reflections from the black hole, grow unboundedly. A similar instability takes place for rotating black holes in the asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time.
