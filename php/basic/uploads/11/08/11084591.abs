Title: Hamiltonian analysis of symmetries in a massive theory of gravity
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Sunandan Gangopadhyay and Debraj Roy
Abstract: We construct the generator of hamiltonian gauge symmetries in a 2+1 dimensional massive theory of gravity, proposed recently, through a systematic off-shell algorithm. Using a field dependant map among gauge parameters we show that the symmetries obtained from this generator are on-shell equivalent to the Poincar\'{e} gauge symmetries. We also clarify certain subtle issues concerning the implementation of this map.
