Title: Effective gravitational couplings for cosmological perturbations in the  most general scalar-tensor theories with second-order field equations
Authors: Antonio De Felice and Tsutomu Kobayashi and Shinji Tsujikawa
Abstract: In the Horndeski's most general scalar-tensor theories the equations of scalar density perturbations are derived in the presence of non-relativistic matter minimally coupled to gravity. Under a quasi-static approximation on sub-horizon scales we obtain the effective gravitational coupling $G_{eff}$ associated with the growth rate of matter perturbations as well as the effective gravitational potential $\Phi_{eff}$ relevant to the deviation of light rays. We then apply our formulas to a number of modified gravitational models of dark energy--such as those based on f(R) theories, Brans-Dicke theories, kinetic gravity braidings, covariant Galileons, and field derivative couplings with the Einstein tensor. Our results are useful to test the large-distance modification of gravity from the future high-precision observations of large-scale structure, weak lensing, and cosmic microwave background.
