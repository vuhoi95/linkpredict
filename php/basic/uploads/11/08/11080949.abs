Title: Remarks on the renormalization of primordial cosmological perturbations
Authors: Ivan Agullo and Jose Navarro-Salas and Gonzalo J. Olmo and Leonard Parker
Abstract: We briefly review the need to perform renormalization of inflationary perturbations to properly work out the physical power spectra. We also summarize the basis of (momentum-space) renormalization in curved spacetime and address several misconceptions found in recent literature on this subject.
