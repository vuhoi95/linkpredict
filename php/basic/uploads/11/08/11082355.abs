Title: Braiding properties of the N=1 super-conformal blocks (Ramond sector)
Authors: Damian Chorazkiewicz and Leszek Hadasz and Zbigniew Jaskolski
Abstract: Using a super scalar field representation of the chiral vertex operators we develop a general method of calculating braiding matrices for all types of N=1 super-conformal 4-point blocks involving Ramond external weights. We give explicit analytic formulae in a number of cases.
