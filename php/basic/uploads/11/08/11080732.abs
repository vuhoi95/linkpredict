Title: Master Integrals for Four-Loop Massless Propagators up to  Transcendentality Weight Twelve
Authors: R. N. Lee and A. V. Smirnov and V. A. Smirnov
Abstract: We evaluate a Laurent expansion in dimensional regularization parameter $\epsilon=(4-d)/2$ of all the master integrals for four-loop massless propagators up to transcendentality weight twelve, using a recently developed method of one of the present coauthors (R.L.) and extending thereby results by Baikov and Chetyrkin obtained at transcendentality weight seven. We observe only multiple zeta values in our results. Therefore, we conclude that all the four-loop massless propagator integrals, with any integer powers of numerators and propagators, have only multiple zeta values in their epsilon expansions up to transcendentality weight twelve.
