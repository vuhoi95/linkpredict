Title: Wormholes in Dilatonic Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Theory
Authors: Panagiota Kanti and Burkhard Kleihaus and Jutta Kunz
Abstract: We construct traversable wormholes in dilatonic Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory in four spacetime dimensions, without needing any form of exotic matter. We determine their domain of existence, and show that these wormholes satisfy a generalised Smarr relation. We demonstrate linear stability with respect to radial perturbations for a subset of these wormholes.
