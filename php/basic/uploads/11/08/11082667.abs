Title: Introduction of the chemical potential in the overlap formalism
Authors: R. Narayanan and Sayantan Sharma
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of coupling a chemical potential only to the physical chiral fermions on the lattice starting from the many body state description of overlap fermions. After developing the formalism for a chiral gauge theory, we focus our attention on the case of free fermions coupled to a vector like chemical potential and discuss the issue of zero temperature divergences.
