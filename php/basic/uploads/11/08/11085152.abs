Abstract: We expand the results of arXiv:1105.5165, where a holographic description of a conformal field theory defined on a manifold with boundaries (so called BCFT) was proposed, based on AdS/CFT. We construct gravity duals of conformal field theories on strips, balls and also time-dependent boundaries. We show a holographic g-theorem in any dimension. As a special example, we can define a `boundary central charge' in three dimensional conformal field theories and our holographic g-theorem argues that it decreases under RG flows. We also computed holographic one-point functions and confirmed that their scaling property agrees with field theory calculations. Finally, we give an example of string theory embedding of this holography by inserting orientifold 8-planes in AdS(4)xCP(3).
