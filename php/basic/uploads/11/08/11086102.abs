Title: Flux Discharge Cascades in Various Dimensions
Authors: Matthew Kleban and Karthik Krishnaiyengar and Massimo Porrati
Abstract: We study the dynamics of electric flux discharge by charged particle pair or spherical string or membrane production in various dimensions. When electric flux wraps at least one compact cycle, we find that a single "pair" production event can initiate a cascading decay in real time that "shorts out" the flux and discharges many units of it. This process arises from local dynamics in the compact space, and so is invisible in the dimensionally-reduced truncation. It occurs in theories as simple as the Schwinger model on a circle, and has implications for any theory with compact dimensions and electric flux, including string theories and the string landscape.
