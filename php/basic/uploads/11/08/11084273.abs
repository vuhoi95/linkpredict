Title: Thermodynamics of Classical Systems on Noncommutative Phase Space
Authors: Mojtaba Najafizadeh and Mehdi Saadat
Abstract: We study the formulation of statistical mechanics on noncommutative classical phase space, and construct the corresponding canonical ensemble theory. For illustration, some basic and important examples are considered in the framework of noncommutative statistical mechanics: such as the ideal gas, the extreme relativistic gas, and the 3-dimensional harmonic oscillator.
