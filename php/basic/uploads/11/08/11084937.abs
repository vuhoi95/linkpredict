Title: Massive Type II in Double Field Theory
Authors: Olaf Hohm and Seung Ki Kwak
Abstract: We provide an extension of the recently constructed double field theory formulation of the low-energy limits of type II strings, in which the RR fields can depend simultaneously on the 10-dimensional space-time coordinates and linearly on the dual winding coordinates. For the special case that only the RR one-form of type IIA carries such a dependence, we obtain the massive deformation of type IIA supergravity due to Romans. For T-dual configurations we obtain a `massive' but non-covariant formulation of type IIB, in which the 10-dimensional diffeomorphism symmetry is deformed by the mass parameter.
