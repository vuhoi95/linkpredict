Title: Spectral action beyond the weak-field approximation
Authors: B. Iochum and C. Levy and D. Vassilevich
Abstract: The spectral action for a non-compact commutative spectral triple is computed covariantly in a gauge perturbation up to order 2 in full generality. In the ultraviolet regime, $p\to\infty$, the action decays as $1/p^4$ in any even dimension.
