Title: Hawking radiation of Dirac particles from black strings
Authors: Jamil Ahmed and K. Saifullah
Abstract: Hawking radiation has been studied as a phenomenon of quantum tunneling in different black holes. In this paper we extend this semi-classical approach to cylindrically symmetric black holes. Using the Hamilton-Jacobi method and WKB approximation we calculate the tunneling probabilities of incoming and outgoing Dirac particles from the event horizon and find the Hawking temperature of these black holes. We obtain results both for uncharged as well as charged particles.
