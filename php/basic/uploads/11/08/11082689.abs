Title: The remodeling conjecture and the Faber-Pandharipande formula
Authors: Vincent Bouchard and Andrei Catuneanu and Olivier Marchal and Piotr Su≈Çkowski
Abstract: In this note, we prove that the free energies F_g constructed from the Eynard-Orantin topological recursion applied to the curve mirror to C^3 reproduce the Faber-Pandharipande formula for genus g Gromov-Witten invariants of C^3. This completes the proof of the remodeling conjecture for C^3.
