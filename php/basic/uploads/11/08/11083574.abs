Title: SUSY Hidden in the Continuum
Authors: Haiying Cai and Hsin-Chia Cheng and Anibal D. Medina and John Terning
Abstract: We study models where the superpartners of the ordinary particles have continuous spectra rather than being discrete states, which can occur when the supersymmetric standard model is coupled to an approximately conformal sector. We show that when superpartners that are well into the continuum are produced at a collider they tend to have long decay chains that step their way down through the continuum, emitting many fairly soft standard model particles along the way, with a roughly spherical energy distribution in the center of mass frame.
