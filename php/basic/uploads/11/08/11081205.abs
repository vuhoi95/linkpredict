Title: Spectral function of the supersymmetry current
Authors: Jerome Gauntlett and Julian Sonner and Daniel Waldram
Abstract: We continue our study of the retarded Green's function of the universal fermionic supersymmetry current ("supercurrent") for the most general class of d=3 N=2 SCFTs with D=10 or D=11 supergravity duals by studying the propagation of the Dirac gravitino in the electrically charged AdS-Reissner-Nordstr\"om black-brane background of N=2 minimal gauged supergravity in D=4. We expand upon results presented in a companion paper, including the absence of a Fermi surface and the appearance of a soft power-law gap at zero temperature. We also present the analytic solution of the gravitino equation in the AdS_2 X R^2 background which arises as the near-horizon limit at zero temperature. In addition we determine the quasinormal mode spectrum.
