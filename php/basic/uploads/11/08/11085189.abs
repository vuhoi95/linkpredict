Abstract: Oscillator and Coulomb systems on N-dimensional spaces of constant curvature can be generalized by replacing their angular degrees of freedom with a compact integrable (N-1)-dimensional system. We present the action-angle formulation of such models in terms of theradial degree of freedom and the action-angle variables of the angular subsystem. As an example, we construct the spherical and pseudospherical generalization of the two-dimensional superintegrable models introduced by Tremblay, Turbiner and Winternitz and by Post and Winternitz. We demonstrate the superintegrability of these systems and give their hidden constant of motion.
