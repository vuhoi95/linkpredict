Title: Chirally symmetric and confining dense matter with a diffused quark  Fermi surface
Authors: L. Ya. Glozman and V. K. Sazonov and R. F. Wagenbrunn
Abstract: It is possible that at low temperatures and large density there exists a confining matter with restored chiral symmetry, just after the dense nuclear matter with broken chiral symmetry. Such a phase has sofar been studied within a confining and chirally symmetric model assuming a rigid quark Fermi surface. In the confining quarkyonic matter, however, near the Fermi surface quarks group into color-singlet baryons. Interaction between quarks leads to a diffusion of the quark Fermi surface. Here we study effects of such diffusion and verify that it does not destroy a possible existence of a confining but chirally symmetric matter at low temperatures.
