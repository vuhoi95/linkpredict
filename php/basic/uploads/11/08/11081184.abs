Title: Stability of Einstein-Kalb-Ramond Wormholes
Authors: Paul H. Cox and Benjamin C. Harms
Abstract: This paper investigates a particular type of wormhole. The wormholes studied are the result of sewing together two Reissner-Nordstrom-type black hole metrics at their horizons. By requiring the stress-energy tensor associated with this geometry to be that of a Kalb-Ramond field, we obtain the mass and Kalb-Ramond charge of the wormholes in terms of the parameters describing the mass density, tension and pressure. We show by direct calculation of the action of these wormholes that they can be made quasi-stable against tunnelling to the vacuum via gravitational instantons by a suitable choice of the parameters.
