Abstract: Adinkras are diagrams that describe many useful supermultiplets in D=1 dimensions. We show that the topology of the Adinkra is uniquely determined by a doubly even code. Conversely, every doubly even code produces a possible topology of an Adinkra. A computation of doubly even codes results in an enumeration of these Adinkra topologies up to N=28, and for minimal supermultiplets, up to N=32.
