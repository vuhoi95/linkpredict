Title: Path-Integral Bosonization of Massive Gauged Thirring Model
Authors: R. Bufalo and B. M. Pimentel
Abstract: In this work the bosonization of two-dimensional massive gauged Thirring model in the path-integral framework is presented. After completing the bosonization prescription, by the fermionic mass expansion, we perform an analysis of the strong coupling regime of the model through the transition amplitude, regarding the intention of extending the previous result about the isomorphisms, at quantum level, of the massless gauged Thirring model to the massive case.
