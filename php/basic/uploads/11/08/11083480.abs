Title: Quantum folded string in S^5 and the Konishi multiplet at strong  coupling
Authors: Matteo Beccaria and Guido Macorini
Abstract: The Konishi superconformal multiplet is an important theoretical laboratory where one can test AdS/CFT methods to compute strong coupling corrections to the spectrum of superstrings in AdS_5 x S^5. In particular, one can exploit integrability for finite charge states/operators. The multiplet ground state is a singlet operator with two simple descendants in the rank-1 sectors sl(2) and su(2) of N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. Recently, the next-to-leading quantum correction to the sl(2) state has been computed. Here, we use the algebraic curve approach to determine the correction to the other state recovering universality of the correction inside the multiplet.
