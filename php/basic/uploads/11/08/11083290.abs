Title: Form factors of twist fields in the lattice Dirac theory
Authors: P. Gavrylenko and N. Iorgov and O. Lisovyy
Abstract: We study U(1) twist fields in a two-dimensional lattice theory of massive Dirac fermions. Factorized formulas for finite-lattice form factors of these fields are derived using elliptic parametrization of the spectral curve of the model, elliptic determinant identities and theta functional interpolation. We also investigate the thermodynamic and the infinite-volume scaling limit, where the corresponding expressions reduce to form factors of the exponential fields of the sine-Gordon model at the free-fermion point.
