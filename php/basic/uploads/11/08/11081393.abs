Abstract: Three-dimensional fluids with nontrivial vorticity can be described holographically. It is well-known that the Kerr-AdS geometry gives rise to a cyclonic flow. Here we note that Taub--NUT--AdS4 geometries give rise to a rotating fluid with vortex flow. The Randers and Zermelo forms of the boundary metrics provide alternative descriptions of the fluid by inertial co-moving or by accelerated observers. Such fluids possess acoustic horizons. Moreover, light propagation on the boundary Taub--NUT fluid will encounter an optical horizon associated with closed timelike curves. In the latter case the Misner string introduces a multi-valuedness of the scalar fluctuations which can be attributed to the anyonic nature of the boundary vortex.
