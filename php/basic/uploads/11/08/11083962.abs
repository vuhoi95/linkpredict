Title: The Instabilities of Bianchi Type IX Einstein Static Universes
Authors: John D. Barrow and Kei Yamamoto
Abstract: We investigate the stability of the Einstein static universe as a non-LRS Bianchi type IX solution of the Einstein equations in the presence of both non-tilted and tilted fluids. We find that the static universe is unstable to homogeneous perturbations of Bianchi type IX to the future and the past.
