Title: Implications of String Constraints for Exotic Matter and Z' s Beyond the  Standard Model
Authors: Mirjam Cvetiƒç and James Halverson and Paul Langacker
Abstract: Global consistency of string compactifications places constraints on the chiral matter spectrum of a gauge theory which include those necessary for the absence of cubic nonabelian anomalies, but also contain some additional conditions. In the class of theories we study, some of these are present in a field theory augmented by anomalous U(1)'s and Chern-Simons terms, but some are genuinely not present in field theory. Their violation has phenomenological implications, rendering inconsistent many quiver gauge theories with the chiral matter spectrum of the MSSM. The inconsistent MSSM quivers often violate the constraints in a particular way that is suggestive of what matter must be added for consistency. The preferred matter additions are MSSM singlets with anomalous U(1) charge, hyperchargeless SU(2) triplets, quasichiral Higgs or lepton isodoublet pairs, quasichiral quark isosinglet pairs, and nonabelian singlets with charge +-1. Smaller numbers of quark isodoublet pairs, lepton pairs with charges (+- 1,+- 2), and chiral fourth families are also found. We present the results of systematic analyses including multiplicity counts of matter beyond the standard model and also study the possibility of using the singlets for a dynamical perturbative \mu-term or for neutrino mass. We also systematically study the appearance of additional non-anomalous U(1)' symmetries in the low energy theory and find that family non-universality is very common. These new physics effects may be observable at the LHC even for a large string scale close to the Planck scale.
