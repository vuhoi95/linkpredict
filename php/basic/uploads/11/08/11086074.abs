Title: Comment on "On two misconceptions in current relativistic quantum  information"
Authors: M. Montero and E. Martin-Martinez
Abstract: We show that, contrarily to the claims in [K. Bradler, (2011), arXiv:1108.5553] (and arXiv:1201.1045), the reference [Phys. Rev. A 83, 062323 (2011)] is devoid of flaws or mistakes. We show that the criticism comes from a misunderstanding of part of our work. We also discuss the claims made in arXiv:1108.5553 about entanglement measures as a valid tool in relativistic quantum information.
