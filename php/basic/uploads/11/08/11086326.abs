Title: One-loop SYM-supergravity relation for five-point amplitudes
Authors: Stephen G. Naculich and Howard J. Schnitzer
Abstract: We derive a linear relation between the one-loop five-point amplitude of N=8 supergravity and the one-loop five-point subleading-color amplitudes of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.
