Title: The Hawking-Unruh phenomenon on graphene
Authors: Alfredo Iorio and Gaetano Lambiase
Abstract: We find that, for a very specific shape of a monolayer graphene sample, a general relativistic-like description of a back-ground spacetime for graphene's conductivity electrons is very natural. The corresponding electronic local density of states is of finite temperature. This is a Hawking-Unruh effect that we propose to detect through an experiment with a Scanning Tunneling Microscope.
