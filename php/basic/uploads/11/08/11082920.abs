Title: New Static Solutions in f(T) Theory
Authors: M. Hamani Daouda and Manuel E. Rodrigues and M. J. S. Houndjo
Abstract: We consider the equations of motion of an anisotropic space-time in $f(T)$ theory, where $T$ is the torsion. New spherically symmetric solutions of black holes and wormholes are obtained with a constant torsion and the cases for which the radial pressure is proportional to a real constant, to some algebraic functions $f(T)$ and their derivatives $f_T(T)$, or vanish identically.
