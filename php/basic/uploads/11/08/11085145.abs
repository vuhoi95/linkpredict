Title: Thermodynamics of non-extremal Kaluza-Klein multi-black holes in five  dimensions
Authors: Cristian Stelea and Kristin Schleich and Donald Witt
Abstract: Using a solution-generating method, we derive an exact solution of the Einstein's field equations in five dimensions describing multi-black hole configurations. More specifically, this solution describes systems of non-extremal static black holes with Kaluza-Klein asymptotics. As expected, we find that, in general, there are conical singularities in-between the Kaluza-Klein black holes that cannot be completely eliminated. Notwithstanding the presence of these conical singularities, such solutions still exhibit interesting thermodynamical properties. By choosing an appropriate set of thermodynamic variables we show that the entropy of these objects still obeys the Bekenstein-Hawking law for spaces with Kaluza-Klein asymptotics. This extends the previously known thermodynamic description of asymptotically flat spaces with conical singularities to general spaces with Kaluza-Klein asymptotics with conical singularities. Finally, we obtain a charged generalization of this multi-black hole solution in the general Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory and show how to recover the extremal multi-black hole solution as a particular case.
