Title: Linearized Modes in Extended and Critical Gravities
Authors: Yi-Xin Chen and H. Lu and Kai-Nan Shao
Abstract: We construct explicit solutions for the linearized massive and massless spin-2, vector and scalar modes around the AdS spacetimes in diverse dimensions. These modes may arise in extended (super)gravities with higher curvature terms in general dimensions. Log modes in critical gravities can also be straightforwardly deduced. We analyze the properties of these modes and obtain the tachyon-free condition, which allows negative mass square for these modes. However, such modes may not satisfy the standard AdS boundary condition and can be truncated out from the spectrum.
