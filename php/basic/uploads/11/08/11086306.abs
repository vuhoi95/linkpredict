Title: Plasma conductivity at finite coupling
Authors: Babiker Hassanain and Martin Schvellinger
Abstract: By taking into account the full order(\alpha'^3) type IIB string theory corrections to the supergravity action, we compute the leading finite 't Hooft coupling order(\lambda^{-3/2}) corrections to the conductivity of strongly-coupled SU(N) {\cal {N}}=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma in the large N limit. We find that the conductivity is enhanced by the corrections, in agreement with the trend expected from previous perturbative weak-coupling computations.
