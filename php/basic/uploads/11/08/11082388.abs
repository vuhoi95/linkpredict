Title: Collisional Processes in Supersymmetric Plasma
Authors: Alina Czajka and Stanislaw Mrowczynski
Abstract: Collisional processes in ultrarelativistic N=1 SUSY QED plasma are studied and compared to those in an electromagnetic plasma of electrons, positrons and photons. Cross sections of all binary interactions which occur in the supersymmetric plasma at the order of e^4 are computed. Some processes, in particular the Compton scattering on selectrons, appear to be independent of momentum transfer and thus they are qualitatively different from processes in an electromagnetic plasma. It suggests that transport properties of the SUSY plasma are different than those of its non-supersymmetric counterpart. Energy loss and momentum broadening of a particle traversing the supersymmetric plasma are discussed in detail and the characteristics are shown to be surprisingly similar to those of QED plasma.
