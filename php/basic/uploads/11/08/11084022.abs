Title: A Holographic Chiral p_x + ip_y Superconductor
Authors: Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas and Dori Reichmann
Abstract: Using a string inspired model we construct gravity duals generalizing px and p_x + ip_y superconductors. Introducing a Chern-Simons coupling in the gravity side we demonstrate the ability to control which phase dominates at low temperatures, and focus on the chiral p_x + ip_y phase. We study the fermionic spectral function and establish that the behavior is rather different from the standard p-wave two-nodes model.
