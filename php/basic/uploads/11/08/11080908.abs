Title: Explicit Orbit Classification of Reducible Jordan Algebras and  Freudenthal Triple Systems
Authors: L. Borsten and M. J. Duff and S. Ferrara and A. Marrani and W. Rubens
Abstract: We determine explicit orbit representatives of reducible Jordan algebras and of their corresponding Freudenthal triple systems. This work has direct application to the classification of extremal black hole solutions of N = 2, 4 locally supersymmetric theories of gravity coupled to an arbitrary number of Abelian vector multiplets in D = 4, 5 space-time dimensions.
