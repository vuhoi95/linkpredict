Title: Inverse Scattering Construction of a Dipole Black Ring
Authors: Jorge V. Rocha and Maria J. Rodriguez and Amitabh Virmani
Abstract: Using the inverse scattering method in six dimensions we construct the dipole black ring of five dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory with dilaton coupling a = 2(2/3)^(1/2).The 5d theory can be thought of as the NS sector of low energy string theory in Einstein frame. It can also be obtained by dimensionally reducing six-dimensional vacuum gravity on a circle. Our new approach uses GL(4, R) integrability structure of the theory inherited from six-dimensional vacuum gravity. Our approach is also general enough to potentially generate dipole black objects carrying multiple rotations as well as more exotic multi-horizon configurations.
