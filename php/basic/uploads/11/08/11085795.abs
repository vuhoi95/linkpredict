Title: Equations of Motion in Double Field Theory: From Particles to Scale  Factors
Authors: Nahomi Kan and Koichiro Kobayashi and Kiyoshi Shiraishi
Abstract: In double field theory, the equation of motion for a point particle in the background field is considered. We find that the motion is described by a geodesic flow in the doubled geometry. Inspired by the analysis on the particle motion, we consider a modified model of quantum string cosmology, which includes two scale factors.
