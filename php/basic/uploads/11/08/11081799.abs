Title: Lorentz- and CPT-violating models for neutrino oscillations
Authors: Jorge S. Diaz and Alan Kostelecky
Abstract: A class of calculable global models for neutrino oscillations based on Lorentz and CPT violation is presented. One simple example matches established neutrino data from accelerator, atmospheric, reactor, and solar experiments, using only two degrees of freedom instead of the usual five. A third degree of freedom appears in the model, and it naturally generates the MiniBooNE low-energy anomalies. More involved models in this class can also accommodate the LSND anomaly and neutrino-antineutrino differences of the MINOS type. The models predict some striking signals in various ongoing and future experiments.
