Abstract: Electrostatic patch potentials give rise to forces between neutral conductors at distances in the micrometer range and must be accounted for in the analysis of Casimir force experiments. In this paper we develop a quasi-local model for describing random potentials on metallic surfaces. In contrast to some previously published results, we find that patches may provide a significant contribution to the measured signal, and may render the experimental data at distances below 1 micrometer compatible with theoretical predictions based on the Drude model.
