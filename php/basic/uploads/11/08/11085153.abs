Title: Direct test of the gauge-gravity correspondence for Matrix theory  correlation functions
Authors: Masanori Hanada and Jun Nishimura and Yasuhiro Sekino and Tamiaki Yoneya
Abstract: We study correlation functions in (0+1)-dimensional maximally supersymmetric U(N) Yang-Mills theory, which was proposed by Banks et al. as a non-perturbative definition of 11-dimensional M-theory in the infinite-momentum frame. We perform first-principle calculations using Monte Carlo simulations, and compare the results against the predictions obtained previously based on the gauge-gravity correspondence from 10 dimensions. After providing a self-contained review on these predictions, we present clear evidence that the predictions in the large-N limit actually hold even at small N such as N=2 and 3. The predicted behavior seems to continue to the far infrared regime, which goes beyond the naive range of validity of the 10D supergravity analysis. This suggests that the correlation functions also contain important information on the M-theory limit.
