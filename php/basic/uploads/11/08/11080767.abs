Title: Cyclic, ekpyrotic and little rip universe in modified gravity
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov and Diego Saez-Gomez
Abstract: We propose the reconstruction of $F(R)$ gravity in such a way that corresponding theory admits cyclic and ekpyrotic universe solutions. The number of explicit examples of such $F(R)$ model is found. The comparison with the reconstructed scalar-tensor theory is made. We also present $F(R)$ gravity which provides the little rip evolution and gives the realistic gravitational alternative for $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. The time for little rip dissolution of bound structures in such theory is estimated. We demonstrate that transformed little rip $F(R)$ solution becomes qualitatively different cosmological solution with Big Bang type singularity in Einstein frame.
