Title: 4D Localization in Randall-Sundrum 2 Supergravity and in Vasiliev  Theories
Authors: Sergio Ferrara and Massimo Porrati
Abstract: We discuss the problem of localization of 4D massless states in Randall-Sundrum 2 (one-brane) models. A Randall-Sundrum 2 construction starting from N=8 gauged supergravity in 5D Anti de Sitter space gives rise to an N=4 supergravity-matter system. We explicitly show that only the modes of the N=4 graviton supermultiplet localize on the 4D brane, streamlining and generalizing previous works. We also point out that while charged 1/4 BPS black holes do exist in the 4D theory, they are always produced in sets of total charge zero. This zero-charge configuration uplifts to a 5D metric without naked singularities, thus avoiding the curvature singularity of the 5D uplift of an isolated charged BPS black hole. Finally, we resolve a puzzle with localization of massless high spin fields on a (putative) Randall-Sundrum 2 construction based on Vasiliev's high spin theories. We show that while high spin fields do localize, the gauge symmetry that ensures decoupling of their unphysical polarizations is anomalous. This implies that the high spin fields must acquire a mass.
