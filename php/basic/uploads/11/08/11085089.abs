Title: Again on coherent states in magnetic-solenoid field
Authors: V. G. Bagrov and S. P. Gavrilov and D. M. Gitman and K. Gorska
Abstract: This article completes our study of coherent states in the so-called magnetic-solenoid field (a colinear combination of a constant uniform magnetic field and Aharonov-Bohm solenoid field) presented in JPA 2010 and 2011. Here we succeeded to prove nontrivial completeness relations for non-relativistic and relativistic coherent states in such a field. In addition, we solve here the relevant Stieltjes moment problem and present a comparative analysis of our coherent states and the well-known in the case of pure uniform magnetic field Malkin-Man'ko coherent states.
