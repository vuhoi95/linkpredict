Title: A comment on AdS collapse of a scalar field in higher dimensions
Authors: Joanna Jałmużna and Andrzej Rostworowski and Piotr Bizoń
Abstract: We point out that the weakly turbulent instability of anti-de Sitter space, recently found in arXiv:1104.3702 for four dimensional spherically symmetric Einstein-massless-scalar field equations with negative cosmological constant, is present in all dimensions $d+1$ for $d\geq 3$, contrary to a claim made in arXiv:1106.2339.
