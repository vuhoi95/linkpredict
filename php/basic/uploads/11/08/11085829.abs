Title: Chiral anomalies in superfluid hydrodynamics
Authors: Yasha Neiman and Yaron Oz
Abstract: This is a brief report of work performed in arXiv:1106.3576. We consider the chiral transport terms in a relativistic charged superfluid, and their relation to triangle anomalies. The terms allowed by the Second Law of thermodynamics have been worked out. A simplified form is proposed on heuristic grounds, from an analysis of the better-understood chiral effects in normal fluids. We point out the appearance of a "chiral electric conductivity", and relate it through an educated guess to the axial anomaly coefficient.
