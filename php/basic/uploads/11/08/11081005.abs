Title: Particles with spin in stationary flat spacetimes
Authors: Thierry Barbot and Catherine Meusburger
Abstract: We construct stationary flat three-dimensional Lorentzian manifolds with singularities that are obtained from Euclidean surfaces with cone singularities and closed one-forms on these surfaces. In the application to (2+1)-gravity, these spacetimes correspond to models containing massive particles with spin. We analyse their geometrical properties, introduce a generalised notion of global hyperbolicity and classify all stationary flat spacetimes with singularities that are globally hyperbolic in that sense. We then apply our results to (2+1)-gravity and analyse the causality structure of these spacetimes in terms of measurements by observers. In particular, we derive a condition on observers that excludes causality violating light signals despite the presence of closed timelike curves in these spacetimes.
