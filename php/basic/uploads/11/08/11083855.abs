Title: Entanglement Entropy of Black Shells
Authors: J. Robel Arenas and J. Manuel Tejeiro
Abstract: We present a coherent account of how the entanglement interpretation, thermofield dynamical description and the brick wall formulations (with the ground state correctly identified) fit into a connected and self-consistent explanation of what Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is, and where it is located.
