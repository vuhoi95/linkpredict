Title: The Berry phase in inflationary cosmology
Authors: Barun Kumar Pal and Supratik Pal and B. Basu
Abstract: We derive an analogue of the Berry phase associated with inflationary cosmological perturbations of quantum mechanical origin by obtaining the corresponding wavefunction. We have further shown that cosmological Berry phase can be completely envisioned through the observable parameters, viz. spectral indices. Finally, physical significance of this phase is discussed from the point of view of theoretical and observational aspects with some possible consequences of this quantity in inflationary cosmology.
