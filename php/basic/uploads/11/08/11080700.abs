Title: Finite size effects on the statistical angle of an electron induced dyon  in proximity to a topological insulator
Authors: Sichun Sun and Andreas Karch
Abstract: A pointlike electric charge close to the surface of a three dimensional topological insulator induces a magnetic monopole mirror charge. We study the distance dependence of the statistical angle describing this induced dyon system. We find that the total angular momentum, which sometimes is used as signature of the statistical angle, for an electron outside a finite size spherical or tube shaped topological insulator is zero for any finite distance between the electron and the surface. However, we show that in the 2-electron system one can indeed isolate a non-trivial statistical angle for intermediate size loops, that is loops much larger than the distance of the charge to the sample but much smaller than the size of the sample. The necessity for this limit confirms the 2+1 dimensional nature of the non-trivial statistical angle found in previous work. Our results clarify the conditions under which the statistical angle of this system could be measured in real experiments.
