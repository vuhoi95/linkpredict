Title: Causal Dynamical Triangulation with Extended Interactions in 1+1  Dimensions
Authors: Hiroyuki Fuji and Yuki Sato and Yoshiyuki Watabiki
Abstract: We study the Causal Dynamical Triangulation (CDT) with extended interactions in 1+1 dimensions applying the method in the non-critical string field theory (SFT) constructed by Ishibashi and Kawai. For this model, we solve Schwinger-Dyson's equation (SDE) for disk amplitude perturbatively, and find a matrix model in the continuum limit reproducing the SDE in the non-critical SFT approach as the loop equation.
