Title: The structure of N=2 supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models in AdS_4
Authors: Daniel Butter and Sergei M. Kuzenko
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the most general N=2 supersymmetric sigma models in four-dimensional anti-de Sitter space AdS_4 formulated in terms of N=1 chiral superfields. The target space is demonstrated to be a non-compact hyperkahler manifold restricted to possess a special Killing vector field which generates an SO(2) group of rotations on the two-sphere of complex structures and necessarily leaves one of them invariant. All hyperkahler cones, that is the target spaces of N=2 superconformal sigma models, prove to possess such a vector field that belongs to the Lie algebra of an isometry group SU(2) acting by rotations on the complex structures. A unique property of the N=2 sigma models constructed is that the algebra of OSp(2|4) transformations closes off the mass shell. We uncover the underlying N=2 superfield formulation for the N=2 sigma models constructed and compute the associated N=2 supercurrent. We give a special analysis of the most general systems of self-interacting N=2 tensor multiplets in AdS_4 and their dual sigma models realized in terms of N=1 chiral multiplets. We also briefly discuss the relationship between our results on N=2 supersymmetric sigma models formulated in the N=1 AdS superspace and the off-shell sigma models constructed in the N=2 AdS superspace in arXiv:0807.3368.
