Title: Wilson Lines from Representations of NQ-Manifolds
Authors: Francesco Bonechi and Jian Qiu and Maxim Zabzine
Abstract: An NQ-manifold is a non-negatively graded supermanifold with a degree 1 homological vector field. The focus of this paper is to define the Wilson loops/lines in the context of NQ-manifolds and to study their properties. The Wilson loops/lines, which give the holonomy or parallel transport, are familiar objects in usual differential geometry, we analyze the subtleties in the generalization to the NQ-setting and we also sketch some possible applications of our construction.
