Title: The Background Field Method for N = 2, d3 Super Chern-Simons-Matter  Theories
Authors: I. L. Buchbinder and N. G. Pletnev
Abstract: We develop the superfield background field method and study the effective action in the N=2, d3 supersymmetric Chern-Simons-matter systems. The one-loop low-energy effective action for non-Abelian supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory is computed to order $F^4$ by use of N = 2 superfield heat kernel techniques.
