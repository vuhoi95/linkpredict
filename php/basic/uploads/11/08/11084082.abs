Abstract: To assist in the search for phenomenologically realistic models in the string landscape, we must develop tools for investigating all gauge charges, including U(1) charges, in string models. We introduce the process for constructing fermionic string models and present an algorithm for determining the U(1) gauge states and U(1) charges in weakly-coupled free fermionic heterotic string (WCFFHS) models given their matter and non-Abelian gauge content. We determine the computational complexity of this algorithm and discuss a particular implementation that can be used in conjunction with a framework developed at Baylor University for building WCFFHS models. We also present preliminary results regarding matter state uniqueness for a run of 1.4 million gauge models and find that U(1) charges affect the number of unique matter states in a significant minority of models constructed. We conclude by considering future avenues of investigation to which this algorithm may be applied.
