Title: Inverse algorithm and M2-brane theories
Authors: Siddharth Dwivedi and P. Ramadevi
Abstract: Recent paper arXiv:1103.0553 studied the quiver gauge theories on coincident $M2$ branes on a singular toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds which are complex cone over toric Fano 3-folds. There are 18 toric Fano manifolds but only 14 toric Fano were obtained from the forward algorithm. We attempt to systematize the inverse algorithm which helps in obtaining quiver gauge theories on $M2$-branes from the toric data of the Calabi-Yau 4-folds. In particular, we obtain quiver gauge theories on coincident $M2$-branes corresponding to the remaining 4 toric Fano 3-folds. We observe that these quiver gauge theories cannot be given a dimer tiling presentation.
