Title: Entanglement in composite bosons realized by deformed oscillators
Authors: A. M. Gavrilik and Yu. A. Mishchenko
Abstract: Composite bosons (or quasibosons), as recently proven, are realizable by deformed oscillators and due to that can be effectively treated as particles of nonstandard statistics (deformed bosons). This enables us to study quasiboson states and their inter-component entanglement aspects using the well developed formalism of deformed oscillators. We prove that the internal entanglement characteristics for single two-component quasiboson are determined completely by the parameter(s) of deformation. The bipartite entanglement characteristics are generalized and calculated for arbitrary multi-quasiboson (Fock, coherent etc.) states and expressed through deformation parameter.
