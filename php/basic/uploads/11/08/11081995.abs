Title: Vector-field model with compensated cosmological constant and  radiation-dominated FRW phase
Authors: V. Emelyanov and F. R. Klinkhamer
Abstract: A special model of a massless vector-field is presented, which has an extra modified-gravity-type interaction term in the action. The cosmology of the model is studied with standard noninteracting relativistic matter added. It is found that this cosmology can have an early phase where the vector-field starts to compensate a (Planck-scale) cosmological constant and a late Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) phase where the relativistic-matter energy density dominates the dynamic vacuum energy density.
