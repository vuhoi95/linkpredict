Title: Magnetic AdS x R^2: Supersymmetry and stability
Authors: Ahmed Almuhairi and Joseph Polchinski
Abstract: We study AdS/CFT with a Kaluza-Klein magnetic field in one plane. By appropriate choice of magnetic U(1), and by balancing the magnetic field against the background D field, we obtain a supersymmetric field theory. We find the dual geometry for an AdS_5 to AdS_3 x R^2 example, and we compare the moduli spaces and entropies. For the entropy, the interactions are important even at weak coupling. We also consider nonsupersymmetric embeddings of the U(1), and show that over a regime of parameter space all known instabilities appear to be absent, aside from a dilaton tadpole that may be removed in a number of ways.
