Title: Quantization of the interior Schwarzschild black hole
Authors: Shahram Jalalzadeh and Babak Vakili
Abstract: We study a Hamiltonian quantum formalism of a spherically symmetric space-time which can be identified with the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole. The phase space of this model is spanned by two dynamical variables and their conjugate momenta. It is shown that the classical Lagrangian of the model gives rise the interior metric of a Schwarzschild black hole. We also show that the the mass of such a system is a Dirac observable and then by quantization of the model by Wheeler-DeWitt approach and constructing suitable wave packets we get the mass spectrum of the black hole.
