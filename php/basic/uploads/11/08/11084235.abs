Title: Surface Terms of Quasitopological Gravity and Thermodynamics of Charged  Rotating Black Branes
Authors: M. H. Dehghani and M. H. Vahidinia
Abstract: We introduce the surface term for quasitopological gravity in order to make the variational principle of the action well-defined. We also introduce the charged black branes of quasitopological gravity and calculate the finite action through the use of counterterm method. Then we compute the thermodynamic quantities of the black brane solution by use of Gibbs free energy and investigate the first law of thermodynamics by introducing a Smarr-type formula. Finally, we generalize our solutions to the case of rotating charged solutions.
