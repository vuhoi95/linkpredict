Authors: Susanne Barisch and Gabriel Lopes Cardoso and Michael Haack and Suresh Nampuri and Niels A. Obers
Abstract: We study static black brane solutions in the context of N = 2 U(1) gauged supergravity in four dimensions. Using the formalism of first-order flow equations, we construct novel extremal black brane solutions including examples of Nernst branes, i.e. extremal black brane solutions with vanishing entropy density. We also discuss a class of non-extremal generalizations which is captured by the first-order formalism.
