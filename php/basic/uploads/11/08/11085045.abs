Title: Topology and Flux of T-Dual Manifolds with Circle Actions
Authors: Varghese Mathai and Siye Wu
Abstract: We present an explicit formula for the topology and H-flux of the T-dual of a general type II compactification, significantly generalizing earlier results. Our results apply to T-dualities with respect to any circle action on spacetime. As before, T-duality exchanges type IIA and type IIB string theories. A new consequence is that the T-dual spacetime is a singular space when the fixed point set is non-empty; the singularities correspond to Kaluza-Klein monopoles. We propose that the Ramond-Ramond charges of type II string theories on the singular dual are classified by twisted equivariant cohomology groups. We also include the K-theory approach.
