Title: CFT Duals of Black Rings With Higher Derivative Terms
Authors: K. Goldstein and H. Soltanpanahi
Abstract: We study possible CFT duals of supersymmetric five dimensional black rings in the presence of supersymmetric higher derivative corrections to the N=2 supergravity action. A Virasoro algebra associated to an asymptotic symmetry group of solutions is defined by using the Kerr/CFT approach. We find the central charge and compute the microscopic entropy which is in precise agreement with the macroscopic entropy. Although apparently related to a different aspect of the near-horizon geometry and a different Virasoro algebra, we find that the c-extremization method leads to the same central charge and microscopic entropy computed in the Kerr/CFT approach. The relationship between these two point of view is clarified by relating the geometry to a self-dual orbifold of AdS3.
