Abstract: Effects of mass deformations on 1/2 Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) non-Abelian vortices are studied in 4d N=2 supersymmetric U(1) \times SO(2n) and U(1) \times USp(2n) gauge theories, with Nf=2n quark multiplets. The 2d N=(2,2) effective worldsheet sigma models on the Hermitian symmetric spaces SO(2n)/U(n) and USp(2n)/U(n) found recently which describe the low-energy excitations of the orientational moduli of the vortices, are generalized to the respective massive sigma models. The continuous vortex moduli spaces are replaced by a finite number (2^{n-1} or 2^{n}) of vortex solutions. The 1/2 BPS kinks connecting different vortex vacua are magnetic monopoles in the 4d theory, trapped inside the vortex core, with total configurations being 1/4 BPS composite states. These configurations are systematically studied within the semi-classical regime.
