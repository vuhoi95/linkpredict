Abstract: We study the four-point correlation function of stress-tensor supermultiplets in N=4 SYM using the method of Lagrangian insertions. We argue that, as a corollary of N=4 superconformal symmetry, the resulting all-loop integrand possesses an unexpected complete symmetry under the exchange of the four external and all the internal (integration) points. This alone allows us to predict the integrand of the three-loop correlation function up to four undetermined constants. Further, exploiting the conjectured amplitude/correlation function duality, we are able to fully determine the three-loop integrand in the planar limit. We perform an independent check of this result by verifying that it is consistent with the operator product expansion, in particular that it correctly reproduces the three-loop anomalous dimension of the Konishi operator. As a byproduct of our study, we also obtain the three-point function of two half-BPS operators and one Konishi operator at three-loop level. We use the same technique to work out a compact form for the four-loop four-point integrand and discuss the generalisation to higher loops.
