Title: Baryon-baryon scattering in the Gross-Neveu model: the large N solution
Authors: Gerald V. Dunne and Christian Fitzner and Michael Thies
Abstract: The scattering of two Dashen-Hasslacher-Neveu (DHN) baryons in the large N Gross-Neveu model is solved exactly using the relativistic, time-dependent Hartree-Fock approach. Unlike the special case of kink-antikink scattering, the scattering of DHN baryons is sensitive to the back-reaction of the fermions bound inside the baryons. Correspondingly the solution is much more complicated than the kink-antikink scattering solutions, which can be expressed in terms of sinh-Gordon solitons. Nevertheless, we present a simple ansatz form that gives closed analytic expressions for both the space-time dependent mean fields and the Dirac spinors for all continuum and bound states. The solution can also be applied to the scattering of polarons and solitons in conducting polymers.
