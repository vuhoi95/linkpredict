Title: A second-order phase transition in CDT
Authors: J. Ambjorn and S. Jordan and J. Jurkiewicz and R. Loll
Abstract: Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT) are a concrete attempt to define a nonperturbative path integral for quantum gravity. We present strong evidence that the lattice theory has a second-order phase transition line, which can potentially be used to define a continuum limit in the conventional sense of nongravitational lattice theories.
