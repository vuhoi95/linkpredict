Title: Boundary CFT from Holography
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha and Reza Fareghbal
Abstract: We explore some aspects of holographic dual of Boundary Conformal Field Theory (BCFT). In particular we study asymptotic symmetry of geometries which provide holographic dual of BCFTs. We also compute two-point functions of certain bosonic and fermionic operators in the dual BCFT by making use of AdS/BCFT correspondence.
