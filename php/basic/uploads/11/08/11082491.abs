Title: A Field Theoretic Approach to Roughness Corrections
Authors: Hua Yao Wu and Martin Schaden
Abstract: We develop a systematic field theoretic description for the roughness correction to the Casimir free energy of parallel plates. Roughness is modeled by specifying a generating functional for correlation functions of the height profile, the two-point correlation function being characterized by the variance, \sigma^2, and correlation length, \ell, of the profile. We obtain the partition function of a massless scalar quantum field interacting with the height profile of the surface via a \delta-function potential. The partition function of this model is also given by a holographic reduction to three coupled scalar fields on a two-dimensional plane. The original three-dimensional space with a parallel plate at separation 'a' is encoded in the non-local propagators of the surface fields on its boundary. Feynman rules for this equivalent 2+1-dimensional model are derived and its counter terms constructed. The two-loop contribution to the free energy of this model gives the leading roughness correction. The absolute separation to a rough plate is measured to an effective plane that is displaced a distance \rho\propto \sigma^2/\ell from the mean of its profile. This definition of the separation eliminates corrections to the free energy of order 1/a^4 and results in a unitary model. We derive an effective low-energy theory in the limit \ell\ll a. It gives the scattering matrix and effective planar surface of a very rough plate in terms of the single length scale \rho. The Casimir force on a rough plate is found to always weaken with decreasing correlation length \ell. The two-loop approximation to the free energy interpolates between the free energy of the effective low-energy model and that obtained in proximity force approximation -- the force on a very rough plate with \sigma\gtrsim 0.5\ell being weaker than on a flat plate at any separation.
