Title: Supersymmetry Breaking Triggered by Monopoles
Authors: Csaba Csaki and David Curtin and Vikram Rentala and Yuri Shirman and John Terning
Abstract: We investigate N = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories where monopole condensation triggers supersymmetry breaking in a metastable vacuum. The low-energy effective theory is an O'Raifeartaigh-like model of the kind investigated recently by Shih where the R-symmetry can be spontaneously broken. We examine several implementations with varying degrees of phenomenological interest.
