Title: Causality in noncommutative spacetime
Authors: Everton M. C. Abreu and Mario J. Neves
Abstract: In this paper we investigated the causality problem present in the recent work about the Doplicher-Fredenhagen-Roberts-Amorim (DFRA) noncommutative framework which analyzed the complex scalar field. To accomplish this task we provided a brief review of the main ingredients of the problem and we demonstrated precisely that the DFRA algebra obeys the rules of the Canonical Commutation Relations algebra. This fact permitted us to prove the form of the DFRA operators previously constructed in the usual way. After that, we introduced the solution of its Klein-Gordon equation with a source term. Its solution was accomplished through the retarded, advanced and causal Green functions constructed in this noncommutative ten dimensional DFRA spacetime. We believe that this solution constitutes the first step in the elaboration of a quantum field theory using the DFRA formalism where the noncommutative parameter is an ordinary coordinate of the system and therefore has a canonical conjugate momentum.
