Title: Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and Landau Phase Transition in Horava  Gravity
Authors: Sudipta Das and Subir Ghosh
Abstract: Presence of higher derivative terms in the Horava model of gravity can generate an instability in the Minkowski ground state. This in turn leads to a space dependent vacuum metric with a length scale determined by the higher derivative coupling coefficient. The translation invariance is spontaneously broken in the process. The phenomenon is interpreted as a form of Landau liquid-solid phase translation. The (metric) condensate acts as a source that modifies the Newtonian potential below the length scale but keeps it unchanged for sufficiently large distance.
