Title: Cosmology of Horava-Lifshitz f(R) Gravity
Authors: Sayan K. Chakrabarti and Koushik Dutta and Anjan A. Sen
Abstract: We discuss the cosmology of recently proposed Horava-Lifshitz f(R) gravity. In particular, we derive the modified Hubble equation that reduces to the standard HL gravity case in appropriate limit. We show how the bounce solutions in this theory are modified due to nonlinear effect of f(R) gravity. We also show that in principle, the Universe in this set-up can show cyclic behavior.
