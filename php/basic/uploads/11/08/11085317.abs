Title: Solutions from boundary condition changing operators in open superstring  field theory
Authors: Toshifumi Noumi and Yuji Okawa
Abstract: We construct analytic solutions of open superstring field theory in the Berkovits formulation using boundary condition changing operators under some regularity conditions, extending the previous construction in the bosonic string. We also consider the gauge-invariant observables corresponding to closed string one-point functions on the disk. We analytically calculate the gauge-invariant observables for the solutions both in the bosonic string and in the superstring and find the expected change of boundary conditions of the disk.
