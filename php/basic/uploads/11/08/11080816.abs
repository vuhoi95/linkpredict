Title: Chirality of tensor perturbations for complex values of the Immirzi  parameter
Authors: Laura Bethke and Joao Magueijo
Abstract: In this paper we generalise previous work on tensor perturbations in a de Sitter background in terms of Ashtekar variables to cover all complex values of the Immirzi parameter gamma (previous work was restricted to imaginary gamma). Particular attention is paid to the case of real gamma. Following the same approach as in the imaginary case, we can obtain physical graviton states by invoking reality and torsion free conditions. The Hamiltonian in terms of graviton states has the same form whether gamma has a real part or not; however changes occur for the vacuum energy and fluctuations. Specifically, we observe a gamma dependent chiral asymmetry in the vacuum fluctuations only if gamma has an imaginary part. Ordering prescriptions also change this asymmetry. We thus present a measurable result for CMB polarisation experiments that could shed light on the workings of quantum gravity.
