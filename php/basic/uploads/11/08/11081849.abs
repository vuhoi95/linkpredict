Title: Unbalanced Pomeransky-Sen'kov black ring
Authors: Yu Chen and Kenneth Hong and Edward Teo
Abstract: The Pomeransky-Sen'kov solution is well known to describe an asymptotically flat doubly rotating black ring in five dimensions, whose self-gravity is exactly balanced by the centrifugal force arising from the rotation in the ring direction. In this paper, we generalise this solution to the unbalanced case, in which there is in general a conical singularity in the space-time. Unlike a previous form of this solution presented in the literature, our form is much more compact. We describe in detail how this solution can be derived using the inverse-scattering method, and study its various properties. In particular, we show how various known limits can be recovered as special cases of this solution.
