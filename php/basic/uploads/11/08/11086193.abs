Abstract: We have studied a (1+2)-dimensional Lorentz-violating model which is obtained from the dimensional reduction of the nonbirefringent sector of the CPT-even electrodynamics of the standard model extension (SME). The planar theory contains a gauge sector and a scalar sector which are linearly coupled by means of a Lorentz-invariance violating (LIV) vector, $S^{\mu}$, while the kinetic terms of both sectors are affected by the components of a Lorentz-violating symmetric tensor, $\kappa^{\mu\nu}$. The energy-momentum tensor reveals that both sectors present energy stability for sufficiently small values of the Lorentz-violating parameters. The full dispersion relation equations are exactly determined and analyzed for some special configurations of the LIV backgrounds, showing that the planar model is entirely nonbirefringent at any order in the LIV parameters. At first order, the gauge and scalar sectors are described by the same dispersion relations. Finally, the equations of motion have been solved in the stationary regime and at first order in the LIV parameters. It is observed that the Lorentz-violating parameters do not alter the asymptotical behavior of the electric and magnetic fields but induce an angular dependence which is not present in Maxwell's planar theory.
