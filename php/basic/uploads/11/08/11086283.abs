Title: Three dimensional Lifshitz black hole and the Korteweg-de Vries equation
Authors: E. Abdalla and Jeferson de Oliveira and A. Lima Santos and A. B. Pavan
Abstract: We consider a solution of three dimensional New Massive Gravity with a negative cosmological constant and use the AdS/CTF correspondence to inquire about the equivalent two dimensional model at the boundary. We conclude that there should be a close relation with the Korteweg-de Vries equation.
