Title: A Holographic Flat Band
Authors: Jo√£o N. Laia and David Tong
Abstract: We describe a novel implementation of non-relativistic fermions in AdS/CFT by imposing Lorentz violating boundary conditions for a Dirac spinor in AdS4. The dual boundary theory is scale invariant and exhibits a number of interesting properties, including a dispersionless flat band of gapless excitations.
