Title: Spontaneously Induced General Relativity: Holographic Interior for  Reissner-Nordstrom Exterior
Authors: Aharon Davidson and Ben Yellin
Abstract: If general relativity is spontaneously induced, that is if the reciprocal Newton constant serves as a VEV, the electrically charged black hole limit is governed by a Davidson-Gurwich phase transition which occurs precisely at the would have been outer horizon. The transition profile which connects the exterior Reissner-Nordstrom solution with the novel interior is analytically derived. The inner core is characterized by a vanishing spatial volume and constant surface gravity, and in some respects, resembles a maximally stretched horizon. The Komar mass residing inside any concentric interior sphere is proportional to the surface area of that sphere, and consequently, is non-negative definite and furthermore non-singular at the origin. The Kruskal structure is recovered, admitting the exact Hawking imaginary time periodicity, but unconventionally, with the conic defect defused at the origin. The corresponding holographic entropy packing locally saturates the 't Hooft-Susskind-Bousso holographic bound, thus making the core Nature's ultimate information storage.
