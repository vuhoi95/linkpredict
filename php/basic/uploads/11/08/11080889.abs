Abstract: A proof that new massive gravity - the massive 3D gravity model proposed by Bergshoeff, Hohm and Townsend (BHT) - is the only unitary system at the tree level that can be constructed by augmenting planar gravity through the curvature-squared terms, is presented. Two interesting gravitational properties of the BHT model, namely, time dilation and time delay, which have no counterpart in the usual Einstein 3D gravity, are analyzed as well.
