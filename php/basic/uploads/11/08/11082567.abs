Title: Partition functions of higher spin black holes and their CFT duals
Authors: Per Kraus and Eric Perlmutter
Abstract: We find black hole solutions of D=3 higher-spin gravity in the hs[\lambda] + hs[\lambda] Chern-Simons formulation. These solutions have a spin-3 chemical potential, and carry nonzero values for an infinite number of charges of the asymptotic W_{\infty}[\lambda] symmetry. Applying a previously developed set of rules for ensuring smooth solutions, we compute the black hole partition function perturbatively in the chemical potential. At \lambda =0, 1 we compare our result against boundary CFT computations involving free bosons and fermions, and find perfect agreement. For generic \lambda\ we expect that our gravity result will match the partition function of the coset CFTs conjectured by Gaberdiel and Gopakumar to be dual to these bulk theories.
