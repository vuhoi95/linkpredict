Title: Relativistic quantum dynamics of a charged particle in cosmic string  spacetime in the presence of magnetic field and scalar potential
Authors: E. R. Figueiredo Medeiros and E. R. Bezerra de Mello
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the relativistic quantum motion of charged spin-0 and spin-1/2 particles in the presence of a uniform magnetic field and scalar potentials in the cosmic string spacetime. In order to develop this analysis, we assume that the magnetic field is parallel to the string and the scalar potentials present a cylindrical symmetry with their center on the string. Two distinct configurations for the scalar potential, $S(r)$, are considered: $(i)$ the potential proportional to the inverse of the polar distance, i.e., $S\propto1/r$, and $(ii)$ the potential proportional to this distance, i.e., $S\propto r$. The energy spectra are explicitly computed for different physical situations and presented their dependences on the magnetic field strength and scalar coupling constants.
