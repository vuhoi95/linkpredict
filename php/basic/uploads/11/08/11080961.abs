Abstract: With the help of the Drinfeld twist or factorizing F-matrix for the eight-vertex SOS model, we obtain the explicit determinant expression of the partition function of the eight-vertex model with a generic non-diagonal reflecting end and domain wall boundary condition. Our result shows that, contrary to the eight-vertex model without a reflection end, the partition function can be expressed as a single determinant.
