Title: Flowing Between Fermionic Fixed Points
Authors: Jo√£o N. Laia and David Tong
Abstract: We study holographic Wilsonian renormalization group flows for bulk spinor fields in AdS. We use this to compute the all-loop beta function for fermionic double trace operators in the dual conformal field theory.
