Title: Properties of some (3+1) dimensional vortex solutions of the CP^N model
Authors: L. A. Ferreira and P. Klimas and W. J. Zakrzewski
Abstract: We construct new classes of vortex-like solutions of the CP^N model in (3+1) dimensions and discuss some of their properties. These solutions are obtained by generalizing to (3+1) dimensions the techniques well established for the two dimensional CP^N models. We show that as the total energy of these solutions is infinite, they describe evolving vortices and anti-vortices with the energy density of some configurations varying in time. We also make some further observations about the dynamics of these vortices.
