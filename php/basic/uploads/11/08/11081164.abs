Title: Exact solution to Fick-Jacobs equation
Authors: Juan M. Romero and O. González-Gaxiola and G. Chacón-Acosta
Abstract: A relation between Fick-Jacobs and Schr\"{o}dinger equation is shown. When the diffusion coefficient is constant, exact solutions for Fick-Jacobs equation are obtained. Using a change of variable the general case is studied.
