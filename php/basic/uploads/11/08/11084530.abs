Title: Particle acceleration in Horava-Lifshitz black holes
Authors: J. Sadeghi and B. Pourhassan
Abstract: In this paper we calculate the center-of-mass energy of two colliding test particles near the rotating and non-rotating Horava-Lifshitz black hole. For the case of slowly rotating KS solution of Horava-Lifshitz black hole we compare our results with the case of Kerr black holes. We confirm the limited value of the center-of-mass energy for the static black holes and unlimited value of the center-of-mass energy for the rotating black holes. Numerically, we discuss temperature dependence of the center-of-mass energy on the black hole horizon. We obtain the critical angular momentum of particles. In this limit the center-of-mass energy of two colliding particles in the neighborhood of the rotating Horava-Lifshitz black hole could be arbitrarily high. We found appropriate conditions where the critical angular momentum could have an orbit outside the horizon. Finally, we obtain center-of-mass energy corresponding to this circle orbit.
