Title: Cosmic censorship in overcharging a Reissner-Nordstr√∂m black hole  via charged particle absorption

Abstract: There is a claim that a static charged black hole (Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole) can be overcharged by absorbing a charged test particle. If it is true, it might give a counter example to the weak cosmic censorship conjecture, which states that spacetime singularities are never observed by a distant observer. However, so far the proposed process has only been analyzed within a test particle approximation. Here we claim that the back reaction effects of a charged particle cannot be neglected when judging whether the suggested process is really a counter example to the cosmic censorship conjecture or not. Furthermore, we argue that all the back reaction effects can be properly taken into account when we consider the trajectory of a particle on the border between the plunge and bounce orbits. In such marginal cases we find that the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole can never be overcharged via the absorption of a charged particle. Since all the plunge orbits are expected to have a higher energy than the marginal orbit, we conclude that there is no supporting evidence that indicates the violation of the cosmic censorship in the proposed overcharging process.
