Title: Heterotic Bundles on Calabi-Yau Manifolds with Small Picard Number
Authors: Yang-Hui He and Maximilian Kreuzer and Seung-Joo Lee and Andre Lukas
Abstract: We undertake a systematic scan of vector bundles over spaces from the largest database of known Calabi-Yau three-folds, in the context of heterotic string compactification. Specifically, we construct positive rank five monad bundles over Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties, with the number of Kahler moduli equal to one, two, and three and extract physically interesting models. We select models which can lead to three families of matter after dividing by a freely-acting discrete symmetry and including Wilson lines. About 2000 such models on two manifolds are found.
