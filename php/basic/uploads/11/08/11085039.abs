Title: Dressed Fermions, Modular Transformations and Bosonization in the  Compactified Schwinger Model
Authors: MichaÃ«l Fanuel and Jan Govaerts
Abstract: The celebrated exactly solvable "Schwinger" model, namely massless two-dimensional QED, is revisited. The solution presented here emphasizes the non- perturbative relevance of the topological sector through large gauge transformations whose role is made manifest by compactifying space into a circle. Eventually the well-known non-perturbative features and solution of the model are recovered in the massless case. However the fermion mass term is shown to play a subtle role in order to achieve a physical quantization that accounts for gauge invariance under both small and large gauge symmetries. Quantization of the system follows Dirac's approach in an explicitly gauge invariant way that avoids any gauge fixing procedure.
