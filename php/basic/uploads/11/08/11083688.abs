Title: Finite Width in out-of-Equilibrium Propagators and Kinetic Theory
Authors: Bjorn Garbrecht and Mathias Garny
Abstract: We derive solutions to the Schwinger-Dyson equations on the Closed-Time-Path for a scalar field in the limit where backreaction is neglected. In Wigner space, the two-point Wightman functions have the curious property that the equilibrium component has a finite width, while the out-of equilibrium component has zero width. This feature is confirmed in a numerical simulation for scalar field theory with quartic interactions. When substituting these solutions into the collision term, we observe that an expansion including terms of all orders in gradients leads to an effective finite-width. Besides, we observe no breakdown of perturbation theory, that is sometimes associated with pinch singularities. The effective width is identical with the width of the equilibrium component. Therefore, reconciliation between the zero-width behaviour and the usual notion in kinetic theory, that the out-of-equilibrium contributions have a finite width as well, is achieved. This result may also be viewed as a generalisation of the fluctuation-dissipation relation to out-of-equilibrium systems with negligible backreaction.
