Title: (1,0) superconformal models in six dimensions
Authors: Henning Samtleben and Ergin Sezgin and Robert Wimmer
Abstract: We construct six-dimensional (1,0) superconformal models with non-abelian gauge couplings for multiple tensor multiplets. A crucial ingredient in the construction is the introduction of three-form gauge potentials which communicate degrees of freedom between the tensor multiplets and the Yang-Mills multiplet, but do not introduce additional degrees of freedom. Generically these models provide only equations of motions. For a subclass also a Lagrangian formulation exists, however it appears to exhibit indefinite metrics in the kinetic sector. We discuss several examples and analyze the excitation spectra in their supersymmetric vacua. In general, the models are perturbatively defined only in the spontaneously broken phase with the vev of the tensor multiplet scalars serving as the inverse coupling constants of the Yang-Mills multiplet. We briefly discuss the inclusion of hypermultiplets which complete the field content to that of superconformal (2,0) theories.
