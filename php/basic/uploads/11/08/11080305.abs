Abstract: We study a cosmological scenario in which the DBI action governing the motion of a D3-brane in a higher-dimensional spacetime is supplemented with an induced gravity term. The latter reduces to the quartic Galileon Lagrangian when the motion of the brane is non-relativistic and we show that it tends to violate the null energy condition and to render cosmological fluctuations ghosts. There nonetheless exists an interesting parameter space in which a stable phase of quasi-exponential expansion can be achieved while the induced gravity leaves non trivial imprints. We derive the exact second-order action governing the dynamics of linear perturbations and we show that it can be simply understood through a bimetric perspective. In the relativistic regime, we also calculate the dominant contribution to the primordial bispectrum and demonstrate that large non-Gaussianities of orthogonal shape can be generated, for the first time in a concrete model. More generally, we find that the sign and the shape of the bispectrum offer powerful diagnostics of the precise strength of the induced gravity.
