Title: Comments on 3d Seiberg-like dualities
Authors: Francesco Benini and Cyril Closset and Stefano Cremonesi
Abstract: We study Seiberg-like dualities in three dimensional N=2 supersymmetric theories, emphasizing Chern-Simons terms for the global symmetry group, which affect contact terms in two-point functions of global currents and are essential to the duality map. We introduce new Seiberg-like dualities for Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theories with unitary gauge groups with arbitrary numbers of matter fields in the fundamental and antifundamental representations. These dualities are derived from Aharony duality by real mass deformations. They allow to initiate the systematic study of Seiberg-like dualities in Chern-Simons quivers. We also comment on known Seiberg-like dualities for symplectic and orthogonal gauge groups and extend the latter to the Yang-Mills case. We check our proposals by showing that the localized partition functions on the squashed S^3 match between dual descriptions.
