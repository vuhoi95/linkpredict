Title: Gribov as a Phase Transition
Authors: L. C. Q. Vilar and O. S. Ventura and V. E. R. Lemes
Abstract: Our goal will be the description of a theory of Gribov's type as a physical process of phase transition in the context of a spontaneous symmetry breaking. We mainly focus at the quantum stability of the whole process.
