Title: The Hilbert basis method for D-flat directions and the superpotential
Authors: Rolf Kappl and Michael Ratz and Christian Staudt
Abstract: We discuss, using the Hilbert basis method, how to efficiently construct a complete basis for D-flat directions in supersymmetric Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories. We extend the method to discrete (R and non-R) symmetries. This facilitates the construction of a basis of all superpotential terms in a theory with given symmetries.
