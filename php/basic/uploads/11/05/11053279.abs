Title: Finite size effect on the magnon's correlation functions
Authors: Bum-Hoon Lee and Chanyong Park
Abstract: We calculate the finite size correction on the three-point correlation function between two giant magnons and one marginal operator. We also check that the structure constant in the string set-up is exactly the same as one of the RG analysis in the gauge theory.
