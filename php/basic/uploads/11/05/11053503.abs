Title: BCJ Relation of Color Scalar Theory and KLT Relation of Gauge Theory
Authors: Yi-Jian Du and Bo Feng and Chih-Hao Fu
Abstract: We present a field theoretical proof of the conjectured KLT relation which states that the full tree-level scattering amplitude of gluons can be written as a product of color-ordered amplitude of gluons and color-ordered amplitude of scalars with only cubic vertex. To give a proof we establish the KK relation and BCJ relation of color-ordered scalar amplitude using BCFW recursion relation with nonzero boundary contributions. As a byproduct, an off-shell version of fundamental BCJ relation is proved, which plays an important role in our work.
