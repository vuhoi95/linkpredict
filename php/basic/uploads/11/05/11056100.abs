Title: Josephson Junctions and AdS/CFT Networks
Authors: Elias Kiritsis and Vasilis Niarchos
Abstract: We propose a new holographic model of Josephson junctions (and networks thereof) based on designer multi-gravity, namely multi-(super)gravity theories on products of distinct asymptotically AdS spacetimes coupled by mixed boundary conditions. We present a simple model of a Josephson junction (JJ) that exhibits the well-known current-phase sine relation of JJs. In one-dimensional chains of holographic superconductors we find that the Cooper-pair condensates are described by a discretized Schrodinger-type equation. Such non-integrable equations, which have been studied extensively in the past in condensed matter and optics applications, are known to exhibit complex behavior that includes periodic and quasiperiodic solutions, chaotic dynamics, soliton and kink solutions. In our setup these solutions translate to holographic configurations of strongly-coupled superconductors in networks with weak site-to-site interactions that exhibit interesting patterns of modulated superconductivity. In a continuum limit our equations reduce to generalizations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We comment on the many possible extensions and applications of this new approach.
