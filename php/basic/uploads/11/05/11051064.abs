Title: Bulk Higgs and Gauge fields in a multiply warped braneworld model
Authors: Ashmita Das and R. S. Hundi and Soumitra SenGupta
Abstract: We readdress the problems associated with bulk Higgs and the gauge fields in a 5-dimensional Randall-Sundrum model by extending the model to six dimensions with double warping along the two extra spatial dimensions. In this 6-dimensional model we have a freedom of two moduli scales as against one modulus in the 5-dimensional model. With a little hierarchy between these moduli we can obtain the right magnitude for $W$ and $Z$ boson masses from the Kaluza-Klein modes of massive bulk gauge fields where the spontaneous symmetry breaking is triggered by bulk Higgs . We also have determined the gauge couplings of the standard model fermions with Kaluza-Klein modes of the gauge fields. Unlike the case of 5-dimensional model with a massless bulk gauge field, here we have shown that the gauge couplings and the masses of the Kaluza-Klein gauge fields satisfy the precision electroweak constraints and also obey the Tevatron bounds.
