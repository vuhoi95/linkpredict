Title: Black holes with only one Killing field
Authors: Oscar J. C. Dias and Gary T. Horowitz and Jorge E. Santos
Abstract: We present the first examples of black holes with only one Killing field. The solutions describe five dimensional AdS black holes with scalar hair. The black holes are neither stationary nor axisymmetric, but are invariant under a single Killing field which is tangent to the null generators of the horizon. Some of these solutions can be viewed as putting black holes into rotating boson stars. Others are related to the endpoint of a superradiant instability. For given mass and angular momentum (within a certain range) several black hole solutions exist.
