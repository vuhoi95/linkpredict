Title: On the black hole limit of electrically counterpoised dust  configurations
Authors: Reinhard Meinel and Moritz HÃ¼tten
Abstract: By means of a simple scaling transformation any asymptotically flat Papapetrou-Majumdar solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations corresponding to a localized regular distribution of electrically counterpoised dust can be reformulated as a one-parameter family of solutions admitting a black hole limit. In the limit, a characteristic separation of spacetimes occurs: From the exterior point of view, the extreme Reissner-Nordstrom metric outside the event horizon is formed. From the interior point of view, a regular, non-asymptotically flat (and in general non-spherically symmetric) spacetime with the extreme Reissner-Nordstrom near-horizon geometry at spatial infinity results.
