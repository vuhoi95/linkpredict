Title: Quantum moduli space of Chern-Simons quivers, wrapped D6-branes and  AdS4/CFT3
Authors: Francesco Benini and Cyril Closset and Stefano Cremonesi
Abstract: We study the quantum moduli space of N=2 Chern-Simons quivers with generic ranks and CS levels, proving along the way exact formulas for the charges of bare monopole operators. We then derive N=2 Chern-Simons quiver theories dual to AdS_4 x Y^{p,q}(CP2) M-theory backgrounds, for the whole family of Sasaki-Einstein seven-manifolds and for any value of the torsion G_4 flux. The derivation of the gauge theories relies on the reduction to type IIA string theory, in which M2-branes become D2-branes while the conical geometry maps to RR flux and D6-branes wrapped on compact four-cycles. M5-branes on torsion cycles map to flux and wrapped D4-branes. The moduli space of the quiver is shown to contain the corresponding CY_4 cone and all its crepant resolutions.
