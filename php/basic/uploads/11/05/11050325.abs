Title: Tachyon Reconstruction of Ghost Dark Energy
Authors: A. Sheykhi and M. Sadegh Movahed and E. Ebrahimi
Abstract: Recently it has been argued that a possible source for the dark energy may arise due to the contribution to the vacuum energy of the QCD ghost in a time-dependent background. In this paper we establish a connection between interacting ghost dark energy and tachyon field. It is demonstrated that the evolution of the ghost dark energy dominated universe can be described completely by a single tachyon scalar field. The potential and the dynamics of the tachyon field are reconstructed according to the evolutionary behavior of ghost energy density.
