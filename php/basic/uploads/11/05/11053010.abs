Title: Finite Energy of Black Holes in Massive Gravity
Authors: Denis Comelli and Marco Crisostomi and Fabrizio Nesti and Luigi Pilo
Abstract: In GR the static gravitational potential of a self-gravitating body goes as 1/r at large distances and any slower decrease leads to infinity energy. We show that in a class of four-dimensional massive gravity theories there exists spherically symmetric solutions with finite total energy, featuring an asymptotic behavior slower than 1/r and generically of the form $r^\gamma$. This suggests that configurations with nonstandard asymptotics may well turn out to be physical. The effect is due to an extra field coupled only gravitationally, which allows for modifications of the static potential generated by matter, while counterbalancing the apparently infinite energy budget.
