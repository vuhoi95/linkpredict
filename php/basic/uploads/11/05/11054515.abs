Title: General solution of scalar field cosmology with a (piecewise)  exponential potential
Authors: A. A. Andrianov and F. Cannata and A. Yu. Kamenshchik
Abstract: We study in detail the general solution for a scalar field cosmology with an exponential potential, correcting some imprecisions, encountered previously in the literature. In addition, we generalize this solution for a piecewise exponential potential, which is continuous, but not smooth (with cusps).
