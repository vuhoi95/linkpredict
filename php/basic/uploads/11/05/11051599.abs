Title: Kappa-Minkowski differential calculi and star product
Authors: Flavio Mercati and Andrzej Sitarz
Abstract: We present the star-product algebra of the kappa-deformation of Minkowski space and the formulation of Poincare covariant differential calculus. We use these tools to construct a twisted K-cycle over the algebra and a twisted cyclic cocycle.
