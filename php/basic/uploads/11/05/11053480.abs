Title: Towards a Loop Quantum Gravity and Yang-Mills Unification
Authors: Stephon Alexander and Antonino Marciano and Ruggero Altair Tacchi
Abstract: We propose a new method of unifying gravity and the Standard Model by introducing a spin-foam model. We realize a unification between an SU(2) Yang-Mills interaction and 3D general relativity by considering a Spin(4) Plebanski action. The theory is quantized a la spin-foam by implementing the analogue of the simplicial constraints for the broken phase of the Spin(4) SO(4) symmetry. A natural 4D extension of the theory is shown. We also present a way to recover 2-point correlation functions between the connections as a first way to implement scattering amplitudes between particle states, aiming to connect Loop Quantum Gravity to new physical predictions.
