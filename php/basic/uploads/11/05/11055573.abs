Abstract: In this paper we discuss in detail a numerical method to study resonances in membranes generated by domain walls in Randall-Sundrum-like scenarios. It is based on similar works to understand the quantum mechanics of electrons subject to the potential barriers that exist in heterostructures in semiconductors. This method was used recently to study resonances of a three form field and lately generalized to arbitrary forms. We apply it to a lot of important models, namely those that contain the Gauge, Gravity and Spinor fields. In many cases we find a rich structure of resonances which depends on the parameters involved.
