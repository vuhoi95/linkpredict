Authors: Hocine Bahlouli and El Bouazzaoui Choubabi and Ahmed Jellal
Abstract: We solve the general one-dimensional Dirac equation using a "Poincare Map" approach which avoids any approximation to the spacial derivatives and reduces the problem to a simple recursive relation which is very practical from the numerical implementation point of view. To test the efficiency and rapid convergence of this approach we apply it to a vector coupling Woods--Saxon potential, which is exactly solvable. Comparison with available analytical results is impressive and hence validates the accuracy and efficiency of this method.
