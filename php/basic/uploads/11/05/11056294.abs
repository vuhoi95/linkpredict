Title: Stringy differential geometry, beyond Riemann
Authors: Imtak Jeon and Kanghoon Lee and Jeong-Hyuck Park
Abstract: While the fundamental object in Riemannian geometry is a metric, closed string theories call for us to put a two-form gauge field and a scalar dilaton on an equal footing with the metric. Here we propose a novel differential geometry which treats the three objects in a unified manner, manifests not only diffeomorphism and one-form gauge symmetry but also O(D,D) T-duality, and enables us to rewrite the known low energy effective action of them as a single term. Further, we develop a corresponding vielbein formalism and gauge the internal symmetry which is given by a direct product of two local Lorentz groups, SO(1,D-1) times SO(1,D-1). We comment that the notion of cosmological constant naturally changes.
