Title: N=1 curves for trifundamentals
Authors: Yuji Tachikawa and Kazuya Yonekura
Abstract: We study the Coulomb phase of N=1 SU(2)^3 gauge theory coupled to one trifundamental field, and generalizations thereof. The moduli space of vacua is always one-dimensional with multiple unbroken U(1) fields. We find that the N=1 Seiberg-Witten curve which encodes the U(1) couplings is given by the double cover of a Riemann surface branched at the poles and the zeros of a meromorphic function.
