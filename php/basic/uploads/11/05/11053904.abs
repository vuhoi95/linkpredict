Title: Constructing Generalized Self-Dual Strings
Authors: Sam Palmer and Christian Saemann
Abstract: We generalize a recently developed ADHMN-like construction of self-dual string solitons using loop space. In particular, we present two extensions: The first one starts from solutions to the Basu-Harvey equation for the ABJM model, the second one starts from solutions to a corresponding BPS equation in an N=2 supersymmetric deformation of the BLG model. Both constructions yield solutions to the abelian and the nonabelian self-dual string equation transgressed to loop space. These equations might provide an effective description of M2-branes suspended between M5-branes.
