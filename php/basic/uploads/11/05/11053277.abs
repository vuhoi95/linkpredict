Title: Diamagnetism of Confined Dirac Fermions in Disordered Graphene
Authors: Ahmed Jellal and Malika Bellati and Michael Schreiber
Abstract: The diamagnetism of confined Dirac fermions submitted to a uniform magnetic field in disordered graphene is investigated. The solutions of the energy spectrum are used to discuss the orbital magnetism from a statistical mechanical point of view. More precisely, by the technique of Green functions the self-energy for short and long-ranged disorders is obtained. This allows us to determine the susceptibility for short and long-ranged disorders together with confinement. We compare our results with already published work and point out the relevance of these findings to a systematic formulation of the diamagnetism in a confining potential.
