Title: Hyperconfluent third-order supersymmetric quantum mechanics
Authors: David J Fernandez C and Encarnacion Salinas-Hernandez
Abstract: The hyperconfluent third-order supersymmetric quantum mechanics, in which all the factorization energies tend to a common value, is analyzed. It will be shown that the final potential as well can be achieved by applying consecutively a confluent second-order and a first-order SUSY transformations, both with the same factorization energy. The technique will be applied to the free particle and the Coulomb potential.
