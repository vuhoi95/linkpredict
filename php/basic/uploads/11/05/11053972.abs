Title: The Complete One-Loop Dilation Operator of N=2 SuperConformal QCD
Authors: Pedro Liendo and Elli Pomoni and Leonardo Rastelli
Abstract: We evaluate the full planar one-loop dilation operator of N=2 SuperConformal QCD, the SU(N_c) super Yang-Mills theory with N_f = 2 N_c fundamental hypermultiplets, in the flavor-singlet sector. Remarkably, the spin-chain Hamiltonian turns out to be completely fixed by superconformal symmetry, as in N=4 SYM. We present a more general calculation, for the superconformal quiver theory with SU(N_c)X SU(N_c) gauge group, which interpolates between N=2 SCQCD and the Z_2 orbifold of N=4 SYM; here symmetry fixes the Hamiltonian up to a single parameter, corresponding to the ratio of the two marginal gauge couplings.
