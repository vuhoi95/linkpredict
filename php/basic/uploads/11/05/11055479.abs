Abstract: We consider warped five-dimensional thick braneworlds with four-dimensional Poincar\'e invariance originated from bulk scalar matter non-minimally coupled to gravity plus a Gauss-Bonnet term. The background field equations as well as the perturbed equations are investigated. A relationship between 4D and 5D Planck masses is studied in general terms. By imposing finiteness of the 4D Planck mass and regularity of the geometry, the localization properties of the tensor modes of the perturbed geometry are analyzed to first order, for a wide class of solutions. In order to explore the gravity localization properties for this model, the normalizability condition for the lowest level of the tensor fluctuations is analyzed. It is found that for the examined class of solutions, gravity in 4 dimensions is recovered if the curvature invariants are regular and the 4D Planck mass is finite. It turns out that both the addition of the Gauss-Bonnet term and the non-minimal coupling between the scalar field and gravity {\it reduce} the value of the 4D Planck mass compared to its value when the scalar field and gravity are minimally coupled and the Gauss-Bonnet term is absent. The above discussed analysis depends on the explicit form of the scalar field (through its non-minimal coupling to gravity), making necessary the construction of explicit solutions in order to get results in closed form, and is illustrated with some examples which constitute smooth generalizations of the so-called Randall-Sundrum braneworld model. These solutions were obtained by making use of a detailed {\it singular perturbation theory} procedure with respect to the non-minimal coupling parameter between the scalar field and gravity, a difficult task that we managed to perform in such a way that all the physically meaningful conditions for the localization of gravity are fully satisfied. From the obtained...
