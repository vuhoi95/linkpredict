Title: Atoms and Forces of Interaction Between Elementary Particles in the  Expanding Universe
Authors: M. V. Gorbatenko and V. P. Neznamov
Abstract: The earlier developed algorithm for constructing a self-conjugate Hamiltonian in the \eta-representation for Dirac particles interacting with a general gravitational field is extended to the case of electromagnetic fields. This Hamiltonian is applied to the case when the gravitational field describes the spatially flat Friedmann model, and the electromagnetic field is the Coulomb potential extended to the case of this model. The analysis of atomic systems and electromagnetic forces of interaction under the conditions of spatially flat expansion of the universe has demonstrated that the system of atomic levels does not change with cosmological time. Spectral lines of atoms in the spatially flat Friedmann model are identical at different points of cosmological time. In this case the redshift is stipulated entirely by the growth of wavelength of photons at movement in the expending universe. At the same time force of interaction between elementary particles can change with expansion of the universe.
