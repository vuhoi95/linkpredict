Title: Fuzzy spheres at finite temperature supported by Wilson lines
Authors: Diego Rodriguez-Gomez and Jorge G. Russo
Abstract: We study the fate of the fuzzy sphere vacuum solutions in the SU(N)xSU(N+M) Klebanov-Strassler theory at finite temperature and at weak coupling. We find that thermal effects push the S^2 radius --a modulus at T=0-- towards vanishing size. We then show that the fuzzy sphere can be stabilized by adding a temporal Wilson line for a background U(1) gauge field, which can be associated with either the baryonic or the R-symmetry. Thus, upon deforming the KS theory with a background gauge field for a global symmetry, we find a phase of broken baryonic symmetry at weak coupling surviving at finite temperature.
