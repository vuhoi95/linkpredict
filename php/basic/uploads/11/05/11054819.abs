Title: Graded Fock--like representations for a system of algebraically  interacting paraparticles
Authors: K. Kanakoglou and A. Herrera-Aguilar
Abstract: We will present an algebra describing a mixed paraparticle model, known in the bibliography as "The Relative Parabose Set (\textsc{Rpbs})". Focusing in the special case of a single parabosonic and a single parafermionic degree of freedom $P_{BF}^{(1,1)}$, we will study a class of Fock--like representations of this algebra, dependent on a positive integer parameter p (a kind of generalized parastatistics order). Mathematical properties of the Fock--like modules will be investigated for all values of p and constructions such as ladder operators, irreducibility (for the carrier spaces) and Klein group gradings (for both the carrier spaces and the algebra itself) will be established.
