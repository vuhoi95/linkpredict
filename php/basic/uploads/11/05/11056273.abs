Title: Decay widths of large-spin mesons from the non-critical string/gauge  duality
Authors: J. Sadeghi and S. Heshmatian
Abstract: In this paper, we use the non-critical string/gauge duality to calculate the decay widths of large-spin mesons. Since it is believed that the string theory of QCD is not a ten dimensional theory, we expect that the non-critical versions of ten dimensional black hole backgrounds lead to better results than the critical ones. For this purpose we concentrate on the confining theories and consider two different six dimensional black hole backgrounds. We choose the near extremal AdS6 model and the near extremal KM model to compute the decay widths of large-spin mesons. Then, we present our results from these two non-critical backgrounds and compare them together with those from the critical models and experimental data.
