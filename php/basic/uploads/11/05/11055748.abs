Title: Multichannel Conformal Blocks for Polygon Wilson Loops
Authors: Amit Sever and Pedro Vieira
Abstract: We introduce the notion of Multichannel Conformal Blocks relevant for the Operator Product Expansion for Null Polygon Wilson loops with more than six edges. As an application of these, we decompose the one loop heptagon Wilson loop and predict the value of its two loop OPE discontinuities. At the functional level, the OPE discontinuities are roughly half of the full result. Using symbols they suffice to predict the full two loop result. We also present several new predictions for the heptagon result at any loop order.
