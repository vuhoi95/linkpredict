Title: Hole pairing from attraction of opposite chirality spin vortices:  Non-BCS superconductivity in Underdoped Cuprates

Abstract: Within a gauge approach to the t-J model, we propose a new, non-BCS mechanism of superconductivity for underdoped cuprates. We implement the no-double occupancy constraint with a (semionic) slave-particle formalism. The dopant generates a vortex-like quantum distortion of the AF background centered on the empty sites, with opposite chirality for cores on the two N\'eel sublattices. Empty sites are described in terms of spinless fermionic holons and the long-range attraction between spin vortices on two opposite N\'eel sublattices is the holon pairing force, leading eventually to SC. The spin fluctuations are described by bosonic spinons with a gap generated by scattering on spin vortices. Due to the occupation constraint, there is a gauge attraction between holon and spinon, binding them into a physical hole. Through gauge interaction the spin vortex attraction induces the formation of spin-singlet RVB pairs reducing the spinon gap. Lowering T, there are two crossovers as precursors of the SC transition: at the higher one a gas of holon pairs appears, reducing the hole spectral weight, while at the lower one a gas of spinon pairs also appears, giving rise to a gas of incoherent preformed hole pairs with magnetic vortices in the plasma phase, supporting a Nernst signal. At an even lower T the hole pairs become coherent and SC appears beyond a critical doping. The proposed SC mechanism is not of the BCS-type, because it involves a gain in kinetic energy (lowering of spinon gap) and it is "almost" of the classical 3D XY-type. Since both the spinon gap and the holon pairing originate from the same term in the slave-particle representation of the t-J model, this approach incorporates a strong interplay between AF and SC, giving rise to a universal relation between Tc and the energy of the resonance mode, as observed in neutron scattering experiments.
