Title: Brans-Dicke Gravity from Entropic Viewpoint
Authors: Ee Chang-Young and Kyoungtae Kimm and Daeho Lee
Abstract: We interpret the Brans-Dicke gravity from entropic viewpoint. We first apply the Verlinde's entropic formalism in the Einstein frame, then perform the conformal transformation which connects the Einstein frame to the Jordan frame. The transformed result yields the equation of motion of the Brans-Dicke theory in the Jordan frame.
