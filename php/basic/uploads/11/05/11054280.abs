Title: Dilogarithms, OPE and twisted T-duality
Authors: Marco Aldi and Reimundo Heluani
Abstract: We study the full sigma model with target the three-dimensional Heisenberg nilmanifold by means of a Hamiltonian formulation of double field theory. We show that the expected T -duality with the sigma model on a torus endowed with H-flux is a manifest symmetry of the theory. We compute correlation functions of scalar fields and show that they exhibit dilogarithmic singularities. We show how the reflection and pentagonal identities of the dilogarithm can be interpreted in terms of correlators with 4 and 5 insertions.
