Title: 1/4 BPS String Junctions and $N^3$ Problem in 6-dim (2,0) Superconformal  Theories
Authors: Stefano Bolognesi and Kimyeong Lee
Abstract: We explore 1/4 BPS objects in the Coulomb phase of the ADE-type 6-dim (2,0) superconformal theories. By using the previous work on the junctions of strings in 5-dim gauge theories and 6-dim superconformal theories, we count the number of 1/4 BPS objects, which are made of waves on selfdual strings and junctions of selfdual strings and show that for all cases the number matches exactly one third of the anomaly constant $c_G=d_G h_G$ which is the product of dimension $d_G$ and dual Coxeter number $h_G$. This suggests the long sought after $N^3$ degrees of freedom are these 1/4 BPS objects at least in the Coulomb phase.
