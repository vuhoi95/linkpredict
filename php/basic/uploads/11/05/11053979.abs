Title: F-maximization along the RG flows: a proposal
Authors: Antonio Amariti and Massimo Siani
Abstract: We propose an extension of the F-maximization principle to take into account the effects of non-superconformality. Guided by a four-dimensional analog, we formulate a modification of the free energy via the Lagrange multiplier technique. We conjecture that the Lagrange multiplier plays the same role as the coupling constant, at least at weak coupling. We check our proposal in many examples with unitary, symplectic and orthogonal gauge groups.
