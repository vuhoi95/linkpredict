Title: Universality and constant scalar curvature invariants
Authors: A A Coley and S Hervik
Abstract: A classical solution is called universal if the quantum correction is a multiple of the metric. Universal solutions consequently play an important role in the quantum theory. We show that in a spacetime which is universal all of the scalar curvature invariants are constant (i.e., the spacetime is CSI).
