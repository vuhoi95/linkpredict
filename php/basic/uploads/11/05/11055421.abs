Title: Towards an Observational Appraisal of String Cosmology
Authors: David J. Mulryne and John Ward
Abstract: We review the current observational status of string cosmology when confronted with experimental datasets. We begin by defining common observational parameters and discuss how they are determined for a given model. Then we review the observable footprints of several string theoretic models, discussing the significance of various potential signals. Throughout we comment on present and future prospects of finding evidence for string theory in cosmology, and on significant issues for the future.
