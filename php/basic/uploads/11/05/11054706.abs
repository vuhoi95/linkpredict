Title: Fluid Super-Dynamics from Black Hole Superpartners
Authors: L. G. C. Gentile and P. A. Grassi and A. Mezzalira
Abstract: Recently the Navier-Stokes equations have been derived from the duality with the black branes in AdS_5. The zero modes of black branes are reinterpreted as dynamical degrees of freedom of a conformal fluid on the boundary of AdS_5. Here, we derive the corrections to the Navier-Stokes equations due to fermionic zero modes of the black branes. We study only the contributions due to bilinears in the fermionic zero modes in the first order of the parameter expansion. The need of a superextension of the fluid dynamics is a consequence of the full AdS/CFT correspondence and yet to be investigated.
