Title: An Analogy of the Quantum Hall Condutivity in a Lorentz-symmetry  Violation Setup
Authors: L. R. Ribeiro and E. Passos and C. Furtado
Abstract: We investigated some influences of unconventional physics, such Lorentz-symmetry violation, for quantum mechanical systems. In this context, we calculated a important contribution for Standard Model Extension. In the non-relativistic limit, we obtained a analogy of the Landau levels and the quantum Hall conductivity related to this contribution for low energy systems.
