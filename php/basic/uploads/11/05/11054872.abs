Title: Period Integrals of CY and General Type Complete Intersections
Authors: Bong H. Lian and Shing-Tung Yau
Abstract: We develop a global Poincar\'e residue formula to study period integrals of families of complex manifolds. For any compact complex manifold $X$ equipped with a linear system $V^*$ of generically smooth CY hypersurfaces, the formula expresses period integrals in terms of a canonical global meromorphic top form on $X$. Two important ingredients of our construction are the notion of a CY principal bundle, and a classification of such rank one bundles. We also generalize our construction to CY and general type complete intersections. When $X$ is an algebraic manifold having a sufficiently large automorphism group $G$ and $V^*$ is a linear representation of $G$, we construct a holonomic D-module that governs the period integrals. The construction is based in part on the theory of tautological systems we have developed in the paper \cite{LSY1}, joint with R. Song. The approach allows us to explicitly describe a Picard-Fuchs type system for complete intersection varieties of general types, as well as CY, in any Fano variety, and in a homogeneous space in particular. In addition, the approach provides a new perspective of old examples such as CY complete intersections in a toric variety or partial flag variety.
