Title: Volume of Moduli Space of Vortex Equations and Localization
Authors: Akiko Miyake and Kazutoshi Ohta and Norisuke Sakai
Abstract: We evaluate volume of moduli space of BPS vortices on a compact Riemann surface by using topological field theory and localization technique developed by Moore, Nekrasov and Shatashvili. We apply this technique to Abelian (ANO) vortex and show that the volume of moduli space agrees with the previous results obtained by integrating over the moduli space metric. We extend the evaluation to non-Abelian gauge groups and multi-flavors. We also compare our results with the volume of the Kahler quotient space inspired by the brane configuration.
