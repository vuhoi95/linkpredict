Title: From N=4 gauge theory to N=2 conformal QCD: three-loop mixing of scalar  composite operators
Authors: Elli Pomoni and Christoph Sieg
Abstract: We derive the planar dilatation operator in the closed subsector of scalar composite operators of an N=2 superconformal quiver gauge theory to three loops. By tuning the ratio of its two gauge couplings we interpolate between a Z_2 orbifold of N=4 SYM theory and N=2 superconformal QCD. We find zeta(3) contributions at three loops that disappear when the theory is at the orbifold point. They are responsible for imaginary contributions to the dispersion relation of a single scalar excitation in the spin-chain picture. This points towards an interpretation of the individual scalar excitations as effective rather than as elementary magnons. We argue that the elementary excitations should be associated with certain fermions and covariant derivatives, and that integrability in the respective subsectors should persist at least to two loops.
