Title: Regge gravity from spinfoams
Authors: Elena Magliaro and Claudio Perini
Abstract: We consider spinfoam quantum gravity for general triangulations in the regime $l_P^2\ll a\ll a/\gamma$, namely in the combined classical limit of large areas $a$ and flipped limit of small Barbero-Immirzi parameter $\gamma$, where $l_P$ is the Planck length. Under few working hypotheses we find that the flipped limit enforces the constraints that turn the spinfoam theory into an effective Regge-like quantum theory with lengths as variables, while the classical limit selects among the possible geometries the ones satisfying the Einstein equations. Two kinds of quantum corrections appear in terms of powers of $l^2_P/a$ and $\gamma l_P^2/a$. The result also suggests that the Barbero-Immirzi parameter may run to smaller values under coarse-graining of the triangulation.
