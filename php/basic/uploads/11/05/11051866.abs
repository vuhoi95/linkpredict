Authors: Merab Gogberashvili and Pavle Midodashvili and Levan Midodashvili
Abstract: We investigate the problem of localization of gauge fields within the 5D standing wave braneworld model and show that in the case of increasing warp factor there exist normalizable vector field zero modes on the brane.
