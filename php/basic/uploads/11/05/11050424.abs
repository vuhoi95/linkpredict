Title: Gravitational Corrections to Fermion Masses in Grand Unified Theories
Authors: Xavier Calmet and Ting-Cheng Yang
Abstract: We reconsider quantum gravitational threshold effects to the unification of fermion masses in Grand Unified Theories. We show that the running of the Planck mass can have a sizable effect on these thresholds which are thus much more important than naively expected. These corrections make any extrapolation from low energy measurements challenging.
