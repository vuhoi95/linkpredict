Abstract: The scattering is studied using moduli space metric for well-separated vortices of non-Abelian vortices in (2+1)-dimensional U(N) gauge theories with N Higgs fields in the fundamental representation. Unlike vortices in the Abelian-Higgs model, dynamics of non-Abelian vortices has a lot of new features; The kinetic energy in real space can be transfered to that of internal orientational moduli and vice versa, the energy and charge transfer between two vortices, the scattering angle of collisions with a fixed impact parameter depends on the internal orientations, and some resonances appear due to synchronization of the orientations. Scattering of dyonic non-Abelian vortices in a mass deformed theory is also studied. We find a bound state of two vortices moving along coils around a circle, like a loop of a phone code.
