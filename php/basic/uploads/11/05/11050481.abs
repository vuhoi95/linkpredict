Title: On the Stability of Non-Supersymmetric Quantum Attractors in String  Theory
Authors: Pramod Dominic and Prasanta K. Tripathy
Abstract: We study four dimensional non-supersymmetric attractors in type IIA string theory in the presence of sub-leading corrections to the prepotential. For a given Calabi-Yau manifold, the D0-D4 system admits an attractor point in the moduli space which is uniquely specified by the black hole charges. The perturbative corrections to the prepotential do not change the number of massless directions in the black hole effective potential. We further study non-supersymmetric D0-D6 black holes in the presence of sub-leading corrections. In this case the space of attractor points define a hypersurface in the moduli space.
