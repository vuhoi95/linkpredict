Title: Hidden Order and Dynamics in Supersymmetric Valence Bond Solid States --  Super-Matrix Product State Formalism
Authors: Kazuki Hasebe and Keisuke Totsuka
Abstract: Supersymmetric valence bond solid models are extensions of the VBS model, a paradigmatic model of `solvable' gapped quantum antiferromagnets, to the case with doped fermionic holes. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of physical properties of the models. For systematic studies, a supersymmetric version of the matrix product formalism is developed. On 1D chains, we exactly evaluate the hole-doping behavior of various physical quantities, such as the spin/charge excitation spectrum, superconducting order parameter. A generalized hidden order is proposed, and the corresponding string non-local order parameter is also calculated. The behavior of the string order parameter is discussed in the light of the entanglement spectrum.
