Title: Generalized G-inflation: Inflation with the most general second-order  field equations
Authors: Tsutomu Kobayashi and Masahide Yamaguchi and Jun'ichi Yokoyama
Abstract: We study generalized Galileons as a framework to develop the most general single-field inflation models ever, Generalized G-inflation, containing yet further generalization of G-inflation, as well as previous examples such as k-inflation, extended inflation, and new Higgs inflation as special cases. We investigate the background and perturbation evolution in this model, calculating the most general quadratic actions for tensor and scalar cosmological perturbations to give the stability criteria and the power spectra of primordial fluctuations. It is pointed out in the Appendix that the Horndeski theory and the generalized Galileons are equivalent. In particular, even the non-minimal coupling to the Gauss-Bonnet term is included in the generalized Galileons in a non-trivial manner.
