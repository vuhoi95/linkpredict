Title: ABJM Baryon Stability and Myers effect
Authors: Yolanda Lozano and Marco Picos and Konstadinos Sfetsos and Konstadinos Siampos
Abstract: We consider magnetically charged baryon vertex like configurations in AdS^4 X CP^3 with a reduced number of quarks l. We show that these configurations are solutions to the classical equations of motion and are stable beyond a critical value of l. Given that the magnetic flux dissolves D0-brane charge it is possible to give a microscopical description in terms of D0-branes expanding into fuzzy CP^n spaces by Myers dielectric effect. Using this description we are able to explore the region of finite 't Hooft coupling.
