Title: Anisotropic Power Law Inflation from Rolling Tachyons
Authors: Samrat Bhowmick and Sudipta Mukherji
Abstract: We provide an explicit solution representing an anisotropic power law inflation within the framework of rolling tachyon model. This is generated by allowing a non-minimal coupling between the tachyon and the world-volume gauge field on non-BPS D3 brane. We also show that this solution is perturbatively stable.
