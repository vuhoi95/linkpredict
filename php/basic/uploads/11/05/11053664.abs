Title: Approximate Solutions of Functional Equations
Authors: Thomas Curtright and Xiang Jin and Cosmas Zachos
Abstract: Approximate solutions to functional evolution equations are constructed through a combination of series and conjugation methods, and relative errors are estimated. The methods are illustrated, both analytically and numerically, by construction of approximate continuous functional iterates for x/(1-x), sin x, and {\lambda}x(1-x). Simple functional conjugation by these functions, and their inverses, substantially improves the numerical accuracy of formal series approximations for their continuous iterates.
