Title: Color Coulomb Potential in Yang-Mills Theory from Hamiltonian Flows
Authors: Markus Leder and Hugo Reinhardt and Axel Weber and Jan M. Pawlowski
Abstract: We consider the Hamiltonian formulation of Yang-Mills theory in the Coulomb gauge and apply the recently developed technique of Hamiltonian flows. We formulate a flow equation for the color Coulomb potential which allows for a scaling solution that results in an almost linearly rising confining potential.
