Title: High-energy scalarons in R^{2} gravity as a model for Dark Matter in  galaxies
Authors: Christian Corda and Herman J. Mosquera Cuesta and Roberto Lorduy GÃ²mez
Abstract: We show that in the framework of R^{2} gravity and in the linearized approach it is possible to obtain spherically symmetric stationary states that can be used as a model for galaxies. The model can also help to have a better understanding on the theoretical basis of Einstein-Vlasov systems. Specifically, we discuss, in the linearized R^{2} gravity, the solutions of a Klein-Gordon equation for the spacetime curvature. Such solutions describe high energy scalarons, a field that in the context of galactic dynamics can be interpreted like the no-light-emitting galactic component. That is, these particles can be figured out like wave-packets showing stationary solutions in the Einstein-Vlasov system. As pertinent to the issue under analysis in this paper, we present an analysis on the gravitational lensing phenomena within this framework. Although the main goal of this paper is to give a potential solution to the Dark Matter Problem within galaxies, we add a Section where we show that an important property of the Bullet Cluster can in principle be explained in the scenario introduced in this work. To the end, we discuss the generic prospective to give rise to the Dark Matter component of most galaxies within extended gravity.
