Title: Generalized coordinate Bethe ansatz for non diagonal boundaries
Authors: N. Crampe and E. Ragoucy
Abstract: We compute the spectrum and the eigenstates of the open XXX model with non-diagonal (triangular) boundary matrices. Since the boundary matrices are not diagonal, the usual coordinate Bethe ansatz does not work anymore, and we use a generalization of it to solve the problem.
