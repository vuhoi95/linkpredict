Title: Thermodynamic of the Ghost Dark Energy Universe
Authors: Chao-Jun Feng and Xin-Zhou Li and Xian-Yong Shen
Abstract: Recently, the vacuum energy of the QCD ghost in a time-dependent background is proposed as a kind of dark energy candidate to explain the acceleration of the Universe. In this model, the energy density of the dark energy is proportional to the Hubble parameter $H$, which is the Hawking temperature on the Hubble horizon of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) Universe. In this paper, we generalized this model and choice the Hawking temperature on the so-called trapping horizon, which will coincides with the Hubble temperature in the context of flat FRW Universe dominated by the dark energy component. We study the thermodynamics of Universe with this kind of dark energy and find that the entropy-area relation is modified, namely, there is an another new term besides the area term.
