Title: On the Steady State Distributions for Turbulence
Authors: Djordje Minic and Michel Pleimling and Anne E. Staples
Abstract: We propose explicit forms for the steady state distributions governing fully developed turbulence in two and three spatial dimensions. We base our proposals on the crucial importance of the area and volume preserving diffeomorphisms in the space of velocities. We argue that these distributions can lead to the relevant (Kolmogorov and Kraichnan) scaling laws.
