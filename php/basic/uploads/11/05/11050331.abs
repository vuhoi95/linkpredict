Title: Relativistic Electron Vortex Beams: Angular Momentum and Spin-Orbit  Interaction
Authors: Konstantin Y. Bliokh and Mark R. Dennis and Franco Nori
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of electron vortex beams carrying orbital angular momentum (AM), we construct exact Bessel-beam solutions of the Dirac equation. They describe relativistic and nonparaxial corrections to the scalar electron beams. We describe the spin and orbital AM of the electron with Berry-phase corrections and predict the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in free space. This can be observed as a spin-dependent probability distribution of the focused electron vortex beams. Moreover, the magnetic moment is calculated, which shows different $g$-factors for spin and orbital AM and also contains the Berry-phase correction.
