Title: Moduli Space and Wall-Crossing Formulae in Higher-Rank Gauge Theories
Authors: Heng-Yu Chen and Nick Dorey and Kirill Petunin
Abstract: We study the interplay between wall-crossing in four-dimensional gauge theory and instanton contributions to the moduli space metric of the same theory on $\mathbb{R}^{3}\times S^{1}$. We consider $\mathcal{N}=2$ SUSY Yang--Mills with gauge group SU(n) and focus on walls of marginal stability which extend to weak coupling. By comparison with explicit field theory results we verify the Kontsevich--Soibelman formula for the change in the BPS spectrum at these walls and check the smoothness of the metric in the corresponding compactified theory. We also verify in detail the predictions for the one instanton contribution to the metric coming from the non-linear integral equations of Gaiotto, Moore and Nietzke.
