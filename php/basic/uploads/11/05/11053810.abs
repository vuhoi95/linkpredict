Title: Gravitating Q-balls in the Affleck-Dine mechanism
Authors: Takashi Tamaki and Nobuyuki Sakai
Abstract: We investigate how gravity affects "Q-balls" with the Affleck-Dine potential $V_{AD}(\phi):=\frac{m^2}{2}\phi^2[ 1+K\ln (\frac{\phi}{M})^2]$. Contrary to the flat case, in which equilibrium solutions exist only if $K<0$, we find three types of gravitating solutions as follows. In the case that $K<0$, ordinary Q-ball solutions exist; there is an upper bound of the charge due to gravity. In the case that K=0, equilibrium solutions called (mini-)boson stars appear due to gravity; there is an upper bound of the charge, too. In the case that $K>0$, equilibrium solutions appear, too. In this case, these solutions are not asymptotically flat but surrounded by Q-matter. These solutions might be important in considering a dark matter scenario in the Affleck-Dine mechanism.
