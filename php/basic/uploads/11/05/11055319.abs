Title: Counting master integrals: integration by parts vs. differential  reduction
Authors: Mikhail Yu. Kalmykov and Bernd A. Kniehl
Abstract: The techniques of integration by parts and differential reduction differ in the counting of master integrals. This is illustrated using as an example the two-loop sunset diagram with on-shell kinematics. A new algebraic relation between the master integrals of the two-loop sunset diagram that does not follow from the integration-by-parts technique is found.
