Title: Calculating the jet quenching parameter in the plasma of NCYM theory  from gauge/gravity duality
Authors: Somdeb Chakraborty and Shibaji Roy
Abstract: A particular decoupling limit of non-extremal (D1, D3) brane bound state system of type IIB string theory is known to give the gravity dual of space-space non- commutative Yang-Mills (NCYM) theory at finite temperature. We use a string probe in this background to compute the jet quenching parameter in the strongly coupled plasma of hot non-commutative Yang-Mills theory in (3+1)-dimensions from gauge/gravity duality. We give the expressions for the jet quenching parameter for both small and large non-commutativity. For small non-commutativity, we find that the value of the jet quenching parameter gets reduced from its commutative value. The reduction is enhanced with temperature as T^{7} for fixed non-commutativity and the fixed 't Hooft coupling. We further generalize the results for the non-commutative Yang-Mills theories in diverse dimensions.
