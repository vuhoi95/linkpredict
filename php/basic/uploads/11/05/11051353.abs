Title: Pulsating Strings in Lunin-Maldacena Backgrounds
Authors: Sergio Giardino and Victor Rivelles
Abstract: We consider pulsating strings in Lunin-Maldacena backgrounds, specifically in deformed Minkowski spacetime and deformed AdS_5xS^5. We find the relation between the energy and the oscillation number of the pulsating string when the deformation is small. Since the oscillation number is an adiabatic invariant it can be used to explore the regime of highly excited string states. We then quantize the string and look for such a sector. For the deformed Minkowski background we find a precise match with the classical results if the oscillation number is quantized as an even number. For the deformed AdS_5xS^5 we find a contribution which depends on the deformation parameter.
