Title: Chaotic Fast Scrambling At Black Holes
Authors: Jose L. F. Barbon and Javier M. Magan
Abstract: Fast scramblers process information in characteristic times scaling logarithmically with the entropy, a behavior which has been conjectured for black hole horizons. In this note we use the AdS/CFT fold to argue that causality bounds on information flow only depend on the properties of a single thermal cell, and admit a geometrical interpretation in terms of the optical depth, i.e. the thickness of the Rindler region in the so-called optical metric. The spatial sections of the optical metric are well approximated by constant-curvature hyperboloids. We use this fact to propose an effective kinetic model of scrambling which can be assimilated to a compact hyperbolic billiard, furnishing a classic example of hard chaos. It is suggested that classical chaos at large N is a crucial ingredient in reconciling the notion of fast scrambling with the required saturation of causality.
