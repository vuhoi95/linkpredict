Title: Applications of Subleading-color Amplitudes in N=4 SYM Theory
Authors: Stephen G. Naculich and Horatiu Nastase and Howard J. Schnitzer
Abstract: A number of features and applications of subleading color amplitudes of N=4 SYM theory are reviewed. Particular attention is given to the IR divergences of the subleading-color amplitudes, the relationships of N=4 SYM theory to N=8 supergravity, and to geometric interpretations of one-loop subleading color and N^k MHV amplitudes of N=4 SYM theory.
