Title: BPS state counting on singular varieties
Authors: Elizabeth Gasparim and Thomas KÃ¶ppe and Pushan Majumdar and Koushik Ray
Abstract: We define new partition functions for theories with targets on toric singularities via products of old partition functions on crepant resolutions. We compute explicit examples and show that the new partition functions turn out to be homogeneous on MacMahon factors.
