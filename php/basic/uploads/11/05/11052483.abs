Title: Shear viscosity, Bulk viscosity and Relaxation Times of Causal  Dissipative Relativistic Fluid-Dynamics at Finite Temperature and Chemical  Potential
Authors: Xu-Guang Huang and Tomoi Koide
Abstract: The microscopic formulas for the shear viscosity $\eta$, the bulk viscosity $\zeta$, and the corresponding relaxation times $\tau_\pi$ and $\tau_\Pi$ of causal dissipative relativistic fluid-dynamics are obtained at finite temperature and chemical potential by using the projection operator method. The non-triviality of the finite chemical potential calculation is attributed to the arbitrariness of the operator definition for the bulk viscous pressure.We show that, when the operator definition for the bulk viscous pressure $\Pi$ is appropriately chosen, the leading-order result of the ratio, $\zeta$ over $\tau_\Pi$, coincides with the same ratio obtained at vanishing chemical potential. We further discuss the physical meaning of the time-convolutionless (TCL) approximation to the memory function, which is adopted to derive the main formulas. We show that the TCL approximation violates the time reversal symmetry appropriately and leads results consistent with the quantum master equation obtained by van Hove. Furthermore, this approximation can reproduce an exact relation for transport coefficients obtained by using the f-sum rule derived by Kadanoff and Martin. Our approach can reproduce also the result in Baier et al.(2008) Ref. \cite{con} by taking into account the next-order correction to the TCL approximation, although this correction causes several problems.
