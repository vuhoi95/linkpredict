Title: Analytic Non-integrability in String Theory
Authors: Pallab Basu and Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas
Abstract: Using analytic techniques developed for Hamiltonian dynamical systems we show that a certain classical string configurations in AdS_5 x X_5 with X_5 in a large class of Einstein spaces, is non-integrable. This answers the question of integrability of string on such backgrounds in the negative. We consider a string localized in the center of AdS_5 that winds around two circles in the manifold X_5.
