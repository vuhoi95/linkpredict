Title: Theoretical constraints on brane inflation and cosmic superstring  radiation
Authors: Rhiannon Gwyn and Mairi Sakellariadou and Spyros Sypsas
Abstract: We analyze theoretical constraints on the consistency of brane inflation leading to cosmic superstring formation and on the subsequent radiation of these cosmic superstrings. We first investigate the implications of recently elucidated supergravity constraints on models of brane inflation. We show that both D3/D7 and D3/anti-D3 brane inflation are subject to non-trivial constraints. Both models can be shown to satisfy those constraints, but for the case of D3/D7 there may be important consequences for the inflationary mechanism. We then analyze the strong theoretical constraints on the types of allowed radiation by cosmic superstrings, should they be formed; such constraints do not apply to their field theoretical analogues. We argue that in a warped background where one might expect axionic radiation to be enhanced relative to gravitational radiation, neithe F-strings nor D-strings can emit axionic radiation, while FD-strings cannot give rise to Neveu-Schwarz--Neveu-Schwarz particle emission, and their Ramond-Ramond particle emission is not well-defined.
