Title: Aharonov-Bohm effect in a Class of Noncommutative Theories
Authors: A. Das and H. Falomir and J. Gamboa and F. Mendez and M. Nieto
Abstract: The Aharonov-Bohm effect including spin-noncommutative effects is considered. At linear order in $\theta$, the magnetic field is gauge invariant although spatially strongly anisotropic. Despite this anisotropy, the Schr\"odinger-Pauli equation is separable through successive unitary transformations and the exact solution is found. The scattering amplitude is calculated and compared with the usual case. In the noncommutative Aharonov-Bohm case the differential cross section is independent of $\theta$.
