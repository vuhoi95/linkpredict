Title: Spectral dimension as a probe of the ultraviolet continuum regime of  causal dynamical triangulations
Authors: Thomas P. Sotiriou and Matt Visser and Silke Weinfurtner
Abstract: We explore the ultraviolet continuum regime of causal dynamical triangulations, as probed by the flow of the spectral dimension. We set up a framework in which one can find continuum theories that can in principle fully reproduce the behaviour of the latter in this regime. In particular, we show that, in 2+1 dimensions, Hovrava-Lifshitz gravity can mimic the flow of the spectral dimension in causal dynamical triangulations to high accuracy and over a wide range of scales. This seems to provide evidence for an important connection between the two theories.
