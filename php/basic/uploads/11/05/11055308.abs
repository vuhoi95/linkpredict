Title: Stress-energy Tensor Correlators of a Quantum Field in Euclidean $R^N$  and $AdS^N$ spaces via the generalized zeta-function method
Authors: H. T. Cho and B. L. Hu
Abstract: In this paper we calculate the vacuum expectation values of the stress-energy bitensor of a massive quantum scalar field with general coupling to N-dimensional Euclidean spaces and hyperbolic spaces which are Euclidean sections of the anti-de Sitter (AdS) spaces. These correlators, also known as the noise kernel, act as sources in the Einstein-Langevin equations of stochastic gravity [1,2] which govern the induced metric fluctuations beyond the mean-field dynamics described by the semiclassical Einstein equations of semiclassical gravity. Because these spaces are maximally symmetric the eigenmodes have analytic expressions which facilitate the computation of the zeta-function [3,4]. Upon taking the second functional variation of the generalized zeta function introduced in [5] we obtain the correlators of the stress tensor for these two classes of spacetimes. Both the short and the large geodesic distance limits of the correlators are presented for dimensions up to 11. We mention current research problems in early universe cosmology, black hole physics and gravity-fluid duality where these results can be usefully applied to.
