Title: Large non-Gaussianity in non-minimal inflation
Authors: Jinn-Ouk Gong and Hyun Min Lee
Abstract: We consider a simple inflation model with a complex scalar field coupled to gravity non-minimally. Both the modulus and the angular directions of the complex scalar are slowly rolling, leading to two-field inflation. The modulus direction becomes flat due to the non-minimal coupling, and the angular direction becomes a pseudo-Goldstone boson from a small breaking of the global U(1) symmetry. We show that large non-Gaussianity can be produced during slow-roll inflation under a reasonable assumption on the initial condition of the angular direction. This scenario may be realized in particle physics models such as the Standard Model with two Higgs doublets.
