Title: Integrable achiral D5-brane reflections and asymptotic Bethe equations
Authors: Diego H. Correa and Vidas Regelskis and Charles A. S. Young
Abstract: We study the reflection of magnons from a D5-brane in the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We consider two possible orientations of the D5-brane with respect to the reference vacuum state, namely vacuum states aligned along "vertical" and "horizontal" directions. We show that the reflections are of the achiral type. We also show that the reflection matrices satisfy the boundary Yang-Baxter equations for both orientations. In the horizontal case the reflection matrix can be interpreted in terms of a bulk S-matrix, S(p, -p), and factorizability of boundary scattering therefore follows from that of bulk scattering. Finally, we solve the nested coordinate Bethe ansatz for the system in the vertical case to find the Bethe equations. In the horizontal case, the Bethe equations are of the same form as those for the closed string.
