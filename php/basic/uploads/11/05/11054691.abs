Abstract: In this paper we have considered the dynamics of an anomalous ($g\neq 2$) charged relativistic spinning particle in the presence of an external electromagnetic field. The constraint analysis is done and the complete set of Dirac brackets are provided that generate the canonical Lorentz algebra and dynamics through Hamiltonian equations of motion. The spin-induced effective curvature of spacetime and its possible connection with Analogue Gravity models are commented upon.
