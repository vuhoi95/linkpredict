Title: Navier-Stokes Equation by Stochastic Variational Method
Authors: T. Koide and T. Kodama
Abstract: We show for the first time that the stochastic variational method can naturally derive the Navier-Stokes equation starting from the action of ideal fluid. In the frame work of the stochastic variational method, the dynamical variables are extended to stochastic quantities. Then the effect of dissipation is realized as the direct consequence of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The present result reveals the potential availability of this approach to describe more general dissipative processes.
