Title: An Effective Theory of Superfluid Turbulence from Local Scale Invariance
Authors: Siddhartha Sen and Koushik Ray
Abstract: We construct a three-dimensional locally scale invariant version of the free Schroedinger field theory. It is shown to provide an effective theory of superfluid turbulence in Helium IV.
