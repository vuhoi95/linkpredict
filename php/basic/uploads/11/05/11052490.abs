Title: Theta term in a bounded region
Authors: Fabrizio Canfora and Luigi Rosa and Jorge Zanelli
Abstract: We analyse the physical implications of adding a topological density term $\theta Tr(F\wedge F)$ to a gauge theory in a bounded region. In particular, we calculate the Casimir effect on a spherical region and we show that the result is not periodic in $\theta$, contrary to what would be expected for a true topological density. The topological nature of the $\theta$-term can be restored if an additional boundary term required by the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer theorem is included. Then, the periodicity is trivially restored because the resulting Casimir energy is independent of $\theta$. The results of the present work suggest that the observable effects of the $\theta$-term could be very small even without assuming $\theta$ itself to be small.
