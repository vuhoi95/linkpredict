Title: The gravity/CFT correspondence
Authors: Henrique Gomes and Sean Gryb and Tim Koslowski and Flavio Mercati
Abstract: General Relativity can be formulated in terms of a spatially Weyl invariant gauge theory called Shape Dynamics. Using this formulation, we establish a "bulk/bulk" duality between gravity and a Weyl invariant theory on spacelike Cauchy hypersurfaces. This duality has two immediate consequences: i) it leads trivially to a corresponding "bulk/boundary" duality between General Relativity and a boundary CFT, and ii) the boundary can be defined in a gauge-invariant way. Moreover, the corresponding bulk/boundary duality is sufficient to explain a large portion of the evidence in favor of gauge/gravity duality and provides independent evidence for the AdS/CFT correspondence.
