Abstract: HYPERDIRE is a project devoted to the creation of a set of Mathematica based programs for the differential reduction of hypergeometric functions. The current version includes two parts: one, pfq, is relevant for manipulations of hypergeometric functions_{p+1}F_p, and the second one, AppellF1F4, for manipulations with Appell hypergeometric functions F_1,F_2,F_3,F_4 of two variables.
