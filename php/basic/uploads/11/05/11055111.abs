Abstract: This work deals with the presence of defect structures in models described by real scalar field in a diversity of scenarios. The defect structures which we consider are static solutions of the equations of motion which depend on a single spatial dimension. We search for different models, which support the same defect solution, with the very same energy density. We work in flat spacetime, where we introduce and investigate a new class of models. We also work in curved spacetime, within the braneworld context, with a single extra dimension of infinite extent, and there we show how the brane is formed from the static field configuration.
