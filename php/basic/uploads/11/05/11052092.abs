Abstract: A new numerical method for performing the Nahm transform for charge $k=2$ caloron is presented. The Weyl equations with boundary impurities are solved directly and the determination of the appropriate basis to the linear system is established. The action densities of the 2-calorons with 10 moduli parameters are shown.
