Title: Defrosting in an Emergent Galileon Cosmology
Authors: Laurence Perreault Levasseur and Robert Brandenberger and Anne-Christine Davis
Abstract: We study the transition from an Emergent Galileon condensate phase of the early universe to a later expanding radiation phase. This "defrosting" or "preheating" transition is a consequence of the excitation of matter fluctuations by the coherent Galileon condensate, in analogy to how preheating in inflationary cosmology occurs via the excitation of matter fluctuations through coupling of matter with the coherent inflaton condensate. We show that the "minimal" coupling of matter (modeled as a massless scalar field) to the Galileon field introduced by Creminelli, Nicolis and Trincherini in order to generate a scale-invariant spectrum of matter fluctuations is sufficient to lead to efficient defrosting, provided that the effects of the non-vanishing expansion rate of the universe are taken into account. If we neglect the effects of expansion, an additional coupling of matter to the Galileon condensate is required. We study the efficiency of the defrosting mechanism in both cases.
