Abstract: In this work, we derive a recently proposed Abelian model to describe the interaction of correlated monopoles, center vortices, and dual fields in three dimensional SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. Following recent polymer techniques, special care is taken to obtain the end-to-end probability for a single interacting center vortex, which constitutes a key ingredient to represent the ensemble integration.
