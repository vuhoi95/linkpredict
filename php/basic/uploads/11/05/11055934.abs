Title: Degrees of freedom of $f(T)$ gravity
Authors: Miao Li and Rong-Xin Miao and Yan-Gang Miao
Abstract: We investigate the Hamiltonian formulation of $f(T)$ gravity and find that there are five degrees of freedom. The six first class constraints corresponding to the local Lorentz transformation in Teleparallel gravity become second class constraints in $f(T)$ gravity, which leads to the appearance of three extra degrees of freedom and the violation of the local Lorentz invariance in $f(T)$ gravity. In general, there are $D-1$ extra degrees of freedom for $f(T)$ gravity in $D$ dimensions, and this implies that the extra degrees of freedom correspond to one massive vector field or one massless vector field with one scalar field.
