Title: 3D-partition functions on the sphere: exact evaluation and mirror  symmetry
Authors: Sergio Benvenuti and Sara Pasquetti
Abstract: We study N = 4 quiver theories on the three-sphere. We compute partition functions using the localisation method by Kapustin et al. solving exactly the matrix integrals at finite N, as functions of mass and Fayet-Iliopoulos parameters. We find a simple explicit formula for the partition function of the quiver tail T(SU(N)). This formula opens the way for the analysis of star-shaped quivers and their mirrors (that are the Gaiotto-type theories arising from M5 branes on punctured Riemann surfaces). We provide non-perturbative checks of mirror symmetry for infinite classes of theories and find the partition functions of the TN theory, the building block of generalised quiver theories.
