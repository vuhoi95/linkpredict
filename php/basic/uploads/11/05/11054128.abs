Title: Achiral boundaries and the twisted Yangian of the D5-brane
Authors: Niall MacKay and Vidas Regelskis
Abstract: We consider integrable field theories with achiral boundary conditions and uncover the underlying achiral twisted Yangian algebra. This construction arises from old work on the bosonic principal chiral model on a half-line, but finds a modern realization as the hidden symmetry in the planar limit of the scattering of worldsheet excitations of the AdS/CFT light-cone superstring off a D5-brane.
