Authors: C. R. Das and L. V. Laperashvili and H. B. Nielsen and A. Tureanu
Abstract: A talk presents a new cosmological model with superstring-inspired $E_6$ unification, broken at the early stage of the Universe into $SO(10)\times U(1)_Z$ -- into the ordinary world, and $SU(6)'\times SU(2)'_{\theta}$ -- into the hidden world.
