Title: Einstein Equations from Riemann-only Gravitational Actions
Authors: Durmus A. Demir and Oktay Dogangun and Tonguc Rador and Selin Soysal
Abstract: In pure affine formalism for gravitation, we construct invariant actions constructed solely from the Riemann tensor. We do this by generalizing the notion of determinant to higher rank tensor fields. In regard to reducing to Einstein-Hilbert action in arbitrary dimensions, we show that Riemann-only actions are more natural than those based on the Ricci tensor. In spacetimes with torsion, we construct a dynamical equation for Riemann tensor itself, and show that it embodies the usual gravitational field equations.
