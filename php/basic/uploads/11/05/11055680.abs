Title: Interacting Ghost Dark Energy in Brans-Dicke Theory
Authors: Esmaeil Ebrahimi and Ahmad Sheykhi
Abstract: We investigate the QCD ghost model of dark energy in the framework of Brans-Dicke cosmology. First, we study the non-interacting ghost dark energy in a flat Brans-Dicke theory. In this case we obtain the EoS and the deceleration parameters and a differential equation governing the evolution of ghost energy density. Interestingly enough, we find that the EoS parameter of the non-interacting ghost dark energy can cross the phantom line ($w_D=-1$) provided the parameters of the model are chosen suitably. Then, we generalize the study to the interacting ghost dark energy in both flat and non-flat Brans-Dicke framework and find out that the transition of $w_D$ to phantom regime can be more easily achieved for than when resort to the Einstein field equations is made.
