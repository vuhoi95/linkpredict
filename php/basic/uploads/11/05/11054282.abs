Title: Calabi-Yau threefolds in weighted flag varieties
Authors: Muhammad Imran Qureshi and Balazs Szendroi
Abstract: We review the construction of families of projective varieties, in particular Calabi--Yau threefolds, as quasilinear sections in weighted flag varieties. We also describe a construction of tautological orbi-bundles on these varieties, which may be of interest in heterotic model building.
