Title: Renormalisation of heavy-light light ray operators
Authors: Michael Knoedlseder and Nils Offen
Abstract: We calculate the renormalisation of different light ray operators with one light degree of freedom and a static heavy quark. Both $2\to2$- and $2\to3$-kernels are considered. A comparison with the light-light case suggests that the mixing with three-particle operators is solely governed by the light degrees of freedom. Additionally we show that conformal symmetry is already broken at the level of the one loop counterterms due to the additional UV-renormalisation of a cusp in the two contributing Wilson-lines. This general feature can be used to fix the $2\to2$-renormalisation kernels up to a constant. Some examples for applications of our results are given.
