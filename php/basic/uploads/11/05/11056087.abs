Title: The vanishing volume of D=4 superspace
Authors: G. Bossard and P. S. Howe and K. S. Stelle and P. Vanhove
Abstract: The volume of on-shell D=4, N=8 superspace is shown to vanish. Despite this, it is shown that there is a fully supersymmetric and duality-invariant candidate d^8 R^4 counterterm corresponding to an anticipated seven-loop logarithmic divergence in D=4. We construct this counterterm explicitly and also give the complete nonlinear extension of the 1/8-BPS d^6 R^4 invariant. Similar results are derived for N=4,5 & 6.
