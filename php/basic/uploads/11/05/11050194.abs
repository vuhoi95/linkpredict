Title: From Quantum Gravity to Quantum Field Theory via Noncommutative Geometry
Authors: Johannes Aastrup and Jesper M. Grimstrup
Abstract: A link between canonical quantum gravity and fermionic quantum field theory is established in this paper. From a spectral triple construction which encodes the kinematics of quantum gravity semi-classical states are constructed which, in a semi-classical limit, give a system of interacting fermions in an ambient gravitational field. The interaction involves flux tubes of the gravitational field. In the additional limit where all gravitational degrees of freedom are turned off, a free fermionic quantum field theory emerges.
