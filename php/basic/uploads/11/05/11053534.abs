Authors: Hisaki Hatanaka and Makoto Sakamoto and Kazunori Takenaga
Abstract: We discuss the gauge-Higgs unification in a framework of Lifshitz type gauge theory. We study a higher dimensional gauge theory on R^{D-1}\times S^{1} in which the normal second (first) order derivative terms for scalar (fermion) fields in the action are replaced by higher order derivative ones for the direction of the extra dimension. We provide some mathematical tools to evaluate a one-loop effective potential for the zero mode of the extra component of a higher dimensional gauge field and clarify how the higher order derivative terms affect the standard form of the effective potential. Our results show that they can make the Higgs mass heavier and change its vacuum expectation value drastically. Some extensions of our framework are briefly discussed.
