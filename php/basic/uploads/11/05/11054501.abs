Title: Teichm√ºller spaces as degenerated symplectic leaves in  Dubrovin--Ugaglia Poisson manifolds
Authors: Leonid Chekhov and Marta Mazzocco
Abstract: In this paper we study the Goldman bracket between geodesic length functions both on a Riemann surface $\Sigma_{g,s,0}$ of genus $g$ with $s=1,2$ holes and on a Riemann sphere $\Sigma_{0,1,n}$ with one hole and $n$ orbifold points of order two. We show that the corresponding Teichm\"uller spaces $\mathcal T_{g,s,0}$ and $\mathcal T_{0,1,n}$ are realised as real slices of degenerated symplectic leaves in the Dubrovin--Ugaglia Poisson algebra of upper--triangular matrices $S$ with 1 on the diagonal.
