Title: Goldstino superfields for spontaneously broken N=2 supersymmetry
Authors: S. M. Kuzenko and I. N. McArthur
Abstract: We examine spontaneously broken N=2 supersymmetry in four dimensions and associate a spinor superfield with each Goldstino via a finite supersymmetry transformation with parameters that are the Grassmann coordinates of N=2 superspace. Making use of a special choice of coset parametrization allows us to develop a version of nonlinearly realized N=2 supersymmetry for which the associated Goldstino superfields are defined on harmonic superspace, thereby providing a natural mechanism for construction of a Goldstino action. The corresponding superfield Lagrangian is an O(4) multiplet. This property is used to reformulate the Goldstino action in projective superspace and in conventional N=2 superspace. We show how to generate matter couplings of the Goldstinos to supersymmetric matter using the N=2 harmonic, projective and full superspaces. As a bi-product of our consideration, we also derive an N=2 chiral Goldstino action.
