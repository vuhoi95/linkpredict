Title: N=1 vacua in Exceptional Generalized Geometry
Authors: Mariana Gra√±a and Francesco Orsi
Abstract: We study N=1 Minkowski vacua in compactifications of type II string theory in the language of exceptional generalized geometry (EGG). We find the differential equations governing the EGG analogues of the pure spinors of generalized complex geometry, namely the structures which parameterize the vector and hypermultiplet moduli spaces of the effective four-dimensional N=2 supergravity obtained after compactification. In order to do so, we identify a twisted differential operator that contains NS and RR fluxes and transforms covariantly under the U-duality group, E7(7). We show that the conditions for N=1 vacua correspond to a subset of the structures being closed under the twisted derivative.
