Abstract: The general solution of Einstein's gravity equation in $D$ dimensions for an anisotropic and spherically symmetric matter distribution is calculated in a bulk with position dependent cosmological constant. Results for $n$ concentric $(D-2)-$branes with arbitrary mass, radius and pressure with different cosmological constant between branes are found. It is shown how the difference between the cosmological constant contributes to the effective mass of each brane, and it is also shown that the equation of state for each brane influences the dynamics of branes, which can be divided into eras according to the dominant matter. This scenario can be used to model the universe in the D=5 case, which may presents a richer phenomenology than the current models. The evolution law of the branes is studied, and the anisotropic pressure that remove divergences is found. The Randall-Sundrum metric in an outside region in the flat branes limit is also derived.
