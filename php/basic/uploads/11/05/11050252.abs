Authors: Weijian Wang and Feichao Tian and Zheng-Mao Sheng
Abstract: The higgsstrahlung process $e^+e^-\to Z H$ and pair production process $e^+e^- \to H H$ are studied in the framework of the minimal noncommutative (NC) standard model. In particular, the Feynman rules involving all orders of the noncommutative parameter $\theta$ are derived using reclusive formation of Seiberg-Witten map. It is shown that the total cross section and angular distribution can be significantly affected because of spacetime noncommutativity when the collision energy exceeds to 1 \tev. It is found that in each process, there is an optimal collision energy ($E_{oc}$) for achieving the greatest noncommutative effect, and $E_{oc}$ varies linearly with the NC scale $\Lambda_{NC}$. A brief discussion on the process $e^+e^- \to\mu^+ \mu^-$ is also given.
