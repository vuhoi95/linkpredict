Title: The dynamical origin of the refinement of the Gribov-Zwanziger theory
Authors: D. Dudal and S. P. Sorella and N. Vandersickel
Abstract: In recent years, the Gribov-Zwanziger action was refined by taking into account certain dimension 2 condensates. In this fashion, one succeeded in bringing the gluon and the ghost propagator obtained from the GZ model in qualitative and quantitative agreement with the lattice data. In this paper, we shall elaborate further on this aspect. First, we shall show that more dimension 2 condensates can be taken into account than considered so far and, in addition, we shall give firm evidence that these condensates are in fact present by discussing the effective potential. It follows thus that the Gribov-Zwanziger action dynamically transforms itself into the refined version, thereby showing that the continuum nonperturbative Landau gauge fixing, as implemented by the Gribov-Zwanziger approach, is consistent with lattice simulations.
