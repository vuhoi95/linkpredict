Title: Higher Curvature Gravity and the Holographic fluid dual to flat  spacetime
Authors: Goffredo Chirco and Christopher Eling and Stefano Liberati
Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated that one can construct a (d+2) dimensional solution of the vacuum Einstein equations that is dual to a (d+1) dimensional fluid satisfying the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. In one important example, the fluid lives on a fixed timelike surface in the flat Rindler spacetime associated with an accelerated observer. In this paper, we show that the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio of the fluid takes the universal value 1/4\pi in a wide class of higher curvature generalizations to Einstein gravity. Unlike the fluid dual to asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes, here the choice of gravitational dynamics only affects the second order transport coefficients. We explicitly calculate these in five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and discuss the implications of our results.
