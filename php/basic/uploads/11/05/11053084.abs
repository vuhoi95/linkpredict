Title: Three-point Correlation functions of Giant magnons with finite size
Authors: Changrim Ahn and Plamen Bozhilov
Abstract: We compute holographic three-point correlation functions or structure constants of a zero-momentum dilaton operator and two (dyonic) giant magnon string states with a finite-size length in the semiclassical approximation. We show that the semiclassical structure constants match exactly with the three-point functions between two su(2) magnon single trace operators with finite size and the Lagrangian in the large 't Hooft coupling constant limit. A special limit J>>sqrt(lambda) of our result is compared with the relevant result based on the L\"uscher corrections.
