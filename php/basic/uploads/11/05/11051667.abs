Title: W(1+infinity) algebra as a symmetry behind AGT relation
Authors: Shoichi Kanno and Yutaka Matsuo and Shotaro Shiba
Abstract: We give some evidences which imply that W(1+infinity) algebra describes the symmetry behind AGT(-W) conjecture: a correspondence between the partition function of N=2 supersymmetric quiver gauge theories and the correlators of Liouville (Toda) field theory.
