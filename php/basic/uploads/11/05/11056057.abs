Title: Comments on Lumps from RG flows
Authors: Theodore Erler and Carlo Maccaferri
Abstract: In this note we investigate the proposal of Ellwood and one of the authors et al. to construct a string field theory solution describing the endpoint of an RG flow from a reference BCFT to a target BCFT*. We show that the proposed class of solutions suffers from an anomaly in the equations of motion. Nevertheless, the gauge invariant action exactly reproduces the expected shift in energy.
