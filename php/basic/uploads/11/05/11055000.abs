Title: Phase transitions in AdS soliton spacetime through marginally stable  modes
Authors: Rong-Gen Cai and Xi He and Huai-Fan Li and Hai-Qing Zhang
Abstract: We investigate the marginally stable modes of the scalar (vector) perturbations in the AdS soliton background coupled to electric field. In the probe limit, we find that the marginally stable modes can reveal the onset of the phase transitions of this model. The critical chemical potentials obtained from this approach are in good agreement with the previous numerical or analytical results.
