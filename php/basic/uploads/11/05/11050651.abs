Abstract: The dilaton-gravity sector of a linear in the scalar curvature, scale invariant Two Measures Field Theory (TMT), is explored in detail in the context of closed FRW cosmology and shown to allow stable emerging universe solutions. The model possesses scale invariance which is spontaneously broken due to the intrinsic features of the TMT dynamics. We study the transition from the emerging phase to inflation, and then to a zero cosmological constant phase. We also study the spectrum of density perturbations and the constraints that impose on the parameters of the theory.
