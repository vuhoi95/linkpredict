Title: A Very Light Dilaton
Authors: Benjam√≠n Grinstein and Patipan Uttayarat
Abstract: We present a completely perturbative model that displays behavior similar to that of walking technicolor. In one phase of the model RG-trajectories run towards an IR-fixed point but approximate scale invariance is spontaneously broken before reaching the fixed point. The trajectories then run away from it and a light dilaton appears in the spectrum. The mass of the dilaton is controlled by the "distance" of the theory to the critical surface, and can be adjusted to be arbitrarily small without turning off the interactions. There is a second phase with no spontaneous symmetry breaking and hence no dilaton, and in which RG trajectories do terminate at the IR-fixed point.
