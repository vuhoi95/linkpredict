Title: T-dual-coordinate dependence makes the effective Kalb-Ramond field  nontrivial
Authors: Lj. Davidović and B. Sazdović
Abstract: We show that the fact that the string theory is unoriented does not necessarily force the Kalb-Ramond field to vanish. We investigated the theory of the open string propagating in the weakly curved background. The effective Kalb-Ramond field $B^{eff}_{\mu\nu}$, the background field of the effective theory obtained on the solution of the boundary conditions, does not depend on the $\Omega$-even effective coordinate $q$, but on its T-dual $\tilde{q}$ which is $\Omega$-odd. This brakes the standard proof that the term with $B_{\mu\nu}^{eff}$ should vanish. From the world-sheet equations of motion we identify $B_{\mu\nu}^{eff}$ with the torsion potential.
