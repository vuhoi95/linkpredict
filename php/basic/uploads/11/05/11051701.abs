Authors: Merab Gogberashvili and Pavle Midodashvili and Levan Midodashvili
Abstract: We investigate scalar and tensor fields in the brane model solution for the 5D space-time with standing gravitational waves in the bulk and show that even in the case of increasing warp factor there exist normalizable zero modes localized on the brane.
