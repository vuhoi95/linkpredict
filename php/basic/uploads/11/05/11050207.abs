Authors: Edmund J. Copeland and Levon Pogosian and Tanmay Vachaspati
Abstract: We review the existence, formation and properties of cosmic strings in string theory, the wide variety of observational techniques that are being employed to detect them, and the constraints that current observations impose on string theory models.
