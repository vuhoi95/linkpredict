Title: Correlations of the stress-energy tensor in AdS spaces via the  generalized zeta-function method
Authors: H. T. Cho and B. L. Hu
Abstract: We calculate the vacuum expectation values of the stress-energy bitensor of a minimally coupled massless scalar field in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spaces. These correlators, also known as the noise kernel, act as sources in the Einstein-Langevin equations of stochastic gravity [1,2] which govern the induced metric fluctuations beyond the mean-field dynamics described by the semiclassical Einstein equations of semiclassical gravity. Because the AdS spaces are maximally symmetric the eigenmodes have analytic expressions which facilitate the computation of the zeta-function [3,4]. Upon taking the second functional variation of the generalized zeta function introduced in [5] we obtain the correlators of the stress tensor. Both the short and the long geodesic distance limits of the correlators are presented.
