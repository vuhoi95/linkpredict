Title: N=1 supersymmetric extension of the baby Skyrme model
Authors: C. Adam and J. M. Queiruga and J. Sanchez-Guillen and A. Wereszczynski
Abstract: We construct a method to supersymmetrize higher kinetic terms and apply it to the baby Skyrme model. We find that there exist N=1 supersymmetric extensions for baby Skyrme models with arbitrary potential.
