Abstract: We study the phase diagram of a holographic QCD using the probe D7 brane in black D3 geometry with finite D-instanton charge. Due to quasi-confining nature of the geometry, baryon vertex can exist outside the horizon so that we can find D7 brane embeddings with finite baryon density and finite chiral condensation as well as an embedding where only quarks are possible but chiral condensation can be zero or non-zero. We study the phase transition and phase diagram between these phases. We also calculated constituent quark mass and binding energy of baryons as fucntion of the density.
