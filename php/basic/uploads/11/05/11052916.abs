Title: Quantum Gravity and Dark Matter
Authors: Chiu Man Ho and Djordje Minic and Y. Jack Ng
Abstract: We propose a connection between global physics and local galactic dynamics via quantum gravity. The salient features of cold dark matter (CDM) and modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) are combined into a unified scheme by introducing the concept of MONDian dark matter which behaves like CDM at cluster and cosmological scales but emulates MOND at the galactic scale.
