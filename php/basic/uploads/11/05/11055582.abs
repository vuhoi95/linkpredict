Title: Lattice quantum gravity - an update
Authors: J. Ambjorn and J. Jurkiewicz and R. Loll
Abstract: We advocate lattice methods as the tool of choice to constructively define a background-independent theory of Lorentzian quantum gravity and explore its physical properties in the Planckian regime. The formulation that arguably has most furthered our understanding of quantum gravity (and of various pitfalls present in the nonperturbative sector) uses dynamical triangulations to regularize the nonperturbative path integral over geometries. Its Lorentzian version in terms of Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT) - in addition to having a definite quantum signature on short scales - has been shown to reproduce important features of the classical theory on large scales. This article recaps the most important developments in CDT of the last few years for the physically relevant case of four spacetime dimensions, and describes its status quo at present.
