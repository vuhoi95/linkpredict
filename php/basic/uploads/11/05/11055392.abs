Title: Flux Periodicities and Quantum Hair on Holographic Superconductors
Authors: Marc Montull and Oriol Pujolas and Alberto Salvio and Pedro J. Silva
Abstract: Superconductors in a cylindrical geometry respond periodically to a cylinder-threading magnetic flux, with the period changing from hc/2e to hc/e depending on whether the Aharonov-Bohm effects are suppressed or not. We show that Holographic Superconductors present a similar phenomenon, and that the different periodicities follow from classical no-hair theorems. We also give the Ginzburg-Landau description of the period-doubling phenomenon.
