Title: 3d Partition Function as Overlap of Wavefunctions
Authors: Tatsuma Nishioka and Yuji Tachikawa and Masahito Yamazaki
Abstract: We compute the partition function on S^3 of 3d N=4 theories which arise as the low-energy limit of 4d N=4 super Yang-Mills theory on a segment or on a junction, and propose its 1d interpretation. We show that the partition function can be written as an overlap of wavefunctions determined by the boundary conditions. We also comment on the connection of our results with the 4d superconformal index and the 2d q-deformed Yang-Mills theory.
