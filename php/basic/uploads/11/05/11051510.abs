Abstract: We establish the existence of fixed points for certain gauge theories candidate to be magnetic duals of QCD with one adjoint Weyl fermion. In the perturbative regime of the magnetic theory the existence of a very large number of fixed points is unveiled. We classify them by analyzing their basin of attraction. The existence of several nonsupersymmetric fixed points for the magnetic gauge theory lends further support towards the existence of gauge-gauge duality beyond supersymmetry. We also discover that among these very many fixed points there are supersymmetric ones emerging from a generic nonsupersymmetric renormalization group flow. We therefore conclude that supersymmetry naturally emerges as a fixed point theory from a nonsupersymmetric Lagrangian without the need for fine-tuning of the bare couplings. Our results suggest that supersymmetry can be viewed as an emergent phenomenon in field theory. In particular there should be no need for fine-tuning the bare couplings when performing Lattice simulations aimed to investigate supersymmetry on the Lattice.
