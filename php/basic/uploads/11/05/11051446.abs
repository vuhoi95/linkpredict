Title: Canonical brackets from continuous symmetries: Abelian 2-form gauge  theory
Authors: Saurabh Gupta and R. Kumar
Abstract: We derive the canonical (anti-)commutation relations amongst the creation and annihilation operators of the various basic fields, present in the four (3 + 1)-dimensional (4D) free Abelian 2-from gauge theory, with the help of continuous symmetry transformations within the framework of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism. We show that all the six continuous symmetries of the theory lead to the exactly the same non-vanishing (anti-)commutator amongst the creation and annihilation operators of the normal mode expansion of the basic fields of the theory.
