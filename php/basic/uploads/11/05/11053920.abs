Title: The Matsubara-Fradkin Thermodynamical Quantization of Podolsky  Electrodynamics
Authors: C. A. Bonin and B. M. Pimentel
Abstract: In this work we apply the Matsubara-Fradkin formalism and the Nakanishi's auxiliary field method to the quantization of the Podolsky electrodynamics in thermodynamic equilibrium. This approach allows us to write consistently the path integral representation for the partition function of gauge theories in a simple manner. Furthermore, we find the Dyson-Schwinger-Fradkin equations and the Ward-Fradkin-Takahashi identities for the Podolsky theory. We also write the most general form for the polarization tensor in thermodynamic equilibrium.
