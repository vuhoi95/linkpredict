Title: Stellar spectroscopy: Fermions and holographic Lifshitz criticality
Authors: Sean A. Hartnoll and Diego M. Hofman and David Vegh
Abstract: Electron stars are fluids of charged fermions in Anti-de Sitter spacetime. They are candidate holographic duals for gauge theories at finite charge density and exhibit emergent Lifshitz scaling at low energies. This paper computes in detail the field theory Green's function G^R(w,k) of the gauge-invariant fermionic operators making up the star. The Green's function contains a large number of closely spaced Fermi surfaces, the volumes of which add up to the total charge density in accordance with the Luttinger count. Excitations of the Fermi surfaces are long lived for w <~ k^z. Beyond w ~ k^z the fermionic quasiparticles dissipate strongly into the critical Lifshitz sector. Fermions near this critical dispersion relation give interesting contributions to the optical conductivity.
