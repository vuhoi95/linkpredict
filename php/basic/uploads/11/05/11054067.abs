Title: An N=8 superconformal particle in the half-plane
Authors: Olaf Lechtenfeld and Francesco Toppan
Abstract: By imposing global supersymmetry and scale invariance we construct an N=8 superconformal mechanical system based on the inhomogeneous (2,8,6) linear multiplet. The unique action describes a special K"ahler sigma model with a Calogero-type potential and Fayet-Iliopoulos terms. The classical dynamics of the two propagating bosons is restricted to a (warped) half-plane and bounded. We numerically inspect typical trajectories of this special particle.
