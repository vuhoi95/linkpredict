Title: Fermionic structure in the sine-Gordon model: form factors and  null-vectors
Authors: Michio Jimbo and Tetsuji Miwa and Fedor Smirnov
Abstract: The form factor bootstrap in integrable quantum field theory allows one to capture local fields in terms of infinite sequences of Laurent polynomials called `towers'. For the sine-Gordon model, towers are systematically described by fermions introduced some time ago by Babelon, Bernard and Smirnov. Recently the authors developed a new method for evaluating one-point functions of descendant fields, using yet another fermions which act on the space of local fields. The goal of this paper is to establish that these two fermions are one and the same object. This opens up a way for answering the longstanding question about how to identify precisely towers and local fields.
