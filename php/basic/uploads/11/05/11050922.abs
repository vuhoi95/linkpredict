Title: Testing General Relativity using the Environmental Dependence of Dark  Matter Halos
Authors: Gong-Bo Zhao and Baojiu Li and Kazuya Koyama
Abstract: In this Letter, we investigate the environmental dependence of dark matter halos in theories that attempt to explain the accelerated expansion of the Universe by modifying general relativity (GR). Using high-resolution N-body simulations in f(R) gravity models which recover GR in dense environments by virtue of the chameleon mechanism, we find a strong environmentally-dependent difference between the lensing mass and dynamical mass estimates of dark matter halos. This environmental dependence of the halo properties can be used as a smoking gun to test GR observationally.
