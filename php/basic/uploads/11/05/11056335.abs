Title: Black holes and black branes in Lifshitz spacetimes
Authors: Javier Tarrio and Stefan Vandoren
Abstract: We construct analytic solutions describing black holes and black branes in asymptotically Lifshitz spacetimes with arbitrary dynamical exponent z and for arbitrary number of dimensions. The model considered consists of Einstein gravity with negative cosmological constant, a scalar, and N U(1) gauge fields with dilatonic-like couplings. We study the phase diagrams and thermodynamic instabilities of the solution, and find qualitative differences between the cases with 1<= z<2, z=2 and z>2.
