Title: Towards a 4d/2d correspondence for Sicilian quivers
Authors: Lotte Hollands and Christoph A. Keller and Jaewon Song
Abstract: We study the 4d/2d AGT correspondence between four-dimensional instanton counting and two-dimensional conformal blocks for generalized SU(2) quiver gauge theories coming from punctured Gaiotto curves of arbitrary genus. We propose a conformal block description that corresponds to the elementary SU(2) trifundamental half-hypermultiplet, and check it against Sp(1)-SO(4) instanton counting.
