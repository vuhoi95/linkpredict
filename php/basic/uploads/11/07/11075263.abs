Title: Chiral symmetry breaking in Hamiltonian QCD in Coulomb gauge
Authors: Markus Pak and Hugo Reinhardt
Abstract: Spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is investigated in the Hamiltonian approach to QCD in Coulomb gauge. The quark wave functional is determined by the variational principle using an ansatz which goes beyond the commonly used BCS-type of wave functionals and includes the coupling of the quarks to the transversal spatial gluons. Using the lattice gluon propagator as input it is shown that the low energy chiral properties of the quarks, like the quark condensate and the constituent quark mass, are substantially increased by the coupling of the quarks to the spatial gluons. Our results compare favourably with the phenomenological values.
