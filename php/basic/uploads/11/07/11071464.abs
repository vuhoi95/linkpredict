Abstract: We generalize the framework in arXiv:1104.5502 to the case that an embedding may have a nonvanishing intrinsic curvature. Directly employing the Brown-York stress tensor as the fundamental variables, we study the effect of finite perturbations of the extrinsic curvature while keeping the intrinsic metric fixed. We show that imposing a Petrov type I condition on the hypersurface geometry may reduce to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation for a fluid moving in spatially curved spacetime in the near-horizon limit.
