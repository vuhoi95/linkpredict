Abstract: We present an analytical method, rooted in the non-perturbative renormalization group, that allows one to calculate the critical exponents and the correlation and response functions of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) growth equation in all its different regimes, including the strong-coupling one. We analyze the symmetries of the KPZ problem and derive an approximation scheme that satisfies the linearly realized ones. We implement this scheme at the minimal order in the response field, and show that it yields a complete, qualitatively correct phase diagram in all dimensions, with reasonable values for the critical exponents in physical dimensions. We also compute in one dimension the full (momentum and frequency dependent) correlation function, and the associated universal scaling functions. We find an excellent quantitative agreement with the exact results from Praehofer and Spohn (J. Stat. Phys. 115 (2004)). We emphasize that all these results, which can be systematically improved, are obtained with sole input the bare action and its symmetries, without further assumptions on the existence of scaling or on the form of the scaling function.
