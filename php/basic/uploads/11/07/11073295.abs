Title: Super $w_{\infty}$ 3-algebra
Authors: Min-Ru Chen and Ke Wu and Wei-Zhong Zhao
Abstract: We investigate the super high-order Virasoro 3-algebra. By applying the appropriate scaling limits on the generators, we obtain the super $w_{\infty}$ 3-algebra which satisfies the generalized fundamental identity condition. We also define a super Nambu-Poisson bracket which satisfies the generalized skewsymmetry, Leibniz rule and fundamental identity. By means of this super Nambu-Poisson bracket, the realization of the super $w_{\infty}$ 3-algebra is presented.
