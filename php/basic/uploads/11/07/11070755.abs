Title: Gravity on a Little Warped Space
Authors: Damien P. George and Kristian L. McDonald
Abstract: We investigate the consistent inclusion of 4D Einstein gravity on a truncated slice of AdS_5 whose bulk-gravity and UV scales are much less than the 4D Planck scale, M_* << M_{Pl}. Such "Little Warped Spaces" have found phenomenological utility and can be motivated by string realizations of the Randall-Sundrum framework. Using the interval approach to brane-world gravity, we show that the inclusion of a large UV-localized Einstein-Hilbert term allows one to consistently incorporate 4D Einstein gravity into the low-energy theory. We detail the spectrum of Kaluza-Klein metric fluctuations and, in particular, examine the coupling of the little radion to matter. Furthermore, we show that Goldberger-Wise stabilization can be successfully implemented on such spaces. Our results demonstrate that realistic low-energy effective theories can be constructed on these spaces, and have relevance for existing models in the literature.
