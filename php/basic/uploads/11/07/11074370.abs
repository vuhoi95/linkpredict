Title: Supersymmetric K field theories and defect structures
Authors: C. Adam and J. M. Queiruga and J. Sanchez-Guillen and A. Wereszczynski
Abstract: We construct supersymmetric K field theories (i.e., theories with a non-standard kinetic term) in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions such that the bosonic sector just consists of a nonstandard kinetic term plus a potential. Further, we study the possibility of topological defect formation in these supersymmetric models. Finally, we consider more general supersymmetric K field theories where, again, topological defects exist in some cases.
