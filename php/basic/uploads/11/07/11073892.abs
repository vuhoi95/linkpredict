Title: Fermion spectrum and localization on kinks in a deconstructed dimension
Authors: Nahomi Kan and Koichiro Kobayashi and Kiyoshi Shiraishi
Abstract: We study the deconstructed scalar theory having nonlinear interactions and being renormalizable. It is shown that the kink-like configurations exist in such models. The possible forms of Yukawa coupling are considered. We find the degeneracy in mass spectrum of fermions coupled to the nontrivial scalar configuration.
