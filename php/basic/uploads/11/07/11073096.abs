Title: Charged Dilatonic AdS Black Branes in Arbitrary Dimensions
Authors: Per Berglund and Jishnu Bhattacharyya and David Mattingly
Abstract: We study electromagnetically charged dilatonic black brane solutions in arbitrary dimensions with flat transverse spaces, that are asymptotically AdS. This class of solutions includes spacetimes which possess a bulk region where the metric is approximately invariant under Lifshitz scalings. Given fixed asymptotic boundary conditions, we analyze how the behavior of the bulk up to the horizon varies with the charges and derive the extremality conditions for these spacetimes.
