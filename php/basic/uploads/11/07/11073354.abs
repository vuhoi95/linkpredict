Title: Thermodynamics of Rotating Lovelock-Lifshitz Black Branes
Authors: M. H. Dehghani and Sh. Asnafi
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of rotating Lovelock-Lifshitz black branes. We calculate the conserved and thermodynamic quantities of the solutions and obtain a relation between temperature, angular velocity, energy density, entropy density and angular momentum density. We, also, obtain a Smarr-type formula for the energy density as a function of entropy and angular momentum densities, and show that the thermodynamic quantities calculated in this paper satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. Finally, we investigate the stability of black brane solutions in both canonical and grand-canonical ensemble. We find that the solutions are thermally stable for the solutions with $z\leq n-1$, while they can be unstable for $z>n-1$.
