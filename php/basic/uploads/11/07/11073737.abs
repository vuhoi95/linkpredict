Abstract: The propagation of electromagnetic waves in a Lorentz-symmetry violating scenario where there is a region of polarized vacuum is studied. It turns out that the photon field acquires an interesting polarization state, possibly useful to set up upper bounds in Lorentz-violating models at laboratory scales.
