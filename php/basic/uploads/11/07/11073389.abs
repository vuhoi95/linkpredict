Title: Variational approach to Yang-Mills theory at finite temperatures
Authors: Hugo Reinhardt and Davide R. Campagnari and Adam P. Szczepaniak
Abstract: We study the finite-temperature phase of a gluon ensemble in a variational approximation to QCD in the Coulomb gauge. We derive and numerically solve the underlying Dyson-Schwinger equations up to one-loop order. Assuming the subcritical solution at T=0, we find a sharp transition in the infrared value of the gluon energy at a critical temperature.
