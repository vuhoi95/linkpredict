Title: Alexander Polynomial Invariants of Torus Knots T(n,3) and Chebyshev  Polynomials
Authors: A. M. Gavrilik and A. M. Pavlyuk
Abstract: The explicit formula, which expresses the Alexander polynomials \Delta_{n,3}(t) of torus knots T(n,3) as a sum of the Alexander polynomials \Delta_{k,2}(t) of torus knots T(k,2), is found. Using this result and those from our previous papers, we express the Alexander polynomials \Delta_{n,3}(t) through Chebyshev polynomials. The latter result is extended to general torus knots T(n,l) with n and l coprime.
