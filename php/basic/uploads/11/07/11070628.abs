Title: A Relativistic Relative of the Magnon S-Matrix
Authors: Ben Hoare and Timothy J. Hollowood and J. Luis Miramontes
Abstract: We construct a relativistic scattering theory based on a q deformation and large string tension limit of the magnon S-matrix of the string world sheet theory in AdS_5 x S^5. The S-matrix falls naturally into a previously studied class associated to affine quantum groups, in this case for a twisted affine loop superalgebra associated to an outer automorphism of sl(2|2). This infinite algebra includes the celebrated triply extended psl(2|2) x R^3 algebra, but only two of the centres, the lightcone components of the 2-momentum, are non-vanishing. The algebra has the interpretation as an extended supersymmetry algebra including a non-trivial R-symmetry. The representation theory of this algebra has some complications in that tensor products are reducible but indecomposable, however, we find that structure meshes perfectly with the bootstrap, or fusion, equations of S-matrix theory. The bootstrap equations can then be used inductively to generate the complete S-matrix. Unlike the magnon theory, the relativistic theory only has a finite set of states and we find that - at least when the deformation parameter q is a root of unity - the spectrum matches precisely the soliton spectrum of the relativistic theory underlying the Pohlmeyer reduction of the string world sheet theory known as the semi-symmetric space sine-Gordon theory.
