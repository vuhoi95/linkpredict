Title: A Distorted MSSM Higgs Sector from Low-Scale Strong Dynamics
Authors: Tony Gherghetta and Alex Pomarol
Abstract: We show that when supersymmetry is broken at the TeV scale by strong dynamics, the Higgs sector of the MSSM can be drastically modified. This arises from possible sizeable mixings of the Higgs with the resonances of the strong sector. In particular the mass of the lightest Higgs boson can be significantly above the MSSM bound (~130 GeV). Furthermore only one Higgs doublet is strictly necessary, because the Yukawa couplings can have a very different structure compared to the MSSM. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence electroweak precision observables can be calculated and shown to be below experimental bounds. The most natural way to generate sparticle masses is through mixing with the composite states. This causes the gauginos and Higgsinos to easily obtain Dirac masses around 200 GeV, while scalar masses can be generated either from extra D-terms or also through mixing with the strongly-coupled states. Finally one of the most interesting predictions of these scenarios is the sizeable decay width of the Higgs boson into a very light gravitino (~ 10^{-4} eV) and a Higgsino.
