Title: A BPS Skyrme model
Authors: C. Adam and J. Sanchez-Guillen and A. Wereszczynski
Abstract: Within the set of generalized Skyrme models, we identify a submodel which has both infinitely many symmetries and a Bogomolny bound which is saturated by infinitely many exact soliton solutions. Concretely, the submodel consists of the square of the baryon current and a potential term only. Further, already on the classical level, this BPS Skyrme model reproduces some features of the liquid drop model of nuclei. Here, we review the properties of the model and we discuss the semiclassical quantization of the simplest Skyrmion (the nucleon).
