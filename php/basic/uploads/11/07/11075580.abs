Title: On four-point functions and integrability in N=4 SYM: from weak to  strong coupling
Authors: Joao Caetano and Jorge Escobedo
Abstract: Using integrability techniques, we compute four-point functions of single trace gauge-invariant operators in N=4 SYM to leading order at weak coupling. Our results are valid for operators of arbitrary size. In particular, we study the limit in which two of the four operators are taken to be much smaller than the others. We show that in this limit our weak coupling result matches with the strong coupling result in the Frolov-Tseytlin limit.
