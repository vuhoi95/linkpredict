Title: On the holographic dual of N=1 SQCD with massive flavors
Authors: Eduardo Conde and Jerome Gaillard and Alfonso V. Ramallo
Abstract: We construct holographic duals to N=1 SQCD with a quartic superpotential and unquenched massive flavors. Our backgrounds are generated by D5-branes wrapping two-dimensional submanifolds of an internal space. The flavor degrees of freedom are introduced by means of D5-branes extended along two-dimensional calibrated surfaces, and act as sources of the different supergravity fields. The backgrounds we get include the backreaction of the flavor branes and generalize the geometries obtained so far to the case in which the fundamental matter is massive. The supergravity solutions we find are regular everywhere and depend on a radial function which can be determined from the distribution of flavor branes used as sources. We also work out the holomorphic structure of the model and explore some of its observable consequences.
