Title: Rindler force at large distances
Authors: Daniel Grumiller and Florian Preis
Abstract: Given some assumptions it is possible to derive the most general post-general relativistic theory of gravity for the distant field of a point mass. The force law derived from this theory contains a Rindler term in addition to well-known contributions, a Schwarzschild mass and a cosmological constant. The same force law recently was confronted with solar system precision data. The Rindler force, if present in Nature, has intriguing consequences for gravity at large distances. In particular, the Rindler force is capable of explaining about 10% of the Pioneer anomaly and simultaneously ameliorates the shape of galactic rotation curves.
