Title: Topological solitons in three-band superconductors with broken time  reversal symmetry
Authors: Julien Garaud and Johan Carlstrom and Egor Babaev
Abstract: We show that three-band superconductors with broken time reversal symmetry allow magnetic flux-carrying stable topological solitons which have only a slightly higher energy than ordinary vortices. Therefore they can be induced by fluctuations or quenching the system through a phase transition. It can provide an experimental signature of the time reversal symmetry breakdown.
