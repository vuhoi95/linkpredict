Title: Super Yangian of superstring on AdS5xS5 revisited
Authors: Machiko Hatsuda and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We construct infinite number of conserved nonlocal charges for type IIB superstring on the AdS5xS5 space in the conformal gauge without assuming any kappa gauge fixing, and show that they satisfy the super Yangian algebra. The resultant algebra is the same as our previous work, where a special gauge was assumed in such a way that the Noether current satisfies a flatness condition. However the flatness condition for the Noether current of a superstring on the AdS space is broken in general. We show that the anomalous contribution is absorbed into the current where fermionic constraints play an essential role, and a resultant conserved nonlocal charge has different expression satisfying the same super Yangian algebra.
