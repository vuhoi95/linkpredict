Title: Higher-spin algebras and cubic interactions for simple mixed-symmetry  fields in AdS spacetime
Authors: Nicolas Boulanger and E. D. Skvortsov
Abstract: Nonabelian Fradkin-Vasiliev cubic interactions for dual-graviton-like gauge fields with gravity and themselves are constructed in anti-de Sitter spacetime. The Young diagrams of gauge potentials have shapes of 'tall-hooks', i.e. two columns the second of height one. The underlying nonabelian algebra is a Clifford algebra with the anti-de Sitter signature. We also discuss the universal enveloping realization of higher-spin algebras, showing that there is a one-parameter family of algebras compatible with unitarity, which is reminiscent of 3d deformed oscillators.
