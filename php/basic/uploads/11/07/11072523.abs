Title: Dynamics of localized states in extended supersymmetric quantum  mechanics with multi-well potentials
Authors: V. P. Berezovoj and M. I. Konchatnij
Abstract: In this paper we propose a self--consistent approach to the description of temporal dynamics of localized states. This approach is based on exactly solvable quantum mechanical models with multi-well potentials and their propagators. States of Hamiltonians with multi-well potentials form a suitable basis for the expansion of wave packets with different shapes and localization degrees. We also consider properties of the tunneling wave packets, taking into account all states of Hamiltonians with symmetric and asymmetric potentials, as well as their dependence on the degree of localization and deformations of potentials. The study of the dynamics of initially localized states shows that application of the two-state approximation for the description of tunneling is considerably limited, especially for systems, which have several states in the under-barrier region, as for example in modern superconducting quantum interference devices and traps for cold atoms.
