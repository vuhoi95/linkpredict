Title: Quantum fluctuations in planar domain-wall space-times: A possible  origin of primordial preferred direction
Authors: Chih-Hung Wang and Yu-Huei Wu and Stephen D. H. Hsu
Abstract: We study the gravitational effects of a planar domain wall on quantum fluctuations of a massless scalar field during inflation. By obtaining an exact solution of the scalar field equation in de Sitter space, we show that the gravitational effects of the domain wall break the rotational invariance of the primordial power spectrum without affecting the translational invariance. The strength of rotational violation is determined by one dimensionless parameter $\beta$, which is a function of two physical parameters, the domain wall surface tension $\sigma$ and cosmological constant $\Lambda$. In the limit of small $\beta$, the leading effect of rotational violation of the primordial power spectrum is scale-invariant.
