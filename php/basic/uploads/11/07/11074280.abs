Title: Arguments towards a c-theorem from branch-point twist fields
Authors: Olalla A. Castro-Alvaredo and Benjamin Doyon and Emanuele Levi
Abstract: A fundamental quantity in 1+1 dimensional quantum field theories is Zamolodchikov's c-function. A function of a renormalization group distance parameter r that interpolates between UV and IR fixed points, its value is usually interpreted as a measure of the number of degrees of freedom of a model at a particular energy scale. The c-theorem establishes that c(r) is a monotonically decreasing function of r and that its derivative may only vanish at quantum critical points. At those points c(r) becomes the central charge of the conformal field theory which describes the critical point. In this letter we argue that a different function proposed by Calabrese and Cardy, defined in terms of the two-point function of a branch point twist field and the trace of the stress-energy tensor, has exactly the same qualitative features as c(r).
