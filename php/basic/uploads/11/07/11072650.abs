Abstract: We argue that there exists a new class of completely smooth 1/8-BPS, three-charge bound state configurations that depend upon arbitrary functions of two variables. These configurations are locally 1/2-BPS objects in that if they form an infinite flat sheet then they preserve 16 supersymmetries but even with arbitrary two-dimensional shape modes they still preserve 4 supersymmetries. They have three electric charges and can be thought of the result of two successive supertube transitions that involve adding two independent dipole moments and giving rise to the arbitrary two-dimensional shape modes. We further argue that in the D1-D5-P duality frame this construction will give rise to smooth, horizonless solutions, or microstate geometries. We expect these solutions to be extremely important in the semi-classical and holographic descriptions of black-hole entropy.
