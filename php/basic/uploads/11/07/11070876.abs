Title: Double Field Theory for Double D-branes
Authors: Cecilia Albertsson and Shou-Huang Dai and Pei-Wen Kao and Feng-Li Lin
Abstract: We consider Hull's doubled formalism for open strings on D-branes in flat space and construct the corresponding effective double field theory. We show that the worldsheet boundary conditions of the doubled formalism describe in a unified way a T-dual pair of D-branes, which we call double D-branes. We evaluate the one-loop beta function for the boundary gauge coupling and then obtain the effective field theory for the double D-branes. The effective field theory is described by a DBI action of double fields. The T-duality covariant form of this DBI action is thus a kind of "master" action, which describes all the double D-brane configurations related by T-duality transformations. We discuss a number of aspects of this effective theory.
