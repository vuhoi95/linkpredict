Title: Numerical simulations of black-hole binaries and gravitational wave  emission
Authors: Ulrich Sperhake and Emanuele Berti and Vitor Cardoso
Abstract: We review recent progress in numerical relativity simulations of black-hole (BH) spacetimes. Following a brief summary of the methods employed in the modeling, we summarize the key results in three major areas of BH physics: (i) BHs as sources of gravitational waves (GWs), (ii) astrophysical systems involving BHs, and (iii) BHs in high-energy physics. We conclude with a list of the most urgent tasks for numerical relativity in these three areas.
