Title: A twisted look on kappa-Minkowski: U(1) gauge theory
Authors: Marija Dimitrijevic and Larisa Jonke
Abstract: Kappa-Minkowski space-time is an example of noncommutative space-time with potentially interesting phenomenological consequences. However, the construction of field theories on this space, although operationally well-defined, is plagued with ambiguities. A part of ambiguities can be resolved by clarifying the geometrical picture of gauge transformations on the kappa-Minkowski space-time. To this end we use the twist approach to construct the noncommutative U(1) gauge theory coupled to fermions. However, in this approach we cannot maintain the kappa-Poincar\'e symmetry; the corresponding symmetry of the twisted kappa-Minkowski space is the twisted igl(1,3) symmetry. We construct an action for the gauge and matter fields in a geometric way, as an integral of a maximal form. We use the Seiberg-Witten map to relate noncommutative and commutative degrees of freedom and expand the action to obtain the first order corrections in the deformation parameter.
