Title: Dielectric 5-Branes and Giant Gravitons in ABJM
Authors: Mario Herrero and Yolanda Lozano and Marco Picos
Abstract: We construct a supersymmetric NS5-brane wrapped on a twisted 5-sphere expanding in the $CP^3$ in $AdS_4\times CP^3$, with D0-brane charge. This configuration provides a realization of the stringy exclusion principle in terms of giant D0-branes. In the maximal case the twisted 5-sphere reduces to a $CP^2$ and its energy can be accounted for both by a bound state of $k$ D4-branes wrapping the $CP^2$ and a bound state of $N$ D0-branes, a realization on the gravity side of the symmetry of Young diagrams with $N$ rows and $k$ columns. We discuss some generalizations of this configuration in M-theory carrying angular momentum, some of them with an interpretation as giant gravitons. We provide the microscopical description that allows to explore the region of finite 't Hooft coupling.
