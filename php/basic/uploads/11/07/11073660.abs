Abstract: We study the spectrum of BPS D5-D3-F1 states in type IIB theory, which are proposed to be dual to D4-D2-D0 states on the resolved conifold in type IIA theory. We evaluate the BPS partition functions for all values of the moduli parameter in the type IIB side, and find them completely agree with the results in the type IIA side which was obtained by using Kontsevich-Soibelman's wall-crossing formula. Our result is a quite strong evidence for string dualities on the conifold.
