Title: Anti de Sitter quantum field theory and a new class of hypergeometric  identities
Authors: Jacques Bros and Henri Epstein and Michel Gaudin and Ugo Moschella and Vincent Pasquier
Abstract: We use Anti-de Sitter quantum field theory to prove a new class of identities between hypergeometric functions related to the K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation of products of two Anti-de Sitter two-point functions. A rich mathematical structure emerges. We apply our results to study the decay of unstable Anti-de Sitter particles. The total amplitude is in this case finite and Anti-de Sitter invariant.
