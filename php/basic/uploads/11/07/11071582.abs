Title: Note on two-dimensional gauged Lifshitz models
Authors: Edwin J. Son and Wontae Kim
Abstract: We fermionize the two-dimensional free Lifshitz scalar field in order to identify what the gauge covariant couplings are, and then they are bosonized back to get the gauged Lifshitz scalar field theories. We show that they give the same physical modes with those of the corresponding Lorentz invariant gauged scalar theories, although the dispersion relations are different.
