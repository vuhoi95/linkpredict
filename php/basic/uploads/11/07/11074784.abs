Title: AGT conjecture and AFLT states: a complete construction
Authors: Bao Shou and Jian-Feng Wu and Ming Yu
Abstract: A complete construction of the AFLT states is proposed. With this construction and for all the cases we have checked, the AGT conjecture on the equivalence of Nekrasov Instanton Counting (NIC) to the $Vir\oplus u(1)$ conformal block has been verified to be true.
