Title: Einstein Branes
Authors: Wissam Chemissany and Bert Janssen and Thomas Van Riet
Abstract: We generalise the standard, flat p-brane solutions sourced by a dilaton and a form field, by taking the worldvolume to be a curved Einstein space, such as (anti-)de Sitter space. Our method is based on reducing the p-branes to domain walls and then allowing these domain walls to be curved. For de Sitter worldvolumes this extends some recently constructed warped de Sitter non-compactifications. We restrict our analysis to solutions that possess scaling behavior and demonstrate that these scaling solutions are near-horizon limits of a more general solution. Finally, our framework can equally be used for spacelike branes and the uplift of the domain wall/cosmology correspondence becomes in this context a more general timelike/spacelike brane correspondence.
