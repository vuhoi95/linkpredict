Title: Quark Number Susceptibility and QCD Phase Transition in the Predictive  Soft-wall AdS/QCD Model with Finite Temperature
Authors: Ling-Xiao Cui and Shingo Takeuchi and Yue-Liang Wu
Abstract: Based on the infrared improved soft-wall AdS/QCD model which can lead to a consistent prediction for the mass spectra of light resonance mesons, we extend it to the finite temperature system and carry out the calculation for the quark number susceptibility with finite quark mass. As a consequence, we show that the quark number susceptibility grows rapidly with a continuous blow-up in a narrow temperature interval as the temperature increases, and there is a peak when the temperature is around $T \simeq 160 \sim 190$ MeV depending slightly on the models, the resulting critical temperature is about 170MeV, which agrees remarkably with the lattice QCD calculation.
