Title: Strongly Warped BPS Domain Walls
Authors: Ali Masoumi and I-Sheng Yang
Abstract: We present analytical solutions of BPS domain walls in the Einstein-Maxwell flux landscape. We also remove the smeared-branes approximation and write down solutions with localized branes. In these solutions the domain walls induce strong (if not infinite) warping.
