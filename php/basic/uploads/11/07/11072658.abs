Title: Hunting for Dynamical Supersymmetry Breaking in Theories That S-confine
Authors: Tongyan Lin and John D. Mason and Aqil Sajjad
Abstract: The s-confining theories are a class of supersymmetric gauge theories with infrared dynamics which are well-understood. Perturbing such theories can give rise to dynamical supersymmetry breaking. We realize simple models of dynamical supersymmetry breaking by perturbing two of the 10 SU(N) s-confining gauge theories by a single trilinear operator. These examples have locally stable vacua with spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. The first is SU(5) with two generations (consisting of an antisymmetric tensor and an antifundamental) plus two flavors. The second is SU(5) with three generations. The properties of the former vacuum are calculable while those of the latter vacuum are not. We briefly discuss the other SU(N) models.
