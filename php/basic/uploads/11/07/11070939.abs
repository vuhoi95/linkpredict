Title: About Locality and the Relativity Principle Beyond Special Relativity
Authors: J. M. Carmona and J. L. Cortes and D. Mazon and F. Mercati
Abstract: Locality of interactions is an essential ingredient of Special Relativity. Recently, a new framework under the name of relative locality \cite{AmelinoCamelia:2011bm} has been proposed as a way to consider Planckian modifications of the relativistic dynamics of particles. We note in this paper that the loss of absolute locality is a general feature of theories beyond Special Relativity with an implementation of a relativity principle. We give an explicit construction of such an implementation and compare it both with the previously mentioned framework of relative locality and the so-called Doubly Special Relativity theories.
