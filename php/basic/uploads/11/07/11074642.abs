Title: Viscous Little Rip Cosmology
Authors: I. Brevik and E. Elizalde and S. Nojiri and S. D. Odintsov
Abstract: Dark energy of phantom or quintessence nature with an equation of state parameter $w$ almost equal to -1 often leads the universe evolution to a finite-time future singularity. An elegant solution to this problem has been recently proposed \cite{frampton11} under the form of the so-called Little Rip cosmology which appears to be a realistic alternative to the $\Lambda$CDM model. A viscous Little Rip cosmology is here proposed. Whereas generically bulk viscosity tends to promote the Big Rip, we find that there are a number of situations where this is not the case and where the formalism nicely adjusts itself to the Little Rip scenario. We prove, in particular, that a viscous fluid (or, equivalently, one with an inhomogeneous (imperfect) equation of state) is perfectly able to produce a Little Rip cosmology as a purely viscosity effect. The possibility of its induction as a combined result of viscosity and a general (power-like) equation of state is also investigated in detail. To finish, a physical, inertial force interpretation of the dissolution of bound structures in the Little Rip cosmology is presented.
