Title: Physical equivalence between the covariant and physical graviton  two-point functions in de Sitter spacetime
Authors: Mir Faizal and Atsushi Higuchi
Abstract: It is known that the covariant graviton two-point function in de Sitter spacetime is infrared divergent for some choices of gauge parameters. On the other hand it is also known that there are no infrared divergences requiring an infrared cutoff for the physical graviton two-point function for this spacetime in the transverse-traceless-synchronous gauge in the global coordinate system. We show in this paper that the covariant graviton Wightman two-point function with two gauge parameters is equivalent to the physical one in the global coordinate system in the sense that they produce the same two-point function of any local gauge-invariant tensor linear in the graviton field such as the linearized Weyl tensor. This confirms the fact, pointed out decades ago, that the infrared divergences of the graviton two-point function in the covariant gauge for some choices of gauge parameters are gauge artifact in the sense that they do not contribute to the Wightman two-point function of any local gauge invariant tensor field in linearized theory.
