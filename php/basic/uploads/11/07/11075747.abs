Title: On Arnold's 14 `exceptional' N=2 superconformal gauge theories
Authors: Sergio Cecotti and Michele Del Zotto
Abstract: We study the four-dimensional superconformal N=2 gauge theories engineered by the Type IIB superstring on Arnold's 14 exceptional unimodal singularities (a.k.a. Arnold's strange duality list), thus extending the methods of 1006.3435 to singularities which are not the direct sum of minimal ones. In particular, we compute their BPS spectra in several `strongly coupled' chambers. From the TBA side, we construct ten new periodic Y-systems, providing additional evidence for the existence of a periodic Y-system for each isolated quasi-homogeneous singularity with $\hat c<2$ (more generally, for each N=2 superconformal theory with a finite BPS chamber whose chiral primaries have dimensions of the form N/l).
