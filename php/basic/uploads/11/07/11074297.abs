Abstract: The concept of quasi-bosons or composite bosons (like mesons, excitons etc.) has a wide range of potential physical applications. Even composed of two pure fermions, the quasi-boson creation and annihilation operators satisfy non-standard commutation relations. It is natural to try to realize the quasi-boson operators by the operators of deformed (nonlinear) oscillator, the latter constituting widely studied field of modern quantum physics. In this paper, it is proved that the deformed oscillators which realize quasi-boson operators in a consistent way really exist. The conditions for such realization are derived, and the uniqueness of the family of deformations under consideration is shown.
