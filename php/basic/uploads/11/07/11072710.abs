Title: Dualities for Loop Amplitudes of N=6 Chern-Simons Matter Theory
Authors: Wei-Ming Chen and Yu-tin Huang
Abstract: In this paper we study the one- and two-loop corrections to the four-point amplitude of N=6 Chern-Simons matter theory. Using generalized unitarity methods we express the one- and two-loop amplitudes in terms of dual-conformal integrals. Explicit integration by using dimensional reduction gives vanishing one-loop result as expected, while the two-loop result is non-vanishing and matches with the Wilson loop computation. Furthermore, the two-loop correction takes the same form as the one-loop correction to the four-point amplitude of N=4 super Yang-Mills. We discuss possible higher loop extensions of this correspondence between the two theories. As a side result, we extend the method of dimensional reduction for three dimensions to five dimensions where dual conformal symmetry is most manifest, demonstrating significant simplification to the computation of integrals.
