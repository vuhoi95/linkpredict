Authors: Bobby Ezhuthachan and Shinji Shimasaki and Shuichi Yokoyama
Abstract: We investigate BPS solutions in ABJM theory on RxS^2. We find new BPS solutions, which have nonzero angular momentum as well as nontrivial configurations of fluxes. Applying the "Higgsing procedure" of arxiv:0803.3218 around a 1/2-BPS solution of ABJM theory, one obtains N=8 super Yang-Mills (SYM) on RxS^2. We also show that other BPS solutions of the SYM can be obtained from BPS solutions of ABJM theory by this higgsing procedure.
