Title: Ekpyrosis and inflationary dynamics in heavy ion collisions: the role of  quantum fluctuations
Authors: Kevin Dusling and Francois Gelis and Raju Venugopalan
Abstract: We summarize recent significant progress in the development of a first-principles formalism to describe the formation and evolution of matter in very high energy heavy ion collisions. The key role of quantum fluctuations both before and after a collision is emphasized. Systematic computations are now feasible to address early time dynamics essential to quantifying properties of strongly interacting quark-gluon matter.
