Title: String cosmology from Poisson-Lie T-dual sigma models on supermanifolds
Authors: A. Eghbali and A. Rezaei-Aghdam
Abstract: We generalize the formulation of Poisson-Lie T-dual sigma models on manifolds to supermanifolds. In this respect, we formulate 1+1 dimensional string cosmological models on the Lie supergroup C^3 and its dual (A_1,1 + 2A)^0_(1,0,0), which are coupled to two fermionic fields. Then, we solve the equations of motion of the models and show that there is a essential singularity for the metric of the original model and its dual.
