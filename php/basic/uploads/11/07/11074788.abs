Title: The Ricci flow on noncommutative two-tori
Authors: Tanvir Ahamed Bhuyain and Matilde Marcolli
Abstract: In this paper we construct a version of Ricci flow for noncommutative 2-tori, based on a spectral formulation in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunction of the Laplacian and recent results on the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for noncommutative tori.
