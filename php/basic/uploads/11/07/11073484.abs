Title: Static charged double-black rings in five dimensions
Authors: Cristian Stelea and Ciprian Dariescu and Marina-Aura Dariescu
Abstract: Using a solution generating technique based on the symmetries of the dimensionally reduced Lagrangian we derive two exact solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton field equations in five dimensions. More specifically, these solutions describe general systems of non-extremally charged static asymptotically flat black bi/di-ring. We compute their conserved charges and investigate some of their properties. As expected, we find that in general there are conical singularities in between the black rings and for the static solutions considered here they cannot be completely eliminated.
