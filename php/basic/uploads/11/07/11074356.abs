Title: New numerical results and novel effective string predictions for Wilson  loops
Authors: Marco Billo' and Michele Caselle and Roberto Pellegrini
Abstract: We compute the prediction of the Nambu-Goto effective string model for a rectangular Wilson loop up to three loops. This is done through the use of an operatorial, first order formulation and of the open string analogues of boundary states. This result is interesting since there are universality theorems stating that the predictions up to three loops are common to all effective string models. To test the effective string prediction, we set up the Montecarlo evaluation, in the 3d Ising gauge model, of an observable (the ratio of two Wilson loops with the same perimeter) for which boundary effects are relatively small. Our simulation attains a level of precision which is sufficient to test the two-loop correction. The three-loop correction seems to go in the right direction, but is actually yet beyond the reach of our simulation, since its effect is comparable with the statistical errors of the latter.
