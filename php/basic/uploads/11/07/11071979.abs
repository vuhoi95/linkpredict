Title: Finite-size corrections for logarithmic representations in critical  dense polymers
Authors: Nickolay Sh. Izmailian and Philippe Ruelle and Chin-Kun Hu
Abstract: We study (analytic) finite-size corrections in the dense polymer model on the strip by perturbing the critical Hamiltonian with irrelevant operators belonging to the tower of the identity. We generalize the perturbation expansion to include Jordan cells, and examine whether the finite-size corrections are sensitive to the properties of indecomposable representations appearing in the conformal spectrum, in particular their indecomposability parameters. We find, at first order, that the corrections do not depend on these parameters nor even on the presence of Jordan cells. Though the corrections themselves are not universal, the ratios are universal and correctly reproduced by the conformal perturbative approach, to first order.
