Abstract: In this work we study the theory of linearized gravity via the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism. We make a brief review of this theory and its Lagrangian description, as well as a review of the Hamilton-Jacobi approach for singular systems. Then we apply this formalism to analyze the constraint structure of the linearized gravity in instant and front-form dynamics.
