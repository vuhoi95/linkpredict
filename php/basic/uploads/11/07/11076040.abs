Title: On Higher Spatial Derivative Field Theories
Authors: Pedro R. S. Gomes and M. Gomes
Abstract: In this work, we employ renormalization group methods to study the general behavior of field theories possessing anisotropic scaling in the spacetime variables. The Lorentz breaking symmetry that accompanies these models are either soft, if no higher spatial derivative is present, or it may have a more complex structure if higher spatial derivatives are also included. Both situations are discussed in models with only scalar fields and also in models with fermions as a Yukawa like model.
