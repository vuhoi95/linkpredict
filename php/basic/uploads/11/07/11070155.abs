Title: Holography at work for nuclear and hadron physics
Authors: Youngman Kim and Deokhyun Yi
Abstract: The purpose of this review is to provide basic ingredients of holographic QCD to non-experts in string theory and to summarize its interesting achievements in nuclear and hadron physics. We focus on results from a less stringy bottom-up approach and review a stringy top-down model with some calculational details.
