Title: Entropic Force Scenarios and Eternal Inflation
Authors: Taotao Qiu and Emmanuel N. Saridakis
Abstract: We examine various entropic inflation scenarios, under the light of eternality. After describing the inflation realization and the normal condition for inflation to last at the background level, we investigate the conditions for eternal inflation with the effect of thermal fluctuations produced from standard radiation and from the holographic screen. Furthermore, we incorporate stochastic quantum fluctuations through a phenomenological, Langevin analysis, studying whether they can affect the inflation eternality. In single-holographic-screen scenarios eternality can be easily obtained, while in double-screen considerations inflation is eternal only in the high-energy regime. Thus, from the cosmological point of view, one should take these into account before he can consider entropic gravity as a candidate for the description of nature. However, form the string theory point of view, inflation eternality may form the background for the "Landscape" of string/M theory vacua, leading to new perspectives in entropy gravity.
