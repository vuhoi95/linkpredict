Title: An entropic picture of emergent quantum mechanics

Abstract: Quantum mechanics emerges a la Verlinde from a foliation of space by holographic screens, when regarding the latter as entropy reservoirs that a particle can exchange entropy with. This entropy is quantised in units of Boltzmann's constant k. The holographic screens can be treated thermodynamically as stretched membranes. On that side of a holographic screen where spacetime has already emerged, the energy representation of thermodynamics gives rise to the usual quantum mechanics. A knowledge of the different surface densities of entropy flow across all screens is equivalent to a knowledge of the quantum-mechanical wavefunction on space. The entropy representation of thermodynamics, as applied to a screen, can be used to describe quantum mechanics in the absence of spacetime, that is, quantum mechanics beyond a holographic screen, where spacetime has not yet emerged. Our approach can be regarded as a formal derivation of Planck's constant h from Boltzmann's constant k.
