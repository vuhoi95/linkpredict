Authors: Bum-Hoon Lee and Da-Wei Pang and Chanyong Park
Abstract: We give a review on our recent work arXiv:1006.0779 [hep-th] and arXiv:1006.1719 [hep-th], in which properties of holographic strange metals were investigated. The background is chosen to be anisotropic scaling solution in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory with a Liouville potential. The effects of bulk Maxwell field, an extra U(1) gauge field and probe D-branes on the DC conductivity, the DC Hall conductivity and the AC conductivity are extensively analyzed. We classify behaviors of the conductivities according to the parameter ranges in the bulk theory and characterize conditions when the holographic results can reproduce experimental data.
