Title: A new look at hidden conformal symmetries of black holes
Authors: Edgardo Franzin and Ivica SmoliÄ‡
Abstract: We propose a different approach to the analysis of symmetries in the near-horizon region of black holes. The idea is presented here for spherically symmetric black holes, for which we have shown that the generators of hidden symmetries can be extracted by solving the conformal Killing equation under certain assumptions. Our result is in agreement with that obtained in literature by the analysis of the wave equation in the near-horizon region.
