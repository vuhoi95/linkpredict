Authors: Chiung Hwang and Hyungchul Kim and Kyung-Jae Park and Jaemo Park
Abstract: We work out the superconformal index for N=2 supersymmetric Chern-Simons matter theories exhibiting Seiberg-like dualities proposed by Giveon and Kutasov. We consider $U(N)/Sp(2N)/O(N)$ gauge theories of QCD type and find the perfect agreements for proposed dual pairs.
