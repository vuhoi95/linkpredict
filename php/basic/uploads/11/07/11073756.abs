Abstract: We study Baxter's T-Q equation of XXX spin-chain models under the semiclassical limit where an intriguing SU(N)/SU(2)^{N-3} correspondence emerges. That is, two kinds of 4D \mathcal{N}=2 superconformal field theories having the above different gauge groups are encoded simultaneously in one Baxter's T-Q equation which captures their spectral curves. For example, while one is SU(N_c) with N_f=2N_c flavors the other turns out to be SU(2)^{N_c-3} with N_c hyper-multiplets (N_c > 3). It is seen that the corresponding Seiberg-Witten differential supports our proposal.
