Title: Reconsidering a higher-spin-field solution to the main cosmological  constant problem
Authors: V. Emelyanov and F. R. Klinkhamer
Abstract: Following an earlier suggestion by Dolgov, we present a specific model of two massless vector fields which dynamically cancel a cosmological constant of arbitrary magnitude and sign. Flat Minkowski spacetime appears asymptotically as an attractor of the field equations. Unlike the original model, the new model does not upset the local Newtonian gravitational dynamics.
