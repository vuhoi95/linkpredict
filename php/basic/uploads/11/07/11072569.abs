Title: (p,q) D=3 Poincare supergravities from Lie algebra expansions
Authors: Jose A. de Azcarraga and Jose M. Izquierdo
Abstract: We use the expansion of superalgebras procedure (summarized in the text) to derive Chern-Simons (CS) actions for the (p,q)-Poincare supergravities in three-dimensional spacetime. After deriving the action for the (p,0)-Poincare supergravity as a CS theory for the expansion osp(p|2;R)(2,1) of osp(p|2;R), we find the general (p,q)-Poincare superalgebras and their associated D=3 supergravity actions as CS gauge theories from an expansion of the simple osp(p+q|2,R) superalgebras, namely osp(p+q|2,R)(2,1,2).
