Title: Correlation function of null polygonal Wilson loops with local operators
Authors: L. F. Alday and E. I. Buchbinder and A. A. Tseytlin
Abstract: We consider the correlator <W_n O(x)> of a light-like polygonal Wilson loop with n cusps with a local operator (like the dilaton or the chiral primary scalar) in planar N =4 super Yang-Mills theory. As a consequence of conformal symmetry, the main part of such correlator is a function F of 3n-11 conformal ratios. The first non-trivial case is n=4 when F depends on just one conformal ratio \zeta. This makes the corresponding correlator one of the simplest non-trivial observables that one would like to compute for generic values of the `t Hooft coupling \lambda. We compute F(\zeta,\lambda) at leading order in both the strong coupling regime (using semiclassical AdS5 x S5 string theory) and the weak coupling regime (using perturbative gauge theory). Some results are also obtained for polygonal Wilson loops with more than four edges. Furthermore, we also discuss a connection to the relation between a correlator of local operators at null-separated positions and cusped Wilson loop suggested in arXiv:1007.3243.
