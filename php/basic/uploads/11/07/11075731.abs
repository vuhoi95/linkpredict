Title: AdS--Maxwell superalgebra and supergravity
Authors: R. Durka and J. Kowalski-Glikman and M. Szczachor
Abstract: In this paper we derive the Anti de Sitter counterpart of the super-Maxwell algebra presented recently by Bonanos et.\ al. Then we gauge this algebra and derive the corresponding supergravity theory, which turns out to be described by the standard N=1 supergravity lagrangian, up to topological terms.
