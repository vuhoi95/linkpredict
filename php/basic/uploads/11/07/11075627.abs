Abstract: With the help of the F-basis provided by the Drinfeld twist or factorizing F-matrix for the open XXZ spin chain with non-diagonal boundary terms, we obtain the determinant representation of the partition function of the six-vertex model with a non-diagonal reflecting end under domain wall boundary condition.
