Title: Photon-photon interaction and Schwinger process
Authors: K. Bulycheva and S. Guts
Abstract: We consider the tunneling processes induced by two-particle collisions. The result derived by the termal bath approach is reproduced by the classical configurations. The Coulomb and Yukawa corrections for the rate of the process are computed.
