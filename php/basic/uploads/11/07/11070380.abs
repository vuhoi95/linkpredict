Title: Moving Branes with Background Massless and Tachyon Fields in the Compact  Spacetime
Authors: Zahra Rezaei and Davoud Kamani
Abstract: In this article we shall obtain the boundary state associated with a moving $Dp$-brane in the presence of the Kalb-Ramond field $B_{\mu\nu}$, an internal U(1) gauge field $A_{\alpha}$ and a tachyon field, in the compact spacetime. According to this state, properties of the brane and a closed string, with mixed boundary conditions emitted from it, will be obtained. Using this boundary state we calculate the interaction amplitude of two moving $Dp_{1}$ and $Dp_{2}$-branes with above background fields in a partially compact spacetime. They are parallel or perpendicular to each other. Properties of the interaction amplitude will be analyzed and contribution of the massless states to the interaction will be extracted.
