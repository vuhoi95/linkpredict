Title: Chiral Scale and Conformal Invariance in 2D Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Diego M. Hofman and Andrew Strominger
Abstract: It is well known that a local, unitary Poincare-invariant 2D QFT with a global scaling symmetry and a discrete non-negative spectrum of scaling dimensions necessarily has both a left and a right local conformal symmetry. In this paper we consider a chiral situation beginning with only a left global scaling symmetry and do not assume Lorentz invariance. We find that a left conformal symmetry is still implied, while right translations are enhanced either to a right conformal symmetry or a left U(1) Kac-Moody symmetry.
