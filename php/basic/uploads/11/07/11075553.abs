Title: Some Hadronic Properties from Light Front Holography
Authors: Alfredo Vega and Ivan Schmidt and Thomas Gutsche and Valery E. Lyubovitskij
Abstract: Using ideas from Light Front Holography, we discuss the calculation of hadronic properties. In this talk I will pay special attention to hadronic masses and the nucleon helicity-independent generalized parton distributions of quarks in the zero skewness case
