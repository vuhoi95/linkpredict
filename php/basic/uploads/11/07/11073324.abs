Title: Supersymmetry Breaking in Low Dimensional Models
Authors: Christian Wozar and Andreas Wipf
Abstract: We analyse supersymmetric models that show supersymmetry breaking in one and two dimensions using lattice methods. Starting from supersymmetric quantum mechanics we explain the fundamental principles and problems that arise in putting supersymmetric models onto the lattice. We compare our lattice results (built upon the non-local SLAC derivative) with numerically exact results obtained within the Hamiltonian approach. A particular emphasis is put on the discussion of boundary conditions. We investigate the ground state structure, mass spectrum, effective potential and Ward identities and conclude that lattice methods are suitable to derive the physical properties of supersymmetric quantum mechanics, even with broken supersymmetry. Based on this result we analyse the two dimensional N=1 Wess-Zumino model with spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. First we show that (in agreement with earlier analytical and numerical studies) the SLAC derivative is a sensible choice in the quenched model, which is nothing but the two dimensional phi^4 model. Then, we present the very first computation of a renormalised critical coupling for the complete supersymmetric model. This calculation makes use of Binder cumulants and is supported by a direct comparison to Ward identity results, both in the continuum and infinite volume limit. The physical picture is completed by masses at two selected couplings, one in the supersymmetric phase and one in the supersymmetry broken phase. Signatures of the Goldstino in the fermionic correlator are clearly visible in the broken case.
