Title: The no-boundary measure in scalar-tensor gravity
Authors: Dong-il Hwang and Hanno Sahlmann and Dong-han Yeom
Abstract: In this article, we study the no-boundary wave function in scalar-tensor gravity with various potentials for the non-minimally coupled scalar field. Our goal is to calculate probabilities for the scalar field - and hence the effective gravitational coupling and cosmological constant - to take specific values. Most calculations are done in the minisuperspace approximation, and we use a saddle point approximation for the Euclidean action, which is then evaluated numerically. We find that for potentials that have several minima, none of them is substantially preferred by the quantum mechanical probabilities. We argue that the same is true for the stable and the runaway solution in the case of a dilaton-type potential. Technically, this is due to the inclusion of quantum mechanical effects (fuzzy instantons). These results are in contrast to the often held view that vanishing gravitation or cosmological constants would be exponentially preferred in quantum cosmology, and they may be relevant to the cosmological constant problem and the dilaton stabilization problem.
