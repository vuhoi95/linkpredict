Abstract: We analyze the a set of seventeen rotation curves of Low Surface Brightness (LSB) galaxies from the The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS) with different mass models to study the core structure and to determine a phase transition energy scale (E_c) between hot and cold dark matter, due to nonperturbative effects in the Bound Dark Matter (BDM) model. Our results agree with previous ones implying the cored profiles are preferred over the N-body motivated cuspy NFW profile. We find an average galactic core radius of r_c = 260 \times 10^{+/- 1.3} pc and a phase transition energy E_c = 0.11\times 10^{+/- 0.46} eV, that is of the same order of magnitude as the sum of the neutrino masses.
