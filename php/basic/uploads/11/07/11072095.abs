Title: Calabi-Yau Manifolds, Hermitian Yang-Mills Instantons and Mirror  Symmetry
Authors: Hyun Seok Yang and Sangheon Yun
Abstract: We address the issue why a Calabi-Yau manifold exists with a mirror pair. We observe that the irreducible spinor representation of the Lorentz group Spin(6) requires us to consider the vector spaces of two-forms and four-forms on an equal footing. The doubling of the two-form vector space due to the Hodge duality brings about the doubling for the variety of six-dimensional spin manifolds which is responsible for the existence of the mirror symmetry between Calabi-Yau manifolds. Via the gauge theory formulation of six-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, we show that a Calabi-Yau manifold is equivalent to a Hermitian Yang-Mills instanton. We verify that the mirror symmetry of Calabi-Yau manifolds can be understood as the existence of the mirror pair of Hermitian Yang-Mills instantons embedded in the fundamental and anti-fundamental representations of the gauge group SU(4)=Spin(6).
