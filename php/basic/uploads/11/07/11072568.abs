Abstract: Twist operators in the closed sl(2) sector of planar N=4 SYM are characterized by their spin. The explicit dependence of anomalous dimensions on this important parameter is a source of interesting information. Wrapping corrections are a non trivial part of the calculation and are under control in the framework of thermodynamical Bethe Ansatz valid for the full theory and thoroughly checked in that sector. The extension to more general twist operators beyond sl(2) has been recently accomplished for the so-called 3-gluon operators that are a special case of the generalized twist operators introduced by Freyhult, Rej and Zieme. Such operators are dual to spinning strings configurations with two spins S1, S2 in AdS_5 and charge in S^5. We compute the expansion of the weak-coupling leading order wrapping correction in the gauge theory limit dual to large S1 and fixed S2. We present a simple algorithm for the calculation and provide explicit results illustrating the general structure of the expansion.
