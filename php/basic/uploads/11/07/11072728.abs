Abstract: We explore the gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric dust cloud in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity without a cosmological constant, and obtain three families of LTB-like solutions. It is shown that the Gauss-Bonnet term has a profound influence on the nature of singularities, and the global structure of space-time changes drastically from the analogous general relativistic case. Interestingly, the formation of a naked, massive and uncentral singularity, allowed in 5-dimensional space-time, is forbidden if $D\geq6$. Moreover, such singularity is gravitational strong and a serious counter example to CCH.
