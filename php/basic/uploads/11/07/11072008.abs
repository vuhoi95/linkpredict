Title: Analytic Models for the Evolution of Semilocal String Networks
Authors: A. S. Nunes and A. Avgoustidis and C. J. A. P. Martins and J. Urrestilla
Abstract: We revisit previously developed analytic models for defect evolution and adapt them appropriately for the study of semilocal string networks. We thus confirm the expectation (based on numerical simulations) that linear scaling evolution is the attractor solution for a broad range of model parameters. We discuss in detail the evolution of individual semilocal segments, focusing on the phenomenology of segment growth, and also provide a preliminary comparison with existing numerical simulations.
