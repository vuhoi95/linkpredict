Title: Supersymmetric Fluid Dynamics
Authors: P. A. Grassi and A. Mezzalira and L. Sommovigo
Abstract: Recently Navier-Stokes (NS) equations have been derived from the duality between the black branes and a conformal fluid on the boundary of AdS_5. Nevertheless, the full correspondence has to be established between solutions of supergravity in AdS_5 and supersymmetric field theories on the boundary. That prompts the construction of NS equations for a supersymmetric fluid. In the framework of rigid susy, there are several possibilities and we propose one candidate. We deduce the equations of motion in two ways: both from the divergenless condition on the energy-momentum tensor and by a suitable parametrization of the auxiliary fields. We give the complete component expansion and a very preliminary analysis of the physics of this supersymmetric fluid.
