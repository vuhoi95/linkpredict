Title: Intersecting branes and a standard model realization in matrix models
Authors: Athanasios Chatzistavrakidis and Harold Steinacker and George Zoupanos
Abstract: We consider intersecting brane solutions of the type IIB matrix model. It is shown that fermionic zero-modes arise on such backgrounds, localized at the brane intersections. They lead to chiral fermions in four dimensions under certain conditions. Such configurations reproduce many of the welcome features in similar string-theoretic constructions. Therefore they can be used to construct semi-realistic particle physics models in the framework of Yang-Mills matrix models. In particular, we present a brane configuration which realizes the correct chiral spectrum of the standard model in the matrix model. Furthermore, the stability of intersecting branes is discussed by analyzing the 1-loop effective action. It is shown that intersecting branes may form a bound state for certain flux configurations. The four-dimensional geometry of the branes is generic, and determined by the (emergent) gravity sector of the matrix model.
