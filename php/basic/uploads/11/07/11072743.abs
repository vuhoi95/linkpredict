Authors: Rui-Hong Yue and De-Cheng Zou and Tian-Yi Yu and Zhan-Ying Yang
Abstract: This paper presents a new metric and studies slowly rotating Gauss-Bonnet black holes with one nonvanishing angular momentum in five dimensional anti-de Sitter spaces. Taking the angular momentum parameter $a$ up to second order, the slowly rotating black hole solutions are obtained by working directly in the action. In addition, it also finds that this method is applicable in higher order Lovelock gravity.
