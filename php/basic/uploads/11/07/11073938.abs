Title: Colliding branes and big crunches
Authors: John Omotani and Paul M. Saffin and Jorma Louko
Abstract: We examine the global structure of colliding domain walls in AdS spacetime and come to the conclusion that singularities forming from such collisions are of the big-crunch type rather than that of a black brane.
