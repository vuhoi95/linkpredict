Title: Quantum Energies and Tensorial Central Charges of Confined Monopoles
Authors: David Burke and Robert Wimmer
Abstract: We study different aspects of monopoles in the Higgs phase which are confined by (non-abelian) vortices in \cal{N}=2 SQCD with gauge group U(N) and N_f >= N massive flavors, including generalized FI-terms. We compute in particular the perturbative quantum corrections for (multiple) confined monopoles and identify an anomalous contribution in the central charge. For N_f = N the results match the quantum corrections for kinks in two-dimensional CP^{N-1} models. To regulate the theory we embedded it in a six-dimensional model with constant U(1) background fields which generate the masses upon dimensional reduction. We discuss the (local) susy algebra and its representations including tensorial central charges, which are carried by the confined monopoles, in an SU(2)_R covariant way. The resulting SU(2)_R covariant 1/4 BPS equations show that there is no correlation between the SU(2)_R and the spatial orientation of the confined monopole system. However, at the quantum level we find that supersymmetry links the spatial SU(2) with the R-symmetry SU(2)_R.
