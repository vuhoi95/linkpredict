Title: Classical instability in Lovelock gravity
Authors: P. Suranyi and L. C. R. Wijewardhana
Abstract: We introduce a simple method for the investigation of the classical stability of static solutions with a horizon in Lovelock gravity. The method is applicable to the investigation of high angular momentum instabilities, similar to those found by Dotti and Gleiser for Gauss-Bonnet black holes. The method does not require the knowledge of the explicit analytic form of the black hole solution. In this paper we apply our method to a case where the explicit solution is known and show that it identifies correctly the resulting unstable modes.
