Title: Gauged AdS-Maxwell algebra and gravity
Authors: R. Durka and J. Kowalski-Glikman and M. Szczachor
Abstract: We deform the anti-de Sitter algebra by adding additional generators $\mathcal{Z}_{ab}$, forming in this way the negative cosmological constant counterpart of the Maxwell algebra. We gauge this algebra and construct a dynamical model with the help of a constrained the BF theory. It turns out that the resulting theory is described by the Einstein-Cartan action with Holst term, and the gauge fields associated with the Maxwell generators $\mathcal{Z}_{ab}$ appear only in topological terms that do not influence dynamical field equations. We briefly comment on the extension of this construction, which would lead to a nontrivial Maxwell fields dynamics.
