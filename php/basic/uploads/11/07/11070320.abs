Title: Green-Schwarz Mechanism in Heterotic (2,0) Gauged Linear Sigma Models:  Torsion and NS5 Branes
Authors: Michael Blaszczyk and Stefan Groot Nibbelink and Fabian Ruehle
Abstract: Heterotic string compactifications can be conveniently described in the language of (2,0) gauged linear sigma models (GLSMs). Such models allow for Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI)-terms, which can be interpreted as Kahler parameters and axions on the target space geometry. We show that field dependent non-gauge invariant FI-terms lead to a Green-Schwarz-like mechanism on the worldsheet which can be used to cancel worldsheet anomalies. However, given that these FI-terms are constrained by quantization conditions due to worldsheet gauge instantons, the anomaly conditions turn out to be still rather constraining. Field dependent non-gauge invariant FI-terms result in non-Kahler, i.e. torsional, target spaces in general. When FI-terms involve logarithmic terms, the GLSM seems to describe the heterotic string in the presence of Neveu-Schwarz (NS)5 branes. In particular, when the gauge bundle overcloses the Bianchi identities, the GLSM describes a decompactified target space geometry due to anti-NS5 branes.
