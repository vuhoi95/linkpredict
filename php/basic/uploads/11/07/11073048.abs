Title: Randall-Sundrum limit of f(R) brane-world models
Authors: Adam Balcerzak and Mariusz P. Dabrowski
Abstract: By setting some special boundary conditions in the variational principle we obtain junction conditions for the five-dimensional $f(R)$ gravity which in the Einstein limit $f(R)\rightarrow R$ transform into the standard Randall-Sundrum junction conditions. We apply these junction conditions to a particular model of a Friedmann universe on the brane and show explicitly that the limit gives the standard Randall-Sundrum model Friedmann equation.
