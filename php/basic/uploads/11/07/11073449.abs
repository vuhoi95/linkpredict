Title: $κ$-Deformation and Spectral Triples
Authors: B. Iochum and T. Masson and Th. Schücker and A. Sitarz
Abstract: The aim of the paper is to answer the following question: does $\kappa$-deformation fit into the framework of noncommutative geometry in the sense of spectral triples? Using a compactification of time, we get a discrete version of $\kappa$-Minkowski deformation via $C^*$-algebras of groups. The dynamical system of the underlying groups (including some Baumslag--Solitar groups) is used in order to construct \emph{finitely summable} spectral triples. This allows to bypass an obstruction to finite-summability appearing when using the common regular representation.
