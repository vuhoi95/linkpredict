Title: Nonlinear Quantum Cosmology of de Sitter Space
Authors: Rajesh R. Parwani and Siti Nursaba Tarih
Abstract: We perform a minisuperspace analysis of an information-theoretic nonlinear Wheeler-deWitt (WDW) equation for de Sitter universes. The nonlinear WDW equation, which is in the form of a difference-differential equation, is transformed into a pure difference equation for the probability density by using the current conservation constraint. In the present study we observe some new features not seen in our previous approximate investigation, such as a nonzero minimum and maximum allowable size to the quantum universe: An examination of the effective classical dynamics supports the interpretation of a bouncing universe. The studied model suggests implications for the early universe, and plausibly also for the future of an ongoing accelerating phase of the universe.
