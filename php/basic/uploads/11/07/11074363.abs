Title: Higher Derivative Corrections to Holographic Entanglement Entropy for  AdS Solitons
Authors: Noriaki Ogawa and Tadashi Takayanagi
Abstract: We investigate the behaviors of holographic entanglement entropy for AdS soliton geometries in the presence of higher derivative corrections. We calculate the leading higher derivative corrections for the AdS5 setup in type IIB string and for the AdS4,7 ones in M-theory. We also study the holographic entanglement entropy in Gauss-Bonnet gravity and study how the confinement/deconfinement phase transition observed in AdS solitons is affected by the higher derivative corrections.
