Title: Effective scalar fields in Yang-Mills theories
Authors: H. Verschelde and V. I. Zakharov
Abstract: Scalar fields play a crucial role in the Standard model. On the other hand, in the weak-coupling regime there is an unsolved problem of the quadratic divergence of scalar masses. Thus, it is natural to turn to composite, or effective scalar fields in the strong-coupling regime. Lattice simulations provide information on the "actually existing" scalar fields in Yang-Mills theories. On the continuum-theory side, dual models predict existence of various low-dimension vacuum defects, including probably scalar particles. We are looking for correspondence between the two frameworks, of lattice phenomenology and dual models, and discuss possible applications to the theory of the Yang-Mills plasma in the deconfining phase. It is not ruled out that the effective scalars play important role in the plasma dynamics.
