Title: Spontaneous parity breaking and supersymmetry breaking in metastable  vacua with consistent cosmology
Authors: Debasish Borah and Urjit A. Yajnik
Abstract: We study the compatibility of spontaneous breaking of parity and successful cosmology in a left-right symmetric model where supersymmetry breaking is achieved in metastable vacua. We show that domain walls formed due to this breaking can be removed due to Planck scale suppressed terms, provided the parity breaking scale $M_R$ is constrained to remain smaller than $10^{10}-10^{11}$ GeV. Ensuring metastability is achieved naturally even if the entire mechanism operates at low scales, within a few orders of magnitude of the TeV scale. Taking $M_R$ as high as permitted, close to the acceptable reheat temperature after inflation, would require the magnetic phase of the Supersymmetric Quantum Chromodynamics (SQCD) to have set in before the end of inflation.
