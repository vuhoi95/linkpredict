Title: Logarithmic Entropy of Kehagias-Sfetsos black hole with Self-gravitation  in Asymptotically Flat IR Modified Horava Gravity
Authors: Molin Liu and Junwang Lu
Abstract: Motivated by recent logarithmic entropy of Ho$\check{r}$ava-Lifshitz gravity, we investigate Hawking radiation for Kehagias-Sfetsos black hole from tunneling perspective. After considering the effect of self-gravitation, we calculate the emission rate and entropy of quantum tunneling by using Kraus-Parikh-Wilczek method. Meanwhile, both massless and massive particles are considered in this letter. Interestingly, two types tunneling particles have the same emission rate $\Gamma$ and entropy $S_b$ whose analytical formulae are $\Gamma = \exp{[\pi (r_{in}^2 - r_{out}^2t)/2 + \pi/\alpha \ln r_{in}/r_{out}]}$ and $S_b = A/4 + \pi/\alpha \ln (A/4)$, respectively. Here, $\alpha$ is the Ho$\check{r}$ava-Lifshitz field parameter. The results show that the logarithmic entropy of Ho$\check{r}$ava-Lifshitz gravity could be explained well by the self-gravitation, which is totally different from other methods. The study of this semiclassical tunneling process may shed light on the understand of Ho$\check{r}$ava-Lifshitz gravity.
