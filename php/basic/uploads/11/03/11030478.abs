Title: Spectral Action from Anomalies
Authors: A. A. Andrianov and M. A. Kurkov and Fedele Lizzi
Abstract: Starting from a theory of fermions moving in a fixed gauge and gravitational background we implement the scale invariance of the theory. Upon quantization the theory is anomalous but the anomaly can be cancelled by the addition of another term to the action. This term comes out to be basically the Chamseddine Connes spectral action introduced in the context of noncommutative geometry. An alternative realization of the dilaton may involve a collective scalar mode of all fermions accumulated in a {scale-noninvariant} dilaton action. The entire spectral action describes gauge and Higgs fields coupled with gravity. Here this action is coupled with a dilaton and we discuss how it relates to the transition from the radiation to the electroweak broken phase via condensation of Higgs fields.
