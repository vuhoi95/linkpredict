Title: Properties of a consistent Lorentz-violating Abelian gauge theory
Authors: Jean Alexandre and Ariadni Vergou
Abstract: A Lorentz violating modification of massless QED is proposed, with higher order space derivatives for the photon field. The fermion dynamical mass generation is studied with the Schwinger-Dyson approach. Perturbative properties of the model are calculated at one-loop and discussed at higher-order loops, showing the consistency of the model. We explain that there is no contradiction with the definition of the speed of light c, although fermions see an an effective light cone, with a maximum speed smaller than c.
