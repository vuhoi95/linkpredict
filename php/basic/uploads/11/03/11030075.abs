Title: Anisotropy in Born-Infeld brane cosmology
Authors: Z. Haghani and H. R. Sepangi and S. Shahidi
Abstract: The accelerated expansion of the universe together with its present day isotropy has posed an interesting challenge to the numerous model theories presented over the years to describe them. In this paper, we address the above questions in the context of a brane-world model where the universe is filled with a Born-Infeld matter. We show that in such a model, the universe evolves from a highly anisotropic state to its present isotropic form which has entered an accelerated expanding phase.
