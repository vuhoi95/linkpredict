Abstract: We show a novel charge structure of baryons in electromagnetic field due to the chiral anomaly. A key connection is to treat baryons as solitons of mesons. We use Skyrmions to calculate the charge distributions in a single nucleon and find an additional charge. We also perform calculations of charge distribution for classical multi-baryons with B=2, 3,...,8 and 17; they show amusing charge distributions.
