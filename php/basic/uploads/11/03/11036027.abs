Title: Notes on a Cure for Higher-Spin Acausality
Authors: Massimo Porrati and Rakibur Rahman
Abstract: We present a Lagrangian describing a massive charged spin-2 field and a scalar in a constant electromagnetic background, and we provide a consistent description of the system. The Lagrangian, derived from string field theory through a suitable dimensional reduction, propagates the correct number of degrees of freedom within the light cone in any space-time dimension less than 26. We briefly discuss the higher-spin generalization of this construction, that cures the pathologies of a massive charged particle of arbitrary integer spin by introducing only finitely many new massive degrees of freedom.
