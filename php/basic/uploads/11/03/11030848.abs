Abstract: In this paper we apply in a systematic way a previously developed integration algorithm of the relevant Lax equation to the construction of spherical symmetric, asymptotically flat black hole solutions of N=2 supergravities with symmetric Special Geometry. Our main goal is the classification of these black-holes according to the H*-orbits in which the space of possible Lax operators decomposes, H* being the isotropy group of scalar manifold originating from time-like dimensional reduction of supergravity from D=4 to D=3 dimensions. The main result of our investigation is the construction of three universal tensors, extracted from quadratic and quartic powers of the Lax operator, that are capable of classifying both regular and nilpotent H* orbits of Lax operators. Our tensor based classification is compared, in the case of the simple one-field model S^3, to the algebraic classification of nilpotent orbits and it is shown to provide a simple and practical discriminating method. We present a detailed analysis of the S^3 model and its black hole solutions, discussing the Liouville integrability of the corresponding dynamical system. By means of the Kostant-representation of a generic Lie algebra element, we were able to develop an algorithm which produces the necessary number of hamiltonians in involution required by Liouville integrability of generic orbits. The degenerate orbits correspond to extremal black-holes and are nilpotent. We analyze these orbits in some detail working out different representatives thereof and showing that the relation between H* orbits and critical points of the geodesic potential is not one-to-one. Finally we present the conjecture that our newly identified tensor classifiers are universal and able to label all regular and nilpotent orbits in all homogeneous symmetric Special Geometries.
