Abstract: By solving the Einstein equations of the graviton coupling with a real scalar dilaton field, we establish a general framework to self-consistently solve the geometric background with black-hole for any given phenomenological holographic models. In this framwork, we solve the black-hole background, the corresponding dilaon field and the dilaton potential for the deformed AdS$_5$ model with a positive/negative quadratic correction. We systematically investigate the thermodynamical properties of the deformed AdS$_5$ model with a positive and negative quadratic correction, respectively, and compare with lattice QCD on the results of the equation of state, the heavy quark potential, the Polyakov loop and the spatial Wilson loop. We find that the bulk thermodynamical properties are not sensitive to the sign of the quadratic correction, and the results of both deformed holographic QCD models agree well with lattice QCD result for pure SU(3) gauge theory. However, the results from loop operators favor a positive quadratic correction, which agree well with lattice QCD result. Especially, the result from the Polyakov loop excludes the model with a negative quadratic correction in the warp factor of ${\rm AdS}_5$.
