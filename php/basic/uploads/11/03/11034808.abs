Title: Collapse of Charged Scalar Field in Dilaton Gravity
Authors: Anna Borkowska and Marek Rogatko and Rafal Moderski
Abstract: We elaborated the gravitational collapse of a self-gravitating complex charged scalar field in the context of the low-energy limit of the string theory, the so-called dilaton gravity. We begin with the regular spacetime and follow the evolution through the formation of an apparent horizon and the final central singularity.
