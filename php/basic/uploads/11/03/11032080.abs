Title: Chiral Properties of Strong Interactions in a Magnetic Background
Authors: Massimo D'Elia and Francesco Negro
Abstract: We investigate the chiral properties of QCD in presence of a magnetic background field and in the low temperature regime, by lattice numerical simulations of N_f = 2 QCD. We adopt a standard staggered discretization, with a pion mass around 200 MeV, and explore a range of magnetic fields (180 MeV)^2 \leq|e|B \leq (700 MeV)^2, in which we study magnetic catalysis, i.e. the increase of chiral symmetry breaking induced by the background field. We determine the dependence of the chiral condensate on the external field, compare our results with existing model predictions and show that a substantial contribution to magnetic catalysis comes from the modified distribution of non-Abelian gauge fields, induced by the magnetic field via dynamical quark loop effects.
