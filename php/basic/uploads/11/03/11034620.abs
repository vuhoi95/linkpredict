Title: A de Sitter Farey Tail
Authors: Alejandra Castro and Nima Lashkari and Alexander Maloney
Abstract: We consider quantum Einstein gravity in three dimensional de Sitter space. The Euclidean path integral is formulated as a sum over geometries, including both perturbative loop corrections and non-perturbative instanton corrections coming from geometries with non-trivial topology. These non-trivial geometries have a natural physical interpretation. Conventional wisdom states that the sphere is the unique Euclidean continuation of de Sitter space. However, when considering physics only in the causal patch of a single observer other Euclidean geometries, in this case lens spaces, contribute to physical observables. This induces quantum gravitational effects which lead to deviations from the standard thermal behaviour obtained by analytic continuation from the three sphere. The sum over these geometries can be formulated as a sum over cosets of the modular group; this is the de Sitter analog of the celebrated "black hole Farey tail." We compute the vacuum partition function including the sum over these geometries. Perturbative quantum corrections are computed to all orders in perturbation theory using the relationship between Einstein gravity and Chern-Simons theory, which is checked explicitly at tree and one-loop level using heat kernel techniques. The vacuum partition function, including all instanton and perturbative corrections, is shown to diverge in a way which can not be regulated using standard field theory techniques.
