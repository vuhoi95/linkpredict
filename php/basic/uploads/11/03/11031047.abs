Title: N=2 superparticle near horizon of extreme Kerr-Newman-AdS-dS black hole
Authors: Anton Galajinsky and Kirill Orekhov
Abstract: Conformal mechanics related to the near horizon extreme Kerr-Newman-AdS-dS black hole is studied. A unique N=2 supersymmetric extension of the conformal mechanics is constructed.
