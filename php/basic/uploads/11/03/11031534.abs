Title: Fermionic screening operators in the sine-Gordon model
Authors: M. Jimbo and T. Miwa and F. Smirnov
Abstract: Extending our previous construction in the sine-Gordon model, we show how to introduce two kinds of fermionic screening operators, in close analogy with conformal field theory with c<1.
