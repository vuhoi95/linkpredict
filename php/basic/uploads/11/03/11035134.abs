Title: A Gravitational Mechanism for Cosmological Screening
Authors: N. C. Tsamis and R. P. Woodard
Abstract: Infrared gravitons are continually produced during inflation. Like all particles, their contribution to the vacuum energy comes not only from their bare kinetic energy but also from the interactions they have with other gravitons. These interactions can be substantial -- despite the particles being highly infrared -- because they occur over the enormous spatial volume of the universe. Furthermore, the interactions grow with time evolution because more and more such gravitons come into causal contact with one another. Since gravity is universally attractive, these interactions can act to slow and eventually stop accelerated expansion.
