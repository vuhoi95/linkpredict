Title: Universal topological phase of 2D stabilizer codes
Authors: H. Bombin and Guillaume Duclos-Cianci and David Poulin
Abstract: Two topological phases are equivalent if they are connected by a local unitary transformation. In this sense, classifying topological phases amounts to classifying long-range entanglement patterns. We show that all 2D topological stabilizer codes are equivalent to several copies of one universal phase: Kitaev's topological code. Error correction benefits from the corresponding local mappings.
