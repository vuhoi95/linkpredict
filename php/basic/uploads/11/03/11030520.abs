Title: Hair in the Back of a Throat: Non-Supersymmetric Multi-Center Solutions  from KÃ¤hler Manifolds
Authors: Nikolay Bobev and Ben Niehoff and Nicholas P. Warner
Abstract: We find a class of non-supersymmetric multi-center solutions of the STU model of five-dimensional ungauged supergravity. The solutions are determined by a system of linear equations defined on a four-dimensional K\"ahler manifold with vanishing Ricci scalar and a U(1) isometry. The most general class of such K\"ahler manifolds was studied by LeBrun and they have non-trivial 2-cycles that can support the topological fluxes characteristic of bubbled geometries. After imposing an additional U(1) symmetry on the base we find explicit multi-center supergravity solutions. We show that there is an infinite number of regular multi-center solutions with non-trivial topology that are asymptotic to the near-horizon limit of a BMPV black hole.
