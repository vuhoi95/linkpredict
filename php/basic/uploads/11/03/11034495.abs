Title: Gauge theories on Omega-backgrounds from non commutative Seiberg-Witten  curves
Authors: F. Fucito and J. F. Morales and R. Poghossian and D. Ricci Pacifici
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a N=2 supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theory with fundamental or adjoint matter in presence of a non trivial Omega-background along a two dimensional plane. The prepotential and chiral correlators of the gauge theory can be obtained, via a saddle point analysis, from an equation which can be viewed as a non commutative version of the "standard" Seiberg and Witten curve.
