Abstract: A free massive scalar field in inhomogeneous random media is investigated. The coefficients of the Klein-Gordon equation are taken to be random functions of the spatial coordinates. The case of an annealed-like disordered medium, modeled by centered stationary and Gaussian processes, is analyzed. After performing the averages over the random functions, we obtain the two-point causal Green's function of the model up to one-loop. The disordered scalar quantum field theory becomes qualitatively similar to a $\lambda\phi^{4}$ self-interacting theory with a frequency-dependent coupling.
