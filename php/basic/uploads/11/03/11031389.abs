Title: Supersymmetry Breaking and Dilaton Stabilization in String Gas Cosmology
Authors: Sasmita Mishra and Wei Xue and Robert Brandenberger and Urjit Yajnik
Abstract: In this Note we study supersymmetry breaking via gaugino condensation in string gas cosmology. We show that the same gaugino condensate which is introduced to stabilize the dilaton breaks supersymmetry. We study the constraints on the scale of supersymmetry breaking which this mechanism leads to.
