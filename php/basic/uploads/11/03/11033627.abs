Title: The Heat Kernel on $AdS$
Authors: Rajesh Gopakumar and Rajesh Kumar Gupta and Shailesh Lal
Abstract: We explicitly evaluate the heat kernel for the Laplacian of arbitrary spin tensor fields on the thermal quotient of (Euclidean) $AdS_N$ for $N\geq 3$ using the group theoretic techniques employed for $AdS_3$ in arXiv:0911.5085. Our approach is general and can be used, in principle, for other quotients as well as other symmetric spaces.
