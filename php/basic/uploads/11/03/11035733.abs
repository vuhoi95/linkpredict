Title: SO(5,5) duality in M-theory and generalized geometry
Authors: David S. Berman and Hadi Godazgar and Malcolm J. Perry
Abstract: We attempt to reformulate eleven dimensional supergravity in terms of an object that unifies the three-form and the metric and makes the M-theory duality group manifest. This short note deals with the case of where the U-duality group SO(5,5) acts in five spatial dimensions.
