Title: On the thermodynamics of Lifshitz black holes
Authors: Deniz Olgu Devecioglu and Ozgur Sarioglu
Abstract: We apply the recently extended conserved Killing charge definition of Abbott-Deser-Tekin formalism to compute, for the first time, the energies of analytic Lifshitz black holes in higher dimensions. We then calculate the temperature and the entropy of this large family of solutions, and study and discuss the first law of black hole thermodynamics. Along the way we also identify the possible critical points of the relevant quadratic curvature gravity theories. Separately, we also apply the generalized Killing charge definition to compute the energy and the angular momentum of the warped AdS_3 black hole solution of the three-dimensional New Massive Gravity theory.
