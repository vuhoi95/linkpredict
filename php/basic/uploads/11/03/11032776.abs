Title: The Bond-Algebraic Approach to Dualities
Authors: Emilio Cobanera and Gerardo Ortiz and Zohar Nussinov
Abstract: An algebraic theory of dualities is developed based on the notion of bond algebras. It deals with classical and quantum dualities in a unified fashion explaining the precise connection between quantum dualities and the low temperature (strong-coupling)/high temperature (weak-coupling) dualities of classical statistical mechanics (or (Euclidean) path integrals). Its range of applications includes discrete lattice, continuum field, and gauge theories. Dualities are revealed to be local, structure-preserving mappings between model-specific bond algebras that can be implemented as unitary transformations, or partial isometries if gauge symmetries are involved. This characterization permits to search systematically for dualities and self-dualities in quantum models of arbitrary system size, dimensionality and complexity, and any classical model admitting a transfer matrix representation. Dualities like exact dimensional reduction, emergent, and gauge-reducing dualities that solve gauge constraints can be easily understood in terms of mappings of bond algebras. As a new example, we show that the (\mathbb{Z}_2) Higgs model is dual to the extended toric code model {\it in any number of dimensions}. Non-local dual variables and Jordan-Wigner dictionaries are derived from the local mappings of bond algebras. Our bond-algebraic approach goes beyond the standard approach to classical dualities, and could help resolve the long standing problem of obtaining duality transformations for lattice non-Abelian models. As an illustration, we present new dualities in any spatial dimension for the quantum Heisenberg model. Finally, we discuss various applications including location of phase boundaries, spectral behavior and, notably, we show how bond-algebraic dualities help constrain and realize fermionization in an arbitrary number of spatial dimensions.
