Title: New and old N=8 superconformal field theories in three dimensions
Authors: Denis Bashkirov and Anton Kapustin
Abstract: We show that an infinite family of N=6 d=3 superconformal Chern-Simons-matter theories has hidden N=8 superconformal symmetry and hidden parity on the quantum level. This family of theories is different from the one found by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis and Maldacena, as well as from the theories constructed by Bagger and Lambert, and Gustavsson. We also test several conjectural dualities between BLG theories and ABJ theories by comparing superconformal indices of these theories.
