Title: Analytic solutions in non-linear massive gravity
Authors: Kazuya Koyama and Gustavo Niz and Gianmassimo Tasinato
Abstract: We study spherically symmetric solutions in a covariant massive gravity model, which is a candidate for a ghost-free non-linear completion of the Fierz-Pauli theory. There is a branch of solutions that exhibits the Vainshtein mechanism, recovering General Relativity below a Vainshtein radius given by $(r_g m^2)^{1/3}$, where $m$ is the graviton mass and $r_g$ is the Schwarzschild radius of a matter source. Another branch of exact solutions exists, corresponding to Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetimes where the curvature scale of de Sitter space is proportional to the mass squared of the graviton.
