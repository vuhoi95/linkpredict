Title: Free Differential Algebras and Pure Spinor Action in IIB Superstring  Sigma Models
Authors: Ichiro Oda and Mario Tonin
Abstract: In this paper we extend to the case of IIB superstring sigma models the method proposed in hep-th/10023500 to derive the pure spinor approach for type IIA sigma models. In particular, starting from the (Free) Differential Algebra and superspace parametrization of type IIB supergravity, extended to include the BRST differential and all the ghosts, we derive the BRST transformations of fields and ghosts as well as the standard pure spinor constraints for the ghosts $\lambda $ related to supersymmetry. Moreover, using the method first proposed by us, we derive the pure spinor action for type IIB superstrings in curved supergravity backgrounds (on shell), in full agreement with the action first obtained by Berkovits and Howe.
