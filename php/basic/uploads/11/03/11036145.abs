Authors: D. Arnaudov and R. C. Rashkov and T. Vetsov
Abstract: Recently there has been progress on the calculation of n-point correlation functions with two "heavy" (with large quantum numbers) states at strong coupling. We extend these findings by computing three-point functions corresponding to a folded three-spin semiclassical string with one angular momentum in AdS and two equal spins in the sphere. We recover previous results as limiting cases. Also, following a recent paper by Buchbinder and Tseytlin, we provide relevant four-point functions and consider some of their limits.
