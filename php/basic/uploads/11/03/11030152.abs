Title: An Exact Conformal Symmetry Ansatz on Kaluza-Klein Reduced TMG
Authors: George Moutsopoulos and Patricia Ritter
Abstract: Using a Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction, and further imposing a conformal Killing symmetry on the reduced metric generated by the dilaton, we show an Ansatz that yields many of the known stationary axisymmetric solutions to TMG.
