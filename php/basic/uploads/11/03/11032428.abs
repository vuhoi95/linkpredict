Authors: Kazuo Ghoroku and Tomoki Taminato and Fumihiko Toyoda
Abstract: We study the Regge trajectories of holographic mesons and baryons by considering rotating strings and D5 brane, which is introduced as the baryon vertex. Our model is based on the type IIB superstring theory with the background of asymptotic $AdS_5\times S^5$. This background is dual to a confining supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (SYM) with gauge condensate, $<F^2>$, which determines the tension of the linear potential between the quark and anti-quark. Then the slope of the meson trajectory ($\alpha'_{M}$) is given by this condensate as $\alpha'_{M}=1/\sqrt{\pi <F^2>}$ at large spin $J$. This relation is compatible with the other theoretical results and experiments. For the baryon, we show the importance of spinning baryon vertex to obtain a Regge slope compatible with the one of $N$ and $\Delta$ series. In both cases, mesons and baryons, the trajectories are shifted to large mass side with the same slope for increasing current quark mass.
