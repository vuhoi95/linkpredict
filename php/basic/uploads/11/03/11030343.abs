Title: Stability of f(R) black holes
Authors: Yun Soo Myung and Taeyoon Moon and Edwin J. Son
Abstract: We investigate the stability of $f(R)$ (Schwarzschild) black hole obtained from the $f(R)$ gravity. It is difficult to carry out the perturbation analysis around the black hole because the linearized Einstein equation is fourth order in $f(R)$ gravity. In order to resolve this difficulty, we transform $f(R)$ gravity into the scalar-tensor theory by introducing two auxiliary scalars. In this case, the linearized curvature scalar becomes a scalaron, showing that all linearized equations are second order, which are the same equations for the massive Brans-Dicke theory. It turns out that the $f(R)$ black hole is stable against the external perturbations if the scalaron does not have a tachyonic mass.
