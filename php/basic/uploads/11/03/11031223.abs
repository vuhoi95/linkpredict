Authors: Shoichi Kawamoto and Tomohisa Takimi and Dan Tomino
Abstract: In this paper, we study the equations of motion for non-Abelian N=(2,0) tensor multiplets in six dimensions, which were recently proposed by Lambert and Papageorgakis. Some equations are regarded as constraint equations. We employ a loop extension of the Lorentzian three-algebra (3-algebra) and examine the equations of motion around various solutions of the constraint equations. The resultant equations take forms that allow Lagrangian descriptions. We find various (5+d)-dimensional Lagrangians and investigate the relation between them from the viewpoint of M-theory duality.
