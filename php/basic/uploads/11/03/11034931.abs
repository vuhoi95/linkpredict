Title: The relationship between a topological Yang-Mills field and a magnetic  monopole
Authors: Nobuyuki Fukui and Kei-Ichi Kondo and Akihiro Shibata and Toru Shinohara
Abstract: We show that a Jackiw-Nohl-Rebbi solution, as the most general two-instanton, generates a circular loop of magnetic monopole in four-dimensional Euclidean SU(2) Yang-Mills theory.
