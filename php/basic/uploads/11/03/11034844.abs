Title: Nonperturbative aspects of ABJM theory
Authors: Nadav Drukker and Marcos Marino and Pavel Putrov
Abstract: Using the matrix model which calculates the exact free energy of ABJM theory on S^3 we study non-perturbative effects in the large N expansion of this model, i.e., in the genus expansion of type IIA string theory on AdS4xCP^3. We propose a general prescription to extract spacetime instanton actions from general matrix models, in terms of period integrals of the spectral curve, and we use it to determine them explicitly in the ABJM matrix model, as exact functions of the 't Hooft coupling. We confirm numerically that these instantons control the asymptotic growth of the genus expansion. Furthermore, we find that the dominant instanton action at strong coupling determined in this way exactly matches the action of an Euclidean D2-brane instanton wrapping RP^3.
