Title: Soliton-antisoliton pair production in particle collisions
Authors: S. V. Demidov and D. G. Levkov
Abstract: We propose general semiclassical method for computing the probability of soliton-antisoliton pair production in particle collisions. The method is illustrated by explicit numerical calculations in (1+1)-dimensional scalar field model. We find that the probability of the process is suppressed by an exponentially small factor which is almost constant at high energies.
