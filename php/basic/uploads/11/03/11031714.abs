Authors: Jiunn-Wei Chen and Yu-Sheng Liu and Debaprasad Maity
Abstract: A holographic model of $d+id$ superconductors based on the action proposed by Benini, Herzog, and Yarom [arXiv:1006.0731] is studied. This model has a charged spin two field in an AdS black hole spacetime. Working in the probe limit, the normalizable solution of the spin two field in the bulk gives rise to a $d+id$ superconducting order parameter at the boundary of the AdS. We calculate the fermion spectral function in this\ superconducting background and confirm the existence of fermi arcs for non-vanishing Majorana couplings. By changing the relative strength $\gamma $ of the $d$ and $id$ condensations, the position and the size of the fermi arcs are changed. When $\gamma =1$, the spectrum becomes isotropic and the spectral function is s-wave like. By changing the fermion mass, the fermi momentum is changed. We also calculate the conductivity for these holographic $d+id$ superconductors where time reversal symmetry has been broken spontaneously. A non-vanishing Hall conductivity is obtained even without an external magnetic field.
