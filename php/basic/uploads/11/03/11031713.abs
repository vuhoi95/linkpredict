Title: Entropic derivation of F=ma for circular motion
Authors: Michael Duncan and Ratbay Myrzakulov and Douglas Singleton
Abstract: We examine the entropic picture of Newton's second law for the case of circular motion. It is shown that one must make modifications to the derivation of F=ma due to a change in the effective Unruh temperature for circular motion. These modifications present a challenge to the entropic derivation of Newton's second law, but also open up the possibility to experimentally test and constrain this model for large centripetal accelerations.
