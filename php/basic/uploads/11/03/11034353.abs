Authors: Burkhard Eden and Paul Heslop and Gregory P. Korchemsky and Emery Sokatchev
Abstract: We continue the study of the duality between super-correlators and scattering super-amplitudes in planar N=4 SYM. We provide a number of further examples supporting the conjectured duality relation between these two seemingly different objects. We consider the five- and six-point one-loop NMHV and the six-point tree-level NNMHV amplitudes, obtaining them from the appropriate correlators of strength tensor multiplets in N=4 SYM. In particular, we find exact agreement between the rather non-trivial parity-odd sector of the integrand of the six-point one-loop NMHV amplitude, as obtained from the correlator or from BCFW recursion relations. Together these results lead to the conjecture that the integrands of any N^kMHV amplitude at any loop order in planar N=4 SYM can be described by the correlators of stress-tensor multiplets.
