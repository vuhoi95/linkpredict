Title: Old issues and linear sigma models
Authors: Jock McOrist and Ilarion V. Melnikov
Abstract: Using mirror symmetry, we resolve an old puzzle in the linear sigma model description of the spacetime Higgs mechanism in a heterotic string compactification with (2,2) worldsheet supersymmetry. The resolution has a nice spacetime interpretation via the normalization of physical fields and suggests that with a little care deformations of the linear sigma model can describe heterotic Higgs branches.
