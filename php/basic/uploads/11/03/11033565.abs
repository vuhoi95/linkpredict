Title: A Codicil To Massless Gauge Superfields of Higher Integer Superspins
Authors: S. James Gates, Jr. and Konstantinos Koutrolikos
Abstract: We study theories of 4D, N=1 supersymmetric massless, arbitrary integer superspins. A new state-of-the art is being established by the discovery of a new series of such theories for arbitrary superspin Y (Y=s for any integer s) The lowest member of the series is surprisingly found to be a previously established formulation of the spin (3/2, 1) supermultiplet.
