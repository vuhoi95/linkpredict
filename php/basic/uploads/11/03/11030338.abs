Title: Response to Shalaby's Comment on "Families of Particles with Different  Masses in PT-Symmetric Quantum Field Theory"
Authors: Carl M. Bender and S. P. Klevansky
Abstract: In a recent Comment [arXiv: 1101.3980] Shalaby criticised our paper "Families of Particles with Different Masses in PT-Symmetric Quantum Field Theory" [arXiv:1002.3253]. On examining his arguments, we find that there are serious flaws at almost every stage of his Comment. In view of space and time considerations, we point out the major flaws that render his arguments invalid. Essentially Shalaby is attempting to obtain our results from a variational principle and to find a physical interpretation of his calculation. The variational procedure that he uses is inapplicable, and his description of the physics is wrong. We thus refute his criticism on all levels.
