Title: An Analytic Analysis of Phase Transitions in Holographic Superconductors
Authors: Chiang-Mei Chen and Ming-Fan Wu
Abstract: Using a simple analytic approach, we study the universal properties of second-order phase transition in holographic superconductor models. We explore a general model in arbitrary dimensions in which the condensation occurs via the St\"uckelberg spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism. All the possible second-order phase transitions and their universal characteristics can be identified analytically. The relationship between the critical temperature and charge density is generic, and the critical exponents can be greater than the typical mean field value 1/2. In addition, the related numerical factors can also be computed qualitatively.
