Title: Electromagnetic Excitations of Hall Systems on Four Dimensional Space
Authors: Mohammed Daoud and Ahmed Jellal and Abdellah Oueld Guejdi
Abstract: The noncommutativity of a four-dimensional phase space is introduced from a purely symplectic point of view. We show that there is always a coordinate map to locally eliminate the gauge fluctuations inducing the deformation of the symplectic structure. This uses the Moser's lemma; a refined version of the celebrated Darboux theorem. We discuss the relation between the coordinates change arising from Moser's lemma and the Seiberg--Witten map. As illustration, we consider the quantum Hall systems on CP^2. We derive the action describing the electromagnetic interaction of Hall droplets. In particular, we show that the velocities of the edge field, along the droplet boundary, are noncommutativity parameters-dependents.
