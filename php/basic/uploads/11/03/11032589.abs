Title: BPS Monopole Equation in Omega-background
Authors: Katsushi Ito and Satoshi Kamoshita and Shin Sasaki
Abstract: We study deformed supersymmetries in N=2 super Yang-Mills theory in the Omega-backgrounds characterized by two complex parameters $\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2$. When one of the $\epsilon$-parameters vanishes, the theory has extended supersymmetries. We compute the central charge of the algebra and obtain the deformed BPS monopole equation. We examine supersymmetries preserved by the equation.
