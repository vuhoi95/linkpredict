Title: Fermionic T-duality and momenta noncommutativity
Authors: Bojan Nikolic and Branislav Sazdovic
Abstract: In this article we establish the relationship between fermionic T-duality and momenta noncommuativity. This is extension of known relation between bosonic T-duality and coordinate noncommutativity. The case of open string propagating in background of the type IIB superstring theory has been considered. We perform T-duality with respect to the fermionic variables instead to the bosonic ones. We also choose Dirichlet boundary conditions at the string endpoints, which lead to the momenta noncommutativity, instead Neumann ones which lead to the coordinates noncommutativity. Finally, we establish the main result of the article that momenta noncommutativity parameters are just fermionic T-dual fields.
