Title: Walls of massive KÃ¤hler sigma models on SO(2N)/U(N) and Sp(N)/U(N)
Authors: Masato Arai and Sunyoung Shin
Abstract: We study the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield wall solutions in massive K\"ahler nonlinear sigma models on SO(2N)/U(N) and Sp(N)/U(N) in three-dimensional spacetime. We show that SO(2N)/U(N) and Sp(N)/U(N) models have 2^{N-1} and 2^N discrete vacua, respectively. We explicitly construct the exact BPS multiwall solutions for N\le 3.
