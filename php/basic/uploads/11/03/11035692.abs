Title: All-order uniform momentum bounds for the massless phi^4 theory in four  dimensional Euclidean space
Authors: Riccardo Guida and Christoph Kopper
Abstract: A panoramic overview is given, of a theorem [1] establishing physical and uniform bounds on the Fourier-transformed Schwinger functions of a massless phi^4 theory in four Euclidean dimensions, at any loop order in perturbation theory.
