Title: Supersymmetry of consistent massive truncations of IIB supergravity
Authors: James T. Liu and Phillip Szepietowski
Abstract: We discuss the supersymmetry and fermionic sector of the recently obtained consistent truncations of IIB supergravity containing massive modes. In particular, we present the general form of the five-dimensional N = 4 supersymmetry transformations and equations of motion for the fermions arising in the reduction of IIB theory on T^{1,1} which contains all modes invariant under the SU(2) x SU(2) isometry group. The N = 4 reduction can be further truncated to two different N = 2 sub-sectors. For each of these, we present the N = 2 fermionic supersymmetry transformations and corresponding superpotentials. As an application, we obtain the explicit Killing spinors of the Klebanov-Strassler solution and comment on the relation to the ansatz of Papadopoulos and Tseytlin. We also demonstrate the applicability of consistent truncations on squashed Sasaki-Einstein manifolds to a class of flux compactifications, focusing on a recent solution describing the geometry of gaugino condensation on wrapped D7 branes and which possesses dynamic SU(2) structure.
