Title: A Novel Formula for Bulk Viscosity from the Null Horizon Focusing  Equation
Authors: Christopher Eling and Yaron Oz
Abstract: The null horizon focusing equation is equivalent via the fluid/gravity correspondence to the entropy balance law of the fluid. Using this equation we derive a simple novel formula for the bulk viscosity of the fluid. The formula is expressed in terms of the dependence of scalar fields at the horizon on thermodynamic variables such as the entropy and charge densities. We apply the formula to three classes of gauge theory plasmas: non-conformal branes, perturbations of the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and holographic models of QCD, and discuss its range of applicability.
