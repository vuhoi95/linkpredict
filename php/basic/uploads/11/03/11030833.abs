Title: Landau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence via quasi-maps
Authors: Jinwon Choi and Young-Hoon Kiem
Abstract: The Landau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence claims that the Gromov-Witten invariant of the quintic Calabi-Yau 3-fold should be related to the Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten invariant of the associated Landau-Ginzburg model via wall crossings. In this paper, we consider the stack of quasi-maps with a cosection and introduce sequences of stability conditions which enable us to interpolate the moduli stacks for Gromov-Witten and Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten invariants.
