Title: Analytical Studies on Holographic Insulator/Superconductor Phase  Transitions
Authors: Rong-Gen Cai and Huai-Fan Li and Hai-Qing Zhang
Abstract: We investigate the analytical properties of the s-wave and p-wave holographic insulator/superconductor phase transitions at zero temperature. In the probe limit, we analytically calculate the critical chemical potentials at which the insulator/superconductor phase transition occurs. Those resulting analytical values perfectly match the previous numerical values. We also study the relations between the condensation values and the chemical potentials near the critical point. We find that the critical exponent for condensation operator is 1/2 for both models. The linear relations between the charge density and the chemical potential near the critical point are also deduced in this paper, which are qualitatively consistent with the previous numerical results.
