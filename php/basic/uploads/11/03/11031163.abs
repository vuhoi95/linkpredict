Title: ABJM Dibaryon Spectroscopy
Authors: Jeff Murugan and Andrea Prinsloo
Abstract: We extend the proposal for a detailed map between wrapped D-branes in Anti-de Sitter space and baryon-like operators in the associated dual conformal field theory provided in hep-th/0202150 to the recently formulated AdS_4 \times CP^3/ABJM correspondence. In this example, the role of the dibaryon operator of the 3-dimensional CFT is played by a D4-brane wrapping a CP^2 \subset CP^3. This topologically stable D-brane in the AdS_4 \times CP^3 is nothing but one-half of the maximal giant graviton on CP^3.
