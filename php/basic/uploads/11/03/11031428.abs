Title: Graviton propagator asymptotics and the classical limit of ELPR/FK spin  foam models
Authors: Aleksandar Mikovic and Marko Vojinovic
Abstract: We study the classical limit of the ELPR/FK spin foam models by analyzing the large-distance asymptotics of the corresponding graviton propagators. This is done by examining the large-spin asymptotics of the Hartle-Hawking wavefunction which is peaked around a classical flat spatial geometry. By using the stationary phase method we determine the wavefunction asymptotics. The obtained asymptotics does not give the desired large-distance asymptotics for the corresponding graviton propagator. However, we show that the ELPR/FK vertex amplitude can be redefined such that the corresponding Hartle-Hawking wavefunction gives the desired asymptotics for the graviton propagator.
