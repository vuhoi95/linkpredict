Title: Amplitudes and Ultraviolet Behavior of N=8 Supergravity
Authors: Zvi Bern and John Joseph Carrasco and Lance Dixon and Henrik Johansson and Radu Roiban
Abstract: In this contribution we describe computational tools that permit the evaluation of multi-loop scattering amplitudes in N=8 supergravity, in terms of amplitudes in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory. We also discuss the remarkable ultraviolet behavior of N=8 supergravity, which follows from these amplitudes, and is as good as that of N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory through at least four loops.
