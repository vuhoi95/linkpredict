Title: Eliminating infrared divergences in an inflationary cosmology
Authors: Diego Chialva and Anupam Mazumdar
Abstract: We study the infrared divergences arising from gravitational loops in the standard cosmological perturbation theory. We provide a simple solution to the problem at all orders of cosmological perturbation theory by redefining the perturbation theory in terms of a local observer. We propose to reformulate the standard perturbations in the in-in formalism, and obtain an infrared safe perturbation theory. Our results do not depend on any infrared cutoffs or similar parameters. We then present an explicit example of graviton one-loop corrections, and briefly discuss non-gaussianities.
