Title: Flavor Oscillation from the Two-Point Function
Authors: Mario Martone and Dean J. Robinson
Abstract: We present a formalism for the flavor oscillation of unstable particles that relies only upon the structure of the time Fourier-transformed two-point Green's function. We derive exact oscillation probability and integrated oscillation probability formulae, and verify that our results reproduce the known results for both neutrino and neutral meson oscillation in the expected regimes of parameter space. The generality of our approach permits us to investigate flavor oscillation in exotic parameter regimes, and present the corresponding oscillation formulae.
