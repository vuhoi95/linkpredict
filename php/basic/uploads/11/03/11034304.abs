Title: Higher Spin Black Holes
Authors: Michael Gutperle and Per Kraus
Abstract: We study classical solutions of three dimensional higher spin gravity in the Chern-Simons formulation. We find solutions that generalize the BTZ black hole and carry spin-3 charge. The black hole entropy formula yields a result for the asymptotic growth of the partition function at finite spin-3 chemical potential. Along the way, we develop technology for computing AdS/CFT correlation functions involving higher spin operators.
