Title: Spiky Strings on NS5-branes
Authors: Sagar Biswas and Kamal L. Panigrahi
Abstract: We study rigidly rotating strings in the near horizon geometry of a stack of Neveu-Schwarz (NS) 5-branes. We solve the Nambu-Goto action of the fundamental string in the presence of a NS-NS two form $(B_{\mu\nu})$ and find out limiting cases corresponding to magnon and spike like solutions.
