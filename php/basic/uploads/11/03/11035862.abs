Title: On the geometry of KÃ¤hler-Poisson structures
Authors: Joakim Arnlind and Gerhard Huisken
Abstract: We prove that the Riemannian geometry of almost K\"ahler manifolds can be expressed in terms of the Poisson algebra of smooth functions on the manifold. Subsequently, K\"ahler-Poisson algebras are introduced, and it is shown that a corresponding purely algebraic theory of geometry and curvature can be developed. As an illustration of the new concepts we give an algebraic proof of the statement that a bound on the (algebraic) Ricci curvature induces a bound on the eigenvalues of the (algebraic) Laplace operator, in analogy with the well-known theorem in Riemannian geometry. As the correspondence between Poisson brackets of smooth functions and commutators of operators lies at the heart of quantization, a purely Poisson algebraic proof of, for instance, such a "Gap Theorem", might lead to an understanding of spectral properties in a corresponding quantum mechanical system.
