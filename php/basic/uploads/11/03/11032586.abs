Abstract: We study the halo mass function in the presence of the kurtosis type of primordial non-Gaussianity. The kurtosis corresponds to the trispectrum as defined in Fourier space. The primordial trispectrum is commonly characterized by two parameters, $\tau_{\rm NL}$ and $g_{\rm NL}$. As applications of the derived non-Gaussian mass function, we consider the effect on the abundance of void structure, the effect on early star formation and on formation of the most massive object at high redshift. We show that by comparing the effects of primordial non-Gaussianity on cluster abundance with that on void abundance, we can distinguish between the skewness and the kurtosis types of primordial non-Gaussianity. As for early star formation, we show that the kurtosis type of primordial non-Gaussianity seems not to affect the reionization history of the Universe on average. However, at high redshifts (up to $z\simeq 20$) such non-Gaussianity does somewhat affect the early stages of reionization.
