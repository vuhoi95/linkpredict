Title: Soliton pair creation in classical wave scattering
Authors: S. V. Demidov and D. G. Levkov
Abstract: We study classical production of soliton-antisoliton pairs from colliding wave packets in (1+1)-dimensional scalar field model. Wave packets represent multiparticle states in quantum theory; we characterize them by energy E and particle number N. Sampling stochastically over the forms of wave packets, we find the entire region in (E,N) plane which corresponds to classical creation of soliton pairs. Particle number is parametrically large within this region meaning that the probability of soliton-antisoliton pair production in few-particle collisions is exponentially suppressed.
