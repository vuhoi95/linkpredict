Title: Chaos Rules out Integrability of Strings in AdS_5 x T^{1,1}
Authors: Pallab Basu and Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas
Abstract: We show that certain classical string configurations in AdS_5 x T^{1,1} are chaotic. This answers the question of integrability of string on such backgrounds in the negative. We consider a string localized in the center of AdS_5 that winds around two circles of T^{1,1}. The corresponding dynamical system is equivalent to two coupled gravitational pendula and allows a very intuitive understanding. We find conclusive evidence of chaotic behavior by systematically analyzing the workings of the KAM theorem. We also show that the largest Lyapunov exponent is positive.
