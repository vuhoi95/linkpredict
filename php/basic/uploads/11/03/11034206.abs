Title: On the evaluation of form factors and correlation functions for the  integrable spin-s XXZ chains via the fusion method
Authors: Tetsuo Deguchi and Chihiro Matsui
Abstract: Revising the derivation of the previous papers, for the integrable spin-$s$ XXZ chain we express any form factor in terms of a single sum over scalar products of the spin-1/2 XXZ chain. With the revised method we express the spin-$s$ XXZ correlation function of any given entry at zero temperature in terms of a single sum of multiple integrals.
