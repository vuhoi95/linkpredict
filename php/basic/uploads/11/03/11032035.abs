Authors: Defu Hou and Hui Liu and Hai-cang Ren
Abstract: In this paper, we shall address some field theoretic issues regarding the chiral magnetic effect. The general structure of the magnetic current consistent with the electromagnetic gauge invariance is obtained and the impact of the infrared divergence is examined. Some subtleties on the relation between the chiral magnetic effect and the axial anomaly are clarified through a careful examination of the infrared limit of the relevant thermal diagrams.
