Title: Holographic three-point functions of giant gravitons
Authors: Agnese Bissi and Charlotte Kristjansen and Donovan Young and Konstantinos Zoubos
Abstract: Working within the AdS/CFT correspondence we calculate the three-point function of two giant gravitons and one pointlike graviton using methods of semiclassical string theory and considering both the case where the giant gravitons wrap an S^3 in S^5 and the case where the giant gravitons wrap an S^3 in AdS_5. We likewise calculate the correlation function in N=4 SYM using two Schur polynomials and a single trace chiral primary. We find that the gauge and string theory results have structural similarities but do not match perfectly, and interpret this in terms of the Schur polynomials' inability to interpolate between dual giant and pointlike gravitons.
