Abstract: We consider a cosmology in which the final stage of the Universe is neither accelerating nor decelerating, but approaches an asymptotic state where the scale factor becomes a constant value. In order to achieve this, we first bring in a scale factor with the desired property and then determine the details of the energy contents as a result of the cosmological evolution equations. We show that such a scenario can be realized if we introduce a generalized quintom model which consists of a scalar field and a phantom with a {\it negative} cosmological constant term. The standard cold dark matter with $w_m=0$ is also introduced. This is possible basically due to the balance between the matter and the {\it negative} cosmological constant which tend to attract and scalar field and phantom which repel in the asymptotic region. The stability analysis shows that this asymptotic solution is classically stable.
