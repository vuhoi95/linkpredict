Title: Finite Temperature Structure of the Compactified Standard Model
Authors: Jonathan M. Arnold and Bartosz Fornal and Koji Ishiwata
Abstract: We analyze the finite temperature structure of the standard model coupled to gravity with one and two dimensions compactified (on a circle and a torus). We find that finite temperature effects wash out any vacua which exist at zero temperature. We also discuss the possibility of transitions between the four-dimensional universe and the lower-dimensional spacetimes.
