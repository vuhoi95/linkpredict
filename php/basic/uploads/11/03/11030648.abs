Title: Non-supersymmetric CS-matter theories with known AdS duals
Authors: Davide Forcella and Alberto Zaffaroni
Abstract: We consider three dimensional conformal field theories living on a stack of N anti-M2 branes at the tip of eight-dimensional supersymmetric cones. The corresponding supergravity solution is obtained by changing sign to the four-form in the Freund-Rubin solution representing M2 branes ("skew-whiffing" transformation) and it is known to be stable. The existence of these non supersymmetric, stable field theories, at least in the large N limit, is a peculiarity of the AdS4/CFT3 correspondence with respect to the usual AdS5/CFT4, and it is worthwhile to study it. We analyze in detail the KK spectrum of the skew-whiffed solution associated with S^7/Z_k and we speculate on the natural field content for a candidate non-supersymmetric dual field theory.
