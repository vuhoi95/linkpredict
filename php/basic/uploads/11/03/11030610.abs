Title: An Optical Geometry Perspective on the Emerging Conformal Field Theory  Behavior on the Cosmological Event Horizon: Massless Fermions on de Sitter  Space
Authors: Pawel O. Mazur and Pawel J. Morawiec
Abstract: We have investigated the emerging conformal field theory behavior on the interior interface of the region near the cosmological event horizon on an example of massless Dirac fermions. Indeed, we have constructed and verified the emerging de Sitter/CFT correspondence for the near cosmological event horizon region. It is in this near horizon region where the infinitely thin shell of matter with the stiffest equation of state (Zeldovich's matter) is placed in the model for a thermodynamically stable `would be black hole' which is sometimes called a gravastar or a dark energy star. We put forward the hypothesis to the effect that the Zeldovich matter consists of the strongly correlated quanta which are best described by the emerging conformal field theory in the near `would be horizon' region of a gravastar/dark energy star.
