Title: Spacelike localization of long-range fields in a model of asymptotic  electrodynamics
Authors: Andrzej Herdegen and Katarzyna Rejzner
Abstract: A previously proposed algebra of asymptotic fields in quantum electrodynamics is formulated as a net of algebras localized in regions which in general have unbounded spacelike extension. Electromagnetic fields may be localized in `symmetrical spacelike cones', but there are strong indications this is not possible in the present model for charged fields, which have tails extending in all space directions. Nevertheless, products of appropriately `dressed' fermion fields (with compensating charges) yield bi-localized observables.
