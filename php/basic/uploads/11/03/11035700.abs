Title: A Duality Appetizer
Authors: Daniel Jafferis and Xi Yin
Abstract: We propose that the three-dimensional N=2 SU(2) Chern-Simons theory at level 1 coupled to an adjoint chiral multiplet with no superpotential is equivalent to the free field theory consisting of a single massless N=2 chiral multiplet. In particular, we show that the two theories have the identical "Z-function" and identical superconformal index.
