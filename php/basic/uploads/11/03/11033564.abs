Title: A Codicil To Massless Gauge Superfields of Higher Half-Odd Integer  Superspins
Authors: S. James Gates, Jr. and Konstantinos Koutrolikos
Abstract: We study theories of 4D, N=1 supersymmetric massless, arbitrary higher half odd-integer superspins. A new series of such theories is found to exist for arbitrary superspin Y (Y=s+1/2 for any integer s). The lowest member (s=1) of the series is the original off-shell formulation of 4D, N=1 supergravity first presented by Breitenlohner in 1977.
