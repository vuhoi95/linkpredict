Title: A Proof of the Supersymmetric Correlation Function / Wilson Loop  Correspondence
Authors: Tim Adamo and Mathew Bullimore and Lionel Mason and David Skinner
Abstract: We prove that in the limit when its insertion points become pairwise null-separated, the ratio of certain n-point correlation functions in N=4 SYM is equal to a supersymmetric Wilson loop on twistor space, acting in the adjoint representation. In the planar limit, each of these objects reduces to the square of the complete n-particle planar superamplitude. Our proof is at the level of the integrand.
