Title: Compact vortex in a generalized Born-Infeld model
Authors: D. Bazeia and E. da Hora and D. Rubiera-Garcia
Abstract: We study vortexlike solutions in a generalized Born-Infeld model. The model is driven by two distinct parameters, one which deals with the Born-Infeld term, and the other, which controls the presence of high-order power term in the covariant derivative of the Higgs field. We numerically solve the equations of motion and depict the main vortex features, for several values of the two parameters of the model. The results indicate the presence of compact vortex, when the parameter responsible for the high-order power in the derivative increases to sufficiently large values.
