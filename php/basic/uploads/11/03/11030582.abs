Title: Soliton Nature of Equilibrium State of Two Charged Masses in General  Relativity
Authors: G. A. Alekseev and V. A. Belinski
Abstract: New derivation of static equilibrium state for two charged masses in General Relativity is given in the framework of the Inverse Scattering Method as an alternative to our previous derivation of this solution by the Integral Equation Method. This shows that such solution is of solitonic character and represents the particular case of more general (12-parametric) stationary axisymmetric electrovacuum two-soliton solution for two rotating charged objects obtained by one of the authors in 1986. This result gives an additional support to our comprehension that the appropriate analytical continuations of solitonic solutions in the space of their parameters are always possible and that applicability of the Inverse Scattering Method in presence of electromagnetic field is not restricted only to the cases with naked singularities.
