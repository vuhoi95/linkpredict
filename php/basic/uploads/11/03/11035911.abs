Title: Light-like Big Bang singularities in string and matrix theories
Authors: Ben Craps and Oleg Evnin
Abstract: Important open questions in cosmology require a better understanding of the Big Bang singularity. In string and matrix theories, light-like analogues of cosmological singularities (singular plane wave backgrounds) turn out to be particularly tractable. We give a status report on the current understanding of such light-like Big Bang models, presenting both solved and open problems.
