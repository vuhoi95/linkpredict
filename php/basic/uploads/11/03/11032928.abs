Title: Electrodynamics from Noncommutative Geometry
Authors: Koen van den Dungen and Walter D. van Suijlekom
Abstract: Within the framework of Connes' noncommutative geometry, the notion of an almost commutative manifold can be used to describe field theories on compact Riemannian spin manifolds. The most notable example is the derivation of the Standard Model of high energy physics from a suitably chosen almost commutative manifold. In contrast to such a non-abelian gauge theory, it has long been thought impossible to describe an abelian gauge theory within this framework. The purpose of this paper is to improve on this point. We provide a simple example of a commutative spectral triple based on the two-point space, and show that it yields a U(1) gauge theory. Then, we slightly modify the spectral triple such that we obtain the full classical theory of electrodynamics on a curved background manifold.
