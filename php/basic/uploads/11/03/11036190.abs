Title: Monodromy--like Relations for Finite Loop Amplitudes
Authors: N. E. J. Bjerrum-Bohr and Poul H. Damgaard and Henrik Johansson and Thomas Sondergaard
Abstract: We investigate the existence of relations for finite one-loop amplitudes in Yang-Mills theory. Using a diagrammatic formalism and a remarkable connection between tree and loop level, we deduce sequences of amplitude relations for any number of external legs.
