Authors: Huai-Fan Li and Rong-Gen Cai and Hai-Qing Zhang
Abstract: We use the variational method for the Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem to analytically calculate some properties of holographic superconductors with Gauss-Bonnet gravity in probe limit. By studying the holographic p-wave and s-wave superconductors in (3+1)-dimensional boundary field theories, it is found that near the critical temperature, the critical exponent of the condensation is 1/2 which is the universal value in mean-field theory. We also find that when Gauss-Bonnet coefficients grow bigger the operators on the boundary field theory will be harder to condense. These are in good agreement with the numerical results.
