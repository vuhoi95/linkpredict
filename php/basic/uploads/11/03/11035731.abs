Title: Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter phase transition from finite  temperature symmetry breaking of Klein-Gordon fields
Authors: Abril Su√°rez and Tonatiuh Matos
Abstract: In this paper the thermal evolution of scalar field dark matter particles at finite cosmological temperatures is studied. Starting with a real scalar field in a thermal bath and using the one loop quantum corrections potential, we rewrite Klein-Gordon's (KG) equation in its hydrodynamical representation and study the phase transition of this scalar field due to a Z_2 symmetry breaking of its potential. A very general version of a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation is obtained. When introducing Madelung's representation, the continuity and momentum equations for a non-ideal SFDM fluid are formulated, and the cosmological scenario with the SFDM described in analogy to an imperfect fluid is then considered where dissipative contributions are obtained in a natural way.Additional terms appear compared to those obtained in the classical version commonly used to describe the \LambdaCDM model, i.e., the ideal fluid. The equations and parameters that characterize the physical properties of the system such as its energy, momentum and viscous flow are related to the temperature of the system, scale factor, Hubble's expansion parameter and the matter energy density. Finally, some details on how galaxy halos and smaller structures might be able to form by condensation of this SF are given.
