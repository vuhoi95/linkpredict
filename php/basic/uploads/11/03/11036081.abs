Title: Gregory-Laflamme instability of a slowly rotating black string
Authors: Chul-Moon Yoo and Sugure Tanzawa and Misao Sasaki
Abstract: We study the Gregory-Laflamme instability of a 5-dimensional slowly rotating black string in which the 4-dimensional section is described by the Kerr black hole. We treat the rotation in a perturbative way introducing a small parameter for the rotation. It is found that rotation makes the Gregory-Laflamme instability stronger. Both the critical wavelength at the onset of instability and the growth time-scale are found to decrease as the rotation increases.
