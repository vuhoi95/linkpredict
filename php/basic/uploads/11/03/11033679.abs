Title: de Sitter relativity: a natural scenario for an evolving Lambda
Authors: J. P. Beltran Almeida and C. S. O. Mayor and J. G. Pereira
Abstract: The dispersion relation of de Sitter special relativity is obtained in a simple and compact form, which is formally similar to the dispersion relation of ordinary special relativity. It is manifestly invariant under change of scale of mass, energy and momentum, and can thus be applied at any energy scale. When applied to the universe as a whole, the de Sitter special relativity is found to provide a natural scenario for the existence of an evolving cosmological term, and agrees in particular with the present-day observed value. It is furthermore consistent with a conformal cyclic view of the universe, in which the transition between two consecutive eras occurs through a conformal invariant spacetime.
