Title: Entanglement entropy for non-coplanar regions in quantum field theory
Authors: David D. Blanco and Horacio Casini
Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy in a relativistic quantum field theory for regions which are not included in a single spatial hyperplane. This geometric configuration cannot be treated with the Euclidean time method and the replica trick. Instead, we use a real time method to calculate the entropy for a massive free Dirac field in two dimensions in some approximations. We find some specifically relativistic features of the entropy. First, there is a large enhancement of entanglement due to boosts. As a result, the mutual information between relatively boosted regions does not vanish in the limit of zero volume and large relative boost. We also find extensivity of the information in a deeply Lorentzian regime with large violations of the triangle inequalities for the distances. This last effect is relevant to an interpretation of the amount of entropy enclosed in the Hawking radiation emitted by a black hole.
