Title: Ultra High Jet Signals from Stringy No-Scale Supergravity
Authors: Tianjun Li and James A. Maxin and Dimitri V. Nanopoulos and Joel W. Walker
Abstract: We present distinctive signatures of flipped F-Theory models with TeV-scale vector-like particles, a \sqrt{s} = 7 TeV 1 fb^{-1} test at LHC of a class of models well-motivated from string theory. The characteristic feature is a light stop and gluino, both sparticles lighter than all other squarks. This unique aspect of the supersymmetry spectrum generates an ultra-high multiplicity of hadronic jets. We find the optimal signal to background ratio is realized for 9 or more jets. Exclusion of the essential cuts presented here could leave the ultra-high jet signal severely attenuated and concealed.
