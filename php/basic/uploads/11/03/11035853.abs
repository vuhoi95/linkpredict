Title: Orbifolded Konishi from the Mirror TBA
Authors: Marius de Leeuw and Stijn J. van Tongeren
Abstract: Starting with a discussion of the general applicability of the simplified mirror TBA equations to simple deformations of the AdS_5 x S^5 superstring, we proceed to study a specific type of orbifold to which the undeformed simplified TBA equations directly apply. We then use this set of equations, as well as Luscher's approach, to determine the NLO wrapping correction to the energy of what we call the orbifolded Konishi state, and show that they perfectly agree. In addition we discuss wrapping corrections to the ground state energy of the orbifolded model under consideration.
