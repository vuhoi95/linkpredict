Title: A Superspace Formulation of The BV Action for Higher Derivative Theories
Authors: Mir Faizal and Mozzam Khan
Abstract: We first analyze the anti-BRST and double BRST structures of a certain higher derivative theory that has been known to possess BRST symmetry associated with its higher derivative structure. We discuss the invariance of this theory under shift symmetry in the Batalin Vilkovisky (BV) formalism. We show that the action for this theory can be written in a manifestly extended BRST invariant manner in superspace formalism using one Grassmann coordinate. It can also be written in a manifestly extended BRST invariant manner and on-shell manifestly extended anti-BRST invariant manner in superspace formalism using two Grassmann coordinates.
