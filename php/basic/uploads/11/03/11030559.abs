Title: Some (3+1) dimensional vortex solutions of the CPN model
Authors: L. A. Ferreira and P. Klimas and W. J. Zakrzewski
Abstract: We present a class of solutions of the CPN model in (3+1) dimensions. We suggest that they represent vortex-like configurations. We also discuss some of their properties. We show that some configurations of vortices have a divergent energy per unit length while for the others such an energy has a minimum for a very special orientation of vortices. We also discuss the Noether charge densities of these vortices.
