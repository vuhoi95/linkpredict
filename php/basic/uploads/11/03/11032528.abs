Title: Three-loop HTL QCD thermodynamics
Authors: Jens O. Andersen and Lars E. Leganger and Michael Strickland and Nan Su
Abstract: The hard-thermal-loop perturbation theory (HTLpt) framework is used to calculate the thermodynamic functions of a quark-gluon plasma to three-loop order. This is the highest order accessible by finite temperature perturbation theory applied to a non-Abelian gauge theory before the high-temperature infrared catastrophe. All ultraviolet divergences are eliminated by renormalization of the vacuum, the HTL mass parameters, and the strong coupling constant. After choosing a prescription for the mass parameters, the three-loop results for the pressure and trace anomaly are found to be in very good agreement with recent lattice data down to $T \sim 2-3\,T_c$, which are temperatures accessible by current and forthcoming heavy-ion collision experiments.
