Title: p-brane dynamics in (N+1)-dimensional FRW universes: a unified framework
Authors: L. Sousa and P. P. Avelino
Abstract: We develop a velocity-dependent one-scale model describing p-brane dynamics in flat homogeneous and isotropic backgrounds in a unified framework. We find the corresponding scaling laws in frictionless and friction dominated regimes considering both expanding and collapsing phases.
