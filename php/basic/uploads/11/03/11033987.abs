Title: Cavitation in holographic sQGP
Authors: Aleksandra Klimek and Louis Leblond and Aninda Sinha
Abstract: We study the possibility of cavitation in the nonconformal N=2^* SU(N) theory which is a mass deformation of N=4 SU(N) Yang-Mills theory. The second order transport coefficients are known from the numerical work using AdS/CFT by Buchel and collaborators. Using these and the approach of Rajagopal and Tripuraneni, we investigate the flow equations in a 1+1 dimensional boost invariant set up. We find that the string theory model does not exhibit cavitation before phase transition is reached. We give a semi-analytic explanation of this finding.
