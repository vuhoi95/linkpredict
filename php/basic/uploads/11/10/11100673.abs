Title: Thermodynamical universality of the Lovelock black holes
Authors: Naresh Dadhich and Josep M. Pons and Kartik Prabhu
Abstract: The necessary and sufficient condition for the thermodynamical universality of the static spherically symmetric Lovelock black hole is that it is the pure Lovelock {\Lambda}-vacuum solution. By universality we mean the thermodynamical parameters: temperature and entropy always bear the same relationship to the horizon radius irrespective of the Lovelock order and the spacetime dimension. For instance, the entropy always goes in terms of the horizon radius as rh and r^2 respectively for h odd and even dimensions. This universality uniquely identifies the pure Lovelock black hole with {\Lambda}.
