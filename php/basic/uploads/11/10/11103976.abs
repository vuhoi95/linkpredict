Title: Signatures of low-scale string models at the LHC
Authors: Manami Hashi and Noriaki Kitazawa
Abstract: Low-scale string models, in which the string scale M_s is of the order of TeV with large extra dimensions, can solve the problems of scale hierarchy and non-renormalizable quantum gravity in the standard model. String excited states of the standard model particles are possibly observed as resonances in the dijet invariant mass distribution at the LHC. There are two properties to distinguish whether the resonances are due to low-scale string or some other "new physics". One is a characteristic angular distribution in dijet events at the resonance due to spin degeneracy of string excited states, and the other is an appearance of the second resonance at a characteristic mass of second string excited states. We investigate a possibility to observe these evidences of low-scale string models by Monte Carlo simulations with a reference value of M_s = 4 TeV at sqrt{s} = 14 TeV. It is shown that spin degeneracy at the dijet resonance can be observed by looking the chi-distribution with integrated luminosity of 20 fb^-1. It is shown that the second resonance can be observed at rather close to the first resonance in the dijet invariant mass distribution with integrated luminosity of 50 fb^-1. These are inevitable signatures of low-scale string models.
