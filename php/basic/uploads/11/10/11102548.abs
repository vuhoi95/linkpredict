Title: Deep inelastic scattering of baryons in a modified soft wall model
Authors: Nelson R. F. Braga and Alfredo Vega
Abstract: We calculate the structure functions for unpolarized deep inelastic scattering of baryons using an AdS/QCD soft wall model that considers a dressed mass for the bulk fermionic fields. Considering the regime of large Bjorken parameter x, we compare the results for the proton structure function $F_2$ with experimental results.
