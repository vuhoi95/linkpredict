Title: Collapse of simple harmonic universe
Authors: Audrey T. Mithani and Alexander Vilenkin
Abstract: In a recent paper Graham et al constructed oscillating and static universe models which are stable with respect to all classical perturbations. Here we show that such universes are quantum-mechanically unstable and can collapse by quantum tunneling to zero radius. We also present instantons describing nucleation of oscillating and static universes from nothing.
