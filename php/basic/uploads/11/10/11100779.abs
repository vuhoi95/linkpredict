Title: Strongly-Coupled Quarks and Colorful Black Holes in AdS/CFT
Authors: MD Razikul Islam and Justin F. Vazquez-Poritz
Abstract: Small black holes potentially created by the Large Hadron Collider could typically carry color charges inherited from their parton progenitors. The dynamics of quarks near such a black hole depends on the curved spacetime geometry as well as the strong interaction due to the color charge of the black hole. We use the AdS/CFT Correspondence to study the behavior of strongly-coupled quarks near a color-charged black hole. The supergravity background consists of a six-dimensional Schwarzschild-black string AdS soliton, for which the bulk horizon extends from the AdS boundary down to an infra-red floor. By going to higher energy scales, the regime of validity of the classical supergravity background can be extended closer to the singularity than might be expected from the four-dimensional perspective. We study the resulting behavior of quarks and compute the rate at which a quark rotating around the black hole loses energy as a function of its mass parameter and angular velocity. We also analyze the behavior of quark-antiquark string configurations and discuss features such as the quark-antiquark screening length.
