Title: On Invariant Structures of Black Hole Charges
Authors: Sergio Ferrara and Alessio Marrani and Armen Yeranyan
Abstract: We study "minimal degree" complete bases of duality- and "horizontal"- invariant homogeneous polynomials in the flux representation of two-centered black hole solutions in two classes of D=4 Einstein supergravity models with symmetric vector multiplets' scalar manifolds. Both classes exhibit an SL(2,R) "horizontal" symmetry. The first class encompasses N=2 and N=4 matter-coupled theories, with semi-simple U-duality given by SL(2,R) x SO(m,n); the analysis is carried out in the so-called Calabi-Vesentini symplectic frame (exhibiting maximal manifest covariance) and until order six in the fluxes included. The second class, exhibiting a non-trivial "horizontal" stabilizer SO(2), includes N=2 minimally coupled and N=3 matter coupled theories, with U-duality given by the pseudo-unitary group U(r,s) (related to complex flux representations). Finally, we comment on the formulation of special Kaehler geometry in terms of "generalized" groups of type E7.
