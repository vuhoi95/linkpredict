Title: Braided Subfactors, Spectral Measures, Planar algebras and Calabi-Yau  algebras associated to SU(3) modular invariants
Authors: David E. Evans and Mathew Pugh
Abstract: Braided subfactors of von Neumann algebras provide a framework for studying two dimensional conformal field theories and their modular invariants. We review this in the context of SU(3) conformal field theories through corresponding SU(3) braided subfactors and various subfactor invariants including spectral measures for the nimrep graphs, A_2-planar algebras and almost Calabi-Yau algebras.
