Title: D1-Strings in Large RR 3-Form Flux, Quantum Nambu Geometry and M5-Branes  in C-Field
Authors: Chong-Sun Chu and Gurdeep S. Sehmbi
Abstract: We consider D1-branes in a RR flux background and show that there is a low energy - large flux double scaling limit where the D1-branes action is dominated by a Chern-Simons-Myers coupling term. As a classical solution to the matrix model, we find a novel quantized geometry characterized by a quantum Nambu 3-bracket. Infinite dimensional representations of the quantum Nambu geometry are constructed which demonstrate that the quantum Nambu geometry is intrinsically different from the ordinary Lie algebra type noncommutative geometry. Matrix models for the IIB string, IIA string and M-theory in the corresponding backgrounds are constructed. A classical solution of a quantum Nambu geometry in the IIA Matrix string theory gives rise to an expansion of the fundamental strings into a system of multiple D4-branes and the fluctuation is found to describe an action for a non-abelian 3-form field strength which is a natural non-abelian generalization of the PST action for a single D4-brane. In view of the recent proposals of the M5-branes theory in terms of the D4-branes, we suggest a natural way to include all the KK modes and propose an action for the the multiple M5-branes in a constant C-field. The worldvolume of the M5-branes in a C-field is found to be described by a quantum Nambu geometry with self-dual parameters. It is intriguing that our action is naturally formulated in terms of a 1-form gauge field living on a six dimensional quantum Nambu geometry.
