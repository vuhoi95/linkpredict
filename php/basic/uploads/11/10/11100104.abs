Title: Moduli Stacks of Bundles on Local Surfaces
Authors: Oren Ben-Bassat and Elizabeth Gasparim
Abstract: We give an explicit groupoid presentation of certain stacks of vector bundles on formal neighborhoods of rational curves inside algebraic surfaces. The presentation involves a M\"obius type action of an automorphism group on a space of extensions.
