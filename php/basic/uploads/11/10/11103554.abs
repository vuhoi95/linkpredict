Title: Boundary divergences in vacuum self-energies and quantum field theory in  curved spacetime
Authors: Francisco D. Mazzitelli and Jean Paul Nery and Alejandro Satz
Abstract: It is well known that boundary conditions on quantum fields produce divergences in the renormalized energy-momentum tensor near the boundaries. Although irrelevant for the computation of Casimir forces between different bodies, the self-energy couples to gravity, and the divergences may, in principle, generate large gravitational effects. We present an analysis of the problem in the context of quantum field theory in curved spaces. Our model consists of a quantum scalar field coupled to a classical field that, in a certain limit, imposes Dirichlet boundary conditions on the quantum field. We show that the model is renormalizable and that the divergences in the renormalized energy-momentum tensor disappear for sufficiently smooth interfaces.
