Title: Local Maxwell symmetry and gravity
Authors: R. Durka and J. Kowalski-Glikman
Abstract: In this paper we discuss some physical aspects of a theory obtained by gauging the AdS-Maxwell symmetry. Such theory has the form of Einstein gravity coupled to the $\sf{SO(3,1)}$ Yang-Mills field. We notice that there is another tetrad field, which can be associated with linear combination of Lorentz and Maxwell connections. Taking this tetrad as a fundamental variable makes it possible to cast the theory into the form of $f-g$ gravity, in first order formulation. Finally we discuss a simple cosmological model derived from the AdS-Maxwell gravity.
