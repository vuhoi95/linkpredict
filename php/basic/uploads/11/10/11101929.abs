Title: Logarithmic tensor category theory, VII: Convergence and extension  properties and applications to expansion for intertwining maps
Authors: Yi-Zhi Huang and James Lepowsky and Lin Zhang
Abstract: This is the seventh part in a series of papers in which we introduce and develop a natural, general tensor category theory for suitable module categories for a vertex (operator) algebra. In this paper (Part VII), we give sufficient conditions for the existence of the associativity isomorphisms.
