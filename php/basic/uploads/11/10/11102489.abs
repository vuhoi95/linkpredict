Title: Singlet Assisted Supersymmetry Breaking
Authors: Yael Shadmi and Yuri Shirman
Abstract: We describe a simple recipe for obtaining local supersymmetry-breaking vacua in s-confining theories coupled to gauge singlets. This recipe gives rise to effective O'Raifeartaigh models in the IR, with calculable supersymmetry-breaking minima near the origin, and can be applied to both vector-like and chiral theories. Since the properties of the vacuum are largely determined by superpotential terms that are non-renormalizable in the UV, it is calculable even when all dimensionless couplings are taken to be of order one. By construction, the models preserve a large subgroup of the original global symmetry. While we only study here s-confining theories, we expect our tools to be useful for inducing dynamical supersymmetry breaking in many gauge theories.
