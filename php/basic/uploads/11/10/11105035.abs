Title: Thermalization and entanglement following a non-relativistic holographic  quench
Authors: Ville Keranen and Esko Keski-Vakkuri and Larus Thorlacius
Abstract: We develop a holographic model for thermalization following a quench near a quantum critical point with non-trivial dynamical critical exponent. The anti-de Sitter Vaidya null collapse geometry is generalized to asymptotically Lifshitz spacetime. Non-local observables such as two-point functions and entanglement entropy in this background then provide information about the length and time scales relevant to thermalization. The propagation of thermalization exhibits similar "horizon" behavior as has been seen previously in the conformal case and we give a heuristic argument for why it also appears here. Finally, analytic upper bounds are obtained for the thermalization rates of the non-local observables.
