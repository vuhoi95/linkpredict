Title: AdS backgrounds from black hole horizons
Authors: U. Gran and J. Gutowski and G. Papadopoulos
Abstract: We utilize the classification of IIB horizons with 5-form flux to present a unified description for the geometry of AdS_n, n=3,5,7 solutions. In particular, we show that all such backgrounds can be constructed from 8-dimensional 2-strong Calabi-Yau geometries with torsion which admit some additional isometries. We explore the geometry of AdS_3 and AdS_5 solutions but we do not find AdS_7 solutions.
