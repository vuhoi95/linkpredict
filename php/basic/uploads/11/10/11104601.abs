Title: Friedel Oscillations in Holographic Metals
Authors: V. G. M. Puletti and S. Nowling and L. Thorlacius and T. Zingg
Abstract: In this article we study the conditions under which holographic metallic states display Friedel oscillations. We focus on systems where the bulk charge density is not hidden behind a black hole horizon. Understanding holographic Friedel oscillations gives a clean way to characterize the boundary system, complementary to probe fermion calculations. We find that fermions in a "hard wall" AdS geometry unambiguously display Friedel oscillations. However, similar oscillations are washed out for electron stars, suggesting a smeared continuum of Fermi surfaces.
