Title: Thermodynamics of Third Order Lovelock-Born-Infeld Black Holes
Authors: Peng Li and Rui-Hong Yue and De-Cheng Zou
Abstract: We here explore black holes in the third order Lovelock gravity coupling with nonlinear Born-Infeld electromagnetic field. Considering special second and third order coefficients ($\hat{\alpha}_2^2=3\hat{\alpha}_3=\alpha^2$), we analyze the thermodynamics of third order Lovelock-Born-Infeld black holes and, in 7-dimensional AdS space-time, discuss the stability of black holes in different event horizon structures. We find that the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ plays an important role in the distribution of stable regions of black holes.
