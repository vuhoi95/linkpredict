Title: Baby Universes Revisited
Authors: J. Ambjorn and J. Barkley and T. Budd and R. Loll
Abstract: The behaviour of baby universes has been an important ingredient in understanding and quantifying non-critical string theory or, equivalently, models of two-dimensional Euclidean quantum gravity coupled to matter. Within a regularized description based on dynamical triangulations, we amend an earlier conjecture by Jain and Mathur on the scaling behaviour of genus-$g$ surfaces containing particular baby universe `necks', and perform a nontrivial numerical check on our improved conjecture.
