Abstract: We solve the Klein-Gordon equation for a massive, non-minimally coupled scalar field, with a conformal coupling, undergoing cosmological evolution from a radiation-dominated phase to a future sudden singularity. We show that, after regularisation, the energy of the created particles is zero and the back-reaction from quantum effects does not change the evolution of the universe near the future singularity and cannot prevent the finite-time sudden singularity.
