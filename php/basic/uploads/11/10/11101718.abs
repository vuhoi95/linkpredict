Title: Full-sky lensing reconstruction of gradient and curl modes from CMB maps
Authors: Toshiya Namikawa and Daisuke Yamauchi and Atsushi Taruya
Abstract: We present a method of lensing reconstruction on the full sky, by extending the optimal quadratic estimator proposed by Okamoto & Hu (2003) to the case including the curl mode of deflection angle. The curl mode is induced by the vector and tensor metric perturbations, and the reconstruction of the curl mode would be a powerful tool to not only check systematics in the estimated gradient mode but also probe any vector and tensor sources. We find that the gradient and curl modes can be reconstructed separately, thanks to the distinctive feature in the parity symmetry between the gradient and curl modes. We compare our estimator with the flat-sky estimator proposed by Cooray et al (2005). Based on the new formalism, the expected signal-to-noise ratio of the curl mode produced by the primordial gravitational-waves and a specific model of cosmic strings are estimated, and prospects for future observations are discussed.
