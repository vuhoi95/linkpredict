Title: Mini-Black-Hole production at RHIC and LHC
Authors: Elias Kiritsis and Anastasios Taliotis
Abstract: We argue that heavy-ion collisions provide the best testing ground for mini-black hole physics as $M_P\simeq 4 GeV$ for the gravity dual of YM and give concrete evidence for a new extra dimension, that is visible only to the strong interactions. We analyse the process of production evolution and decay of the mini-black-holes by using recent results on gravity duals of YM. There are several novelties compared with the traditional story of black hole evaporation, including Bjorken scaling instead of sphericity, evaporation via bubble nucleation instead of the Hawking mechanism and lepton-poor final states. Multiplicities are estimated using shock-wave scattering techniques. It is argued that high-multiplicity/high energy pp collisions will also show similar characteristics of mini-black-hole production and decay.
