Title: Huge Casimir effect at finite temperature in electromagnetic Rindler  space
Authors: Tian-Ming Zhao and Rong-Xin Miao
Abstract: We investigate the Casimir effect at finite temperature in electromagnetic Rindler space, and find the Casimir energy is proportional to $\frac{T^4}{d^2}$ in the high temperature limit, where $T\approx 27 ^\circ\mathrm{C}$ is the temperature and $d\approx 100nm$ is a small cutoff. We propose to make metamaterials to mimic Rindler space and measure the predicted Casimir effect. Since the parameters of metamaterials we proposed are quite simple, this experiment would be easily implemented in laboratory.
