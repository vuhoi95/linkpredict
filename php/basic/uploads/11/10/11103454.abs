Title: Minimal Holographic Superconductors from Maximal Supergravity
Authors: Nikolay Bobev and Arnab Kundu and Krzysztof Pilch and Nicholas P. Warner
Abstract: We study a truncation of four-dimensional maximal gauged supergravity that provides a realization of the minimal model of a holographic superconductor. We find various flow solutions in this truncation at zero and finite temperature with a non-trivial profile for the charged scalar. Below a critical temperature we find holographic superconductor solutions that represent the thermodynamically preferred phase. Depending on the choice of boundary conditions, the superconducting phase transition is either first or second order. For vanishing temperature we find a flow with a condensing charged scalar that interpolates between two perturbatively stable AdS_4 vacua and is the zero-temperature ground state of the holographic superconductor.
