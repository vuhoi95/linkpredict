Title: Warped spherical compactifications in the gravity theory
Authors: Masato Minamitsuji and Kunihito Uzawa
Abstract: We present new exact solutions of the warped spherical compactifications in the higher-dimensional gravitational theory coupled to scalar and several form field strengths. We find two classes of solutions. One has a de Sitter spacetime with a static warp factor. The other gives an accelerating universe in the non-Einstein conformal frame with a time-dependent warp factor.
