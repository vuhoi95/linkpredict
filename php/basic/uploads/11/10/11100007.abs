Title: Transport in Anisotropic Superfluids: A Holographic Description
Authors: Johanna Erdmenger and Patrick Kerner and Hansj√∂rg Zeller
Abstract: We study transport phenomena in p-wave superfluids in the context of gauge/gravity duality. Due to the spacetime anisotropy of this system, the tensorial structure of the transport coefficients is non-trivial in contrast to the isotropic case. In particular, there is an additional shear mode which leads to a non-universal value of the shear viscosity even in an Einstein gravity setup. In this paper, we present a complete study of the helicity two and helicity one fluctuation modes. In addition to the non-universal shear viscosity, we also investigate the thermoelectric effect, i.e. the mixing of electric and heat current. Moreover, we also find an additional effect due to the anisotropy, the so-called flexoelectric effect.
