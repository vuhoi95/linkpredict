Title: Spontaneous breaking of permutation symmetry in pseudo-Hermitian quantum  mechanics
Authors: Jun-Qing Li and Yan-Gang Miao
Abstract: By adding an imaginary interacting term proportional to ip_1p_2 to the Hamiltonian of a free anisotropic planar oscillator, we construct a new model which is described by the PT-pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian with the permutation symmetry of two dimensions. We prove that our model is equivalent to the Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator and thus establish a relationship between our PT-pseudo-Hermitian system and the fourth-order derivative oscillator model. We also point out the spontaneous breaking of permutation symmetry which plays a crucial role in giving a real spectrum free of interchange of positive and negative energy levels in our model. Moreover, we find that the permutation symmetry of two dimensions in our Hamiltonian corresponds to the identity (not in magnitude but in attribute) of two different frequencies in the Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator, and reveal that the unequal-frequency condition imposed as a prerequisite upon the Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator can reasonably be explained as the spontaneous breaking of this identity.
