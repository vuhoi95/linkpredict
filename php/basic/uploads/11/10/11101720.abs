Title: Poincar√© gauge symmetries, hamiltonian symmetries and trivial gauge  transformations
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Debraj Roy
Abstract: We resolve a problem of finding the Poincare symmetries from hamiltonian gauge symmetries constructed through a canonical procedure of handling constrained systems. Through the use of Noether identities corresponding to the symmetries, we motivate a procedure of finding the map between the hamiltonian and Poincare gauge parameters. Using this map, we show that the Poincare and hamiltonian gauge symmetries are equivalent, modulo trivial gauge transformations.
