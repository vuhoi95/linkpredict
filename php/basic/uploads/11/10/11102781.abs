Title: Supersymmetric Solutions in Six Dimensions: A Linear Structure
Authors: Iosif Bena and Stefano Giusto and Masaki Shigemori and Nicholas P. Warner
Abstract: The equations underlying all supersymmetric solutions of six-dimensional minimal ungauged supergravity coupled to an anti-self-dual tensor multiplet have been known for quite a while, and their complicated non-linear form has hindered all attempts to systematically understand and construct BPS solutions. In this paper we show that, by suitably re-parameterizing these equations, one can find a structure that allows one to construct supersymmetric solutions by solving a sequence of linear equations. We then illustrate this method by constructing a new class of geometries describing several parallel spirals carrying D1, D5 and P charge and parameterized by four arbitrary functions of one variable. A similar linear structure is known to exist in five dimensions, where it underlies the black hole, black ring and corresponding microstate geometries. The unexpected generalization of this to six dimensions will have important applications to the construction of new, more general such geometries.
