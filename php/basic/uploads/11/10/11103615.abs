Title: Anomalies and Transport Coefficients: The Chiral Gravito-Magnetic Effect
Authors: Karl Landsteiner and Eugenio Megias and Francisco Pena-Benitez
Abstract: Axial anomalies give rise to interesting new transport phenomena such as the "chiral magnetic effect". We discuss how the associated transport coefficients can be studied via Kubo formulas at weak and strong coupling, the latter via gauge gravity duality. We argue for a new "chiral gravito-magnetic" (or vortical) effect sensitive to the presence of mixed gauge-gravitational anomalies.
