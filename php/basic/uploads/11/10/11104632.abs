Title: Strongly Coupled Striped Superconductor with Large Modulation
Authors: Jimmy A. Hutasoit and Suman Ganguli and George Siopsis and Jason Therrien
Abstract: We analytically calculate properties of a strongly coupled striped superconductor, with the charge density wave sourced by a modulated chemical potential, in the large modulation wavenumber Q limit. In the absence of a homogeneous term in the chemical potential, we show that the critical temperature scales as a negative power of Q for scaling dimensions \Delta < 3/2, whereas for \Delta > 3/2, there is no phase transition above a certain critical value of Q. The condensate is found to scale as a positive power of Q such that the gap is proportional to Q. We discuss how these results change if a homogeneous term is added to the chemical potential. We compare our analytic results with numerical calculations whenever the latter are available and find good agreement.
