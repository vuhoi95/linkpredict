Title: Fuzzy Kaluza-Klein induced M2's from a single M5
Authors: A. J. Nurmagambetov and I. Y. Park
Abstract: We propose an algorithmic procedure of obtaining multiple M2 brane dynamics starting with an action of a single M5 brane. The procedure involves a novel Kaluza-Klein reduction. First, the M5 brane action is truncated to keep a few leading terms in the derivative expansion. Then 3+3 splitting of dimensions is carried out. With expansion in terms of the S*2 spherical harmonics, the fields are associated with SU(N) (or its infinite extension) gauge algebra. We present an elaborate reduction procedure that leads to ABJM theory when the fuzzy spherical harmonics are replaced by SU(N) gauge generators.
