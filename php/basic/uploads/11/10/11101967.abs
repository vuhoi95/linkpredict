Authors: Roman Plyatsko and Oleksandr Stefanyshyn and Mykola Fenyk
Abstract: A new representation, which does not contain the third-order derivatives of the coordinates, of the exact Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations, describing the motion of a spinning test particle, is obtained under the assumption of the Mathisson-Pirani condition in a Kerr background. For this purpose the integrals of energy and angular momentum of the spinning particle as well as a differential relationship following from the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations are used. The form of these equations is adapted for their computer integration with the aim to investigate the influence of the spin-curvature interaction on the particle's behavior in the gravitational field without restrictions on its velocity and spin orientation. Some numerical examples for a Schwarzschild background are presented.
