Title: More Exact Tunneling Solutions in Scalar Field Theory
Authors: Koushik Dutta and Cecelie Hector and Pascal M. Vaudrevange and Alexander Westphal
Abstract: We present exact bounce solutions and amplitudes for tunneling in i) a piecewise linear-quartic potential and ii) a piecewise quartic-quartic potential. We cross check their correctness by comparing with results obtained through the thin-wall approximation and with a piecewise linear-linear potential. We briefly comment on applications in cosmology.
