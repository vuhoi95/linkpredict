Title: Logarithmic tensor category theory, VIII: Braided tensor category  structure on categories of generalized modules for a conformal vertex algebra
Authors: Yi-Zhi Huang and James Lepowsky and Lin Zhang
Abstract: This is the eighth part in a series of papers in which we introduce and develop a natural, general tensor category theory for suitable module categories for a vertex (operator) algebra. In this paper (Part VIII), we construct the braided tensor category structure, using the previously developed results.
