Title: Stochastic Effects in Hybrid Inflation
Authors: Jerome Martin and Vincent Vennin
Abstract: Hybrid inflation is a two field model where inflation ends due to an instability. In the neighborhood of the instability point, the potential is very flat and the quantum fluctuations dominate over the classical motion of the inflaton and waterfall fields. In this article, we study this regime in the framework of stochastic inflation. We numerically solve the two coupled Langevin equations controlling the evolution of the fields and compute the probability distributions of the total number of e-folds and of the inflation exit point. Then, we discuss the physical consequences of our results, in particular the question of how the quantum diffusion can affect the observable prediction of hybrid inflation.
