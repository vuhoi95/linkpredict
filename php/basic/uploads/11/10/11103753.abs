Title: Quantum aether and an invariant Planck scale
Authors: Saurya Das and Elias C. Vagenas
Abstract: We argue that a quantum aether is consistent with the principle of relativity and can provide an economical way of having an invariant quantum gravity or Planck scale. We also show that it may change the effective scale at which quantum gravity effects may be observable.
