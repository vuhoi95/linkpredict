Title: Induced Lorentz-violating terms at finite temperature
Authors: J. Leite and T. Mariz
Abstract: We study the radiatively induced Lorentz-violating terms at finite temperature, namely, the higher-derivative term and the Chern-Simons term. These terms are induced by integrating out the fermions coupled to the coefficient $g^{\kappa\mu\nu}$. The calculation of the resulting expressions is performed by using the derivative expansion and the Matsubara formalism. The Chern-Simons terms is nonzero only at finite temperature, whereas the higher-derivative term is finite at zero temperature, however, it goes to zero as the temperature grows to infinity. We also obtain a higher-derivative Chern-Simons term, nevertheless, it vanishes asymptotically.
