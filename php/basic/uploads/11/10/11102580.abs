Title: MOND's acceleration scale as a fundamental quantity
Authors: T. Bernal and S. Capozziello and G. Cristofano and M. De Laurentis
Abstract: Some quantum-cosmic scaling relations indicate that the MOND acceleration parameter a_0 could be a fundamental quantity ruling the self-gravitating structures, ranging from stars and globular clusters up to superclusters of galaxies and the whole observed universe. We discuss such coincidence relations starting from the Dirac quantization condition ruling the masses of primordial black holes.
