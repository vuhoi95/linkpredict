Title: Non-Quadratic Gauge Fixing and Ghosts for Gauge Theories on the  Hypersphere
Authors: F. T. Brandt and D. G. C. McKeon
Abstract: It has been suggested that using a gauge fixing Lagrangian that is not quadratic in a gauge fixing condition is most appropriate for gauge theories formulated on a hypersphere. We reexamine the appropriate ghost action that is to be associated with gauge fixing, applying a technique that has been used for ensuring that the propagator for a massless spin-two field is transverse and traceless. It is shown that this non-quadratic gauge fixing Lagrangian leads to two pair of complex Fermionic ghosts and two Bosonic real ghosts.
