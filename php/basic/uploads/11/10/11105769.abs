Title: Accelerating vacua in Gauss-Bonnet gravity
Authors: Wei Xu and Kun Meng and Liu Zhao
Abstract: Accelerating vacua with maximally symmetric, but not necessarily spherical, sections for Einstein and Gauss-Bonnet gravities in generic dimensions are obtained. The acceleration parameter has the effect of shifting the cosmological constants in Einstein gravity, whereas in Gauss-Bonnet gravity the effective cosmological constants remain the same in the presence of acceleration as in the case without acceleration.
