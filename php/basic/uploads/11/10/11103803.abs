Title: Generating new dualities through the orbifold equivalence: a  demonstration in ABJM and four-dimensional quivers
Authors: Masanori Hanada and Carlos Hoyos and Andreas Karch
Abstract: We show that the recently proposed large $N$ equivalence between ABJM theories with Chern-Simons terms of different rank and level, U(N_1)_{k_1}\times U(N_1)_{-k_1} and U(N_2)_{k_2}\times U(N_2)_{-k_2}, but the same value of N' =N_1 k_1=N_2 k_2, can be explained using planar equivalence in the mirror duals. The combination of S-dualities and orbifold equivalence can be applied to other cases as well, with very appealing results. As an example we show that two different quiver theories with k nodes can be easily shown to be Seiberg dual through the orbifold equivalence, but it requires order k^2 steps to give a proof when Seiberg duality is performed node by node.
