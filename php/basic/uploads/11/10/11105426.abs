Title: A variational perspective on classical Higgs fields in gauge-natural  theories
Authors: M. Palese and E. Winterroth
Abstract: Higgs fields on gauge-natural prolongations of principal bundles are defined by invariant variational problems and related canonical conservation laws along the kernel of a gauge-natural Jacobi morphism.
