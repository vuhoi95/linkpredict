Title: Towards singularity and ghost free theories of gravity
Authors: Tirthabir Biswas and Erik Gerwick and Tomi Koivisto and Anupam Mazumdar
Abstract: We present the most general covariant ghost-free gravitational action in a Minkowski vacuum. Apart from the much studied f(R) models, this includes a large class of non-local actions with improved UV behavior, which nevertheless recover Einstein's general relativity in the IR.
