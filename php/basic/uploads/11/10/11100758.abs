Title: On correlation functions of Wilson loops, local and non-local operators
Authors: Oluf Tang Engelund and Radu Roiban
Abstract: We discuss and extend recent conjectures relating partial null limits of correlation functions of local gauge invariant operators and the expectation value of null polygonal Wilson loops and local gauge invariant operators. We point out that a particular partial null limit provides a strategy for the calculation of the anomalous dimension of short twist-two operators at weak and strong coupling.
