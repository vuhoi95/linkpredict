Title: Quantum Group $GL_q(2)$ and Quantum Laplace Operator via Semi-infinite  Cohomology
Authors: Igor B. Frenkel and Anton M. Zeitlin
Abstract: We construct the quantum group $GL_q(2)$ as the semi-infinite cohomology of the tensor product of two braided vertex operator algebras based on the algebra $W_2$ with complementary central charges $c+\bar{c}=28$. The conformal field theory version of the Laplace operator on the quantum group is also obtained.
