Title: Conformal use of retarded Green's functions for the Maxwell field in de  Sitter space
Authors: S. Faci and E. Huguet and J. Renaud
Abstract: We propose a new propagation formula for the Maxwell field in de Sitter space which exploit the conformal invariance of this field together with a conformal gauge condition. This formula allows to determine the classical electromagnetic field in the de Sitter space from given currents and initial data. It only uses the Green's function of the massless Minkowskian scalar field. This leads to drastic simplifications in practical calculations. We apply this formula to the classical problem of the two charges of opposite signs at rest at the North and South Poles of the de Sitter space.
