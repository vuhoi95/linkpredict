Title: On the dynamics of perfect fluids in non-minimally coupled gravity
Authors: Orfeu Bertolami and Ant√≥nio Martins
Abstract: In this work we explore the consequences that a non-minimal coupling between geometry and matter can have on the dynamics of perfect fluids. It is argued that the presence of a static, axially symmetric pressureless fluid does not imply a Minkowski space-time like as is in General Relativity. This feature can be atributed to a pressure mimicking mechanism related to the non-minimal coupling. The case of a spherically symmetric black hole surrounded by fluid matter is analyzed, and it is shown that under equilibrium conditions the total fluid mass is about twice that of the black hole. Finally, a generalization of the Newtonian potential for a fluid element is proposed and its implications are briefly discussed.
