Title: Comment on superluminality in general relativity
Authors: Dieter Lust and Marios Petropoulos
Abstract: General relativity provides an appropriate framework for addressing the issue of sub- or superluminality as an apparent effect. Even though a massless particle travels on the light cone, its average velocity over a finite path measured by different observers is not necessarily equal to the velocity of light, as a consequence of the time dilation or contraction in gravitational fields. This phenomenon occurs in either direction (increase or depletion) irrespectively of the details and strength of the gravitational interaction. Hence, it does not intrinsically guarantee superluminality, even when the gravitational field is reinforced.
