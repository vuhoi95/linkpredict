Title: Momentum dependence in the dynamically assisted Sauter-Schwinger effect
Authors: Christian Fey and Ralf Sch√ºtzhold
Abstract: Recently it has been found that the superposition of a strong and slow electric field with a weaker and faster pulse can significantly enhance the probability for non-perturbative electron-positron pair creation out of the vacuum -- the dynamically assisted Sauter-Schwinger effect. Via the WKB method, we estimate the momentum dependence of the pair creation probability and compare it to existing numerical results. Besides the theoretical interest, a better understanding of this pair creation mechanism should be helpful for the planned experiments aiming at its detection.
