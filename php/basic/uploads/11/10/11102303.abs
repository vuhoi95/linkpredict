Title: Solving the Naturalness Problem by Baby Universes in the Lorentzian  Multiverse
Authors: Hikaru Kawai and Takashi Okada
Abstract: We propose a solution of the naturalness problem in the context of the multiverse wavefunction without the anthropic argument. If we include microscopic wormhole configurations in the path integral, the wave function becomes a superposition of universes with various values of the coupling constants such as the cosmological constant, the parameters in the Higgs potential, and so on. We analyze the quantum state of the multiverse, and evaluate the density matrix of one universe. We show that the coupling constants induced by the wormholes are fixed in such a way that the density matrix is maximized. In particular, the cosmological constant, which is in general time-dependent, is chosen such that it takes an extremely small value in the far future. We also discuss the gauge hierarchy problem and the strong CP problem in this context. Our study predicts that the Higgs mass is 140\pm20 GeV and {\theta}=0.
