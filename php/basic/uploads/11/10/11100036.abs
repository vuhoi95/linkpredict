Title: On Asymptotic Darkness in Ho≈ôava-Lifshitz Gravity
Authors: Emilio Elizalde and Pedro J. Silva
Abstract: Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity is shown to exhibit a peculiar behavior, when scattering amplitudes are considered. At low energies it seems to classicalize i.e. the effective size of the interaction grows as a function of the $s$-parameter, with BHs forming part of the spectrum; but when the probing energy is increased such that higher order operators become important, this behavior changes and the classicalon recedes to a new configuration where ordinary quantum regimes take over. Eventually, the theory behaves as a usual field theory that allows probing arbitrarily small distances. In particular, the classical potential created by a point-like source is finite everywhere exhibiting a Vainshtein alike screening behavior. The transition from one behavior to the other is carefully described in a particular case.
