Title: Some Considerations on Discrete Quantum Gravity
Authors: Gabriele Gionti and S. J
Abstract: Recent results in Local Regge Calculus are confronted with Spin Foam Formalism. Introducing Barrett-Crane Quantization in Local Regge Calculus makes it possible to associate a unique Spin $j_{h}$ with an hinge $h$, fulfilling one of the requirements of Spin Foam definition. It is shown that inter-twiner terms of Spin Foam can follow from the closure constraint in Local Regge Calculus. Dedicated to Beppe Marmo for his 65th Birthday
