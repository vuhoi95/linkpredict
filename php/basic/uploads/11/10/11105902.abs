Title: Magnetic Catalysis in AdS4
Authors: Stefano Bolognesi and David Tong
Abstract: We study the formation of fermion condensates in Anti de Sitter space. In particular, we describe a novel version of magnetic catalysis that arises for fermions in asymptotically AdS4 geometries which cap off in the infra-red with a hard wall. We show that the presence of a magnetic field induces a fermion condensate in the bulk that spontaneously breaks CP symmetry. From the perspective of the dual boundary theory, this corresponds to a strongly coupled version of magnetic catalysis in d=2+1.
