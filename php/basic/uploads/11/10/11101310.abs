Abstract: Using the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) equations, we investigate the trajectories of a spinning particle starting near $r_{ph}^{(-)}$ in a Kerr field and moving with the velocity close to the velocity of light ($r_{ph}^{(-)}$ is the Boyer-Lindquist radial coordinate of the counter-rotation circular photon orbits). First, as a partial case of these trajectories, we consider the equatorial circular orbit with $r=r_{ph}^{(-)}$. This orbit is described by the solution that is common for the rigorous MPD equations and their linear spin approximation. Then different cases of the nonequatorial motions are computed and illustrated by the typical figures. All these orbits exhibit the effects of the significant gravitational repulsion that are caused by the spin-gravity interaction. Possible applications in astrophysics are discussed.
