Title: Stability of superconducting strings coupled to cosmic strings
Authors: Alexandru Babeanu and Betti Hartmann
Abstract: We study the stability of superconducting strings in a U(1)_{local} x U(1)_{global} model coupled via a gauge field interaction term to U(1) Abelian-Higgs strings. The effect of the interaction on current stability is numerically investigated by varying the relevant parameters within the physical limits of our model. We find that the propagation speed of transverse (resp. longitudinal) perturbations increases (decreases) with increasing binding between the superconducting and Abelian-Higgs string. Moreover, we observe that for small enough width of the flux tube of the superconducting string and/or large enough interaction between the superconducting and the Abelian-Higgs string superconducting strings cannot carry space-like, i.e. magnetic currents. Our model can be seen as a field theoretical realization of bound states of p F-strings and q superconducting D-strings and has important implications to vorton formation during the evolution of networks of such strings.
