Title: Effective and exact holographies from symmetries and dualities
Authors: Zohar Nussinov and Gerardo Ortiz and Emilio Cobanera
Abstract: The theoretical basis of the phenomenon of effective and exact dimensional reduction, or holographic correspondence, is investigated in a wide variety of physical systems. We first derive general inequalities linking quantum systems of different spatial (or spatio-temporal) dimensionality, thus establishing bounds on arbitrary correlation functions. These bounds enforce an {\em effective} dimensional reduction and become most potent in the presence of certain symmetries. {\em Exact} dimensional reduction can stem from a duality that (i) follows from properties of the local density of states, and/or (ii) from properties of Hamiltonian-dependent algebras of interactions. Dualities of the first type (i) are illustrated with large-$n$ vector theories whose local density of states may remain invariant under transformations that change the dimension. We argue that a broad class of examples of dimensional reduction may be understood in terms of the functional dependence of observables on the local density of states. Dualities of the second type (ii) are obtained via {\em bond algebras}, a recently developed algebraic tool. We apply this technique to systems displaying topological quantum order, and also discuss the implications of dimensional reduction for the storage of quantum information.
