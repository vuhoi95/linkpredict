Title: Isocurvature Perturbations and Non-Gaussianity of Gravitationally  Produced Nonthermal Dark Matter
Authors: Daniel J. H. Chung and Hojin Yoo
Abstract: Gravitational particle production naturally occurs during the transition from the inflationary phase to the non-inflationary phase. If the particles are stable and very weakly interacting, they are natural nonthermal dark matter candidates. We show that such nonthermal dark matter particles can produce local non-Gaussianities large enough to be observed by ongoing and near future experiments without being in conflict with the existing isocurvature bounds. Of particular interest is the fact that these particles can be observable through local non-Gaussianities even when they form a very small fraction of the total dark matter content.
