Title: On closed-string twist-field correlators and their open-string  descendants
Authors: Pascal Anastasopoulos and Massimo Bianchi and Robert Richter
Abstract: In a recent paper we have proposed the possibility that the lightest massive string states could be identified with open strings living at intersections of D-branes forming small angles. In this note, we reconsider the relevant twist-field correlation functions and perform the analysis of the sub-dominant physical poles in the various channels. Our derivation is new in that it is based on the algebraic procedure for the construction of open string models starting from their closed-string `parents' rather than on the stress-tensor method. We also indicate possible generalizations and diverse applications of our approach.
