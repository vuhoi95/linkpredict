Title: Effective action for EPRL/FK spin foam models
Authors: Aleksandar Mikovic and Marko Vojinovic
Abstract: We show that a natural modification of the EPRL/FK vertex amplitude gives a finite spin foam model whose effective action gives the Einstein-Hilbert action in the limit of large spins and arbitrarily fine spacetime triangulations. The first-order quantum corrections can be easily computed and we show how to calculate the higher-order corrections.
