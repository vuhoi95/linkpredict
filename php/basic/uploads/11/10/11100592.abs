Title: Noncommutative geometry of phase space
Authors: Maja Buric and John Madore
Abstract: A version of noncommutative geometry is proposed which is based on phase-space rather than position space. The momenta encode the information contained in the algebra of forms by a map which is the noncommutative extension of the duality between the tangent bundle and the cotangent bundle.
