Abstract: We consider the Euclidean large-$N$ Ginzburg--Landau model in $D$ dimensions, $d$ ($d\leq D$) of them being compactified. For D=3, the system can be supposed to describe, in the cases of d=1, d=2, and d=3, respectively, a superconducting material in the form of a film, of an infinitely long wire having a rectangular cross-section and of a brick-shaped grain. We investigate the fixed-point structure of the model, in the presence of an external magnetic field. An infrared-stable fixed points is found, which is independent of the number of compactified dimensions. This generalizes previous work for type-II superconducting films
