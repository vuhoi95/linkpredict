Title: Observational Constraints on Kinetic Gravity Braiding from the  Integrated Sachs-Wolfe Effect
Authors: Rampei Kimura and Tsutomu Kobayashi and Kazuhiro Yamamoto
Abstract: The cross-correlation between the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect and the large scale structure (LSS) is a powerful tool to constrain dark energy and alternative theories of gravity. In this paper, we obtain observational constraints on kinetic gravity braiding from the ISW-LSS cross-correlation. We find that the late-time ISW effect in the kinetic gravity braiding model anti-correlates with large scale structures in a wide range of parameters, which clearly demonstrates how one can distinguish modified gravity theories from the LCDM model using the ISW effect. In addition to the analysis based on a concrete model, we investigate a future prospect of the ISW-LSS cross-correlation by using a phenomenological parameterization of modified gravity models.
