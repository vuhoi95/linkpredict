Title: Supersymmetric QED Plasma
Authors: Alina Czajka and Stanislaw Mrowczynski
Abstract: We systematically compare the N=1 SUSY QED plasma to its non-supersymmetric counterpart which is QED plasma of electrons, positrons and photons. Collective excitations and collisional processes in the two systems are confronted to each other in a regime of small coupling. The collective and collisional characteristics of supersymmetric plasma are both very similar to those of QED plasma.
