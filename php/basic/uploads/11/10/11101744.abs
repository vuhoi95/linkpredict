Title: Holographic Duals of Quark Gluon Plasmas with Unquenched Flavors
Authors: Francesco Bigazzi and Aldo L. Cotrone and Javier Mas and Daniel Mayerson and Javier Tarrio
Abstract: We review the construction of gravitational solutions holographically dual to N=1 quiver gauge theories with dynamical flavor multiplets. We focus on the D3-D7 construction and consider the finite temperature, finite quark chemical potential case where there is a charged black hole in the dual solution. Discussed physical outputs of the model include its thermodynamics (with susceptibilities) and general hydrodynamic properties.
