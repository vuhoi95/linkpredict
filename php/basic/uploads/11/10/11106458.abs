Title: On the confinement of a quantum particle to a two-dimensional ring in  systems described by the Dirac equation
Authors: K. Bakke and Claudio Furtado
Abstract: In this contribution, we propose a new model for studying the confinement of a spin-half particle to a two-dimensional quantum ring in systems described by the Dirac equation by introducing a new minimal coupling into the Dirac equation. We show that the introduction of this new minimal coupling into the Dirac equation yields a generalization of the two-dimensional model for a quantum ring proposed by Tan and Inkson [W.-C. Tan and J. C. Inkson, Semicond. Sci. Technol. {\bf11}, 1635 (1996)] for relativistic spin-half quantum particles.
