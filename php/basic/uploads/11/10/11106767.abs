Title: Gauge theory on kappa-Minkowski revisited: the twist approach
Authors: Marija Dimitrijevic and Larisa Jonke
Abstract: Kappa-Minkowski space-time is an example of noncommutative space-time with potentially interesting phenomenology. However, the construction of field theories on this space is plagued with ambiguities. We propose to resolve certain ambiguities by clarifying the geometrical picture of gauge transformations on the kappa-Minkowski space-time in the twist approach. We construct the action for the noncommutative U(1) gauge fields in a geometric way, as an integral of a maximal form. The effective action with the first order corrections in the deformation parameter is obtained using the Seiberg-Witten map to relate noncommutative and commutative degrees of freedom.
