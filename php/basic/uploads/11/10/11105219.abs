Title: Novel Kac-Moody-type affine extensions of non-crystallographic Coxeter  groups
Authors: Pierre-Philippe Dechant and Celine Boehm and Reidun Twarock
Abstract: Motivated by recent results in mathematical virology, we present novel asymmetric Z[tau]-integer-valued affine extensions of the non-crystallographic Coxeter groups H_2, H_3 and H_4 derived in a Kac-Moody-type formalism. In particular, we show that the affine reflection planes which extend the Coxeter group H_3 generate (twist) translations along 2-, 3- and 5-fold axes of icosahedral symmetry, and we classify these translations in terms of the Fibonacci recursion relation applied to different start values. We thus provide an explanation of previous results concerning affine extensions of icosahedral symmetry in a Coxeter group context, and extend this analysis to the case of the non-crystallographic Coxeter groups H_2 and H_4. These results will enable new applications of group theory in physics (quasicrystals), biology (viruses) and chemistry (fullerenes).
