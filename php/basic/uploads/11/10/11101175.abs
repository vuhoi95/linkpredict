Title: Primordial black holes, astrophysical systems and the Eddington-Weinberg  relation
Authors: S. Capozziello and G. Cristofano and M. De Laurentis
Abstract: Starting from a quantization relation for primordial black holes, it is shown that quantum fluctuations can play a fundamental role in determining the effective scales of self-gravitating astrophysical systems. Furthermore the Eddington-Weinberg relation between the current scale of the observed universe to the Planck constant (the standard action unit) is naturally derived. Finally, such an approach allows to recover the current value of the cosmological constant.
