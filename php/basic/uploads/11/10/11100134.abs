Title: AKSZ construction of topological open p-brane action and Nambu brackets
Authors: Peter Bouwknegt and Branislav Jurco
Abstract: We review the AKSZ construction as applied to the topological open membranes and Poisson sigma models. We describe a generalization to open topological p-branes and Nambu-Poisson sigma models.
