Title: Four-Derivative Brane Couplings from String Amplitudes
Authors: Katrin Becker and Guangyu Guo and Daniel Robbins
Abstract: We evaluate the string theory disc amplitude of one Ramond-Ramond field C^(p-3) and two Neveu-Schwarz B-fields in the presence of a single Dp-brane in type II string theory. From this amplitude we extract the four-derivative (or equivalently order (alpha')^2) part of the Dp-brane action involving these fields. We show that the new couplings are invariant under R-R and NS-NS gauge transformations and compatible with linear T-duality.
