Abstract: A qualitative study of the lightest glueball states in Euclidean SU(2) Yang-Mills theory quantized in the maximal Abelian gauge is presented. The analysis is done by generalizing to the maximal Abelian gauge the so-called replica model, already successfully introduced in the Landau gauge. As it will be shown, the gluon and ghost propagators obtained from the replica model are of the same type of those already introduced in Phys. Rev. D77, 105023 (2008) [arXiv:0801.0566], whose behavior turns out to be in agreement with that available from the lattice data on the maximal Abelian gauge. The model turns out to be renormalizable to all orders, while enabling us to introduce gauge invariant composite operators for the study of the lightest glueballs $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, $2^{++}$ and $0^{-+}$. The spectral representation for the correlation functions of these operators are evaluated to the first order, and the corresponding spectral densities are shown to be positive. Under the assumption of Abelian dominance, it turns out that the hierarchy for the masses of the lightest glueballs in the maximal Abelian gauge is in agreement with that already obtained in the Landau gauge, a feature which provides evidence for the gauge independence of the spectrum of the theory.
