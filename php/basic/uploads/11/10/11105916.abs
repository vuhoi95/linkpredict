Title: Constraints on 6D Supergravity Theories with Abelian Gauge Symmetry
Authors: Daniel S. Park and Washington Taylor
Abstract: We study six-dimensional N=(1,0) supergravity theories with abelian, as well as non-abelian, gauge group factors. We show that for theories with fewer than nine tensor multiplets, the number of possible combinations of gauge groups - including abelian factors - and non-abelian matter representations is finite. We also identify infinite families of theories with distinct U(1) charges that cannot be ruled out using known quantum consistency conditions, though only a finite subset of these can arise from known string constructions.
