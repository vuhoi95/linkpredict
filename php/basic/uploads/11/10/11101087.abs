Title: Higher Level String Resonances in Four Dimensions
Authors: Wan-Zhe Feng and Tomasz R. Taylor
Abstract: We study higher level Regge resonances of open superstrings, focusing on the universal part of the Neveu-Schwarz sector common to all D-brane realizations of the standard model. For Regge states with masses far above the fundamental string scale, we discuss the spin-dependence of their decay rates into massless gauge bosons. Extending our previous work on lowest level string excitations, we study the second mass level at which spins range from 0 to 3. We construct the respective vertex operators and compute the amplitudes involving one massive particle and two or three gauge bosons. To illustrate the use of BCFW recursion relations in superstring theory, we build the four gluon amplitude from on-shell amplitudes involving string resonances and gauge bosons.
