Title: New treatment of the noncommutative Dirac equation with a Coulomb  potential
Authors: Lamine Khodja and Slimane Zaim
Abstract: Using the approach the modified Euler-Lagrange field equation together with the corresponding Seiberg-Witten maps of the dynamical fields, a noncommutative Dirac equation with a Coulomb potential is derived. We then find the noncommutative modification the energy levels and the possible new transitions. In the nonrelativistic limit a general form of the hamiltonian of the hydrogen atom is obtained, and we show that the noncommmutativity plays the role of spin and magnetic field which gives the hyper fine structure.
