Title: The factorisation of glue and mass terms in SU(N) gauge theories
Authors: Martin Lavelle and David McMullan and Poonam Sharma
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the structure of the glue in Zwanziger's gauge invariant expansion for the A^2-type mass term in Yang-Mills theory. We show how to derive this expansion, in terms of the inverse covariant Laplacian, and extend it to higher orders. In particular, we give an explicit expression, for the first time, for the next to next to leading order term. We further show that the expansion is not unique and give examples of the resulting ambiguity.
