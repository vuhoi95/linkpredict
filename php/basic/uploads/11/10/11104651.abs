Title: Fermions on deformed thick branes
Authors: W. T. Cruz and A. R. Gomes and C. A. S. Almeida
Abstract: In this work we investigate the issue of fermion localization and resonances in $(4,1)$-deformed branes constructed with one scalar field coupled with gravity. Such models provide us branes with internal structures that turns the gravitational interaction more effective for fermions aside the brane, increasing their lifetime. The coupling between the scalar field and spinors is a necessary condition for fermions to be localized on such branes. After performing a chiral decomposition of the five-dimensional spinor we found resonances with both chiralities. The correspondence between the spectra for left and right chirality is guaranteed and Dirac fermions are realized on the brane.
