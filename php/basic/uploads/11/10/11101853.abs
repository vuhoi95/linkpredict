Title: Dark Medium Modified Dispersion Relations
Authors: Isabella Masina and Francesco Sannino
Abstract: We suggest that the dark side of the universe builds a dark medium modifying the Standard Model particle dispersion relations. We introduce the generic form for the modified dispersion relations and provide explicit models of the dark medium. We use the derived neutrino dispersion relations to show that the size of the corrections are smaller than the SN1987a bounds. We argue that before invoking modifications of Einstein's theory of relativity one should investigate the dark medium effects.
