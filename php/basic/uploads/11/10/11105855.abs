Abstract: Here we consider resonances of the Gauge, Gravity and Spinor fields in Randall-Sundrum-like scenarios. We consider membranes that are generated by a class of topological defects that are deformed domain walls obtained from other previously known ones. They are obtained by a deformation procedure generate different potentials to the associated Schr\"odinger-like equation. The resonance spectra are calculated numerically using the method of Transfer Matrix developed by the authors and presented in JHEP 1108 (2011) 071. The new deformed defects change the resonances spectra of all fields considered and the associated phenomenology as well.
