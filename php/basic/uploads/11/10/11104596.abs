Title: Coideal Quantum Affine Algebra and Boundary Scattering of the Deformed  Hubbard Chain
Authors: Marius de Leeuw and Takuya Matsumoto and Vidas Regelskis
Abstract: We consider boundary scattering for a semi-infinite one-dimensional deformed Hubbard chain with boundary conditions of the same type as for the Y=0 giant graviton in the AdS/CFT correspondence. We show that the recently constructed quantum affine algebra of the deformed Hubbard chain has a coideal subalgebra which is consistent with the reflection (boundary Yang-Baxter) equation. We derive the corresponding reflection matrix and furthermore show that the aforementioned algebra in the rational limit specializes to the (generalized) twisted Yangian of the Y=0 giant graviton.
