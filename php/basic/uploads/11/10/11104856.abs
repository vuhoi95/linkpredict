Title: Stability Analysis and Area Spectrum of 3-Dimensional Lifshitz Black  Holes
Authors: Bertha Cuadros-Melgar and Jeferson de Oliveira and C. E. Pellicer
Abstract: In this work, we probe the stability of a $z=3$ three-dimensional Lifshitz black hole by using scalar and spinorial perturbations. We found an analytical expression for the quasinormal frequencies of the scalar probe field, which perfectly agree with the behavior of the quasinormal modes obtained numerically. The results for the numerical analysis of the spinorial perturbations reinforce the conclusion of the scalar analysis, i.e., the model is stable under scalar and spinor perturbations. As an application we found the area spectrum of the Lifshitz black hole, which turns out to be equally spaced.
