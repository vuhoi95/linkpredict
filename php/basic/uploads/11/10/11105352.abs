Title: The spherical sector of the Calogero model as a reduced matrix model
Authors: Tigran Hakobyan and Olaf Lechtenfeld and Armen Nersessian
Abstract: We investigate the matrix-model origin of the spherical sector of the rational Calogero model and its constants of motion. We develop a diagrammatic technique which allows us to find explicit expressions of the constants of motion and calculate their Poisson brackets. In this way we obtain all functionally independent constants of motion to any given order in the momenta. Our technique is related to the valence-bond basis for singlet states.
