Title: Cubic interactions of massless higher spins in (A)dS: metric-like  approach
Authors: E. Joung and M. Taronna
Abstract: Cubic interactions of higher-spin gauge fields in (A)dS are studied in the metric-like approach. Making use of the traceless and transverse constraints together with the ambient-space formalism, all consistent parity-invariant cubic vertices are obtained for d>3 in closed form pointing out the key role of their flat-space counterparts.
