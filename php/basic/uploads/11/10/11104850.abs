Title: The Poisson sigma model on closed surfaces
Authors: Francesco Bonechi and Alberto S. Cattaneo and Pavel Mnev
Abstract: Using methods of formal geometry, the Poisson sigma model on a closed surface is studied in perturbation theory. The effective action, as a function on vacua, is shown to have no quantum corrections if the surface is a torus or if the Poisson structure is regular and unimodular (e.g., symplectic). In the case of a Kahler structure or of a trivial Poisson structure, the partition function on the torus is shown to be the Euler characteristic of the target; some evidence is given for this to happen more generally. The methods of formal geometry introduced in this paper might be applicable to other sigma models, at least of the AKSZ type.
