Title: On 4-dimensional Lorentz-structures, Dark energy and Exotic smoothness
Authors: T. Asselmeyer-Maluga and R. Mader and J. Krol
Abstract: Usually, the topology of a 4-manifolds $M$ is restricted to admit a global hyperbolic structure $\Sigma\times\mathbb{R}$. The result was obtained by using two conditions: existence of a Lorentz structure and causality (no time-like closed curves). In this paper we study the influence of the smoothness structure to show its independence of the two conditions. Then we obtain the possibility for a topology-change of the 3-manifold $\Sigma$ keeping fix its homology. We will study the example $S^{3}\times\mathbb{R}$ with an exotic differential structure more carefully to show some implications for cosmology. Especially we obtain an interpretation of the transition in topology as dark energy.
