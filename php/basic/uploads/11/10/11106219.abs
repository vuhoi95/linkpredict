Title: The phase diagram in $T-Î¼-N_c$ space
Authors: Giorgio Torrieri and Stefano Lottini and Igor Mishustin and Piero Nicolini
Abstract: We examine the phase diagram of hadronic matter when the number of colors, as well as temperature and density, are varied. We show that in this regime several new phase transitions are possible, and we examine issues related to these transitions.
