Title: Holographic non-relativistic fermionic fixed point and bulk dipole  coupling
Authors: Wei-Jia Li and Hongbao Zhang
Abstract: Inspired by the recently discovered non-relativistic fermionic fixed points, we investigate how the presence of bulk dipole coupling modifies the spectral function at one of these novel fixed points. As a result, although the infinite flat band is always visible in the presence of the bulk dipole coupling as well as chemical potential, the band is modified in a remarkable way at small momenta up to the order of magnitude of bulk dipole coupling. On the other hand, like a phoenix, a new Fermi surface sprouts from the formed gap when the bulk dipole coupling is pushed up further such as to overshadow the charge parameter, which is obviously different from what is found at the relativistic fixed points.
