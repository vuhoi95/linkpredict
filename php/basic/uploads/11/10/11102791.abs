Title: Amplitudes for Multiple M5 Branes
Authors: Bartlomiej Czech and Yu-tin Huang and Moshe Rozali
Abstract: We study N=(m,0) super-Poincare invariant six-dimensional massless and five-dimensional massive on-shell amplitudes. We demonstrate that in six dimensions, all possible three-point amplitudes involving tensor multiplets are necessarily embedded in gravitational theories. For non-gravitational amplitudes we consider instead five-dimensional massive amplitudes with N=(2,0) supersymmetry, aiming at describing the world volume theory of multiple M5 branes compactified on M^{4,1}x S^1. We find non-gravitational amplitudes whose on-shell degrees of freedom are shown to match those of the massive particle states that arise from self-dual strings wrapping a circle. Along the way we find interesting hints of a fermionic symmetry in the (2,0) theory, which accompanies the self-dual tensor gauge symmetry. We also discuss novel theories with (3,0) and (4,0) supersymmetry.
