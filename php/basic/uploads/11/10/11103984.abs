Title: Phenomenology of the minimal inflation scenario: inflationary  trajectories and particle production
Authors: Luis Alvarez-Gaume and Cesar Gomez and Raul Jimenez
Abstract: We discuss the phenomenology of the minimal inflation scenario. We concentrate on two aspects: inflationary trajectories and particle production. Our findings can be summarized in two main results: first, that inflationary trayectories that are very flat and provide enough number of e-foldings are natural in the scenario without fine tunning. We present a general formalism to identify attractors in multi-field inflation regardless of trajectories fulfilling the slow-roll conditions. We then explore particle production in the model and show how the inflaton naturally transmutes into a dark matter particle. One interesting feature of our model is that it provides a novel mechanism to generate particles and entropy in the universe: the filling of the Fermi sphere up to a given momentum p_F due to the sea of goldstinos that are an important part of the matter generated after inflation. With this mechanism in hand we predict that the gravitino should have a mass of > 100-1000 TeV. Another interesting feature of our model is that the predicted level of gravity waves is r=0.1 - 0.001, which is in the range of detectability from Planck and upcoming CMB polarization experiments.
