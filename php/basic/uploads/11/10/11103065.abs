Title: Perturbative analysis of the conductivity in disordered monolayer and  bilayer graphene
Authors: Andreas Sinner and Klaus Ziegler
Abstract: The DC conductivity of monolayer and bilayer graphene is studied perturbatively for different types of disorder. In the case of monolayer, an exact cancellation of logarithmic divergences occurs for all disorder types. The total conductivity correction for a random vector potential is zero, while for a random scalar potential and a random gap it acquires finite corrections. We identify the diagrams which are responsible for these corrections and extrapolate the finite contributions to higher orders which gives us general expressions for the conductivity of weakly disordered monolayer graphene. In the case of bilayer graphene, a cancellation of all contributions for all types of disorder takes place. Thus, the minimal conductivity of bilayer graphene turns out to be very robust against disorder.
