Abstract: We study the N=2 four-dimensional superconformal index in various interesting limits, such that only states annihilated by more than one supercharge contribute. Extrapolating from the SU(2) generalized quivers, which have a Lagrangian description, we conjecture explicit formulae for all A-type quivers of class S, which in general do not have one. We test our proposals against several expected dualities. The index can always be interpreted as a correlator in a two-dimensional topological theory, which we identify in each limit as a certain deformation of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory. The structure constants of the topological algebra are diagonal in the basis of Macdonald polynomials of the holonomies.
