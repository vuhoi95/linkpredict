Title: The final stage of gravitationally collapsed thick matter layers
Authors: Piero Nicolini and Alessio Orlandi and Euro Spallucci
Abstract: In the presence of a minimal length physical objects cannot collapse to an infinite density, singular, matter point. In this note we consider the possible final stage of the gravitational collapse of "thick" matter layers. The energy momentum tensor we choose to model these shell-like objects is a proper modification of the source for "non-commutative geometry inspired", regular black holes. By using higher momenta of Gaussian distribution to localize matter at finite distance from the origin, we obtain new solutions of the Einstein's equation which smoothly interpolates between Minkowski geometry near the center of the shell and Schwarzschild spacetime far away from the matter layer. The metric is curvature singularity free. Black hole type solutions exist only for "heavy" shells, i.e. $M\ge M_{e}$, where $M_{e}$ is the mass of the extremal configuration. We determine the Hawking temperature and a modified Area Law taking into account the extended nature of the source.
