Title: Particle Dynamics on Snyder space
Authors: Lei Lu and A. Stern
Abstract: We examine Hamiltonian formalism on Euclidean Snyder space. The latter corresponds to a lattice in the quantum theory. For any given dynamical system, it may not be possible to identify time with a real number parametrizing the evolution in the quantum theory. The alternative requires the introduction of a dynamical time operator. We obtain the dynamical time operator for the relativistic (nonrelativistic) particle, and use it to construct the generators of Poincar\'e (Galilei) group on Snyder space.
