Title: Quantum Scalar Field in D-dimensional de Sitter Spacetimes
Authors: G. Alencar and I. Guedes and R. R. Landim and R. N. Costa Filho
Abstract: In this work we investigate the quantum theory of scalar fields propagating in a $D-$dimensional de Sitter spacetime. The method of dynamic invariants is used to obtain the solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The quantum behavior of the scalar field in this background is analyzed, and the results generalize previous ones found in the literature. We point that the Bunch-Davies thermal bath depends on the choice of $D$ and the conformal parameter $\xi$. This is important in extra dimension physics, as in the Randall-Sundrum model.
