Title: Dualities for 3d Theories with Tensor Matter
Authors: Anton Kapustin and Hyungchul Kim and Jaemo Park
Abstract: We study dualities for ${\cal N}=2$ 3d Chern-Simons matter theories with gauge groups U/Sp/O, matter in the two-index tensor representations (adjoint/symmetric/antisymmetric) in addition to the fundamental representation, and a superpotential. These dualities are analogous to Kutasov-Schwimmer-Seiberg dualities in 4d. We test them by computing the superconformal index and the partition function on $S^3$ for many dual pairs and find perfect agreement. In some cases we find a simple dual description for theories with tensor matter and no superpotential, thereby generalizing the "Duality Appetizer" of Jafferis and Yin to an infinite class of theories. We also investigate nonperturbative truncation of the chiral ring proposed in the context of 4d dualities.
