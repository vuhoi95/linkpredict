Title: N >= 4 Supergravity Amplitudes from Gauge Theory at Two Loops
Authors: C. Boucher-Veronneau and L. J. Dixon
Abstract: We present the full two-loop four-graviton amplitudes in N=4,5,6 supergravity. These results were obtained using the double-copy structure of gravity, which follows from the recently conjectured color-kinematics duality in gauge theory. The two-loop four-gluon scattering amplitudes in N=0,1,2 supersymmetric gauge theory are a second essential ingredient. The gravity amplitudes have the expected infrared behavior: the two-loop divergences are given in terms of the squares of the corresponding one-loop amplitudes. The finite remainders are presented in a compact form. The finite remainder for N=8 supergravity is also presented, in a form that utilizes a pure function with a very simple symbol.
