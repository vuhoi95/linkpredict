Title: ${\cal N}=3$ Supersymmetric Effective Action of D2-branes in Massive IIA  String Theory
Authors: Gyungchoon Go and O-Kab Kwon and D. D. Tolla
Abstract: We obtain a new-type of ${\cal N}=3$ Yang-Mills Chern-Simons theory from the Mukhi-Papageorgakis Higgsing of the ${\cal N}=3$ Gaiotto-Tomasiello theory. This theory has ${\cal N}=1$ BPS fuzzy funnel solution which is expressed in terms of the seven generators of SU(3), excluding $T_8$. We propose that this is an effective theory of multiple D2-branes with D6- and D8-branes background in massive IIA string theory.
