Title: Analytic solutions for Dp branes in SFT
Authors: L. Bonora and S. Giaccari and D. D. Tolla
Abstract: This is the follow-up of a previous paper [ArXiv:1105.5926], where we calculated the energy of an analytic lump solution in SFT, representing a D24-brane. Here we describe an analytic solution for a Dp-brane, for any p, and compute its energy.
