Title: Entropy Bound Derived from the New Thermodynamics on Holographic Screen
Authors: Wu Guang and Gu Wei
Abstract: We introduce a new interpretation of chemical potential and show that holographic entropy is entropy bound, which is supported by two ideal cases discussed in detail. One is sparse but incompressible liquid like a star of uniform density and the other is a screen at infinity in spherically symmetric sapcetime. Our work is based on the new scenario of entropy force and holographic thermodynamics, and the Brown-York quasi-local energy.
