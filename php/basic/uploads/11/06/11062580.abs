Title: Higher Spin Gravity with Matter in AdS_3 and Its CFT Dual
Authors: Chi-Ming Chang and Xi Yin
Abstract: We study Vasiliev's system of higher spin gauge fields coupled to massive scalars in AdS_3, and compute the tree level two and three point functions. These are compared to the large N limit of the W_N minimal model, and nontrivial agreements are found. We propose a modified version of the conjecture of Gaberdiel and Gopakumar, under which the bulk theory is perturbatively dual to a subsector of the CFT that closes on the sphere.
