Title: Closed Timelike Curves in the Galileon Model
Authors: Jarah Evslin and Taotao Qiu
Abstract: It has long been known that generic solutions to the nonlinear DGP and Galileon models admit superluminal propagation. In this note we present a solution of these models which also admits closed timelike curves (CTCs). We observe that these CTCs only arise when, according to each observer, there exists some region in which the higher derivative terms are larger than the 2-derivative kinetic term.
