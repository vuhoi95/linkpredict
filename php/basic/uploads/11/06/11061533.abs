Title: The BTZ black hole with a time-dependent boundary
Authors: N. Lamprou and S. Nonis and N. Tetradis
Abstract: The non-rotating BTZ solution is expressed in terms of coordinates that allow for an arbitrary time-dependent scale factor in the boundary metric. We provide explicit expressions for the coordinate transformation that generates this form of the metric, and determine the regions of the complete Penrose diagram that are convered by our parametrization. This construction is utilized in order to compute the stress-energy tensor of the dual CFT on a time-dependent background. We study in detail the expansion of radial null geodesic congruences in the BTZ background for various forms of the scale factor of the boundary metric. We also discuss the relevance of our construction for the holographic calculation of the entanglement entropy of the dual CFT on time-dependent backgrounds.
