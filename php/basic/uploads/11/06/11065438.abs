Title: Equilibrium configurations from gravitational collapse
Authors: Pankaj S. Joshi and Daniele Malafarina and Ramesh Narayan
Abstract: We develop here a new procedure within Einstein's theory of gravity to generate equilibrium configurations that result as the final state of gravitational collapse from regular initial conditions. As a simplification, we assume that the collapsing fluid is supported only by tangential pressure. We show that the equilibrium geometries generated by this method form a subset of static solutions to the Einstein equations, and that they can either be regular or develop a naked singularity at the center. When a singularity is present, there are key differences in the properties of stable circular orbits relative to those around a Schwarzschild black hole with the same mass. Therefore, if an accretion disk is present around such a naked singularity it could be observationally distinguished from a disk around a black hole.
