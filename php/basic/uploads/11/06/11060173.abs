Title: Dirac fermions in strong gravitational fields
Authors: Yuri N. Obukhov and Alexander J. Silenko and Oleg. V. Teryaev
Abstract: We discuss the dynamics of the Dirac fermions in the general strong gravitational and electromagnetic fields. We derive the general Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian and transform it to the Foldy-Wouthuysen representation for the spatially isotropic metric. The quantum operator equations of motion are obtained and the semiclassical limit is analyzed. The comparison of the quantum mechanical and classical equations shows their complete agreement. The helicity dynamics in strong fields is discussed. Squaring the covariant Dirac equation explicitly shows a similarity of the interactions of electromagnetic and gravitational fields with a charged and spinning particle.
