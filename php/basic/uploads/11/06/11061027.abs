Abstract: The role of a bulk graviton in predicting the signature of extra dimensions through collider-based experiments is explored in the context of a multiply warped spacetime. In particular it is shown that in a doubly warped braneworld model, the presence of the sixth dimension, results in enhanced concentration of graviton Kaluza Klein (KK) modes compared to that obtained in the usual 5-dimensional Randall-Sundrum model. Also, the couplings of these massive graviton KK modes with the matter fields on the visible brane turn out to be appreciably larger than that in the corresponding 5- dimensional model. The significance of these results are discussed in the context of KK graviton search at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
