Title: Penrose Inequality for Asymptotically AdS Spaces
Authors: Igor Itkin and Yaron Oz
Abstract: In general relativity, the Penrose inequality relates the mass and the entropy associated with a gravitational background. If the inequality is violated by an initial Cauchy data, it suggests a creation of a naked singularity, thus providing means to consider the cosmic censorship hypothesis. We propose a general form of Penrose inequality for asymptotically locally AdS spaces.
