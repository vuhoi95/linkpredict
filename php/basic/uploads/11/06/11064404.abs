Title: Scale dependent bias from primordial non-Gaussianity with trispectrum
Authors: Jinn-Ouk Gong and Shuichiro Yokoyama
Abstract: We study the scale dependent bias of the halo power spectrum arising from primordial non-Gaussianity. We present an analytic result of the halo bias including up to the trispectrum contributions. We find the scale dependent bias opens a new possibility of probing the relation between the non-linearity parameters $\fnl$ and $\tnl$.
