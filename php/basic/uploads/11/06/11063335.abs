Title: Oscillons After Inflation
Authors: Mustafa A. Amin and Richard Easther and Hal Finkel and Raphael Flauger and Mark P. Hertzberg
Abstract: Oscillons are massive, long-lived, localized excitations of a scalar field. We show that in a large class of well-motivated single-field models, inflation is followed by self-resonance, leading to copious oscillon generation and a lengthy period of oscillon domination. These models are characterized by an inflaton potential which has a quadratic minimum and is shallower than quadratic away from the minimum. This set includes both string monodromy models and a class of supergravity inspired scenarios, and is in good agreement with the current central values of the concordance cosmology parameters. We assume that the inflaton is weakly coupled to other fields, so as not to quickly drain energy from the oscillons or prevent them from forming. An oscillon-dominated universe has a greatly enhanced primordial power spectrum on very small scales relative to that seen with a quadratic potential, possibly leading to novel gravitational effects in the early universe.
