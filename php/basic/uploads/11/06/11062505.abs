Title: Instantons on ALE spaces and Super Liouville Conformal Field Theories
Authors: Giulio Bonelli and Kazunobu Maruyoshi and Alessandro Tanzini
Abstract: We provide evidence that the conformal blocks of N=1 super Liouville conformal field theory are described in terms of the SU(2) Nekrasov partition function on the ALE space O_{P^1}(-2).
