Title: Electromagnetic Torus Knots
Authors: Manuel Arrayás and José L. Trueba
Abstract: We present a new range of solutions of the Maxwell equations in vacuum in which the topology of the field lines is that of the whole torus knots set. Knotted electromagnetic fields are solutions of the Maxwell equations in vacuum in which magnetic lines, and also electric lines, have some kind of linkage. These solutions may play an important role in fundamental physics problems from the stability of field configurations, such as plasma confinement, to coding information.
