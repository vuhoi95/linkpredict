Title: Systematic solution-generation of five-dimensional black holes
Authors: Hideo Iguchi and Keisuke Izumi and Takashi Mishima
Abstract: Solitonic solution-generating methods are powerful tools to construct nontrivial black hole solutions of the higher-dimensional Einstein equations systematically. In five dimensions particularly, the solitonic methods can be successfully applied to the construction of asymptotically Minkowski spacetimes with multiple horizons. We review the solitonic methods applicable to higher-dimensional vacuum spacetimes and present some five-dimensional examples derived from the methods.
