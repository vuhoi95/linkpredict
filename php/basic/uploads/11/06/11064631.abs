Title: Summing Up All Genus Free Energy of ABJM Matrix Model
Authors: Hiroyuki Fuji and Shinji Hirano and Sanefumi Moriyama
Abstract: The localization technique allows us to compute the free energy of the U(N)_k x U(N)_{-k} Chern-Simons-matter theory dual to type IIA strings on AdS_4 x CP^3 from weak to strong 't Hooft coupling \lambda = N / k at finite N, as demonstrated by Drukker, Marino, and Putrov. In this note we study further the free energy at large 't Hooft coupling with the aim of testing AdS/CFT at the quantum gravity level and, in particular, sum up all the 1/N corrections, apart from the worldsheet instanton contributions. The all genus partition function takes a remarkably simple form -- the Airy function, Ai (k^{4/3} \lambda_r), with the renormalized 't Hooft coupling \lambda_r.
