Title: Collective Dipole Model of AdS/CFT and Higher Spin Gravity
Authors: Antal Jevicki and Kewang Jin and Qibin Ye
Abstract: We formulate a first quantized construction of the AdS_{d+1}/CFT_d correspondence using the bi-local representation of the free d-dimensional large N vector model. The earlier reconstruction of AdS_4 higher-spin gravity provides a scheme where the AdS spacetime (and higher-spin fields) are given by the composite bi-local fields. The underlying first quantized, world-sheet picture is extracted in the present work and generalized to any dimension. A higher-spin AdS particle model is shown to emerge from the collective bi-particle system of Minkowski particles through a canonical transformation. As such this construction provides a simple explicit mechanism of the AdS/CFT correspondence.
