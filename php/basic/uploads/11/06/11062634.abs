Title: Minimal Model Holography for SO(2N)
Authors: Matthias R Gaberdiel and Carl Vollenweider
Abstract: A duality between the large N 't Hooft limit of the WD_N minimal model CFTs and a higher spin gravity theory on AdS3 is proposed. The gravity theory has massless spin fields of all even spins s=2,4,6,..., as well as two real scalar fields whose mass is determined by the 't Hooft parameter of the CFT. We show that, to leading order in the large N limit, the 1-loop partition function of the higher spin theory matches precisely with the CFT partition function.
