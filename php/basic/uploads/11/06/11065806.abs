Title: Interacting non-BPS black holes
Authors: Guillaume Bossard and Clement Ruef
Abstract: We explain how to exploit systematically the structure of nilpotent orbits to obtain a solvable system of equations describing extremal solutions of (super-)gravity theories, i.e. systems that can be solved in a linear way. We present the procedure in the case of the STU model, where we show that all extremal solutions with a flat three-dimensional base are fully described with the help of three different nilpotent orbits: the BPS, the almost-BPS and the composite non-BPS. The latter describes a new class of solutions for which the orientation of half of the constituent branes have been inverted with respect to the BPS one, such that all the centres are intrinsically non-BPS, and interact with each others. We finally recover explicitly the ensemble of the almost-BPS solutions in our formalism and present an explicit two-centre solution of the new class.
