Title: Finite-size Giant Magnons on AdS_4 x CP^3_Î³
Authors: Changrim Ahn and Plamen Bozhilov
Abstract: We investigate finite-size giant magnons propagating on \gamma-deformed AdS_4 x CP^3_{\gamma} type IIA string theory background, dual to one parameter deformation of the N=6 super Chern-Simoms-matter theory. Analyzing the finite-size effect on the dispersion relation, we find that it is modified compared to the undeformed case, acquiring \gamma dependence.
