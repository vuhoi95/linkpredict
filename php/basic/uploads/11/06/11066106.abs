Title: A Simple Method of Calculating Effective Operators
Authors: N. Haba and K. Kaneta and S. Matsumoto and T. Nabeshima
Abstract: It is important to obtain effective operators by integrating out high energy degrees of freedom in physics. We suggest a general method of calculating accurate irrelevant operators in a scattering process without use of equation of motions. By using this method, for example, we will represent a complete set of dimension six operators in QCD, which are induced from physics beyond the standard model, supersymmetry and universal extra dimension. We will also show an example of effective anomalous 4-Fermi interactions induced from a little Higgs model.
