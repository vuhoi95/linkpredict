Title: Disc amplitudes, picture changing and space-time actions
Authors: Katrin Becker and Guangyu Guo and Daniel Robbins
Abstract: We study in detail the procedure for obtaining couplings of D-branes to closed string fields by evaluating string theory disc amplitudes. We perform a careful construction of the relevant vertex operators and discuss the effects of inserting the boundary state which encodes the presence of the D-brane. We confront the issue of non-decoupling of BRST-exact states and prove that the problem is evaded for the computations we need, thus demonstrating that our amplitudes are automatically gauge-invariant and independent of the distribution of picture charge. Finally, we compute explicitly the two-point amplitudes of two NS-NS fields or one NS-NS and one R-R field on the disc, and we carefully compare all the lowest order terms with predictions from supergravity.
