Title: Supersymmetric Nonlinear Sigma Model in AdS_5
Authors: Jonathan Bagger and Jingsheng Li
Abstract: We construct the supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model in a fixed AdS_5 background. We use component fields and find that the complex bosons must be the coordinates of a hyper-Kahler manifold that admits a Killing vector satisfying an inhomogeneous tri-holomorphic condition. We propose boundary conditions that map the on-shell bulk hypermultiplets into off-shell chiral multiplets on 3-branes that foliate the bulk. The supersymmetric AdS_5 isometries reduce to superconformal transformations on the brane fields.
