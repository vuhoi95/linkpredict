Title: Emergent Schrodinger geometries from mass-deformed CFT
Authors: Hee-Cheol Kim and Seok Kim and Kimyeong Lee and Jaemo Park
Abstract: We study an M-theory solution for the holographic flow of AdS4 times Sasaki-Einstein 7-manifolds with skew-whiffing, perturbed by a mass operator. The infrared solution contains the 5 dimensional Schrodinger geometry after considering the gravity dual of the standard non-relativistic limit of relativistic field theories. The mass deformation of the field theory is discussed in detail for the case with 7 manifold being a round sphere.
