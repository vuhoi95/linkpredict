Title: Relative Locality in $κ$-Poincaré
Authors: Giulia Gubitosi and Flavio Mercati
Abstract: We show that the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e Hopf algebra can be interpreted in the framework of curved momentum space leading to the relativity of locality \cite{AFKS}. We study the geometric properties of the momentum space described by $\kappa$-Poincar\'e, and derive the consequences for particles propagation and energy-momentum conservation laws in interaction vertices, obtaining for the first time a coherent and fully workable model of the deformed relativistic kinematics implied by $\kappa$-Poincar\'e. We describe the action of boost transformations on multi-particles systems, showing that in order to keep covariant the composed momenta it is necessary to introduce a dependence of the rapidity parameter on the particles momenta themselves. Finally, we show that this particular form of the boost transformations keeps the validity of the relativity principle, demonstrating the invariance of the equations of motion under boost transformations.
