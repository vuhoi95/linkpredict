Title: Comments on Worldsheet Description of the Omega Background
Authors: Yu Nakayama and Hirosi Ooguri
Abstract: Nekrasov's partition function is defined on a flat bundle of R^4 over S^1 called the Omega background. When the fibration is self-dual, the partition function is known to be equal to the topological string partition function, which computes scattering amplitudes of self-dual gravitons and graviphotons in type II superstring compactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold. We propose a generalization of this correspondence when the fibration is not necessarily self-dual.
