Title: An(1) Affine Quiver Matrix Model
Authors: Hiroshi Itoyama and Takeshi Oota
Abstract: We introduce An(1) (n=1,2,...) affine quiver matrix model by simply adopting the extended Cartan matrices as incidence matrices and study its finite N Schwinger-Dyson equations as well as their planar limit. In the case of n=1, we extend our analysis to derive the cubic planar loop equation for one-parameter family of models labelled by alpha: alpha=1 and alpha=2 correspond to the non-affine A2 case and the affine A1(1) case respectively. In the case of n=2, we derive three sets of constraint equations for the resolvents which are quadratic, cubic and quartic respectively.
