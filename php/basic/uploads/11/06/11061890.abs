Title: Quantization of 2-Plectic Manifolds
Authors: Christian Saemann and Richard J. Szabo
Abstract: We describe an extension of the axioms of quantization to the case of 2-plectic manifolds. We show how such quantum spaces can be obtained as stable classical solutions in a zero-dimensional 3-algebra reduced model obtained by dimensional reduction of the Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson theory. We demonstrate that the groupoid approach to geometric quantization proposed by Hawkins and others can be useful for quantizing 2-plectic manifolds. We discuss our results in the context of recent developments in the quantum geometry of M-branes, and in the nonassociative deformation of spacetime induced by closed strings in the presence of a 2-plectic form.
