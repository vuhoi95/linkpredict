Title: Chiral Phase Transitions around Black Holes
Authors: Antonino Flachi and Takahiro Tanaka
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the possibility that chiral phase transitions, analogous to those of QCD, occur in the vicinity of a black hole. If the black hole is surrounded by a gas of strongly interacting particles, an inhomogeneous condensate will form. We demonstrate this by explicitly constructing self-consistent solutions.
