Title: Effects of anisotropic dynamics on cosmic strings
Authors: Kerstin E. Kunze and Mairi Sakellariadou
Abstract: The dynamics of cosmic strings is considered in anisotropic backgrounds. In particular, the behaviour of infinitely long straight cosmic strings and of cosmic string loops is determined. Small perturbations of a straight cosmic string are calculated. The relevance of these results is discussed with respect to the possible observational imprints of an anisotropic phase on the behaviour of a cosmic string network.
