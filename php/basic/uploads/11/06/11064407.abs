Title: Holographic Dual of the Reissner-Nordstr√∂m Black Hole
Authors: Chiang-Mei Chen and Jia-Rui Sun
Abstract: In this article we give a brief, nevertheless, comprehensive review on recent studies in the quantum gravity description of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole from the perspective of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We survey the known evidence supporting a two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) description holographically dual to the RN black hole.
