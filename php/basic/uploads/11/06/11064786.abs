Title: Fast Scramblers Of Small Size
Authors: J. L. F. Barbon and J. M. Magan
Abstract: We investigate various geometrical aspects of the notion of `optical depth' in the thermal atmosphere of black hole horizons. Optical depth has been proposed as a measure of fast-crambling times in such black hole systems, and the associated optical metric suggests that classical chaos plays a leading role in the actual scrambling mechanism. We study the behavior of the optical depth with the size of the system and find that AdS/CFT phase transitions with topology change occur naturally as the scrambler becomes smaller than its thermal length. In the context of detailed AdS/CFT models based on D-branes, T-duality implies that small scramblers are described in terms of matrix quantum mechanics.
