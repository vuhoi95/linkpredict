Title: R-symmetry Matching In SUSY Breaking Models
Authors: Jessica Goodman and Masahiro Ibe and Yuri Shirman and Felix Yu
Abstract: Low energy descriptions of metastable supersymmetry breaking models often possess an accidental R-symmetry. Viable phenomenological applications of this class of models require R-symmetry to be broken in the ground state. This can be achieved in O'Raifeartaigh-like models where some of the chiral superfields carry negative R-charges. In this paper we consider UV completions of this class of models and formulate necessary conditions that they must satisfy. We show that the R-symmetry of the IR description can be traced to an anomalous or anomaly-free R-symmetry of the UV theory and discuss several representative examples.
