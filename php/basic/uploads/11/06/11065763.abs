Title: Wilson Loops in N=2 Super-Yang-Mills from Matrix Model
Authors: F. Passerini and K. Zarembo
Abstract: We compute the expectation value of the circular Wilson loop in N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with N_f=2N hypermultiplets. Our results indicate that the string tension in the dual string theory scales as the logarithm of the 't Hooft coupling.
