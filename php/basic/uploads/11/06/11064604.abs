Title: Ultrarelativistic Bose-Einstein Gas on Lorentz Symmetry Violation
Authors: J. A. de Sales and T. Costa-Soares and V. J. Vasquez Otoya
Abstract: In this paper we study the effects of Lorentz Symmetry Breaking on thermodynamics properties of ideal gases. Inspired in the dispersion relation came from the Carroll-Field-Jackiw model for Electrodynamics with Lorentz and CPT violation term, we compute the thermodynamics quantities for a Boltzmann, Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein distributions. Two regimes are analyzed: the non- relativistic and the relativistic one. In the first case we show that the topological mass induced by the Chern-Simons term behaves as a chemical potential. For the Bose-Einstein gases it could be found a condensation in both regimes, being the appearance of a condensate in the relativistic regime, the main contribution of this work.
