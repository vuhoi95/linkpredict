Title: Topological parameters in gravity
Authors: Romesh K. Kaul and Sandipan Sengupta
Abstract: We present the Hamiltonian analysis of the theory of gravity based on a Lagrangian density containing Hilbert-Palatini term along with three topological densities, Nieh-Yan, Pontryagin and Euler. The addition of these topological terms modifies the symplectic structure non-trivially. The resulting canonical theory develops a dependence on three parameters which are coefficients of these terms. In the time gauge, we obtain a real SU (2) gauge theoretic description with a set of seven first class constraints corresponding to three SU (2) rotations, three spatial diffeomorphism and one to evolution in a timelike direction. Inverse of the coefficient of Nieh-Yan term, identified as Barbero-Immirzi parameter, acts as the coupling constant of the gauge theory.
