Title: The Discrete Composite Higgs Model
Authors: Giuliano Panico and Andrea Wulzer
Abstract: We describe a concrete, predictive incarnation of the general paradigm of a composite Higgs boson, which provides a valid alternative to the standard holographic models in five space-time dimensions. Differently from the latter, our model is four-dimensional and simple enough to be implemented in an event generator for collider studies. The model is inspired by dimensional deconstruction and hence it retains useful features of the five-dimensional scenario, in particular, the Higgs potential is finite and calculable. Therefore our setup, in spite of being simple, provides a complete description of the composite Higgs physics. After constructing the model we present a first analysis of its phenomenology, focusing on the structure of the Higgs potential, on the constraints from the EWPT and on the spectrum of the new particles.
