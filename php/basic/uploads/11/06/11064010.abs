Title: Moving Defects in AdS/CFT
Authors: Stefan Janiszewski and Andreas Karch
Abstract: We study defects of various dimensions moving through Anti-de Sitter space. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence this allows us to probe aspects of the dual quantum field theory. We focus on the energy loss experienced by these defects as they move through the CFT plasma. We find that the behavior of these physical quantities is governed by induced world-volume horizons. We identify world-volume analogs for several gravitational phenomena including black holes, the Hawking-Page phase transition and expanding cosmological horizons.
