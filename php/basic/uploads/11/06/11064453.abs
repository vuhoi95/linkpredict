Title: N=2 supersymmetric particle near extreme Kerr throat
Authors: Stefano Bellucci and Sergey Krivonos
Abstract: We construct a new N=2 supersymmetric extension of a massive particle moving near the horizon of the extreme Kerr black hole. Our supercharges and Hamiltonian contain the proper number of fermions (two for each bosonic variables). The key ingredient of our construction is a proper choice of the bosonic variables which all have a clear geometric meaning.
