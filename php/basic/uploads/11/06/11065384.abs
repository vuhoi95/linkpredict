Title: Large and strong scale dependent bispectrum in single field inflation  from a sharp feature in the mass
Authors: Frederico Arroja and Antonio Enea Romano and Misao Sasaki
Abstract: We study an inflationary model driven by a single minimally coupled standard kinetic term scalar field with a step in its mass modeled by an Heaviside step function. We present an analytical approximation for the mode function of the curvature perturbation, obtain the power spectrum analytically and compare it with the numerical result. We show that, after the scale set by the step, the spectrum contains damped oscillations that are well described by our analytical approximation. We also compute the dominant contribution to the bispectrum in the equilateral and the squeezed limits and find new shapes. In the equilateral and squeezed limits the bispectrum oscillates and it has a linear growth envelope towards smaller scales. The bispectrum size can be large depending on the model parameters.
