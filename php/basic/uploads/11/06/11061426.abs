Authors: H. T. Cho and A. S. Cornell and Jason Doukas and Wade Naylor
Abstract: We derive expressions for the general five-dimensional metric for Kerr-(A)dS black holes. The Klein-Gordon equation is explicitly separated and we show that the angular part of the wave equation leads to just one spheroidal wave equation, which is also that for charged five-dimensional Kerr-(A)dS black holes. We present results for the perturbative expansion of the angular eigenvalue in powers of the rotation parameters up to 6th order and compare numerically with the continued fraction method.
