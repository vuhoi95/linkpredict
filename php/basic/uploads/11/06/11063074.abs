Title: A Seiberg Dual for the MSSM: Partially Composite W and Z
Authors: Csaba Csaki and Yuri Shirman and John Terning
Abstract: We examine the possibility that the SU(2) gauge group of the standard model appears as the dual "magnetic" gauge group of a supersymmetric gauge theory, thus the W and Z (and through mixing, the photon) are composite (or partially composite) gauge bosons. Fully composite gauge bosons are expected to interact strongly at the duality scale, and a large running is needed to match the electroweak gauge couplings. Alternatively one can mix the composite "magnetic" gauge bosons with some elementary ones to obtain realistic models. In the simplest and most compelling example the Higgs and top are composite, the W and Z partially composite and the light fermions elementary. The effective theory is an NMSSM-type model where the singlet is a component of the composite meson. There is no little hierarchy problem and the Higgs mass can be as large as 400 GeV. This "fat Higgs"-like model can be considered as an explicit 4D implementation of RS-type models with gauge fields in the bulk.
