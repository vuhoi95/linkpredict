Title: Holographic Duals of D=3 N=4 Superconformal Field Theories
Authors: Benjamin Assel and Costas Bachas and John Estes and Jaume Gomis
Abstract: We find the warped AdS_4 x K type-IIB supergravity solutions holographically dual to a large family of three dimensional \cN=4 superconformal field theories labeled by a pair (\rho,\hat\rho) of partitions of N. These superconformal theories arise as renormalization group fixed points of three dimensional mirror symmetric quiver gauge theories, denoted by T^{\rho}_{\hat \rho}(SU(N)) and T_{\rho}^{\hat \rho}(SU(N)) respectively. We give a supergravity derivation of the conjectured field theory constraints that must be satisfied in order for these gauge theories to flow to a non-trivial supersymmetric fixed point in the infrared. The exotic global symmetries of these superconformal field theories are precisely realized in our explicit supergravity description.
