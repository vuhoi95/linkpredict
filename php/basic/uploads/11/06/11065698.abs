Title: On 2d TQFTs whose values are holomorphic symplectic varieties
Authors: Gregory W. Moore and Yuji Tachikawa
Abstract: For simple and simply-connected complex algebraic group G, we conjecture the existence of a functor eta_G from the category of 2-bordisms to the category of holomorphic symplectic varieties with Hamiltonian action, such that gluing of boundaries corresponds to the holomorphic symplectic quotient with respect to the diagonal action of G. We describe various properties of eta_G obtained via string-theoretic analysis. Mathematicians are urged to construct eta_G rigorously.
