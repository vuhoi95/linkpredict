Title: 4D gravity on a non-BPS bent dilatonic brane
Authors: R. C. Fonseca and F. A. Brito and L. Losano
Abstract: We investigate the localization of metastable four-dimensional gravity around a bent dilatonic brane, embedded into a five-dimensional space, that exists only up to distances sufficiently small compared to a crossover scale. Far from such scale, five-dimensional effects strongly deviate the Newtonian potential. We study this effect by considering localization of massive gravity on a non-BPS bent dilatonic 3-brane solution of a five-dimensional supergravity. Our results show that the cosmological constant on the bent brane controls the size of the crossover scale. For sufficiently small positive cosmological constant, that is in accord with the present observations, the crossover scale becomes very large.
