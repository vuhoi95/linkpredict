Authors: Xiao-Mei Kuang and Wei-Jia Li and Yi Ling
Abstract: We construct a holographic p-wave superconductor model in the framework of quasi-topological gravity in the probe limit. The relation between the critical temperature and the coupling parameters of higher curvature terms is investigated. The numerical results for conductivity are presented as well. It turns out that our data fits the Drude model very well in the low frequency limit, and the values of DC conductivity as well as the relaxation time are obtained numerically.
