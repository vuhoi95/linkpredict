Title: Scalar Fields in BTZ Black Hole Spacetime and Entanglement Entropy
Authors: Dharm Veer Singh and Sanjay Siwach
Abstract: We study the quantum scalar fields in background of BTZ black hole spacetime. We calculate the entanglement entropy using the discretized model, which resembles a system of coupled harmonic oscillators. The leading term of the entropy formula is standard Bakenstein-Hawking entropy and sub-leading corresponds to quantum corrections to black hole entropy. We calculate the co-efficent of sub-leading logarithmic corrections numerically.
