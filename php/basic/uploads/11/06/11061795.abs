Title: 4+1 dimensional homogeneous anisotropic string cosmological models
Authors: B. Mojaveri and A. Rezaei-Aghdam
Abstract: We present exact solutions of string cosmological models characterized by five dimensional metrics (with four-dimensional real Lie groups as isometry groups), space independent dilaton and vanishing torsion. As an example we consider VII 0 \oplus R model and show that it is equivalent to the (4 +1)-dimensional cosmological model coupled to perfect fluid with negative deceleration parameters (accelerating universe).
