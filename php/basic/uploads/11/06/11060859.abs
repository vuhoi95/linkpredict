Title: Quadratic corrections to three-point functions
Authors: D. Arnaudov and R. C. Rashkov
Abstract: Following the recent progress on the calculation of three-point correlators with two "heavy" (with large quantum numbers) and one "light" states at strong coupling, we compute the logarithmic divergent terms of leading bosonic quantum corrections to correlation functions with "heavy" operators corresponding to simple string solutions in AdS_5 x S^5. The "light" operator is chosen to be the dilaton. An important relation connecting the corrections to both the dimensions of "heavy" states, and the structure constants is recovered.
