Title: Bose-Einstein Condensation on Product Manifolds
Authors: Guglielmo Fucci and Klaus Kirsten
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation on manifolds constructed as a product of a three-dimensional Euclidian space and a general smooth, compact $d$-dimensional manifold possibly with boundary. By using spectral $\zeta$-function methods, we are able to explicitly provide thermodynamical quantities like the critical temperature and the specific heat when the gas of bosons is confined, in the three-dimensional manifold, by the experimentally relevant anisotropic harmonic oscillator potential.
