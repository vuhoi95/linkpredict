Title: Relativistic Landau-Aharonov-Casher quantization based on the Lorentz  symmetry violation background
Authors: K. Bakke and H. Belich and E. O. Silva
Abstract: Based on the discussions about the Aharonov-Casher effect in the Lorentz symmetry violation background, we show that the analogue of the relativistic Landau quantization in the Aharonov-Casher setup can be achieved in the Lorentz-symmetry violation background.
