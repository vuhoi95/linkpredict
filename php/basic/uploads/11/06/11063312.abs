Title: Cosmology of the Galileon from Massive Gravity
Authors: Claudia de Rham and Lavinia Heisenberg
Abstract: We covariantize the decoupling limit of massive gravity proposed in arXiv:1011.1232 and study the cosmology of this theory as a proxy, which embodies key features of the fully non-linear covariant theory. We first confirm that it exhibits a self-accelerating solution, similar to what has been found in arXiv:1010.1780, where the Hubble parameter corresponds to the graviton mass. For a certain range of parameters fluctuations relative to the self-accelerating background are stable and form an attractor solution. We also show that a degravitating solution can not be constructed in this covariantized proxy theory in a meaningful way. As for cosmic structure formation, we find that the helicity-0 mode of the graviton causes an enhancement relative to LCDM. For consistency we also compare proxy theories obtained starting from different frames in the decoupling limit and discuss the possibility of obtaining a non-representative proxy theory by choosing the wrong starting frame.
