Title: Gravitational collapse of quantum matter
Authors: Benjamin K. Tippett and Viqar Husain
Abstract: We describe a class of exactly soluble models for gravitational collapse in spherical symmetry obtained by patching dynamical spherically symmetric exterior spacetimes with cosmological interior spacetimes. These are generalizations of the Oppenheimer-Snyder type models to include classical and quantum scalar fields as sources for the interior metric, and null fluids with pressure as sources for the exterior metric. In addition to dynamical exteriors, the models exhibit other novel features such as evaporating horizons, and singularity avoidance without quantum gravity.
