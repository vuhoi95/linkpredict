Title: Universal fermionic spectral functions from string theory
Authors: Jerome P. Gauntlett and Julian Sonner and Daniel Waldram
Abstract: We carry out the first holographic calculation of a fermionic response function for a strongly coupled $d=3$ system with an explicit D=10 or D=11 supergravity dual. By considering the supersymmetry current, we obtain a universal result applicable to all d=3 N=2 SCFTs with such duals. Surprisingly, the spectral function does not exhibit a Fermi surface, despite the fact that the system is at finite charge density. We show that it has a phonino pole and at low frequencies there is a depletion of spectral weight with a power-law scaling which is governed by a locally quantum critical point.
