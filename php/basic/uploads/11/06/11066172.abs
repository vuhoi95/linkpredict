Abstract: Ratios of azimuthal angle correlations between two jets produced at large rapidity separation are studied in the N=4 super Yang-Mills theory (MSYM). It is shown that these observables, which directly prove the SL(2,C) symmetry present in gauge theories in the Regge limit, exhibit an excellent perturbative convergence. They are compared to those calculated in QCD for different renormalization schemes concluding that the momentum-substraction (MOM) scheme with the Brodsky-Lepage-Mackenzie (BLM) scale-fixing procedure captures the bulk of the MSYM results.
