Title: Classical strings in $AdS_4\times\mathbb{CP}^3$ with three angular  momenta
Authors: Sergio Giardino and Hector L. Carri√≥n
Abstract: In this paper, rotating strings in three directions of $AdS_4 \times \mathbb{CP}^3$ geometry are studied; its divergent energy limit, and conserved charges are also determined. An interpretation of these configurations as either giant magnons or spiky strings are discussed.
