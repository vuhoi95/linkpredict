Title: MOND cosmology from entropic force
Authors: Hongsheng Zhang and Xin-Zhou Li
Abstract: We derive the MOND cosmology which is uniquely corresponding to the original MOND at galaxy scales via entropic gravity method. It inherits the key merit of MOND, that is, it reduces the baryonic matter and non-baryonic dark matter into baryonic matter only. For the first time we obtain the critical parameter in MOND, i.e., the transition acceleration $a_c$ at cosmological scale. We thus solve the long-standing coincidence problem $a_c\sim cH_{0}$. More interestingly, a term like age-graphic dark energy emerges naturally. In the frame of this MOND cosmology, we only need baryonic matter to describe both dark matter and dark energy in standard cosmology.
