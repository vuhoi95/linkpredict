Title: On Chern-Simons Quivers and Toric Geometry
Authors: Adil Belhaj and Pablo Diaz and Maria Pilar Garcia del Moral and Antonio Segui
Abstract: We discuss a class of 3-dimensional N=4 Chern-Simons (CS) quiver gauge models obtained from M-theory compactifications on singular complex 4-dimensional hyper-Kahler (HK) manifolds, which are realized explicitly as a cotangent bundle over two-Fano toric varieties V^2. The corresponding CS gauge models are encoded in quivers similar to toric diagrams of V^2. Using toric geometry, it is shown that the constraints on CS levels can be related to toric equations determining V^2.
