Title: Energy loss by radiation to all orders in 1/N
Authors: Bartomeu Fiol and Blai Garolera
Abstract: We use the AdS/CFT correspondence to compute the energy radiated by an infinitely massive half-BPS particle charged under N=4 SU(N) SYM, transforming in the symmetric or antisymmetric representation of the gauge group, and moving in the vacuum, to all orders in 1/N and for large 't Hooft coupling. For the antisymmetric case we consider D5-branes reaching the boundary of AdS_5 at arbitrary timelike trajectories, while for the symmetric case, we consider a D3-brane in AdS_5 that reaches the boundary at a hyperbola. This D3-brane solution is the analytic continuation of the one previously used to compute the expectation value of a circular Wilson loop. We compare our results to the one obtained for the fundamental representation by Mikhailov, obtained by considering a string in AdS_5.
