Title: Kinetics of Spin Relaxation in Wires and Channels: Boundary Spin Echo  and Tachyons
Authors: V. A. Slipko and Y. V. Pershin
Abstract: In this paper we use a spin kinetic equation to study spin polarization dynamics in 1D wires and 2D channels. This approach is valid in both diffusive and ballistic spin transport regimes and, therefore, more general than the usual spin drift-diffusion equations. In particular, we demonstrate that in infinite 1D wires with Rashba spin-orbit interaction the exponential spin relaxation decay can be modulated by an oscillating function. In the case of spin relaxation in finite length 1D wires, it is shown that an initially homogeneous spin polarization spontaneously transforms into a persistent spin helix. An interesting sound waves echo-like behavior of initially localized spin polarization packet is found in finite length wires. We show that a propagating spin polarization profile reflects from a system boundary and returns back to its initial position similarly to the reflectance of sound waves from an obstacle. Green's function of spin kinetic equation is found for both finite and infinite 1D systems. Moreover, we demonstrate explicitly that the spin relaxation in 2D channels with Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions of equal strength occurs similarly to that in 1D wires of finite length. Finally, a simple transformation mapping 1D spin kinetic equation into the Klein-Gordon equation with an imaginary mass is found thus establishing an interesting connection between semiconductor spintronics and relativistic quantum mechanics.
