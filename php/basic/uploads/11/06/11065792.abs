Abstract: Using the constrained superfields formalism to describe the interactions of a light goldstino to matter fields in supersymmetric models, we identify generalised, higher-order holomorphic superfield constraints that project out the superpartners and capture the non-universal couplings of the goldstino to matter fields. These arise from microscopic theories in which heavy superpartners masses are of the order of the supersymmetry breaking scale (\sqrt f). In the decoupling limit of infinite superpartners masses, these constraints reduce to the familiar, lower-order universal constraints discussed recently, that describe the universal goldstino-matter fields couplings, suppressed by inverse powers of \sqrt f. We initiate the study of the couplings of the Standard Model (SM) fields to goldstino in the constrained superfields formalism.
