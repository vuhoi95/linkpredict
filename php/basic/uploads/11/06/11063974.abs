Title: On the regularity of the 2+1 dimensional Skyrme model
Authors: Dan-Andrei Geba and Daniel da Silva
Abstract: One of the most interesting open problems concerning the Skyrme model of nuclear physics is the regularity of its solutions. In this article, we study 2+1 dimensional equivariant Skyrme maps, for which we prove, using the method of multipliers, that the energy does not concentrate. This is one of the crucial steps towards a global regularity theory.
