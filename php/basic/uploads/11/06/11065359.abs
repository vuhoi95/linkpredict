Title: Towards Large Volume Big Divisor D3-D7 "mu-Split Supersymmetry" and  Ricci-Flat Swiss-Cheese Metrics, and Dimension-Six Neutrino Mass Operators
Authors: Mansi Dhuria and Aalok Misra
Abstract: We show that it is possible to realize a "mu-split SUSY" scenario [1] in the context of large volume limit of type IIB compactifications on Swiss-Cheese Calabi-Yau's in the presence of a mobile space-time filling D3-brane and a (stack of) D7-brane(s) wrapping the "big" divisor Sigma_B. For this, we investigate the possibility of getting one Higgs to be light while other to be heavy in addition to a heavy Higgsino mass parameter. Further, we examine the existence of long lived gluino that manifests one of the major consequences of mu-split SUSY scenario, by computing its decay width as well as lifetime corresponding to the 3-body decays of the gluino into a quark, a squark and a neutralino or Goldstino, as well as 2-body decays of the gluino into either a neutralino or a Goldstino and a gluon. Guided by the geometric Kaehler potential for Sigma_B obtained in [2] based on GLSM techniques, and the Donaldson's algorithm [3] for obtaining numerically a Ricci-flat metric, we give details of our calculation in [4] pertaining to our proposed metric for the full Swiss-Cheese Calabi-Yau, but for simplicity of calculation, close to Sigma_B, which is Ricci-flat in the large volume limit. Also, as an application of the one-loop RG flow solution for the Higgsino mass parameter, we show that the contribution to the neutrino masses at the EW scale from dimension-six operators arising from the Kaehler potential, is suppressed relative to the Weinberg-type dimension-five operators.
