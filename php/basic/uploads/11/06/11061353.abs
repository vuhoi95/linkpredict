Title: Charge-density waves in deconfining SU(2) Yang-Mills thermodynamics
Authors: Carlos Falquez and Ralf Hofmann and Tilo Baumbach
Abstract: At one-loop accuracy we compute, characterize, and discuss the dispersion laws for the three low-momentum branches of propagating longitudinal, electric U(1) fields in the effective theory for the deconfining phase of pure SU(2) Yang-Mills thermodynamics. With an electric-magnetically dual interpretation of SU(2)$_{\tiny CMB}$ we argue that upon a breaking of plasma isotropy and homogeneity, introduced e.g. by a temperature gradient, the longitudinal modes could conspire to provide magnetic seed fields for magneto-hydrodynamical dynamos inside structures of galaxy, galaxy-cluster, and cosmological scales. Such a scenario ultimately links structure with seed-field formation. As judged from the present cosmological epoch, the maximally available coherent field strength of 10$^{-8}$\,Gauss from SU(2)$_{\tiny CMB}$ matches with the upper bound for cosmological present-day field strength derived from small-angle anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background.
