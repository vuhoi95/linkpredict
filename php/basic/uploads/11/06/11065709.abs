Title: Ultralocal energy density in massive gravity
Authors: V. O. Soloviev and M. V. Tchichikina
Abstract: We provide a space-time covariant Hamiltonian treatment for a finite-range gravitational theory. The Kuchar approach is used to demonstrate the bimetric picture of space-time in its most transparent form. This Hamiltonian formalism is applied for the straightforward realization of the Poincar\'e algebra in Dirac brackets. It uncovers the simplest form of the Poincar\'e generators expressed as spatial integrals of ultralocal quantities constructed pure algebraically by means of the two space-time metrics.
