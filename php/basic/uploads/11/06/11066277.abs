Title: A Non-relativistic Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory from a Holographic  Point of View
Authors: Eric A. Bergshoeff and Sjoerd de Haan and Wout Merbis and Jan Rosseel
Abstract: We study a fourth-order derivative scalar field configuration in a fixed Lifshitz background. Using an auxiliary field we rewrite the equations of motion as two coupled second order equations. We specialize to the limit that the mass of the scalar field degenerates with that of the auxiliary field and show that logarithmic modes appear. Using non-relativistic holographic methods we calculate the two-point correlation functions of the boundary operators in this limit and find evidence for a non-relativistic logarithmic conformal field theory at the boundary.
