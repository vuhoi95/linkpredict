Title: A new dynamical reflection algebra and related quantum integrable  systems
Authors: J. Avan and E. Ragoucy
Abstract: We propose a new dynamical reflection algebra, distinct from the previous dynamical boundary algebra and semi-dynamical reflection algebra. The associated Yang-Baxter equations, coactions, fusions, and commuting traces are derived. Explicit examples are given and quantum integrable Hamiltonians are constructed. They exhibit features similar to the Ruijsenaars-Schneider Hamiltonians.
