Title: Note on SUSY BF theory in (1+2) dimensions from SUSY algebra for  vector-spinor field
Authors: Kazunari Shima and Motomu Tsuda
Abstract: We show in (1+2) dimensions that supersymmetric (SUSY) BF action for a (minimal and off-shell) spin-(1,3/2) supermultiplet is a unique SUSY invariant one required from the closure property of commutator algebra for SUSY transformations.
