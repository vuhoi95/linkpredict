Title: Ho≈ôava-Lifshitz Quantum Cosmology
Authors: Orfeu Bertolami and Carlos A. D. Zarro
Abstract: In this work, a minisuperspace model for the projectable Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity without the detailed balance condition is investigated. The Wheeler-deWitt equation is derived and its solutions are studied and discussed for some particular cases where, due to HL gravity, there is a "potential barrier" nearby $a=0$. For a vanishing cosmological constant, it is found a normalizable wave function of the universe. When the cosmological constant is non-vanishing, the WKB method is used to obtain solutions for the wave function of the universe. Using the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, one discusses how the transition from quantum to classical regime occurs and, for the case of a positive cosmological constant, the scale factor is shown to grow exponentially, hence recovering the GR behaviour for the late universe.
