Title: Schwinger-Dyson equations and disorder
Authors: Adam P. Szczepaniak and Hugo Reinhardt
Abstract: Using simple models in D=0+0 and D=0+1 dimensions we construct partition functions and compute two-point correlations. The exact result is compared with saddle-point approximation and solutions of Schwinger-Dyson equations. When integrals are dominated by more than one saddle-point we find Schwinger-Dyson equations do not reproduce the correct results unless the action is first transformed into dual variables.
