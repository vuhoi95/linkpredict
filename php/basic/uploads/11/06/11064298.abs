Title: Three-point correlators: Examples from Lunin-Maldacena background
Authors: D. Arnaudov and R. C. Rashkov
Abstract: Recently there has been progress on the calculation of three-point functions with two "heavy" operators via semiclassical methods. We extend this analysis to the case of the Lunin-Maldacena background, and examine the suggested procedure for several simple string solutions. By making use of AdS/CFT duality, we derive the relevant correlation functions of operators belonging to the dual N=1 superconformal gauge theory, and recover an important relation connecting the dimensions of "heavy" states and the structure constants.
