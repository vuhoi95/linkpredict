Title: Odd-dimensional de Sitter Space is Transparent
Authors: Philip Lagogiannis and Alexander Maloney and Yi Wang
Abstract: We consider quantum field theory in de Sitter space, focusing on the cases of scalars, spin 1/2 fields, and symmetric and anti-symmetric tensor fields of arbitrary spin. The free field equations in global coordinates can be reduced to a one dimensional Schrodinger problem which possesses a remarkable structure; the potential is of an algebraically special type which appears as a multi-soliton solution of the KdV equation. In an odd number of spacetime dimensions these potentials are "transparent" in the sense that their reflection coefficients vanish identically. This has a remarkable consequence for physics in de Sitter space. It means that odd dimensional de Sitter space is transparent in the sense that a quantum state with no particles at past infinity will evolve into a state with no particles in the far future. This feature has been previously noted for scalar excitations, but the corresponding higher spin behaviour (and the proof using algebraic techniques) is new.
