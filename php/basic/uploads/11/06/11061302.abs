Abstract: We reconsider in details the Dirac equation in the context of the Magueijo-Smolin approach to the Doubly Special Relativity. Starting from the deformed dispersion relation we obtain the Dirac equation in momentum space, allowing us to achieve a more in-depth study of its semiclassical approach. Finally by means of a deformed correspondence principle we gain access to an equation in the position space.
