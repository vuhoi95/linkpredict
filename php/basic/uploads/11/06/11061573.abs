Title: Laboratory Tests of the Galileon
Authors: Philippe Brax and Clare Burrage and Anne-Christine Davis
Abstract: The Galileon model is a ghost free scalar effective field theory containing higher derivative terms that are protected by the Galileon symmetry. The presence of a Vainshtein screening mechanism allows the scalar field to couple to matter without mediating unacceptably large fifth forces in the solar system. We describe how laboratory measurements of the Casimir effect and possible deviations from Newtonian gravity can be used to search for Galileon scalar fields. Current experimental measurements are used to bound a previously unconstrained combination of Galileon parameters.
