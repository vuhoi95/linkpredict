Title: Brane embeddings in sphere submanifolds
Authors: Nikos Karaiskos and Konstadinos Sfetsos and Efstratios Tsatis
Abstract: Wrapping a D(8-p)-brane on AdS_2 times a submanifold of S^{8-p} introduces point-like defects in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence for a Dp-brane background. We classify and work out the details in all possible cases with a single embedding angular coordinate. Brane embeddings of the temperature and beta-deformed near horizon D3-brane backgrounds are also examined. We comment on the relevance of our results to holographic lattices and dimers.
