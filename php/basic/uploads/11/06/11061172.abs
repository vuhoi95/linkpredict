Title: Para-Liouville/Toda central charges from M5-branes
Authors: Tatsuma Nishioka and Yuji Tachikawa
Abstract: We propose that N M5-branes, put on R^4/Z_m with deformation parameters epsilon_{1,2}, realize two-dimensional theory with SU(m)_N symmetry and m-th para-W_N symmetry. This includes the standard W_N symmetry for m=1 and super-Viraroro symmetry for m=N=2. We provide a small check of this proposal by calculating the central charge of the 2d theory from the anomaly polynomial of the 6d theory.
