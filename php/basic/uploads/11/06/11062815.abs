Title: Purely Kinetic Coupled Gravity
Authors: Giulia Gubitosi and Eric V. Linder
Abstract: Cosmic acceleration can be achieved not only with a sufficiently flat scalar field potential but through kinetic terms coupled to gravity. These derivative couplings impose a shift symmetry on the scalar field, aiding naturalness. We write the most general purely kinetic action not exceeding mass dimension six and obeying second order field equations. The result reduces to a simple form involving a coupling of the Einstein tensor with the kinetic term and can be interpreted as adding a new term to Galileon gravity in curved spacetime. We examine the cosmological implications of the effective dark energy and classify the dynamical attractor solutions, finding a quasistable loitering phase mimicking late time acceleration by a cosmological constant.
