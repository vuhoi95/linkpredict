Title: Compatibility of symmetric quantization with general covariance in the  Dirac equation and spin connections
Authors: A. D. Alhaidari and A. Jellal
Abstract: By requiring unambiguous symmetric quantization leading to the Dirac equation in a curved space, we obtain a special representation of the spin connections in terms of the Dirac gamma matrices and their space-time derivatives. We also require that squaring the equation give the Klein-Gordon equation in a curved space in its canonical from (without spinor components coupling and with no first order derivatives). These requirements result in matrix operator algebra for the Dirac gamma matrices that involves a universal curvature constant. We obtain exact solutions of the Dirac and Klein-Gordon equations in 1+1 space-time for a given static metric.
