Title: Non-minimal kinetic coupling and Chaplygin gas cosmology
Authors: L. N. Granda and E. Torrente-Lujan and J. J. Fernandez-Melgarejo
Abstract: In the frame of the scalar field model with non minimal kinetic coupling to gravity, we study the cosmological solutions of the Chaplygin gas model of dark energy. By appropriately restricting the potential, we found the scalar field, the potential and coupling giving rise to the Chaplygin gas solution. Extensions to the generalized and modified Chaplygin gas have been made.
