Title: Lower bound on the magnetic field strength in the hot universe
Authors: E. Elizalde and V. Skalozub
Abstract: It is assumed that long range coherent magnetic fields in the universe were spontaneously generated at high temperature due to vacuum polarization of non-Abelian gauge fields, and resulted in the present intergalaxy magnetic field. The zero value of the screening mass for fields of this type was discovered recently. Here, a procedure to estimate the field strengths at different temperatures is developed and the lower bound on the magnetic field strength $B \sim 10^{14} G$, at the electroweak phase transition temperature, is derived. As a particular case, the standard model is considered. Some model dependent peculiarities of the phenomena under investigation are briefly discussed.
