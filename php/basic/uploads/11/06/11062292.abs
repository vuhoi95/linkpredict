Title: Black hole spectroscopy via adiabatic invariance
Authors: Bibhas Ranjan Majhi and Elias C. Vagenas
Abstract: During the last years, one had to combine the proposal about how quasinormal frequencies are related with black holes and the proposal about the adiabatic invariance of black holes in order to derive the quantized entropy spectrum and its minimum change for several black holes. In this letter we exclusively utilize the statement that the black hole horizon area is an adiabatic invariant and derive an equally spaced entropy spectrum of a black hole with its quantum to be equal to the one given by Bekenstein. Interestingly, in our approach no concept of quasi-normal mode is needed.
