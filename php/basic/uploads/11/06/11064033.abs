Abstract: In this paper we analyze the gravitational field of a global monopole in the context of $f(R)$ gravity. More precisely, we show that the field equations obtained are expressed in terms of $F(R)=\frac{df(R)}{dR}$. Since we are dealing with a spherically symmetric system, we assume that $F(R)$ is a function of the radial coordinate only. Moreover, adopting the weak field approximation, we can provide all components of the metric tensor. A comparison with the corresponding results obtained in General Relativity and in the Brans-Dicke theory is also made.
