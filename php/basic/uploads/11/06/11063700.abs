Title: On the Vacua of Mass-deformed Gaiotto-Tomasiello Theories
Authors: O-Kab Kwon and D. D. Tolla
Abstract: We write explicit Lagrangian and supersymmetry transformation rules using the component fields in the ${\cal N}=2,3$ GT theories. In the component field expansion, the manifestation of an additional ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry is verified in the ${\cal N}=3$ GT theory. We find maximal supersymmetry preserving mass-deformation of the GT theories and their classical supersymmetric discrete vacua. Some interesting aspects of the set of discrete vacua are discussed in comparison with the ABJM case.
