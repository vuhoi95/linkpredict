Title: D term and gaugino masses in gauge mediation
Authors: Tatsuo Azeyanagi and Tatsuo Kobayashi and Atsushi Ogasahara and Koichi Yoshioka
Abstract: We systematically study supersymmetry breaking with non-vanishing F and D terms. We classify the models into two categories and find that a certain class of models necessarily has runaway behavior of scalar potential, while the other needs the Fayet-Iliopoulos term to break supersymmetry. The latter class is useful to have a simple model of gauge mediation where the vacuum is stable everywhere and the gaugino mass is generated at the one-loop order.
