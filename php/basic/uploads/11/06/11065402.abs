Title: Finite escape fraction for ultrahigh energy collisions around Kerr naked  singularity
Authors: Mandar Patil and Pankaj S. Joshi
Abstract: We investigate here the issue of observability of high energy collisions around Kerr naked singu- larity and show that the results are in contrast with the Kerr black hole case. We had shown earlier that it would be possible to have ultrahigh energy collisions between the particles close to the loca- tion r = M around the Kerr naked singularity if the Kerr spin parameter transcends the unity by an infinitesimally small amount a $\rightarrow 1^+$. The collision is between initially ingoing particle that turns back as an outgoing particle due to angular momentum barrier, with another ingoing particle. We assume that two massless particles are produced in such a collision and their angular distribution is isotropic in the center of mass frame. We calculate the escape fraction for the massless particles to reach infinity. We show that escape fraction is finite and approximately equal to half for ultrahigh energy collisions. Therefore the particles produced in high energy collisions would escape to infinity providing signature of the nature of basic interactions at those energies. This result is in contract with the extremal Kerr black hole case where almost all particles produced in high energy collisions are absorbed by the black hole, thus rendering the collisions unobservable.
