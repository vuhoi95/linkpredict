Title: Non-extremal Kerr black holes as particle accelerators
Authors: Sijie Gao and Changchun Zhong
Abstract: It has been shown that extremal Kerr black holes can be used as particle accelerators and arbitrarily high energy may be obtained near the event horizon. We study particle collisions near the event horizon (outer horizon) and Cauchy horizon (inner horizon) of a non-extremal Kerr black hole. Firstly, we provide a general proof showing that particles cannot collide with arbitrarily high energies at the outter horizon. Secondly, we show that ultraenergetic collisions can occur near the inner horizon of a Kerr black hole with any spin parameter $a$.
