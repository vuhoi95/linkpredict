Title: Three-point Correlation Function of Giant Magnons in the Lunin-Maldacena  background
Authors: Changrim Ahn and Plamen Bozhilov
Abstract: We compute semiclassical three-point correlation function, or structure constant, of two finite-size (dyonic) giant magnon string states and a light dilaton mode in the Lunin-Maldacena background, which is the \gamma-deformed, or TsT-transformed AdS_5 x S_{\gamma}^5, dual to N = 1 super Yang-Mills theory. We also prove that an important relation between the structure constant and the conformal dimension, checked for the N = 4 super Yang-Mills case, still holds for the \gamma-deformed string background.
