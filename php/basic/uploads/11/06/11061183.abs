Title: The generalized evolution of linear bias: a tool to test gravity
Authors: S. Basilakos and M. Plionis and A. Pouri
Abstract: We derive an exact analytical solution for the redshift evolution of linear and scale-independent bias, by solving a second order differential equation based on linear perturbation theory. This bias evolution model is applicable to all different types of dark energy and modified gravity models. We propose that the combination of the current bias evolution model with data on the bias of extragalactic mass tracers could provide an efficient way to discriminate between "geometrical" dark energy models and dark energy models that adhere to general relativity.
