Title: Entanglement Efficiencies in PT-Symmetric Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Christian Zielinski and Qing-hai Wang
Abstract: The degree of entanglement is determined for an arbitrary state of a broad class of PT-symmetric bipartite composite systems. Subsequently we quantify the rate with which entangled states are generated and show that this rate can be characterized by a small set of parameters. These relations allow one in principle to improve the ability of these systems to entangle states. It is also noticed that many relations resemble corresponding ones in conventional quantum mechanics.
