Authors: A. Belavin and V. Belavin and M. Bershtein
Abstract: A recently proposed correspondence between 4-dimensional N=2 SUSY SU(k) gauge theories on R^4/Z_m and SU(k) Toda-like theories with Z_m parafermionic symmetry is used to construct four-point N=1 super Liouville conformal block, which corresponds to the particular case k=m=2. The construction is based on the conjectural relation between moduli spaces of SU(2) instantons on R^4/Z_2 and algebras like \hat{gl}(2)_2\times NSR. This conjecture is confirmed by checking the coincidence of number of fixed points on such instanton moduli space with given instanton number N and dimension of subspace degree N in the representation of such algebra.
