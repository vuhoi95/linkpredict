Title: Standard model with compactified spatial dimensions
Authors: Bartosz Fornal and Mark B. Wise
Abstract: We analyze the structure of the standard model coupled to gravity with spatial dimensions compactified on a three-torus. We find that there are no stable one-dimensional vacua at zero temperature, although there does exist an unstable vacuum for a particular set of Dirac neutrino masses.
