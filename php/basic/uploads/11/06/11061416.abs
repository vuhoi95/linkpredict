Title: Evolution of curvature and anisotropy near a nonsingular bounce
Authors: BingKan Xue and Paul J. Steinhardt
Abstract: We consider bouncing cosmologies in which an ekpyrotic contraction phase with w >> 1 is followed by a bouncing phase with w < -1 that violates the null energy condition. The bouncing phase, induced by ghost condensation, is designed to produce a classically nonsingular bounce at a finite value of the scale factor. We show that the initial curvature and anisotropy, though diluted during the ekpyrotic phase, grow back exponentially during the bouncing phase. Moreover, curvature perturbations and anisotropy are generated by quantum fluctuations during the ekpyrotic phase. In the bouncing phase, however, an adiabatic curvature perturbation grows to dominate and contributes a blue spectrum that spoils the scale-invariance. Meanwhile, a scalar shear perturbation grows nonlinear and creates an overwhelming anisotropy that disrupts the nonsingular bounce altogether.
