Title: Spacetime Geometry in Higher Spin Gravity
Authors: Martin Ammon and Michael Gutperle and Per Kraus and Eric Perlmutter
Abstract: Higher spin gravity is an interesting toy model of stringy geometry. Particularly intriguing is the presence of higher spin gauge transformations that redefine notions of invariance in gravity: the existence of event horizons and singularities in the metric become gauge dependent. In previous work, solutions of spin-3 gravity in the SL(3,R) x SL(3,R) Chern-Simons formulation were found, and were proposed to play the role of black holes. However, in the gauge employed there, the spacetime metric describes a traversable wormhole connecting two asymptotic regions, rather than a black hole. In this paper, we show explicitly that under a higher spin gauge transformation these solutions can be transformed to describe black holes with manifestly smooth event horizons, thereby changing the spacetime causal structure. A related aspect is that the Chern-Simons theory admits two distinct AdS_3 vacua with different asymptotic W-algebra symmetries and central charges. We show that these vacua are connected by an explicit, Lorentz symmetry-breaking RG flow, of which our solutions represent finite temperature generalizations. These features will be present in any SL(N,R) x SL(N,R) Chern-Simons theory of higher spins.
