Title: Scale without Conformal Invariance: An Example
Authors: Jean-François Fortin and Benjamín Grinstein and Andreas Stergiou
Abstract: We give an explicit example of a model in D=4-epsilon space-time dimensions that is scale but not conformally invariant, is unitary, and has finite correlators. The invariance is associated with a limit cycle renormalization group (RG) trajectory. We also prove, to second order in the loop expansion, in D=4-epsilon, that scale implies conformal invariance for models of any number of real scalars. For models with one real scalar and any number of Weyl spinors we show that scale implies conformal invariance to all orders in perturbation theory.
