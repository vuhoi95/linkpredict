Abstract: The aim of the present report is to study massless fermion perturbations outside five-dimensional stringy black holes with U(1) charges. The Dirac equation was numerically solved to obtain the time profiles for the evolving fermion fields, and the quasinormal frequencies at intermediate times are computed by numerical Prony fitting and semianalytical WKB expansion at sixth order. We also computed numerically the late-time power law decay factors, showing that there are in correspondence with previously reported results for the case of boson fields in higher dimensional odd space-times. The dependence of quasinormal frequencies with U(1) compactification charges are studied, and the stability of this class of higher dimensional black holes under fermion perturbations is established.
