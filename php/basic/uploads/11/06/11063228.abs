Title: Parity Violation in Graviton Non-gaussianity
Authors: Jiro Soda and Hideo Kodama and Masato Nozawa
Abstract: We study parity violation in graviton non-gaussianity generated during inflation. We develop a useful formalism to calculate graviton non-gaussianity. Using this formalism, we explicitly calculate the parity violating part of the bispectrum for primordial gravitational waves in the exact de Sitter spacetime and prove that no parity violation appears in the non-gaussianity. We also extend the analysis to slow-roll inflation and find that the parity violation of the bispectrum is proportional to the slow-roll parameter. We argue that parity violating non-gaussianity can be tested by the CMB. Our results are also useful for calculating three-point function of the stress tensor in the non-conformal field theory through the gravity/field theory correspondence.
