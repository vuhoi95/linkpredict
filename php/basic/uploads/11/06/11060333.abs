Title: Neutrino Mixing and the Frobenius Group T13
Authors: Christine Hartmann and A. Zee
Abstract: We show that the Frobenius group $T_{13} = Z_{13} \rtimes Z_3$ is a suitable family symmetry group to study neutrino oscillations. Our approach is to catalog all possibilities within an effective field theory approach, assuming only SU(2)xU(1) supplemented by family symmetry. We will use tribimaximal mixing as a guide to place a constraint on the otherwise various possibilities. This leads to an exact fit between the neutrino and charged lepton sector. Such a fit has not been achieved with any other group so far. The results of this paper may then be useful in future studies on the compatibility of this Frobenius group with other models and mechanisms.
