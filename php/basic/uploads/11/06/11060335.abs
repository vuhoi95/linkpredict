Title: Homology of Lie algebra of supersymmetries and of super Poincare Lie  algebra
Authors: M. V. Movshev and A. Schwarz and Renjun Xu
Abstract: We study the homology and cohomology groups of super Lie algebra of supersymmetries and of super Poincare Lie algebra in various dimensions. We give complete answers for (non-extended) supersymmetry in all dimensions $\leq 11$. For dimensions $D=10,11$ we describe also the cohomology of reduction of supersymmetry Lie algebra to lower dimensions. Our methods can be applied to extended supersymmetry algebra.
