Title: The Holographic Description of Baryon in Non- Critical String Theory
Authors: M. R. Pahlavani and J. Sadeghi and R. Morad
Abstract: We consider a holographic model constructed from an intersecting brane configuration $D4/D4/\bar{D4}$ in noncritical string theory. We study the baryon in the confined phase of this supergravity by considering the source term for the baryon. Also, the thermodynamics functions are studied. Moreover, we obtain the binding energy of the baryon in this holographic QCD-like model.
