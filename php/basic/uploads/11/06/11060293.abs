Title: Monopoles in the Plaquette Formulation of the 3D SU(2) Lattice Gauge  Theory
Authors: O. Borisenko and S. Voloshyn and J. Boháčik
Abstract: Using a plaquette formulation for lattice gauge models we describe monopoles of the three dimensional SU(2) theory which appear as configurations in the complete axial gauge and violate the continuum Bianchi identity. Furthemore we derive a dual formulation for the Wilson loop in arbitrary representation and calculate the form of the interaction between generated electric flux and monopoles in the region of a weak coupling relevant for the continuum limit. The effective theory which controls the interaction is of the sine-Gordon type model. The string tension is calculated within the semiclassical approximation.
