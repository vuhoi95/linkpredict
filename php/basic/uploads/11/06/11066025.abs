Title: Chaotic inflation and supersymmetry breaking
Authors: Renata Kallosh and Andrei Linde and Keith A. Olive and Tomas Rube
Abstract: We investigate the recently proposed class of chaotic inflation models in supergravity with an arbitrary inflaton potential. These models are extended to include matter fields in the visible sector and we employ a mechanism of SUSY breaking based on a particular phenomenological version of the KKLT mechanism (the KL model). We describe specific features of reheating in this class of models and show how one can solve the cosmological moduli and gravitino problems in this context.
