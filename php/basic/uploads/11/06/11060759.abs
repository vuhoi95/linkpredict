Title: Physical Vacua in IIB Compactifications with a Single Kaehler Modulus
Authors: Senarath de Alwis and Kevin Givens
Abstract: We search for phenomenologically viable vacua of IIB string flux compactifications on Calabi-Yau orientifolds with a single Kaehler modulus. We perform both analytic studies and numerical searches in order to find models with de Sitter vacua and TeV-scale SUSY particle phenomenology.
