Title: A few remarks on the zero modes of the Faddeev-Popov operator in the  Landau and maximal Abelian gauges
Authors: M. S. Guimaraes and S. P. Sorella
Abstract: The construction outlined by Henyey is employed to provide examples of normalizable zero modes of the Faddeev-Popov operator in the Landau and maximal Abelian gauges in SU(2) Euclidean Yang-Mills theories in d=3 dimensions. The corresponding gauge configurations have all finite norm ||A||^2 < \infty. In particular, in the case of the Landau gauge, the explicit construction of an infinite class of normalizable zero modes with finite norm ||A||^2 is provided.
