Title: Integrability of Green-Schwarz Sigma Models with Boundaries
Authors: Amit Dekel and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We construct integrability preserving boundary conditions for Green-Schwarz sigma-models on semi-symmetric spaces. The boundary conditions are expressed as gluing conditions of the flat-connection, using an involutive metric preserving automorphism. We show that the boundary conditions preserve half of the space-time supersymmetry and an infinite set of conserved charges. We find integrable D-brane configurations for AdS_5 x S^5 and AdS_4 x CP^3 backgrounds.
