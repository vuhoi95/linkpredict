Title: Absence of a Fermi surface in classical minimal four-dimensional gauged  supergravity
Authors: Raphael Belliard and Steven S. Gubser and Amos Yarom
Abstract: We demonstrate that the two point function of the supercurrent dual to the gravitino in the four-dimensional extremal anti-de Sitter Reissner-Nordstrom black hole does not exhibit a Fermi surface singularity. In our analysis, we utilize the ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein coordinate system, which enables us to bypass certain complications in the determination of the allowed near horizon behavior of the gravitino field at zero frequency. We check that our method agrees with previous results for the massless charged Dirac field.
