Title: Angular Eigenvalues of Higher-Dimensional Kerr-(A)dS Black Holes with  Two Rotations
Authors: H. T. Cho and A. S. Cornell and Jason Doukas and Wade Naylor
Abstract: In this paper, following the work of Chen, L\"u and Pope, we present the general metric for Kerr-(A)dS black holes with two rotations. The corresponding Klein-Gordon equation is separated explicitly, from which we develop perturbative expansions for the angular eigenvalues in powers of the rotation parameters with $D\geq 6$.
