Title: A Generalized Vertex Operator Algebra for Heisenberg Intertwiners
Authors: Michael P. Tuite and Alexander Zuevsky
Abstract: We consider the extension of the Heisenberg vertex operator algebra by all its irreducible modules. We give an elementary construction for the intertwining vertex operators and show that they satisfy a complex parametrized generalized vertex operator algebra. We illustrate some of our results with the example of integral lattice vertex operator superalgebras.
