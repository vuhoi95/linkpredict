Title: Nonplanar Integrability: Beyond the SU(2) Sector
Authors: Robert de Mello Koch and Badr Awad Elseid Mohammed and Stephanie Smith
Abstract: We compute the one loop anomalous dimensions of restricted Schur polynomials with a classical dimension \Delta\sim O(N). The operators that we consider are labeled by Young diagrams with two long columns or two long rows. Simple analytic expressions for the action of the dilatation operator are found. The projection operators needed to define the restricted Schur polynomials are constructed by translating the problem into a spin chain language, generalizing earlier results obtained in the SU(2) sector of the theory. The diagonalization of the dilatation operator reduces to solving five term recursion relations. The recursion relations can be solved exactly in terms of products of symmetric Kravchuk polynomials with Hahn polynomials. This proves that the dilatation operator reduces to a decoupled set of harmonic oscillators and therefore it is integrable, extending a similar conclusion reached for the SU(2) sector of the theory.
