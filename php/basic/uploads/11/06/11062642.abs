Title: Two-fluid dark matter models
Authors: Tiberiu Harko and Francisco S. N. Lobo
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that dark matter is a mixture of two non-interacting perfect fluids, with different four-velocities and thermodynamic parameters. The two-fluid model can be described as an effective single anisotropic fluid, with distinct radial and tangential pressures. The basic equations describing the equilibrium structure of the two-fluid dark matter model, and of the tangential velocity of test particles in stable circular orbits, are obtained for the case of a spherically symmetric static geometry. By assuming a non-relativistic kinetic model for the dark matter particles, the density profile and the tangential velocity of the dark matter mixture are obtained by numerically integrating the gravitational field equations. The cosmological implications of the model are also briefly considered, and it is shown that the anisotropic two-fluid model isotropizes in the large time limit.
