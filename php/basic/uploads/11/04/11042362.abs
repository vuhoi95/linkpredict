Title: The Dropping of In-Medium Hadron Mass in Holographic QCD
Authors: Kwanghyun Jo and Mannque Rho and Yunseok Seo and Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: We study the baryon density dependence of the vector meson spectrum using the D4/D6 system together with the compact D4 baryon vertex. We find that the vector meson mass decreases almost linearly in density at low density for small quark mass, but saturates to a finite non-zero value for large density. We also compute the density dependence of the $\eta\prime$ mass and the $\eta\prime$ velocity. We find that in medium, our model is consistent with the GMOR relation up to a few times the normal nuclear density. We compare our hQCD predictions with predictions made based on hidden local gauge theory that is constructed to model QCD.
