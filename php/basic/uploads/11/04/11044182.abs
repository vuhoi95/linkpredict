Abstract: We study the holographic QCD in the hadronic medium by using the soft wall model. We discuss the Hawking-Page transition between Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m AdS black hole and thermal charged AdS of which the geometries correspond to deconfinement and confinement phases respectively. We also present the numerical result of the vector and axial vector meson spectra depending on the quark density.
