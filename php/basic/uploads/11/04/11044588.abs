Title: Dynamical Mass Generation and Confinement in Maxwell-Chern-Simons Planar  Quantum Electrodynamics
Authors: Saúl Sánchez Madrigal and Christoph P. Hofmann and Alfredo Raya
Abstract: We study the non-perturbative phenomena of Dynamical Mass Generation and Confinement by truncating at the non-perturbative level the Schwinger-Dyson equations in Maxwell-Chern-Simons planar quantum electrodynamics. We obtain numerical solutions for the fermion propagator in Landau gauge within the so-called rainbow approximation. A comparison with the ordinary theory without the Chern-Simons term is presented.
