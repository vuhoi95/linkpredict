Title: Reconstruction of Scalar Potentials in Induced Gravity and Cosmology
Authors: Alexander Y. Kamenshchik and Alessandro Tronconi and Giovanni Venturi
Abstract: We develop a technique for the reconstruction of the potential for a scalar field in cosmological models based on induced gravity. The potentials reproducing cosmological evolutions driven by barotropic perfect fluids, a cosmological constant, a Chaplygin gas and a modified Chaplygin gas are constructed explicitly.
