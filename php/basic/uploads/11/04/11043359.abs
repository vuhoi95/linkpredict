Abstract: We offer an interpretation of super-quantum correlations in terms of a "doubly" quantum theory. We argue that string theory, viewed as a quantum theory with two deformation parameters, the string tension \alpha' and the string coupling constant g_s, is such a super-quantum theory, one that transgresses the usual quantum violations of Bell's inequalities. We also discuss the \hbar\to\infty limit of quantum mechanics in this context. As a super-quantum theory, string theory should display distinct experimentally observable super-correlations of entangled stringy states.
