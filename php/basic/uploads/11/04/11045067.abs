Title: Rarita-Schwinger Quantum Free Field Via Deformation Quantization
Authors: B. Carballo Perez and H. Garcia-Compean
Abstract: Rarita-Schwinger (RS) quantum free field is reexamined in the context of deformation quantization. It is found out that the subsidiary condition does not introduce any change either in the Wigner function or in other aspects of the deformation quantization formalism, in relation to the Dirac field case. This happens because the vector structure of the RS field imposes constraints on the space of wave function solutions and not on the operator structure. The RS propagator was also calculated within this formalism.
