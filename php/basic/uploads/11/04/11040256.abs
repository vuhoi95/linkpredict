Title: Effective Field Theory of Fractional Quantized Hall Nematics
Authors: Michael Mulligan and Chetan Nayak and Shamit Kachru
Abstract: We present a Landau-Ginzburg theory for a fractional quantized Hall nematic state and the transition to it from an isotropic fractional quantum Hall state. This justifies Lifshitz-Chern-Simons theory -- which is shown to be its dual -- on a more microscopic basis and enables us to compute a ground state wave function in the symmetry-broken phase. In such a state of matter, the Hall resistance remains quantized while the longitudinal DC resistivity due to thermally-excited quasiparticles is anisotropic. We interpret recent experiments at Landau level filling factor \nu =7/3 in terms of our theory.
