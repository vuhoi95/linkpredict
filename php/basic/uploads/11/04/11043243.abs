Title: Classical mechanics of many particles defined on canonically deformed  nonrelativistic space-time
Authors: Marcin Daszkiewicz and Cezary J. Walczyk
Abstract: We provide the classical mechanics of many particles moving in canonically twist-deformed space-time. In particular, we consider two examples of such noncommutative systems - the set of N particles moving in gravitational field as well as the system of N interacting harmonic oscillators.
