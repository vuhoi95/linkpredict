Title: The Hilbert series of U/SU SQCD and Toeplitz Determinants
Authors: Yang Chen and Noppadol Mekareeya
Abstract: We present a new technique for computing Hilbert series of N=1 supersymmetric QCD in four dimensions with unitary and special unitary gauge groups. We show that the Hilbert series of this theory can be written in terms of determinants of Toeplitz matrices. Applying related theorems from random matrix theory, we compute a number of exact Hilbert series as well as asymptotic formulae for large numbers of colours and flavours -- many of which have not been derived before.
