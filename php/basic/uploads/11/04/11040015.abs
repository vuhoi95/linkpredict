Title: The Topology and Size of the Universe from the Cosmic Microwave  Background
Authors: Grigor Aslanyan and Aneesh V. Manohar
Abstract: We study the possibility that the universe has compact topologies T^3, T^2 x R^1, or S^1 x R^2 using the seven-year WMAP data. The maximum likelihood 95% confidence intervals for the size L of the compact direction are 1.7 < L/L_0 < 2.1, 1.8 < L/L_0 < 2.0, 1.2 < L/L_0 < 2.1 for the three cases, respectively, where L_0=14.4 Gpc is the distance to the last scattering surface. An infinite universe is compatible with the data at 4.3 sigma. We find using a Bayesian analysis that the most probable universe has topology T^2 x R^1, with L/L_0=1.9.
