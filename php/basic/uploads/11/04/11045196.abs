Title: Non-abelian T-duality, Ramond Fields and Coset Geometries
Authors: Yolanda Lozano and Eoin 'O Colgain and Konstadinos Sfetsos and Daniel C. Thompson
Abstract: We extend previous work on non-abelian T-duality in the presence of Ramond fluxes to cases in which the duality group acts with isotropy such as in backgrounds containing coset spaces. In the process we generate new supergravity solutions related to D-brane configurations and to standard supergravity compactifications.
