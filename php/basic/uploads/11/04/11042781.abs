Title: The massless hexagon integral in D = 6 dimensions
Authors: Vittorio Del Duca and Claude Duhr and Vladimir A. Smirnov
Abstract: We evaluate the massless one-loop hexagon integral in six dimensions. The result is given in terms of standard polylogarithms of uniform transcendental weight three, its functional form resembling the one of the remainder function of the two-loop hexagon Wilson loop in four dimensions.
