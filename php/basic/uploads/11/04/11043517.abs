Title: Quantization of charges and fluxes in warped Stenzel geometry
Authors: Akikazu Hashimoto and Peter Ouyang
Abstract: We examine the quantization of fluxes for the warped Stiefel cone and Stenzel geometries and their orbifolds, and distinguish the roles of three related notions of charge: Page, Maxwell, and brane. The orbifolds admit discrete torsion, and we describe the associated quantum numbers which are consistent with the geometry in its large radius and small radius limits from both the type IIA and the M-theory perspectives. The discrete torsion, measured by a Page charge, is related to the number of fractional branes. We relate the shifts in the Page charges under large gauge transformations to the Hanany-Witten brane creation effect.
