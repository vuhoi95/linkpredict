Title: On the Energy Issue for a Class of Modified Higher Order Gravity Black  Hole Solutions
Authors: Guido Cognola and Olesya Gorbunova and Lorenzo Sebastiani and Sergio Zerbini
Abstract: In the case of a large class of static spherically symmetric black hole solutions in higher order modified gravity models, an expression for the associated energy is proposed and identified as a quantity proportional to the constant of integration, which appears in the explicit solution. The identification is achieved making use of derivation of the First Law of black hole physics from the equations of motion, evaluating independently the Entropy via Wald method and the Hawking temperature via the tunneling method. Several non trivial examples are discussed, including a new topological higher derivative black hole solution.
