Title: BRST analysis of topologically massive gauge theory: novel observations
Authors: R. Kumar and R. P. Malik
Abstract: A dynamical non-Abelian 2-form gauge theory (with B \wedge F term) is endowed with the "scalar" and "vector" gauge symmetry transformations. In our present endeavor, we exploit the latter gauge symmetry transformations and perform the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) analysis of the four (3 + 1)-dimensional (4D) topologically massive non-Abelian 2-form gauge theory. We demonstrate the existence of some novel features that have, hitherto, not been observed in the context of BRST approach to 4D (non-)Abelian 1-form as well as Abelian 2-form and 3-form gauge theories. We comment on the differences between the novel features that emerge in the BRST analysis of the "scalar" and "vector" gauge symmetries of the theory.
