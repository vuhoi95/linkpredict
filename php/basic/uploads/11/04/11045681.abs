Title: The Equivalence Theorem in Effective Theories
Authors: D. Chicherin and V. Gorbenko and V. Vereshagin
Abstract: The famous equivalence theorem is reexamined in order to make it applicable to the case of intrinsically quantum infinite-component effective theories. We slightly modify the formulation of this theorem and prove it basing on the notion of generating functional for Green functions. This allows one to trace (directly in terms of graphs) the mutual cancelation of different groups of contributions.
