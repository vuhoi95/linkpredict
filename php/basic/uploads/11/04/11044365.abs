Title: A chiral symmetry breaking AdS / QCD model with scalar interactions
Authors: Alfredo Vega and Ivan Schmidt
Abstract: We consider chiral symmetry breaking AdS / QCD models with cubic and quartic potentials in the scalar sector and a z dependent mass for scalars in the bulk. In these models it is possible to get good mesonic spectra using current quark masses.
