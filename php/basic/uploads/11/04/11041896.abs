Title: Correlation function of dyonic strings
Authors: Xiaojian Bai and Bum-Hoon Lee and Chanyong Park
Abstract: We investigate the two- and three-point correlation functions of the dyonic magnon and spike, which correspond to the solitonic string moving in the Poincare AdS and three-dimensional sphere. We show that the coupling between two dyonic magnons or spikes together with a marginal scalar operator in the string theory is exactly the same as one obtained by the RG analysis in the gauge theory.
