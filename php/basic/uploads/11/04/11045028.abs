Title: Superspace Parafermions
Authors: Constantin Candu and Volker Schomerus
Abstract: We describe several families of non-unitary coset conformal field theories that possess truly marginal couplings. These generalize the known examples of Wess-Zumino-Witten models on supergroups such as PSU(n|n) or OSP(2n+2|2n). Our extension includes coset space sigma models, affine Toda theories or Gross-Neveu models which are believed to arise in certain limits.
