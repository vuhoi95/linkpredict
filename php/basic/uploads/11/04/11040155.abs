Title: de Sitter Galileon
Authors: Clare Burrage and Claudia de Rham and Lavinia Heisenberg
Abstract: We generalize the Galileon symmetry and its relativistic extension to a de Sitter background. This is made possible by studying a probe-brane in a flat five-dimensional bulk using a de Sitter slicing. The generalized Lovelock invariants induced on the probe brane enjoy the induced Poincar\'e symmetry inherited from the bulk, while living on a de Sitter geometry. The non-relativistic limit of these invariants naturally maintain a generalized Galileon symmetry around de Sitter while being free of ghost-like pathologies. We comment briefly on the cosmology of these models and the extension to the AdS symmetry as well as generic FRW backgrounds.
