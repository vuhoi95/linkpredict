Title: The Boundary Conformal Field Theories of the 2D Ising critical points
Authors: Smain Balaska and Nahed Sihem Bounoua
Abstract: We present a new method to identify the Boundary Conformal Field Theories (BCFTs) describing the critical points of the Ising model on the strip. It consists in measuring the low-lying excitation energies spectra of its quantum spin chain for different boundary conditions and then to compare them with those of the different boundary conformal field theories of the $(A_2,A_3)$ minimal model.
