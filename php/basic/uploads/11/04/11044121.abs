Authors: Dumitru Astefanesei and Nabamita Banerjee and Suvankar Dutta
Abstract: We compute the physical charges and discuss the properties of a large class of five-dimensional extremal AdS black holes by using the near horizon data. Our examples include baryonic and electromagnetic black branes, as well as supersymmetric spinning black holes. In the presence of the gauge Chern-Simons term, the five-dimensional physical charges are the Page charges. We carry out the near horizon analysis and compute the four-dimensional charges of the corresponding black holes by using the entropy function formalism and show that they match the Page charges.
