Title: Stability analysis of f(R)-AdS black holes
Authors: Taeyoon Moon and Yun Soo Myung and Edwin J. Son
Abstract: We study the stability of f(R)-AdS (Schwarzschild-AdS) black hole obtained from f(R) gravity. In order to resolve the difficulty of solving fourth order linearized equations, we transform f(R) gravity into the scalar-tensor theory by introducing two auxiliary scalars. In this case, the linearized curvature scalar becomes a dynamical scalaron, showing that all linearized equations are second order. Using the positivity of gravitational potentials and S-deformed technique allows us to guarantee the stability of f(R)-AdS black hole if the scalaron mass squared satisfies the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound. This is confirmed by computing quasinormal frequencies of the scalaron for large f(R)-AdS black hole.
