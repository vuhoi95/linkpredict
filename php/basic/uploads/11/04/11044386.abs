Title: Higgs Inflation in Horava-Lifshitz Gravity
Authors: Taotao Qiu and Debaprasad Maity
Abstract: We study the possibility of standard model Higgs boson acting as an inflaton field in the framework of Horava-Lifshitz Gravity. Under this framework, we showed that it is possible for the Higgs field to produce right amount of inflation and generate scale invariant power spectrum with the correct experimental value. Thanks to the foliation preserving diffeomorphism and anisotropic space-time scaling, it essentially helps us to construct this model without the pre-existing inconsistency coming from cosmological and particle physics constraints. We do not need to introduce any non-minimal or higher derivative coupling term in an arbitrary basis either.
