Title: Hidden quartic symmetry in N=2 supersymmetry
Authors: Rutwig Campoamor-Stursberg and Michel Rausch de Traubenberg
Abstract: It is shown that for N=2 supersymmetry a hidden symmetry arises from the hybrid structure of a quartic algebra. The implications for invariant Lagrangians and multiplets are explored.
