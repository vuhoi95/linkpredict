Abstract: Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) has been formulated since a decade now in covariant gauges. In this work we derive a modified SCET Lagrangian applicable in both classes of gauges: regular and singular ones. This extends the range of applicability of SCET. The new Lagrangian must be used to obtain factorization theorems in cases where the transverse momenta of the particles in the final states are not integrated over, such as semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering, Drell-Yan and the Higgs production cross-section at low transverse momentum. By doing so all non-perturbative matrix elements appearing in the factorized cross-sections are gauge invariant.
