Title: Discrete Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Satoru Odake and Ryu Sasaki
Abstract: A comprehensive review of the discrete quantum mechanics with the pure imaginary shifts and the real shifts is presented in parallel with the corresponding results in the ordinary quantum mechanics. The main subjects to be covered are the factorised Hamiltonians, the general structure of the solution spaces of the Schroedinger equation (Crum's theorem and its modification), the shape invariance, the exact solvability in the Schroedinger picture as well as in the Heisenberg picture, the creation/annihilation operators and the dynamical symmetry algebras, the unified theory of exact and quasi-exact solvability based on the sinusoidal coordinates, the infinite families of new orthogonal (the exceptional) polynomials. Two new infinite families of orthogonal polynomials, the X_\ell Meixner-Pollaczek and the X_\ell Meixner polynomials are reported.
