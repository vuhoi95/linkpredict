Title: Remarks on l-conformal extension of the Newton-Hooke algebra
Authors: Anton Galajinsky and Ivan Masterov
Abstract: The l-conformal extension of the Newton-Hooke algebra proposed in [J. Math. Phys. 38 (1997) 3810] is formulated in the basis in which the flat space limit is unambiguous. Admissible central charges are specified. The infinite-dimensional Virasoro-Kac-Moody type extension is given.
