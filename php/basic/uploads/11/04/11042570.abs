Title: Nontrival Cosmological Constant in Brane Worlds with Unorthodox  Lagrangians
Authors: Stefan Forste and Hans Peter Nilles and Ivonne Zavala
Abstract: In self-tuning brane-world models with extra dimensions, large contributions to the cosmological constant are absorbed into the curvature of extra dimensions and consistent with flat 4d geometry. In models with conventional Lagrangians fine-tuning is needed nevertheless to ensure a finite effective Planck mass. Here, we consider a class of models with non conventional Lagrangian in which known problems can be avoided. Unfortunately these models are found to suffer from tachyonic instabilities. An attempt to cure these instabilities leads to the prediction of a positive cosmological constant, which in turn needs a fine-tuning to be consistent with observations.
