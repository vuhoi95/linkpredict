Title: Newtonian gravity and resonance on de-Sitter branes
Authors: Adriana Araujo and Rommel Guerrero and R. Omar Rodriguez
Abstract: A dS brane on the boundary between two five-dimensional spacetimes is determined. We consider asymmetric scenarios with AdS${}_5$ vacua at each side of the dS brane; and as a result, a resonant mode inside of the spectrum of the gravitational fluctuations is found. We analyze the deviations to the Newton potential generated by the gravitational excitations, finding that, for scenarios with large values of the cosmological constants, the contribution of the resonant mode is exponentially suppressed. However, when one of the vacua is null, the resonant mode belongs to the light states set of the gravitational fluctuations and five-dimensional gravity is recovered on the dS brane.
