Title: The 4d Superconformal Index from q-deformed 2d Yang-Mills
Authors: Abhijit Gadde and Leonardo Rastelli and Shlomo S. Razamat and Wenbin Yan
Abstract: We identify the 2d topological theory underlying the N=2 4d superconformal index with an explicit model: q-deformed 2d Yang-Mills. By this route we are able to evaluate the index of some strongly-coupled 4d SCFTs, such as Gaiotto's T_N theories.
