Title: Exact solutions of higher dimensional black holes
Authors: Shinya Tomizawa and Hideki Ishihara
Abstract: We review exact solutions of black holes in higher dimensions, focusing on asymptotically flat black hole solutions and Kaluza-Klein type black hole solutions. We also summarize some properties which such black hole solutions reveal.
