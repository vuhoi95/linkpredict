Title: Gravity/CFT correspondence for three dimensional Einstein gravity with a  conformal scalar field
Authors: M. Hasanpour and F. Loran and H. Razaghian
Abstract: We study the three dimensional Einstein gravity conformally coupled to a scalar field. Solutions of this theory are geometries with vanishing scalar curvature. We consider solutions with a constant scalar field which corresponds to an infinite Newton's constant. There is a class of solutions with possible curvature singularities which asymptotic symmetries are given by two copies of the Virasoro algebra. We argue that the central charge of the corresponding CFT is infinite. Furthermore, we construct a family of Schwarzschild solutions which can be conformally mapped to the Martinez-Zanelli solution of Einstein's equations with a negative cosmological constant coupled to conformal scalar field.
