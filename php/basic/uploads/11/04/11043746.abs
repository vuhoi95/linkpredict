Title: Dressed Wilson Loops on S^2
Authors: Chrysostomos Kalousios and Donovan Young
Abstract: We present a new, two-parameter family of string solutions corresponding to the holographic duals of specific 1/8-BPS Wilson loops on S^2 in N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The solutions are obtained using the dressing method on the known longitude solution in the context of the auxiliary sigma-model on S^3 put forth in arXiv:0905.0665[hep-th]. We verify that the regularized area of the worldsheets are consistent with expectations.
