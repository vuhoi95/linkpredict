Title: Hierarchies of Susy Splittings in Holographic Gauge Mediation
Authors: W. Fischler and W. Tangarife Garcia
Abstract: We generalize to string theory a construction, originally proposed in field theory, that generates a hierarchy in the splittings between members of super-multiplets in various sectors of the theory.
