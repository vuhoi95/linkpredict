Title: The Universal Real Projective Plane: LHC phenomenology at one Loop
Authors: Giacomo Cacciapaglia and Aldo Deandrea and Jeremie Llodra-Perez
Abstract: The Real Projective Plane is the lowest dimensional orbifold which, when combined with the usual Minkowski space-time, gives rise to a unique model in six flat dimensions possessing an exact Kaluza Klein (KK) parity as a relic symmetry of the broken six dimensional Lorentz group. As a consequence of this property, any model formulated on this background will include a stable Dark Matter candidate. Loop corrections play a crucial role because they remove mass degeneracy in the tiers of KK modes and induce new couplings which mediate decays. We study the full one loop structure of the corrections by means of counter-terms localised on the two singular points. As an application, the phenomenology of the (2,0) and (0,2) tiers is discussed at the LHC. We identify promising signatures with single and di-lepton, top antitop and 4 tops: in the dilepton channel, present data from CMS and ATLAS may already exclude KK masses up to 250 GeV, while by next year they may cover the whole mass range preferred by WMAP data.
