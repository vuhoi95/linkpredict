Title: D-branes with Lorentzian signature in the Nappi-Witten model
Authors: R. Hernandez and G. Horcajada and F. Ruiz Ruiz
Abstract: Lorentzian signature D-branes of all dimensions for the Nappi-Witten string are constructed. This is done by rewriting the gluing condition $J_+=FJ_-$ for the model chiral currents on the brane as a well posed first order differential problem and by solving it for Lie algebra isometries $F$ other than Lie algebra automorphisms. By construction, these D-branes are not twined conjugacy classes. Metrically degenerate D-branes are also obtained.
