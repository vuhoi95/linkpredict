Title: Extended T-systems
Authors: E. Mukhin and C. A. S. Young
Abstract: We use the theory of q-characters to establish a number of short exact sequences in the category of finite-dimensional representations of the quantum affine groups of types A and B. That allows us to introduce a set of 3-term recurrence relations which contains the celebrated T-system as a special case.
