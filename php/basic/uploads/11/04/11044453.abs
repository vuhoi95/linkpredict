Title: Holography of Charged Black Holes with $RF^2$ Corrections
Authors: Rong-Gen Cai and Da-Wei Pang
Abstract: We investigate several holographic properties of charged black holes with $RF^{2}$ corrections, which originate from Kaluza-Klein reductions of five-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We obtain the perturbative solution and discuss its thermodynamics. The DC conductivity is calculated via the effective action approach and the corrections to the DC conductivity are also evaluated. Moreover, we calculate the shear viscosity $\eta$ and thermal conductivity $\kappa_{T}$, as well as two interesting ratios $\eta/s$ and $\kappa_{T}\mu^{2}/(\eta T)$. We find that both bounds conjectured in the literatures can be violated in the presence of the higher order corrections $RF^2$.
