Title: Black hole solutions in string theory
Authors: Kei-ichi Maeda and Masato Nozawa
Abstract: Supersymmetric solutions of supergravity have been of particular importance in the advances of string theory. This article reviews the current status of black hole solutions in higher-dimensional supergravity theories. We discuss primarily the gravitational aspects of supersymmetric black holes and their relatives in various dimensions. Supersymmetric solutions and their systematic derivation are reviewed with prime examples. We also study the stationary or dynamically intersecting branes in ten and eleven-dimensions, which provide a number of interesting black objects via the dimensional reduction and duality transformations.
