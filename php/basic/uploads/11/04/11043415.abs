Title: Exponential Renormalization II: Bogoliubov's R-operation and momentum  subtraction schemes
Authors: Kurusch Ebrahimi-Fard and Frederic Patras
Abstract: This article aims at advancing the recently introduced exponential method for renormalisation in perturbative quantum field theory. It is shown that this new procedure provides a meaningful recursive scheme in the context of the algebraic and group theoretical approach to renormalisation. In particular, we describe in detail a Hopf algebraic formulation of Bogoliubov's classical R-operation and counterterm recursion in the context of momentum subtraction schemes. This approach allows us to propose an algebraic classification of different subtraction schemes. Our results shed light on the peculiar algebraic role played by the degrees of Taylor jet expansions, especially the notion of minimal subtraction and oversubtractions.
