Title: N=1 SQCD and the Transverse Field Ising Model
Authors: David Poland and David Simmons-Duffin
Abstract: We study the dimensions of non-chiral operators in the Veneziano limit of N=1 supersymmetric QCD in the conformal window. We show that when acting on gauge-invariant operators built out of scalars, the 1-loop dilatation operator is equivalent to the spin chain Hamiltonian of the 1D Ising model in a transverse magnetic field, which is a nontrivial integrable system that is exactly solvable at finite length. Solutions with periodic boundary conditions give the anomalous dimensions of flavor-singlet operators and solutions with fixed boundary conditions give the anomalous dimensions of operators whose ends contain open flavor indices.
