Title: Probing AdS Wormholes by Entanglement Entropy
Authors: Mitsutoshi Fujita and Yasuyuki Hatsuda and Tadashi Takayanagi
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Lorentzian AdS wormhole solutions constructed in arXiv:0808.2481 [hep-th]. Each of them is a classical solution interpolating between an AdS space and a flat space in type IIB supergravity. We calculate the holographic entanglement entropy to probe this geometry. Our analysis shows that there exits a mass gap in its holographic dual gauge theory and that the entanglement between the two boundaries is rather suppressed than that we naively expect for wormholes. We also examine the holographic conductivity on a probe D-brane in this spacetime.
