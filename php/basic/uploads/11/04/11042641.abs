Title: Mind the Gap: Supersymmetry Breaking in Scaling, Microstate Geometries
Authors: Orestis Vasilakis and Nicholas P. Warner
Abstract: We use a multi-species supertube solution to construct an example of a scaling microstate geometry for non-BPS black rings in five dimensions. We obtain the asymptotic charges of the microstate geometry and show how the solution is related to the corresponding non-BPS black ring. The supersymmetry is broken in a very controlled manner using holonomy and this enables a close comparison with a scaling, BPS microstate geometry. Requiring that there are no closed time-like curves near the supertubes places additional restrictions on the moduli space of physical, non-BPS solutions when compared to their BPS analogs. For large holonomy the scaling non-BPS solution always has closed time-like curves while for smaller holonomy there is a "gap" in the non-BPS moduli space relative to the BPS counterpart.
