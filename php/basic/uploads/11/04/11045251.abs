Title: Quantum Fields bounded by one dimensional crystal plates
Authors: J. M. Munoz-Castaneda and M. Bordag
Abstract: We get deeper understanding of the role played by boundary conditions in quantum field theory, by studying the structure of a scalar massless quantum field theory bounded by two one dimensional planar crystal plates. The system can also be understood as a massless scalar confined to propagate in the surface of a finite cylinder. We classify the most general type of regular behaved boundary conditions that the quantum field can satisfy, in accordance with the unitarity principle of quantum field theory. Also, we characterize the frequency spectrum for each quantum field theory, by computing the holomorphic spectral function. The spectral function is the starting point to compute the Casimir energy as a global function over the space of allowed boundary conditions for the quantum field theory.
