Title: Spontaneous Parity Violation in SUSY Strong Gauge Theory
Authors: Naoyuki Haba and Hiroshi Ohki
Abstract: We suggest simple models of spontaneous parity violation in supersymmetric strong gauge theory. We focus on left-right symmetric model and investigate vacuum with spontaneous parity violation. Non-perturbative effects are calculable in supersymmetric gauge theory, and we suggest two new models. The first model shows confinement, and the second model has a dual description of the theory. The left-right symmetry breaking and electroweak symmetry breaking are simultaneously occurred with the suitable energy scale hierarchy. The second model also induces spontaneous supersymmetry breaking.
