Authors: Yi-Zhi Huang and Jinwei Yang
Abstract: We establish an isomorphism between the space of logarithmic intertwining operators among suitable generalized modules for a vertex operator algebra and the space of homomorphisms between suitable modules for a generalization of Zhu's algebra given by Dong-Li-Mason.
