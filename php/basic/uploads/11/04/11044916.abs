Title: Space-time transformations of the Born-Infeld gauge field of a D-brane
Authors: Roberto Casalbuoni and Joaquim Gomis and Kiyoshi Kamimura
Abstract: Recently Gliozzi has shown that, under certain conditions, it is possible to derive the Dirac-Born-Infeld action for an abelian gauge field of a D-brane. Also, the action turns out to be invariant with respect to a non-linear realization of the full Poincar\'e group. A crucial role is played by the transformation properties of the gauge field under the non-linear realization. The aim of this note is to point out that these transformation properties are derived directly from the gauge fixing of the diffeomorphisms of the brane and the necessary compensating reparametrization when one performs a Lorentz transformation.
