Title: On a class of Fock-like representations for Lie Superalgebras
Authors: K. Kanakoglou and A. Herrera-Aguilar
Abstract: Utilizing Lie superalgebra (LS) realizations via the Relative Parabose Set algebra $P_{BF}$, combined with earlier results on the Fock-like representations of $P_{BF}^{(1,1)}$, we proceed to the construction of a family of Fock-like representations of LSs: these are infinite dimensional, decomposable super-representations, which are parameterized by the value of a positive integer $p$. They can be constructed for any LS $L$, either initiating from a given 2-dimensional, $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-graded representation of $L$ or using its inclusion as a subalgebra of $P_{BF}^{(1,1)}$. As an application we proceed in studying decompositions with respect to various low-dimensional Lie algebras and superalgebras.
