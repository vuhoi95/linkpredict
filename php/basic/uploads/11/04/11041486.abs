Title: Statistical mechanics of free particles on space with Lie type  noncommutativity
Authors: Ahmad Shariati and Mohammad Khorrami and Amir H Fatollahi
Abstract: Effects of Lie type noncommutativity on thermodynamic properties of a system of free identical particles are investigated. A definition for finite volume of the configuration space is given, and the grandcanonical partition function in the thermodynamic limit is calculated. Two possible definitions for the pressure are discussed, which are equivalent when the noncommutativity vanishes. The thermodynamic observables are extracted from the partition function. Different limits are discussed where either the noncommutativity or the quantum effects are important. Finally specific cases are discussed where the group is SU(2) or SO(3), and the partition function of a nondegenerate gas is calculated.
