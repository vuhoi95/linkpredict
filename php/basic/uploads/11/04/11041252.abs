Title: Mass deformation of twisted super Yang-Mills theory with fuzzy sphere  solution
Authors: Junji Kato and Yoshi Kondo and Akiko Miyake
Abstract: We investigate mass deformation of twisted superalgebra of U(N) super Yang-Mills (SYM) theories in several models and in several dimensions, motivated by the method formulated in [1]. We show that there are several ways to perform the deformation, if a model possesses four scalar supercharges except for two dimensional B-model. We also evaluate classical vacuum solutions of the potentials of scalar fields for each model. We then find that it is always possible to find fuzzy sphere solution in the theories.
