Title: Comments on absorption cross section for Chern-Simons black holes in  five dimensions
Authors: P. A. Gonz√°lez and Joel Saavedra
Abstract: In this paper we study the effects of black hole mass on the absorption cross section for a massive scalar field propagating in a 5-dimensional topological Chern-Simons black hole at the low-frequency limit. We consider the two branches of black hole solutions $(\alpha=\pm 1)$ and we show that, if the mass of black hole increase the absorption cross section decreases at the zero-frequency limit for the branch $\alpha=-1$ and for the other branch, $\alpha=1$, the behavior is opposite, if the black hole mass increase the absorption cross section increases. Also we find that beyond a certain frequency value, the mass black hole does not affect the absorption cross section.
