Title: Geometric construction of D-branes in WZW models
Authors: G. Horcajada and F. Ruiz Ruiz
Abstract: The geometric description of D-branes in WZW models is pushed forward. Our starting point is a gluing condition\, $J_{+}=FJ_-$ that matches the model's chiral currents at the worldsheet boundary through a linear map $F$ acting on the WZW Lie algebra. The equivalence of boundary and gluing conditions of this type is studied in detail. The analysis involves a thorough discussion of Frobenius integrability, shows that $F$ must be an isometry, and applies to both metrically degenerate and nondegenerate D-branes. The isometry $F$ need not be a Lie algebra automorphism nor constantly defined over the brane. This approach, when applied to isometries of the form $F=R$ with $R$ a constant Lie algebra automorphism, validates metrically degenerate $R$-twined conjugacy classes as D-branes. It also shows that no D-branes exist in semisimple WZW models for constant\, $F=-R$.
