Title: Vacuum Solution of a Linear Red-Shift Based Correction in $f(R)$ Gravity
Authors: Solmaz Asgari and Reza Saffari
Abstract: In this paper we have considered a red-shift based linear correction in derivative of action in the context of vacuum $f(R)$ gravity. Here we have found out that the linear correction may describe the late time acceleration which is appeared by SNeIa with no need of dark energy. Also we have calculated the asymptotic action for the desired correction. The value of all solutions may reduce to de' Sitter universe in the absence of correction term.
