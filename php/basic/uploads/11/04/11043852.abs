Title: Snyder Noncommutativity and Pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians from a  Jordanian Twist
Authors: P. G. Castro and R. Kullock and F. Toppan
Abstract: Nonrelativistic quantum mechanics and conformal quantum mechanics are deformed through a Jordanian twist. The deformed space coordinates satisfy the Snyder noncommutativity. The resulting deformed Hamiltonians are pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians of the type discussed by Mostafazadeh. The quantization scheme makes use of the so-called "unfolded formalism" discussed in previous works. A Hopf algebra structure, compatible with the physical interpretation of the coproduct, is introduced for the Universal Enveloping Algebra of a suitably chosen dynamical Lie algebra (the Hamiltonian is contained among its generators). The multi-particle sector, uniquely determined by the deformed 2-particle Hamiltonian, is composed of bosonic particles.
