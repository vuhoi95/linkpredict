Title: Coupling M2-branes to background fields
Authors: James P Allen and Douglas J Smith
Abstract: We discuss some of the issues arising in trying to extend the ABJM action to include couplings to background fields. This is analogous to the Myers-Chern-Simons terms of the multiple Dp-brane action. We review and extend previous results to include terms which are quadratic in the background fields. These are fixed by requiring that we recover the correct Myers-type terms upon using the novel Higgs mechanism to reduce to the multiple D2-brane action.
