Title: The origin of entropy production in spacetime thermodynamics
Authors: Wei Gu and Rong-Xin Miao and Guang Wu
Abstract: We find that the ambiguity term of approximate Killing vector field is responsible for the entropy production term. Without the ambiguity term, pure Einstein theory and $f(R)$ satisfy the relation of thermodynamic equilibrium. Considering such an ambiguity term of approximate Killing vector field, we can get the entropy production term and the entropy in $f(R)$ with a form defined by Jacobson. In pure Einstein theory, the shear term is the only geometric contribution of entropy production term, while in $f(R)$ it can also contribute. We believe our approach and conclusion can be generalized to other gravity theory.
