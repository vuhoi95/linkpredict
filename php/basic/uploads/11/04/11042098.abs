Title: Holographic mesons in D4/D6 model revisited
Authors: Kwanghyun Jo and Youngman Kim and Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: We revisit holographic mesons in the D4/D6 model to study holographic light vector mesons and the properties of heavy quarkonium in confining and deconfining phases. To treat the light mesons and heavy quarkonium on the same footing, we use the same compactification scale MKK in both systems. We observe that like scalar and pseudo-scalar mesons the vector meson mass is linearly proportional to the square root of the quark mass, when the quark mass is large. With a MKK fixed by light meson masses, we calculate the mass of heavy quarkonium in confining and deconfining phases. We also obtain the inmedium dispersion relation for heavy quarkonium, which is important to understand the dissociation and the screening mass of heavy quarkonium in quark-gluon plasma.
