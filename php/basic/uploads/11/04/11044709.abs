Abstract: We investigate the collinear and Regge behavior of the 2 -> 4 MHV amplitude in N = 4super Yang-Mills theory in the BFKL approach. The expression for the remainder function in the collinear kinematics proposed by Alday, Gaiotto, Maldacena, Sever and Vieira is analytically continued to the Mandelstam region. The result of the continuation in the Regge kinematics shows an agreement with the BFKL approach up to to five-loop level. We present the Regge theory interpretation of the obtained results and discuss some issues related to a possible non-multiplicative renormalization of the remainder function in the collinear limit.
