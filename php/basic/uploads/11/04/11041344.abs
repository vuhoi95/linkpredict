Title: The Subleading Term of the Strong Coupling Expansion of the Heavy-Quark  Potential in a $\mathcal N=4$ Super Yang-Mills Plasma
Authors: Zi-qiang Zhang and Defu Hou and Hai-cang Ren and Lei Yin
Abstract: Applying the AdS/CFT correspondence, the expansion of the heavy-quark potential of the ${\cal N}$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at large $N_c$ is carried out to the sub-leading term in the large 't Hooft coupling at nonzero temperatures. The strong coupling corresponds to the semi-classical expansion of the string-sigma model, the gravity dual of the Wilson loop operator, with the sub-leading term expressed in terms of functional determinants of fluctuations. The contributions of these determinants are evaluated numerically.
