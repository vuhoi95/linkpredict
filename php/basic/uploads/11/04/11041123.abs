Title: Universal procedure to cure future singularities of dark energy models
Authors: A. J. LÃ³pez-Revelles and E. Elizalde
Abstract: A systematic search for different viable models of the dark energy universe, all of which give rise to finite-time, future singularities, is undertaken, with the purpose to try to find a solution to this common problem. After some work, a universal procedure to cure all future singularities is developed and carefully tested with the help of explicit examples corresponding to each one of the four different types of possible singularities, as classified in the literature. The cases of a fluid with an equation of state which depends on some parameter, of modified gravity non-minimally coupled to a matter Lagrangian, of non-local gravity, and of isotropic turbulence in a dark fluid universe theory are investigated in detail.
