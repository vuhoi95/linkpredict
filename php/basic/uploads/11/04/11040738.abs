Title: Yangian symmetry in deformed WZNW models on squashed spheres
Authors: Io Kawaguchi and Domenico Orlando and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We introduce a deformation of the Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model with three-dimensional squashed sphere target space. We show how with an appropriate choice of Wess--Zumino and boundary terms it is possible to construct an infinite family of conserved charges realizing an SU(2) Yangian. Finally we discuss the running of the squashing parameter under renormalization group flow.
