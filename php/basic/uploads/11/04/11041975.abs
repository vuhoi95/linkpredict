Title: Gauge Invariant Extension of Linearized Horava Gravity
Authors: Sudipta Das and Subir Ghosh
Abstract: In the present paper we have constructed a gauge invariant extension of a generic Horava Gravity (HG) model (with quadratic curvature terms) in linearized version in a systematic procedure. No additional fields are introduced. The linearized HG model is explicitly shown to be a gauge fixed version of the Einstein Gravity (EG) thus proving the Bellorin-Restuccia conjecture in a robust way. In the process we have explicitly computed the correct Hamiltonian dynamics using Dirac Brackets appearing from the Second Class Constraints present in the HG model. We comment on applying this scheme to the full non-linear HG.
