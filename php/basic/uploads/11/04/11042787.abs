Title: The one-loop six-dimensional hexagon integral and its relation to MHV  amplitudes in N=4 SYM
Authors: Lance J. Dixon and James M. Drummond and Johannes M. Henn
Abstract: We provide an analytic formula for the (rescaled) one-loop scalar hexagon integral $\tilde\Phi_6$ with all external legs massless, in terms of classical polylogarithms. We show that this integral is closely connected to two integrals appearing in one- and two-loop amplitudes in planar $\cN=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory, $\Omega^{(1)}$ and $\Omega^{(2)}$. The derivative of $\Omega^{(2)}$ with respect to one of the conformal invariants yields $\tilde\Phi_6$, while another first-order differential operator applied to $\tilde\Phi_6$ yields $\Omega^{(1)}$. We also introduce some kinematic variables that rationalize the arguments of the polylogarithms, making it easy to verify the latter differential equation. We also give a further example of a six-dimensional integral relevant for amplitudes in $\cN=4$ super-Yang-Mills.
