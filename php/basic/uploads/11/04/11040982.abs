Title: Cosmon as the Modulon: Non-Gaussianity from Dark Energy
Authors: Chian-Shu Chen and Chia-Min Lin
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the idea of growing neutrino can result in a modulated reheating effect and produce detectable non-Gaussianity in the model where the Higgs triplet from type II seesaw mechanism plays the role of the inflaton in chaotic inflation.
