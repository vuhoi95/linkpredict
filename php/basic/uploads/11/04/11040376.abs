Authors: D. Bazeia and L. Losano and J. M. C. Malbouisson and J. R. L. Santos
Abstract: This work deals with the presence of defect structures in generalized sine-Gordon models. The models are described by periodic potentials, with substructure having one, two, three or more distinct topological sectors, with multiplicity one, two, three or more, respectively. The investigation takes advantage of the deformation procedure introduced in previous work, which is used to introduce the new models, and to study all the defect structures they may comprise.
