Title: Angular 21 cm Power Spectrum of a Scaling Distribution of Cosmic String  Wakes
Authors: Oscar F. Hernandez and Yi Wang and Robert Brandenberger and Jose Fong
Abstract: Cosmic string wakes lead to a large signal in 21 cm redshift maps at redshifts larger than that corresponding to reionization. Here, we compute the angular power spectrum of 21 cm radiation as predicted by a scaling distribution of cosmic strings whose wakes have undergone shock heating.
