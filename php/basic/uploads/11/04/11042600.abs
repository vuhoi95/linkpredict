Title: The Spectrum of Goldstini and Modulini
Authors: Clifford Cheung and Francesco D'Eramo and Jesse Thaler
Abstract: When supersymmetry is broken in multiple sectors via independent dynamics, the theory furnishes a corresponding multiplicity of "goldstini" degrees of freedom which may play a substantial role in collider phenomenology and cosmology. In this paper, we explore the tree-level mass spectrum of goldstini arising from a general admixture of F-term, D-term, and almost no-scale supersymmetry breaking, employing non-linear superfields and a novel gauge fixing for supergravity discussed in a companion paper. In theories of F-term and D-term breaking, goldstini acquire a mass which is precisely twice the gravitino mass, while the inclusion of no-scale breaking renders one of these modes, the modulino, massless. We argue that the vanishing modulino mass can be explained in terms of an accidental and spontaneously broken "global" supersymmetry.
