Title: Magnetic Monopoles in Noncommutative Space-Time: Second Order of  Perturbation
Authors: Miklos LÃ¥ngvik and Tapio Salminen
Abstract: We investigate the validity of the Dirac Quantization Condition (DQC) for magnetic monopoles in noncommutative space-time using an extension of the method used by Wu and Yang. We continue the work started in [1] where it was shown that the DQC can be kept unmodified in the first order of the perturbative expansion in the noncommutativity parameter \theta. Here we include second order corrections and find that, in order to find solutions to the noncommutative Maxwell's equations described by the $U_\star(1)$ group, the DQC needs to be modified by perturbative corrections that introduce a dependence on space-time points. Thus the DQC fails to be a topological property of noncommutative space-time. We comment on the possible origin of this difference.
