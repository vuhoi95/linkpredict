Title: IIB black hole horizons with five-form flux and extended supersymmetry
Authors: U. Gran and J. Gutowski and G. Papadopoulos
Abstract: We classify under some assumptions the IIB black hole horizons with 5-form flux preserving more than 2 supersymmetries. We find that the spatial horizon sections with non-vanishing flux preserving 4 supersymmetries are locally isometric either to S^1 * S^3 * T^4 or to S^1 * S^3 * K_3 and the associated near horizon geometries are locally isometric to AdS_3 * S^3 * T^4 and AdS_3 * S^3 * K_3$, respectively. The near horizon geometries preserving more than 4 supersymmetries are locally isometric to R^{1,1} * T^8.
