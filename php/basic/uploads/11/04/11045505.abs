Title: Evidence for Asymptotic Safety from Lattice Quantum Gravity
Authors: J. Laiho and D. Coumbe
Abstract: We calculate the spectral dimension for nonperturbative quantum gravity defined via Euclidean dynamical triangulations. We find that it runs from a value of ~3/2 at short distance to ~4 at large distance scales, similar to results from causal dynamical triangulations. We argue that the short distance value of 3/2 for the spectral dimension may resolve the tension between asymptotic safety and the holographic principle.
