Title: A non Abelian effective model for ensembles of magnetic defects in  QCD(3)
Authors: C. D. Fosco and L. E. Oxman
Abstract: We construct a non Abelian model for SU(2) QCD in Euclidean three-dimensional spacetime and study its different phases. The model contains a center vortex sector coupled to a dual effective field encoding information about how the vortices are paired in the ensemble. The possible phases in parameter space are interpreted in terms of the proliferation of either closed center vortices or closed chains, where the endpoints of open vortices are attached in pairs to monopole-like defects.
