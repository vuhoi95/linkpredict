Abstract: We show that the f(T) gravitational paradigm, in which gravity is described by an arbitrary function of the torsion scalar, can provide a mechanism for realizing bouncing cosmologies, thereby avoiding the Big Bang singularity. After constructing the simplest version of an f(T) matter bounce, we investigate the scalar and tensor modes of cosmological perturbations. Our results show that metric perturbations in the scalar sector lead to a background-dependent sound speed, which is a distinguishable feature from Einstein gravity. Additionally, we obtain a scale-invariant primordial power spectrum, which is consistent with cosmological observations, but suffers from the problem of a large tensor-to-scalar ratio. However, this can be avoided by introducing extra fields, such as a matter bounce curvaton.
