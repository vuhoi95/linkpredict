Authors: Yong-Qiang Wang and Yu-Xiao Liu and Zhen-Hua Zhao
Abstract: In arXiv:1101.3326[hep-th], a (2+1)-dimensional holographic Josephson junction was constructed, and it was shown that the DC Josephson current is proportional to the sine of the phase difference across the junction. In this paper, we extend this study to a holographic description for the (3+1)-dimensional holographic DC Josephson junction. By solving numerically the coupled differential equations, we also obtain the familiar characteristics of Josephson junctions.
