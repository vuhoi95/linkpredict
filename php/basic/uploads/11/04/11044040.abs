Title: A Non-Abelian Self-Dual Gauge Theory in 5+1 Dimensions
Authors: Pei-Ming Ho and Kuo-Wei Huang and Yutaka Matsuo
Abstract: We construct a non-Abelian gauge theory of chiral 2-forms (self-dual gauge fields) in 6 dimensions with a spatial direction compactified on a circle of radius R. It has the following two properties. (1) It reduces to the Yang-Mills theory in 5 dimensions for small R. (2) It is equivalent to the Lorentz-invariant theory of Abelian chiral 2-forms when the gauge group is Abelian. Previous no-go theorems prohibiting non-Abelian deformations of the chiral 2-form gauge theory are circumvented by introducing nonlocality along the compactified dimension.
