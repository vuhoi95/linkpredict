Abstract: We use AdS/QCD duality to compute the finite temperature Green's function G(omega,k;T) of the shear operator T_12 for all omega,k in hot Yang-Mills theory. The goal is to assess how the existence of scales like the transition temperature and glueball masses affects the correlator computed in the scalefree conformal N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We observe sizeable effects for T close to T_c which rapidly disappear with increasing T. Quantitative agreement of these predictions with future lattice Monte Carlo data would suggest that QCD matter in this temperature range is strongly interacting.
