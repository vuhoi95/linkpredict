Title: Supergravity Computations without Gravity Complications
Authors: Clifford Cheung and Francesco D'Eramo and Jesse Thaler
Abstract: The conformal compensator formalism is a convenient and versatile representation of supergravity (SUGRA) obtained by gauge fixing conformal SUGRA. Unfortunately, practical calculations often require cumbersome manipulations of component field terms involving the full gravity multiplet. In this paper, we derive an alternative gauge fixing for conformal SUGRA which decouples these gravity complications from SUGRA computations. This yields a simplified tree-level action for the matter fields in SUGRA which can be expressed compactly in terms of superfields and a modified conformal compensator. Phenomenologically relevant quantities such as the scalar potential and fermion mass matrix are then straightforwardly obtained by expanding the action in superspace.
