Title: Perturbative Hamiltonian constraints for higher order theories
Authors: S. A. Martinez and R. Montemayor and L. F. Urrutia
Abstract: We present a method for constructing a consistent low energy canonical formalism for higher order time-derivative theories, extending the Dirac method to include perturbative Hamiltonian constraints. We apply it to two paradigmatic examples: the Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator and the Bernard-Duncan scalar field. We also compare the results, both at the classical and quantum level, with the ones corresponding to a direct perturbative construction applied to the exact higher order theory. This comparison highligths the soundness of the present formalism.
