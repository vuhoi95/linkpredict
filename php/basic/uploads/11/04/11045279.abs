Title: Generalized Framework for Auxiliary Extra Dimensions
Authors: Lasha Berezhiani and Mehrdad Mirbabayi
Abstract: The theory of gravity with an auxiliary extra dimension is known to give the ghost-free cubic completion of the Fierz-Pauli mass term in the decoupling limit. Our work generalizes the boundary condition in the auxiliary dimension that avoids ghosts order-by-order, and to all orders, in the decoupling limit. Furthermore, we extend the formalism to the case of many auxiliary dimensions, and we show that the multi-dimensional extension with the rotationally invariant boundaries of the bulk, is equivalent to the model with a single auxiliary dimension. The above constructions require the appropriate adjustment of the boundary condition, which we discuss in detail. The other possible extension of the original model by the Gauss-Bonnet term is studied as well.
