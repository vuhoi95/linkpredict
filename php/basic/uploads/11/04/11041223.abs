Title: Comment on: Detecting Vanishing Dimensions Via Primordial Gravitational  Wave Astronomy
Authors: Thomas P. Sotiriou and Matt Visser and Silke Weinfurtner
Abstract: It has been recently claimed [arXiv:1102.3434] that quantum gravity models where the number of dimensions reduces at the ultraviolet exhibit a potentially observable cutoff in the primordial gravitational wave spectrum, and that this is a "generic" and "robust" test for such models, since "(2+1)-dimensional spacetimes have no gravitational degrees of freedom". We argue that such a claim is misleading.
