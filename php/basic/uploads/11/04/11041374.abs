Title: Quantization of Maxwell's equations on curved backgrounds and general  local covariance
Authors: Claudio Dappiaggi and Benjamin Lang
Abstract: We develop a quantization scheme for Maxwell's equations without source on an arbitrary four dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetime. The field strength tensor is the key dynamical object and it is not assumed a priori that it descends from a vector potential. It is shown that, in general, the associated field algebra can contain a non trivial centre and, on account of this, such a theory cannot be described within the framework of general local covariance unless further restrictive assumptions on the topology of the spacetime are made.
