Title: On Supersymmetric Effective Theories of Axion
Authors: Tetsutaro Higaki and Ryuichiro Kitano
Abstract: We study effective theories of an axion in spontaneously broken supersymmetric theories. We consider a system where the axion supermultiplet is directly coupled to a supersymmetry breaking sector whereas the standard model sector is communicated with those sectors through loops of messenger fields. The gaugino masses and the axion-gluon coupling necessary for solving the strong CP problem are both obtained by the same effective interaction. We discuss cosmological constraints on this framework.
