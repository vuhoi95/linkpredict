Title: Noncommutative Geometry Inspired Entropic Inflation
Authors: Kourosh Nozari and Siamak Akhshabi
Abstract: Recently Verlinde proposed that gravity can be described as an emergent phenomena arising from changes in the information associated with the positions of material bodies. By using noncommutative geometry as a way to describe the microscopic, microstructure of quantum spacetime, we derive modified Friedmann equation in this setup and study the entropic force modifications to the inflationary dynamics of early universe.
