Title: A Note on CFT Correlators in Three Dimensions
Authors: Simone Giombi and Shiroman Prakash and Xi Yin
Abstract: In this note we present a simple method of constructing general conformally invariant three point functions of operators of various spins in three dimensions. Upon further imposing current conservation conditions, we find new parity violating structures for the three point functions involving either the stress-energy tensor, spin one currents, or higher spin currents. We find that all parity preserving structures for conformally invariant three point functions of higher spin conserved currents can be realized by free fields, whereas there is at most one parity violating structure for three point functions for each set of spins, which is not realized by free fields.
