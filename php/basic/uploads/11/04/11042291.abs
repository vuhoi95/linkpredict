Title: A non-homogeneous ground state of the low-temperature Sakai-Sugimoto  model
Authors: C. A. Ballon Bayona and Kasper Peeters and Marija Zamaklar
Abstract: We study the instability of the low-temperature QCD vacuum at large-N_c due to an axial chemical potential, using the holographic Sakai-Sugimoto model. We explicitly construct the ground state of the theory, which corresponds to a translationally non-invariant configuration.
