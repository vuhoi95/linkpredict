Title: Conformal Galilei groups, Veronese curves, and Newton-Hooke spacetimes
Authors: Christian Duval and Peter Horvathy
Abstract: Finite-dimensional nonrelativistic conformal Lie algebras spanned by polynomial vector fields of Galilei spacetime arise if the dynamical exponent is z=2/N with N=1,2,.... Their underlying group structure and matrix representation are constructed (up to a covering) by means of the Veronese map of degree N. Suitable quotients of the conformal Galilei groups provide us with Newton-Hooke nonrelativistic spacetimes with a quantized reduced negative cosmological constant \lambda=-N.
