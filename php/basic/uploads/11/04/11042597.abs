Title: Scattering States in AdS/CFT
Authors: A. Liam Fitzpatrick and Jared Kaplan
Abstract: We show that suitably regulated multi-trace primary states in large N CFTs behave like `in' and `out' scattering states in the flat-space limit of AdS. Their transition matrix elements approach the exact scattering amplitudes for the bulk theory, providing a natural CFT definition of the flat space S-Matrix. We study corrections resulting from the AdS curvature and particle propagation far from the center of AdS, and show that AdS simply provides an IR regulator that disappears in the flat space limit.
