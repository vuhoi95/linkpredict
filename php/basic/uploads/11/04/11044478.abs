Title: Superfluid black branes in AdS_4\times S^7
Authors: Aristomenis Donos and Jerome P. Gauntlett
Abstract: We consider the d=3 N=8 SCFT dual to AdS_4\times S^7 when held at finite temperature and chemical potential with respect to a diagonal U(1)_R\subset SO(8) global symmetry and construct black brane solutions of D=11 supergravity that are associated with the superfluid instability with the highest known critical temperature. We construct a rich array of solutions using different sub-truncations of SO(8) gauged supergravity finding results that strongly depend on the truncation used. Our constructions include black brane solutions associated with the Gubser-Mitra instability which preserve the U(1)_R symmetry, and these, in turn, can have further superfluid instabilities. In addition, we also construct superfluid black branes that at zero temperature are domain walls that interpolate between the SO(8) AdS_4 vacuum in the UV, in an alternative quantisation, and the supersymmetric SU(3)\times U(1) AdS_4 vacuum in the IR.
