Title: Mass Hierarchies in Lorentz-Violation-induced Dynamical Mass Models
Authors: Jean Alexandre and Nick E. Mavromatos
Abstract: We discuss the issue of fermion mass hierarchies between lepton and quark families in toy models of dynamical generation of fermion masses through minimal Lorentz Invariance Violation. Realistic hierarchies in chiral theories necessitate an extended gauge structure, which includes both vector and axial-vector interactions.
