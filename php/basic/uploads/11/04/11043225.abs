Title: Collision of two general geodesic particles around a Kerr-Newman black  hole
Authors: Changqing Liu and Songbai Chen and Jiliang Jing
Abstract: We study collision of two general geodesic particles around the Kerr-Newman (KN) black hole and get the center-of-mass (CM) energy of the non-marginally and marginally bound critical particles in the direct collision and LSO collision scenarios. We find the constraint conditions that arbitrarily high CM energy can be obtained for the near-horizon collision of two general geodesic particles in the extremal KN black hole, and note that the charge decreases the value of the latitude in which arbitrarily high CM energy can occurs. We also interpret why the high-velocity collision belt centers to the equator with the increase of the charge.
