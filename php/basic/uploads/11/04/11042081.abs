Title: gamma^* gamma^* -> pi^0 Form Factor from AdS/QCD
Authors: Alexander Stoffers and Ismail Zahed
Abstract: The recently measured $\gamma\gamma^*\rightarrow \pi^0$ anomalous form factor is analyzed using the $D4/D8\bar{D8}$ holographic approach to QCD. The half-on-shell transition form factor is vector meson dominated and is shown to exactly tie to the pion form factor. The holographic result compares well with the data for the lowest vector resonance.
