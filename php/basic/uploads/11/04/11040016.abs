Title: A Black Ring with two Angular Momenta in Taub-NUT
Authors: Iosif Bena and Stefano Giusto and Clement Ruef
Abstract: We use the recently-constructed explicit duality transformation that relates a rotating anti-D6-D4-D2-D0 black hole solution to a rotating M5-M2-P black string to construct a non-supersymmetric black ring in Taub-NUT that has two angular momenta, as well as M2 charges and M5 dipole moments. This is the first black ring solution that has both dipole charges and rotation along the S^2 of the horizon, and hence can be thought of as the "Pomeransky-Senkov" version of the M5-M2 black ring in Taub-NUT. Its physics should provide a testing ground for the applicability of the blackfold approach to charged rotating black branes, and should elucidate the phase space of charged dipole rings in various backgrounds.
