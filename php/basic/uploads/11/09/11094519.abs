Abstract: In the context of f(R) modified gravity theories, we study the Kerr-Newman black-hole solutions. We study non-zero constant scalar curvature solutions and discuss the metric tensor that satisfies the modified field equations. We determine that, in absence of a cosmological constant, the black holes existence is determined by the sign of a parameter dependent of the mass, the charge, the spin and the scalar curvature. We obtain that for negative values of the curvature, the extremal black hole is no longer given by a spin parameter a_max = M (as is the case in General Relativity), but by a_max < M, and that for positive values of the curvature there are two kinds of extremal black holes: the usual one, that occurs for a_max > M, and the extreme marginal one, where the exterior (but not interior) black hole's horizon vanishes provided that a < a_min. Thermodynamics for this kind of black holes is then studied, as well as their local and global stability. Finally we study different f(R) models and see how these properties manifest for their parameters phase space.
