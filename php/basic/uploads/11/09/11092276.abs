Title: D-term Dynamical Supersymmetry Breaking Generating Split N=2 Gaugino  Masses of Mixed Majorana-Dirac Type
Authors: H. Itoyama and Nobuhito Maru
Abstract: Under a few mild assumptions, N=1 supersymmetry in four dimensions is shown to be spontaneously broken in a self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation of BCS/NJL type to one-loop off-shell, in the gauge theory specified by the gauge kinetic function and the superpotential of adjoint chiral superfields, in particular, that possesses N=2 extended supersymmetry spontaneously broken to N=1 at tree level. The N=2 gauginos receive mixed Majorana-Dirac masses and are split. We derive an explicit form of the gap equation, showing the existence of a nontrivial solution.
