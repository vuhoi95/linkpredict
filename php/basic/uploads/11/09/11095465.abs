Title: Annulus amplitude of FZZT branes revisited
Authors: Jae-Hyuk Oh and Jaemo Park and Chaiho Rim
Abstract: We revisit the annulus amplitude of FZZT branes with general matter sectors (r,s) using the recent development of matrix model and minimal Liouville gravity. Following the boundary description of the 1-matrix model and bulk resonance transformation between primary operators we find the consistency of the brane decomposition into (1,1)-branes. We also investigate the corresponding results obtained directly from the minimal Liouville gravity and demonstrate the perfect agreement with the matrix results.
