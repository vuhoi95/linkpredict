Title: Phase structure of fuzzy black holes
Authors: S. Digal and T. R. Govindarajan and Kumar S. Gupta and X. Martin
Abstract: Noncommutative deformations of the BTZ blackholes are described by noncommutative cylinders. We study the scalar fields in this background. The spectrum is studied analytically and through numerical simulations we establish the existence of novel `stripe phases'. These are different from stripes on Moyal spaces and stable due to topological obstruction.
