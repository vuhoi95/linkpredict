Title: Short Distance Freedom of Quantum Gravity
Authors: Gaurav Narain and Ramesh Anishetty
Abstract: Fourth order derivative gravity in 3+1-dimensions is perturbatively renormalizable and is shown to describe a unitary theory of gravitons in a limited coupling parameter space. The running gravitational constant which includes graviton contribution is computed. Generically, gravitational Newton's constant vanishes at short distances in this perturbatively renormalizable and unitary theory.
