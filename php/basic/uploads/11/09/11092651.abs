Title: Hall Viscosity and Electromagnetic Response
Authors: Carlos Hoyos and Dam Thanh Son
Abstract: We show that, for Galilean invariant quantum Hall states, the Hall viscosity appears in the electromagnetic response at finite wave numbers q. In particular, the leading q dependence of the Hall conductivity at small q receives a contribution from the Hall viscosity. The coefficient of the q^2 term in the Hall conductivity is universal in the limit of strong magnetic field.
