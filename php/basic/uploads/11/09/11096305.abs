Title: Deeper Look into Short Strings
Authors: Nikolay Gromov and Saulius Valatka
Abstract: Using a recent conjecture of Basso we compute three leading nontrivial coefficients in the strong coupling expansion of the anomalous dimensions of short operators in the sl2 sector of AdS/CFT. We show that our results are consistent with the numerical results obtained using the Y-system and TBA approach earlier thus providing further support to the Y-system conjecture.
