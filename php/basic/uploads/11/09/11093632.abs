Title: On chiral quantum superspaces
Authors: D. Cervantes and R. Fioresi and M. A. Lledo
Abstract: We give a quantum deformation of the chiral Minkowski superspace in 4 dimensions embedded as the big cell into the chiral conformal superspace. Both deformations are realized as quantum homogeneous superspaces: we deform the ring of regular functions together with a coaction of the corresponding quantum supergroup.
