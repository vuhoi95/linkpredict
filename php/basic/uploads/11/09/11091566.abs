Abstract: All near horizon geometries of supersymmetric black holes in a N=2, D=5 higher-derivative supergravity theory are classified. Depending on the choice of near-horizon data we find that either there are no regular horizons, or horizons exist and the spatial cross-sections of the event horizons are conformal to a squashed or round S^3, S^1 * S^2, or T^3. If the conformal factor is constant then the solutions are maximally supersymmetric. If the conformal factor is not constant, we find that it satisfies a non-linear vortex equation, and the horizon may admit scalar hair.
