Title: On the Thermodynamics of 5D Black Holes on ALF Gravitational Instantons
Authors: Petya Nedkova and Stoytcho S. Yazadjiev
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamical properties of solutions to the 5D Einstein and Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton equations describing static black holes on ALF gravitational instantons. Some general expressions regarding the nut charge and potential are derived, as well as Smarr-like relations. The thermodynamics of two particular solutions representing a static black hole on Taub-Nut and Taub-Bolt instantons are examined in detail. Two dierent approaches for computation of the mass and the tension - the Komar and counterterm method, are applied and compared. A new charged black hole on Taub-Bolt instanton is constructed and investigated.
