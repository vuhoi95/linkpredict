Title: General Solution for the Static, Spherical and Asymptotically Flat  Braneworld
Authors: Keiichi Akama and Takashi Hattori and Hisamitsu Mukaida
Abstract: The general solution for the static, spherical and asymptotically flat braneworld is derived by solving the bulk Einstein equation and braneworld dynamics. We show that it involves a large arbitrariness, which reduces the predictability of the theory. Ways out of the difficulty are discussed.
