Title: Stability of Schwarzschild black hole in f(R) gravity with the dynamical  Chern-Simons term
Authors: Taeyoon Moon and Yun Soo Myung
Abstract: We perform the stability analysis of the Schwarzschild black hole in $f(R)$ gravity with the parity-violating Chern-Simons (CS) term coupled to a dynamical scalar field $\theta$. For this purpose, we transform the $f(R)$ gravity into the scalar-tensor theory by introducing a scalaron $\phi$, providing the dynamical Chern-Simons modified gravity with two scalars. The perturbation equation for the scalar $\theta$ is coupled to the odd-parity metric perturbation equation, providing a system of two coupled second order equations, while the scalaron is coupled to the even-parity perturbation equation. This implies that the CS coupling affects the Regge-Wheeler equation, while $f(R)$ gravity does not affect the Zerilli equation. It turns out that the Schwarzschild black hole is stable against the external perturbations if the scalaron is free from the tachyon.
