Title: SUSY Enhancements in (0,4) Deformations of AdS_3/CFT_2

Abstract: We discuss a marginal deformation of the SL(2,R) x SU(2) x U(1)^4 WZW model, which describes string theory on AdS_3 x S^3 x T^4, that corresponds to warping the S^3 factor. This deformation breaks part of the N=(4,4) supersymmetry of the undeformed dual CFT to N=(0,4) supersymmetry. In the spirit of work by Giveon, Kutasov, and Seiberg, we construct the asymptotic spacetime symmetry algebra from worldsheet operators and find a restoration of (4,4) supersymmetry at discrete values of the deformation parameter. We explain this result from various perspectives: the worldsheet, supergravity, and from the singular D1-D5 CFT. The supergravity analysis includes an asymptotic symmetry computation of the level of the affine SU(2) R-symmetry, which arises purely from B-field contributions.
