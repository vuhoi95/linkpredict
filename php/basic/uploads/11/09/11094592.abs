Title: Analytic Approaches to anisotropic Holographic Superfluids
Authors: Pallab Basu and Jae-Hyuk Oh
Abstract: We construct an analytic solution of the Einstein-SU(2)-Yang-Mills system as the holographic dual of an anisotropic superfluid near its critical point, up to leading corrections in both the inverse Yang-Mills coupling and a symmetry breaking order parameter. We have also calculated the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density in this background, and shown that the universality of this ratio is lost in the broken symmetry direction. The ratio displays a scaling behavior near the critical point with critical exponent $\beta=1$, at the leading order in the double expansion.
