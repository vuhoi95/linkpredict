Title: Gravitational Instantons and Fluxes from M/F-theory on Calabi-Yau  fourfolds
Authors: Thomas W. Grimm and Raffaele Savelli
Abstract: We compactify four-dimensional N=1 gauged supergravity theories on a circle including fluxes for shift-symmetric scalars. Four-dimensional Taub-NUT gravitational instantons universally correct the three-dimensional superpotential in the absence of fluxes. In the presence of fluxes these Taub-NUT instanton contributions are no longer gauge-invariant. Invariance can be restored by gauge instantons on top of Taub-NUT instantons. We establish the embedding of this scenario into M-theory. Circle fluxes and gaugings arise from a restricted class of M-theory four-form fluxes on a resolved Calabi-Yau fourfold. The M5-brane on the base of the elliptic fourfold dualizes into the universal Taub-NUT instanton. In the presence of fluxes this M5-brane is anomalous. We argue that anomaly free contributions arise from involved M5-brane geometries dual to gauge-instantons on top of Taub-NUT instantons. Adding a four-dimensional superpotential to the gravitational instanton corrections leads to three-dimensional Anti-de Sitter vacua at stabilized compactification radius. We comment on the possibility to uplift these M-theory vacua, and to tunnel to four-dimensional F-theory vacua.
