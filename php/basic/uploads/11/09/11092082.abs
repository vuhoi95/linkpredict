Title: A new approach to cosmological perturbations in f(R) models
Authors: Daniele Bertacca and Nicola Bartolo and Sabino Matarrese
Abstract: We propose an analytic procedure that allows to determine quantitatively the deviation in the behavior of cosmological perturbations between a given f(R) modified gravity model and a LCDM reference model. Our method allows to study structure formation in these models from the largest scales, of the order of the Hubble horizon, down to scales deeply inside the Hubble radius, without employing the so-called "quasi-static" approximation. Although we restrict our analysis here to linear perturbations, our technique is completely general and can be extended to any perturbative order.
