Title: Minkowski vacua can be metastable
Authors: Jaume Garriga and Benjamin Shlaer and Alexander Vilenkin
Abstract: We investigate the recent suggestion that a Minkowski vacuum is either absolutely stable, or it has a divergent decay rate and thus fails to have a locally Minkowski description. The divergence comes from boost integration over momenta of the vacuum bubbles. We point out that a prototypical example of false-vacuum decay is pair production in a uniform electric field, so if the argument leading to the divergence is correct, it should apply to this case as well. We provide evidence that no catastrophic vacuum instability occurs in a constant electric field, indicating that the argument cannot be right. Instead, we argue that the boost integration that leads to the divergence is unnecessary: when all possible fluctuations of the vacuum bubble are included, the quantum state of the bubble is invariant under Lorentz boosts.
