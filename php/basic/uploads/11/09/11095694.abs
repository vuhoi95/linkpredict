Title: Localization of gauge fields and Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory
Authors: Daniel Flassig and Alexander Pritzel
Abstract: We propose an explicit model, where an axionic domain wall dynamically localizes a U(1)-component of a nonabelian gauge theory living in a 3+1 dimensional bulk. The effective theory on the wall is 2+1d Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory with a compact U(1) gauge group. This setup allows us to understand all key properties of MCS theory in terms of the dynamics of the underlying 3+1 dimensional gauge theory. Our findings can also shed some light on branes in supersymmetric gluodynamics.
