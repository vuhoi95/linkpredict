Title: Vector Models in the Singlet Sector at Finite Temperature
Authors: Stephen H. Shenker and Xi Yin
Abstract: We study the thermal properties of the O(N) vector-like scalar theory in the singlet sector in 2+1 dimensions. This theory is conjectured to be the AdS/CFT dual of Vasiliev higher spin gravity. We find that a large N transition occurs but only at a very high temperature of order \sqrt{N}. This corresponds to the bulk Planck energy. The transition signals a decrease in the number of degrees of freedom from that expected in the simple higher spin gas, due to relations among the O(N) bilinear invariants.
