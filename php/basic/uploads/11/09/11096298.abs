Title: Supersonic Velocities in Noncommutative Acoustic Black Holes
Authors: M. A. Anacleto and F. A. Brito and E. Passos
Abstract: In this paper we derive Schwarzschild and Kerr - like noncommutative acoustic black hole metrics in the (3+1)-dimensional noncommutative Abelian Higgs model. We have found that the changing in the Hawking temperature T_H due to spacetime noncommutativity account for supersonic velocities and analogously may also account for superluminal particles in the general form (v-c)/c=\Delta T_H/8T_H. Assuming this form is also valid for gravitational black holes and particle physics, we have found that for \Delta T_H about the heaviest muon neutrino mass and T_H about proton mass gives 2.12\times 10-5 which agrees with the recent OPERA experiments. We also consider the Hawking temperature in terms of surface gravity to address the issue of background influence in the neutrino superluminality to show that our investigations also agree with supernova SN1987A measurements.
