Title: Thermodynamics of soft wall AdS/QCD at finite chemical potential
Authors: Shobhit Sachan and Sanjay Siwach
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of soft wall model in AdS/QCD framework. The low temperature phase of QCD is described by thermal AdS and high temperature phase by AdS Black hole solution of five dimensional gravity with negative cosmological constant. The chemical potential is introduced via the solution of U(1) vector field in the bulk. The difference of action densities in two phases is studied and the results are compared with hard wall model. The quark number susceptibility is also calculated in both the models.
