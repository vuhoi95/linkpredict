Title: The Bound State S-matrix of the Deformed Hubbard Chain
Authors: Marius de Leeuw and Takuya Matsumoto and Vidas Regelskis
Abstract: In this work we use the q-oscillator formalism to construct the atypical (short) supersymmetric representations of the centrally extended Uq (su(2|2)) algebra. We then determine the S-matrix describing the scattering of arbitrary bound states. The crucial ingredient in this derivation is the affine extension of the aforementioned algebra.
