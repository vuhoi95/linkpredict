Title: On a new type of orbifold equivalence and M-theoretic AdS4/CFT3 duality
Authors: Masanori Hanada and Carlos Hoyos and Hidehiko Shimada
Abstract: We consider the large-N limit of \mathcal{N}=6 U(N) \times U(N) superconformal Chern-Simons (ABJM) theory with fixed level k, which is conjectured to be dual to M-theory on AdS4\times (S^7/Z_k) background. We point out that the so-called orbifold equivalence on the gravity side, combined with the AdS4/CFT3 duality, predicts a hitherto unknown type of duality on the gauge theory side. It establishes the equivalence between a class of observables, which are not necessarily protected by supersymmetry, in strongly coupled ABJM theories away from the planar approximation, with different values of k and N but sharing common kN. This limit is vastly different from the planar limit, and hence from the gauge theory point of view the duality is more difficult to explain compared to the previously known analogous equivalence between planar gauge theories, where one can explicitly prove the equivalence diagrammatically using the dominance of the planar diagrams.
