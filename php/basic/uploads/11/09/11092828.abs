Title: Evidence for Aharony duality for orthogonal gauge groups
Authors: Chiung Hwang and Kyung-Jae Park and Jaemo Park
Abstract: We study the Aharony duality for three dimensional $\mathcal N=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories for orthogonal gauge groups with matters in vector representation. We provide the evidence for the duality by working out the partition function on $S^3$ and the superconformal index, which show perfect agreement.
