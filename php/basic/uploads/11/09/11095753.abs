Title: Scalar Perturbation in Symmetric Lee-Wick Bouncing Universe
Authors: Inyong Cho and O-Kab Kwon
Abstract: We investigate the scalar perturbation in the Lee-Wick bouncing universe driven by an ordinary scalar field plus a ghost field. We consider only a symmetric evolution of the universe and the scalar fields about the bouncing point. The gauge invariant Sasaki-Mukhanov variable is numerically solved in the spatially flat gauge. We find a new form of the initial perturbation growing during the contracting phase. After the bouncing, this growing mode stabilizes to a constant mode which is responsible for the late-time power spectrum.
