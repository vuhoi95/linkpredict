Authors: Yong-Qiang Wang and Yu-Xiao Liu and Zhen-Hua Zhao
Abstract: In this work we generalized holographic model for s-wave DC Josephson junction constructed in arXiv:1101.3326[hep-th] to a holographic description for p-wave Josephson junction. By solving numerically the coupled equations of motion of Yang-Mills theory for a non-Abelian SU(2) gauge fields in (3+1)-dimensional AdS spacetimes, we shown that DC current of the p-wave Josephson junction is proportional to the sine of the phase difference across the junction like the s-wave case.
