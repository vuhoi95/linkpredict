Title: Analytic Coleman-De Luccia Geometries
Authors: Xi Dong and Daniel Harlow
Abstract: We present the necessary and sufficient conditions for a Euclidean scale factor to be a solution of the Coleman-De Luccia equations for some analytic potential $V(\phi)$, with a Lorentzian continuation describing the growth of a bubble of lower-energy vacuum surrounded by higher-energy vacuum. We then give a set of explicit examples that satisfy the conditions and thus are closed-form analytic examples of Coleman-De Luccia geometries.
