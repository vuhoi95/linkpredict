Title: Gauge-flation and Cosmic No-Hair Conjecture
Authors: A. Maleknejad and M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari and Jiro Soda
Abstract: Gauge-flation, inflation from non-Abelian gauge fields, was introduced in [1,2]. In this work, we study the cosmic no-hair conjecture in gauge-flation. Starting from Bianchi-type I cosmology and through analytic and numeric studies we demonstrate that the isotropic FLRW inflation is an attractor of the dynamics of the theory and that the anisotropies are damped within a few e-folds, in accord with the cosmic no-hair conjecture.
