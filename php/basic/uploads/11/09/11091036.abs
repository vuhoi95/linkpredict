Title: Ground-state Wigner functional of linearized gravitational field
Authors: Hugo Garcia-Compean and Francisco J. Turrubiates
Abstract: The deformation quantization formalism is applied to the linearized gravitational field. Standard aspects of this formalism are worked out before the ground state Wigner functional is obtained. Finally, the propagator for the graviton is also discussed within the context of this formalism.
