Title: Nonexistence of quasinormal modes in the extremal BTZ black hole
Authors: Yun Soo Myung and Yong-Wan Kim and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: We show that quasinormal modes cannot exist in the extremal BTZ black hole. For this purpose, we consider propagations of a minimally coupled scalar and a single massive graviton obtained from the cosmological topologically massive gravity on the extremal BTZ black hole. The would-be quasinormal modes for a scalar and graviton could not exist because it is impossible to make an ingoing flux into the extremal (degenerate) horizon. This is consistent with the argument that there is no propagating dynamics in the self-dual orbifold of AdS(3) which is just the near-horizon limit of the extremal BTZ black hole.
