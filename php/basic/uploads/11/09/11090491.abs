Title: Fermions in an AdS3 Black Hole Background and the Gauge-Gravity Duality
Authors: Cesar D. Fosco and Enrique F. Moreno and Fidel A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We study a model whose dynamics is determined by a Maxwell Lagrangian coupled to a complex scalar and a Dirac fermion field, in an $AdS_3$ black hole background. Our study is performed within the context of the Euclidean formalism, in terms of an effective action $S^{eff}$ that results from integrating out the fermion field. In particular, $S^{eff}$ includes an induced parity breaking part which reduces, in the weak coupling limit, to Chern-Simons terms for both the gauge and spin connections, with temperature dependent coefficients. We find numerically the effective action minimum and, applying the AdS/CFT correspondence, we discuss the properties of the dual quantum field theory defined on the boundary. We show that, in contrast with what happens in the absence of fermions, the system does not undergo a phase transition at any finite temperature.
