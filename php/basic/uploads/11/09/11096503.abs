Title: New symmetries of the chiral Potts model
Authors: Jens Fjelstad and Teresia Mansson
Abstract: In this paper a hithertho unknown symmetry of the three-state chiral Potts model is found consisting of two coupled Temperley-Lieb algebras. From these we can construct new superintegrable models. One realisation is in terms of a staggered isotropic XY spin chain. Further we investigate the importance of the algebra for the existence of mutually commuting charges. This leads us to a natural generalisation of the boost-operator, which generates the charges.
