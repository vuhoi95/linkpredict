Title: Collinear and Soft Divergences in Perturbative Quantum Gravity
Authors: Ratindranath Akhoury and Ryo Saotome and George Sterman
Abstract: Collinear and soft divergences in perturbative quantum gravity are investigated to arbitrary orders in amplitudes for wide-angle scattering, using methods developed for gauge theories. We show that collinear singularities cancel when all such divergent diagrams are summed over, by using the gravitational Ward identity that decouples the unphysical polarizations from the S-matrix. This analysis generalizes a result previously demonstrated in the eikonal approximation. We also confirm that the only virtual graviton corrections that give soft logarithmic divergences are of the ladder and crossed ladder type.
