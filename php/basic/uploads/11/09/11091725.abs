Title: The D-brane U-scan
Authors: Eric A. Bergshoeff and Fabio Riccioni
Abstract: We consider the D-branes that occur in IIA/IIB string theory compactified on a torus. We review how a general expression for the Wess-Zumino term of such branes is derived. We also review the method to determine the D-brane Wess-Zumino term in a U-duality covariant way, and we apply it to derive all the branes obtained by transforming the D-branes under U-duality in any dimension above five. We finally determine all the supersymmetric branes supporting worldvolume tensor multiplets that occur in these theories in any dimension.
