Abstract: We develop a field theoretical approach based on the temporary basis description as a tool to investigate the transmission properties of a time-driven quantum device. It employs a perturbative scheme for the calculation of the transmission of a monochromatic beam of particles through the time-dependent set-up. The main advantage of the proposed treatment is that it permits the use of the particle picture for the calculation of the scattering matrix and the transmission coefficient. Therefore the elementary physical processes contributing to the transmission can be identified and interpreted in a transparent way. We apply the method to the simple but prototype problem of transmission through an one-dimensional oscillating delta potential and we demonstrate how it enables a deep understanding of the underlying physical processes.
