Title: Survey of mathematical foundations of QFT and perturbative string theory
Authors: Hisham Sati and Urs Schreiber
Abstract: Recent years have seen noteworthy progress in the mathematical formulation of quantum field theory and perturbative string theory. We give a brief survey of these developments. It serves as an introduction to the more detailed collection "Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Field Theory and Perturbative String Theory".
