Title: A necessary condition for brane solutions to have their origins in  string field theory
Authors: Riuji Mochizuki and Kenji Ikegami
Abstract: We present a necessary condition for brane solutions to have their origins in string field theory. For such solutions, T-duality operations between IIA and IIB solutions should be well-defined. Nevertheless, not all S-brane solutions have T-duality. The solutions that have T-duality and may accordingly be regarded as low-energy solutions of string field theory satisfy a condition in which some S-brane distributions are forbidden.
