Title: Thermodynamics of phase transition in higher dimensional AdS black holes
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Dibakar Roychowdhury
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of phase transition for $ (n+1) $ dimensional Reissner Nordstrom (RN)-AdS black holes using a grand canonical ensemble. This phase transition is characterized by a discontinuity in specific heat. The phase transition occurs from a lower mass black hole with negative specific heat to a higher mass black hole with positive specific heat. By exploring Ehrenfest's scheme we show that this is a second order phase transition. Explicit expressions for the critical temperature and critical mass are derived. In appropriate limits the results for $ (n+1) $ dimensional Schwarzschild AdS black holes are obtained.
