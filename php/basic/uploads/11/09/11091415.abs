Title: Dynamics of partially localized brane systems
Authors: Masato Minamitsuji and Kunihito Uzawa
Abstract: We study dynamical partially localized brane solutions in higher dimensions. We give new descriptions of the relevant solutions of dynamical branes which are localized along both the overall and relative transverse directions. The starting point is a system of p_r-branes ending on a p_s-brane with a time-dependent warp factor. This system can be related to Dp_r-Dp_s brane system in string theory, where one brane is localized at the delocalized other brane. We then show that these give Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmological solutions. Our approach leads to a new and manifest description of the brane configurations near the delocalized branes, and new solutions in the wave or KK-monopole background in terms of certain partial differential equations in D dimensions including ten and eleven dimensions.
