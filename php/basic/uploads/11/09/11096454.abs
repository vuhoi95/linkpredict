Title: (2,0) Supersymmetry and the Light-Cone Description of M5-branes
Authors: Neil Lambert and Paul Richmond
Abstract: In 1007.2982 a novel system of equations which propagate in one null and four space directions were obtained as the on-shell conditions for the six-dimensional (2,0) superalgebra. In this paper we show how this system reduces to one-dimensional motion on instanton moduli space. Quantization leads to the previous light-cone proposal of the (2,0) theory, generalized to include a potential that arises on the Coulomb branch as well as couplings to background gauge and self-dual two-form fields.
