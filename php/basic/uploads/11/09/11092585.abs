Title: Young diagrams, Brauer algebras, and bubbling geometries
Authors: Yusuke Kimura and Hai Lin
Abstract: We study the 1/4 BPS geometries corresponding to the 1/4 BPS operators of the dual gauge theory side, in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM. By analyzing asymptotic structure and flux integration of the geometries, we present a mapping between droplet configurations arising from the geometries and Young diagrams of the Brauer algebra. In particular, the integer $k$ classifying the operators in the Brauer basis is mapped to the mixing between the two angular directions.
