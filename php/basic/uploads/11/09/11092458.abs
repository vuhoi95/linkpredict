Authors: Kamal L. Panigrahi and Pabitra M. Pradhan and Pratap K. Swain
Abstract: We study solutions for rigidly rotating strings on AdS$_4 \times$ CP$^3$ in the presence of $B_{\rm NS}$ holonomy turned on over $CP^1 \subset CP^3$. We construct general solutions for rotating strings with two and three angular momenta in $CP^3$ and discuss various limits corresponding to giant magnon and spike like solutions.
