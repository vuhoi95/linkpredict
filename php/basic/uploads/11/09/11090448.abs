Title: Tilted Ekpyrosis
Authors: Jos√© Fonseca and David Wands
Abstract: We consider a simple model of cosmological collapse driven by canonical fields with exponential potentials. We generalise the two-field ekpyrotic collapse to consider non-orthogonal or tilted potentials and give the general condition for isocurvature field fluctuations to have a scale-invariant spectrum in this model. In particular we show that tilted potentials allow for a slightly red spectrum of perturbations as required by current observations. However a red spectrum of fluctuations implies that the two-field ekpyrotic phase must have a finite duration and requires a preceding phase which sets the initial conditions for what otherwise appears to be a fine-tuned trajectory in the phase space.
