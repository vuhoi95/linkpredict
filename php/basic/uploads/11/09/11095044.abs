Title: Lifshitz Solitons
Authors: Robert Mann and Luisa Pegoraro and Marius Oltean
Abstract: We numerically obtain a class of soliton solutions for Einstein gravity in $(n+1)$ dimensions coupled to massive abelian gauge fields and with a negative cosmological constant with Lifshitz asymptotic behaviour. We find that for all $n\geq3$, a discrete set of magic values for the charge density at the origin (guaranteeing an asymptotically Lifshitz geometry) exists when the critical exponent associated with the Lifshitz scaling is $z=2$; moreover, in all cases, a single magic value is obtained for essentially every $1<z<2$, yet none when $z>2$ sufficiently.
