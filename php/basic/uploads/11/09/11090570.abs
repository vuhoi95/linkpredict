Title: Thermal properties of a solid through q-deformed algebra
Authors: A. A. Marinho and F. A. Brito and C. Chesman
Abstract: We address the study of the thermodynamics of a crystalline solid by applying q-deformed algebras. We based part of our study by considering both Einstein and Debye models. We have mainly explored the q-deformed thermal and electric conductivities as a function of the Debye specific heat. The results led to the interpretation of the q-deformation acting as a factor of disorder or impurity modifying the characteristics of a crystalline structure as, for example, in the case of semiconductors.
