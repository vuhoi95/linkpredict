Title: The Chiral Heat Effect
Authors: Taro Kimura and Tatsuma Nishioka
Abstract: We consider the thermal response of a (3+1)-dimensional theory with a chiral anomaly on a curved space motivated by the chiral magnetic effect. We find a new phenomenon, called the chiral heat effect, such that the thermal current is induced transverse to a gradient of the temperature even on a flat space. This effect is expected to be observed in QCD experiment as well as the chiral magnetic effect. We study a similar topological effect on the spacetime with a torsion. A holographic construction is also discussed with the D3/D7 and the Sakai-Sugimoto models.
