Title: G-Bounce
Authors: Damien A. Easson and Ignacy Sawicki and Alexander Vikman
Abstract: We present a wide class of models which realise a bounce in a spatially flat Friedmann universe in standard General Relativity. The key ingredient of the theories we consider is a noncanonical, minimally coupled scalar field belonging to the class of theories with Kinetic Gravity Braiding / Galileon-like self-couplings. In these models, the universe smoothly evolves from contraction to expansion, suffering neither from ghosts nor gradient instabilities around the turning point. The end-point of the evolution can be a standard radiation-domination era or an inflationary phase. We formulate necessary restrictions for Lagrangians needed to obtain a healthy bounce and illustrate our results with phase portraits for simple systems including the recently proposed Galilean Genesis scenario.
