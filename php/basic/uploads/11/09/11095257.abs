Abstract: The geometric structure of the null solutions of de Sitter D=5 gauged supergravity coupled to vector multiplets is investigated. These solutions are Kundt metrics, constructed from a one-parameter family of three dimensional Gauduchon-Tod base spaces. We give examples, including the near horizon geometries previously found in arxiv:hep-th/10122120. In addition, two special cases are considered in detail. In the first, we consider solutions for which the Gauduchon-Tod base space is the Berger sphere. In the second case we take the null 1-form Killing spinor bilinear to be recurrent, so that the holonomy of the Levi-Civita connection is contained in Sim(3).
