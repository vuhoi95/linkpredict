Title: Non-Gaussianity in the Cosmic Microwave Background Anisotropies at  Recombination in the Squeezed limit
Authors: N. Bartolo and S. Matarrese and A. Riotto
Abstract: We estimate analytically the second-order cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies at the recombination epoch in the squeezed limit and we deduce the contamination to the primordial local non-Gaussianity. We find that the level of contamination corresponds to f_NL^{con}=O(1) which is below the sensitivity of present experiments and smaller than the value O(5) recently claimed in the literature.
