Title: On the local limit of quantum field theories defined on the loop space
Authors: V. V. Belokurov and E. T. Shavgulidze
Abstract: The local limit of a quantum field theory on the loop space is studied. It is proved that the invariance of the theory with respect to the group of diffeomorphisms leads to Feynman diagrams convergence in the local limit.
