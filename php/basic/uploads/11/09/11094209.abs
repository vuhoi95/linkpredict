Title: Spherically symmetric static spacetimes in vacuum f(T) gravity
Authors: Rafael Ferraro and Franco Fiorini
Abstract: We show that Schwarzschild geometry remains as a vacuum solution for those four-dimensional f(T) gravitational theories behaving as ultraviolet deformations of general relativity. In the gentler context of three-dimensional gravity, we also find that the infrared-deformed f(T) gravities, like the ones used to describe the late cosmic speed up of the Universe, have as the circularly symmetric vacuum solution a Deser-de Sitter or a BTZ-like spacetime with an effective cosmological constant depending on the infrared scale present in the function f(T).
