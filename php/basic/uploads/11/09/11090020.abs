Abstract: We show that quantum chiral anomaly of QCD in magnetic backgrounds induces a novel structure of electric charge inside baryons. To illustrate the anomaly effect, we employ the Skyrme model for baryons, with the anomaly-induced gauged Wess-Zumino term (\pi_0 + (multi-pion)) E_i B_i. Due to this term, the Skyrmions giving a local pion condensation ((\pi_0 + (multi-pion)) \neq 0) necessarily become a local charge source, in the background magnetic field B_i. We present detailed evaluation of the anomaly effects, and calculate the total induced charge, for various baryons in the magnetic field.
