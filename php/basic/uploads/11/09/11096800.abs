Title: Strongly-Coupled Quarks and Colorful Black Holes
Authors: MD Razikul Islam and Justin F. Vazquez-Poritz
Abstract: We use the AdS/CFT correspondence to study the behavior of strongly-coupled quarks in a black hole background. The supergravity background consists of a six-dimensional Schwarzschild-black string AdS soliton, for which the bulk horizon extends from the AdS boundary down to an infra-red floor. By going to higher energy scales, the regime of validity of the classical supergravity background can be extended closer to the singularity than might be expected from the four-dimensional perspective. Small black holes potentially created by the Large Hadron Collider could typically carry color charges inherited from their parton progenitors. The dynamics of quarks near such a black hole depends on the curved spacetime geometry as well as the strong interaction with the color-charged black hole. We study the resulting behavior of quarks and compute the rate at which a quark rotating around the black hole loses energy. We also investigate how the interaction between a quark and an antiquark is altered by the presence of the black hole, which results in a screening length.
