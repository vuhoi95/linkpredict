Title: Lump solutions in SFT. Complements
Authors: L. Bonora and S. Giaccari and D. D. Tolla
Abstract: Recently a possible violation of the equation of motion for the recently proposed lump solutions in open SFT has been pointed out in the literature. In this paper we argue that, when the issue is considered in the appropriate mathematical setting of distribution theory, no violations to the equation of motion occur.
