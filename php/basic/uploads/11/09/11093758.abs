Title: Massless fermions in the standing wave braneworld
Authors: Merab Gogberashvili and Pavle Midodashvili and Levan Midodashvili
Abstract: We investigate the 5D massless fermionic fields within the standing wave braneworld model. We show that in the case of increasing warp factor there exist localized left spinor field zero modes on the brane, while right fermion wave functions are not normalizable.
