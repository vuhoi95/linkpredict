Title: On renormalizability of the effective field theory of massive Yang-Mills  fields
Authors: Jambul Gegelia and George Japaridze
Abstract: Effective field theory of massive Yang-Mills fields interacting with fermions is considered. Perturbative renormalizability in the sense of effective field theory is shown. It is argued that the limit of vanishing vector boson mass leads to massless gauge effective field theory. Possible relevance for the solution to the strong CP problem is discussed.
