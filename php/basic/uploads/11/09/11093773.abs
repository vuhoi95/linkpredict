Title: Schrodinger Equations for Higher Order Non-relativistic Particles and  N-Galilean Conformal Symmetry
Authors: Joaquim Gomis and Kiyoshi Kamimura
Abstract: We consider Schrodinger equations for a non-relativistic particle obeying N+1-th order higher derivative classical equation of motion. These equations are invariant under N(odd)-extended Galilean conformal (NGC) algebras in general d+1 dimensions. In 2+1 dimensions, the exotic Schrodinger equations are invariant under N(even)-GCA.
