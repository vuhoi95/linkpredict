Title: Quantum string cosmology in the phase space
Authors: Ruben Cordero and Erik Diaz and Hugo Garcia-Compean and Francisco J. Turrubiates
Abstract: Deformation quantization is applied to quantize gravitational systems coupled with matter. This quantization procedure is performed explicitly for quantum cosmology of these systems in a flat minisuper(phase)space. The procedure is employed in a quantum string minisuperspace corresponding to an axion-dilaton system in an isotropic FRW Universe. The Wheeler-DeWitt-Moyal equation is obtained and its corresponding Wigner function is given analytically in terms of Meijer's functions. Finally, this Wigner functions is used to extract physical information of the system.
