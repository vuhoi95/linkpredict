Title: Probing Loop Quantum Gravity with Evaporating Black Holes
Authors: Aurelien Barrau and Xiangyu Cao and Jacobo Diaz-Polo and Julien Grain and Thomas Cailleteau
Abstract: This letter aims at showing that the observation of evaporating black holes should allow distinguishing between the usual Hawking behavior and Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) expectations. We present a full Monte-Carlo simulation of the evaporation in LQG and statistical tests that discriminate between competing models. We conclude that contrarily to what was commonly thought, the discreteness of the area in LQG leads to characteristic features that qualify evaporating black holes as objects that could reveal quantum gravity footprints.
