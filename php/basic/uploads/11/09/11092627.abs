Title: Searching for Signatures of Cosmic String Wakes in 21cm Redshift Surveys  using Minkowski Functionals
Authors: Evan McDonough and Robert H. Brandenberger
Abstract: Minkowski Functionals are a powerful tool for analyzing large scale structure, in particular if the distribution of matter is highly non-Gaussian, as it is in models in which cosmic strings contribute to structure formation. Here we apply Minkowski functionals to 21cm maps which arise if structure is seeded by a scaling distribution of cosmic strings embeddded in background fluctuations, and then test for the statistical significance of the cosmic string signals using the Fisher combined probability test. We find that this method allows for detection of cosmic strings with $G \mu > 5 \times 10^{-8}$, which would be improvement over current limits by a factor of about 3.
