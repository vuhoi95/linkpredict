Title: Gauge Origin of M-Parity and the mu-Term in Supersymmetry
Authors: Pavel Fileviez Perez and Martin Gonzalez-Alonso and Sogee Spinner
Abstract: In this article we present a simple theoretical framework where the origin of the mu-term and the matter-parity violating interactions of the minimal supersymmetric standard model can be understood from the spontaneous breaking of new Abelian gauge symmetries. In this context the masses of the Z' gauge bosons, the M-parity violating scale and the mu-term are determined by the supersymmetry breaking scale. The full spectrum of the theory is discussed in detail. We investigate the predictions for the Higgs masses in detail showing that it is possible to satisfy the LEP2 bounds even with sub-TeV squark masses. The model predicts the existence of light colored fields, lepton and baryon number violation, and new neutral gauge bosons at the Large Hadron Collider.
