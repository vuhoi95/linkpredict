Title: Boundary Contributions Using Fermion Pair Deformation
Authors: Bo Feng and Zhibai Zhang
Abstract: Continuing the study of boundary BCFW recursion relation of tree level amplitudes initiated in \cite{Feng:2009ei}, we consider boundary contributions coming from fermion pair deformation. We present the general strategy for these boundary contributions and demonstrate calculations using two examples, i.e, the standard QCD and deformed QCD with anomalous magnetic momentum coupling. As a by-product, we have extended BCFW recursion relation to off-shell gluon current, where because off-shell gluon current is not gauge invariant, a new feature must be cooperated.
