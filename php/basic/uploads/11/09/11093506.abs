Title: Reply to the "Comment on: Detecting Vanishing Dimensions Via Primordial  Gravitational Wave Astronomy"
Authors: Jonas Mureika and Dejan Stojkovic
Abstract: The "Comment on: Detecting Vanishing Dimensions Via Primordial Gravitational Wave Astronomy" [arXiv:1104.1223] is misleading and premised on a misinterpretation of the main content of Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 101101 (2011) [arXiv:1102.3434]. The main claim in the comment - that in some exotic theories different from general relativity (GR) there might be local degrees of freedom even in lower dimensional spaces - is trivial. Nevertheless, the authors of the Comment fail to come-up with a single self-consistent example. This claim, however, has no implications for our paper, in which we make it clear we are working within the framework of "vanishing" or "evolving" dimensions as defined in arXiv:1003.5914.
