Title: Phenomenology of ageing in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation
Authors: Malte Henkel and Jae Dong Noh and Michel Pleimling
Abstract: We study ageing during surface growth processes described by the one-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation. Starting from a flat initial state, the systems undergo simple ageing in both correlators and linear responses and its dynamical scaling is characterised by the ageing exponents a=-1/3, b=-2/3, lambda_C=lambda_R=1 and z=3/2. The form of the autoresponse scaling function is well described by the recently constructed logarithmic extension of local scale-invariance.
