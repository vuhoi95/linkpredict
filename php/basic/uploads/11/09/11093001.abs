Title: The model for self-dual chiral bosons as a Hodge theory
Authors: Sudhaker Upadhyay and Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: We consider (1+1) dimensional theory for a single self-dual chiral boson as classical model for gauge theory. Using Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky (BFV) technique the nilpotent BRST and anti BRST symmetry transformations for this theory have been studied. In this model other forms of nilpotent symmetry transformations like co-BRST and anti co-BRST which leave the gauge-fixing part of the action invariant, are also explored. We show that the nilpotent charges for these symmetry transformations satisfy the algebra of de Rham cohomological operators in differential geometry. The Hodge decomposition theorem on compact manifold is also studied in the context of conserved charges.
