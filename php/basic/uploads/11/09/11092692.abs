Title: QED effective action in Krein space quantization
Authors: A. Refaei and M. V. Takook
Abstract: The one-loop effective action of QED is calculated by the Schwinger method in Krein space quantization. We show that the effective action is naturally fnite and regularized. It also coincides with the renormalized solution which was derived by Schwinger.
