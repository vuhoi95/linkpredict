Title: Hiding and Confining Charges via "Tube-like" Wormholes

Abstract: We describe two interesting effects in wormhole physics. First, we find that a genuinely charged matter source may appear neutral to an external observer - a phenomenon opposite to the famous Misner-Wheeler "charge without charge" effect. This phenomenon takes place when coupling a bulk gravity/nonlinear-gauge-field system to a charged lightlike brane as a matter source. The "charge-hiding" effect occurs in a wormhole solution which connects a non-compact "universe", comprising the exterior region of Schwarzschild-(anti-)de-Sitter (SdS) or purely Schwarzschild black hole beyond the Schwarzschild horizon, to a Levi-Civita-Bertotti-Robinson-type (LCBR) "tube-like" "universe" via a wormhole "throat" occupied by the brane. In this solution the whole electric flux produced by the brane is expelled into the "tube-like" "universe" and the brane is detected as neutral by an observer in the non-compact "universe". Next, we find a truly charge-confining wormhole solution when we couple the bulk gravity/nonlinear-gauge-field system to two oppositely charged lightlike branes. The latter system possesses a "two-throat" wormhole solution, where the "left-most" and the "right-most" "universes" are two identical copies of the exterior region of SdS black hole beyond the Schwarzschild horizon, whereas the "middle" "universe" is of LCBR "tube-like" form with geometry dS_2 x S^2. It comprises the finite-extent intermediate region of dS_2 between its two horizons. Both "throats" are occupied by the two oppositely charged lightlike branes and the whole electric flux produced by the latter is confined entirely within the middle "tube-like" "universe". A crucial ingredient is the special form of the nonlinear gauge field action, which contains both the standard Maxwell term as well as a square root of the latter. This theory was previously shown to produce a QCD-like confining dynamics in flat space-time.
