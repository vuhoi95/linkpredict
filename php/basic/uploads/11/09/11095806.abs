Abstract: We study the infrared properties of SU(3) gauge theory coupled to 12 massless Dirac fermions in the fundamental representation. The renormalized running coupling constant is calculated in the Twisted Polyakov loop scheme on the lattice. From the step-scaling analysis, we find that the infrared behavior of the theory is governed by a non-trivial fixed point.
