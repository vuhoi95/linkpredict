Title: Black holes in scalar-tensor gravity
Authors: Thomas P. Sotiriou and Valerio Faraoni
Abstract: Hawking has proven that black holes which are stationary as the endpoint of gravitational collapse in Brans--Dicke theory (without a potential) are no different than in general relativity. We extend this proof to the much more general class of scalar-tensor and f(R) gravity theories, without assuming any symmetries apart from stationarity.
