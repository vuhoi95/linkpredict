Title: Confluent Heun functions in gauge theories on thick braneworlds
Authors: M. S. Cunha and H. R. Christiansen
Abstract: We investigate the propagation modes of gauge fields in an infinite Randall-Sundrum scenario. In this model a sine-Gordon soliton represents our thick four-dimensional braneworld while an exponentially coupled scalar acts for the dilaton field. For the gauge-field motion we find a differential equation which can be transformed into a confluent Heun equation. By means of another change of variables we obtain a related Schrodinger equation with a family of symmetric rational (\gamma-\omega z^2)/(1-z^2)^2 potential functions. We discuss both results and present the infinite spectrum of analytical solutions for the gauge field. Finally, we assess the existence and the relative weights of Kaluza-Klein modes in the present setup.
