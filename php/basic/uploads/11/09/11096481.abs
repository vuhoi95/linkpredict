Title: Near horizon superconformal symmetry of rotating BPS black holes in five  dimensions
Authors: Masayoshi Nakamura and Naoto Yokoi
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic supersymmetry group of the near horizon region of the BMPV black holes, which are the rotating BPS black holes in five dimensions. When considering only bosonic fluctuations, we show that there exist consistent boundary conditions and the corresponding asymptotic symmetry group is generated by a chiral Virasoro algebra with the vanishing central charge. After turning on fermionic fluctuations with the boundary conditions, we also show that the asymptotic supersymmetry group is generated by a chiral super-Virasoro algebra with the vanishing central extension. The super-Virasoro algebra is originated in the AdS2 isometry supergroup of the near horizon solution.
