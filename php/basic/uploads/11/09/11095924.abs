Title: Mass-dependent Lorentz Violation and Neutrino Velocity
Authors: Miao Li and Tower Wang
Abstract: Motivated by a recent and several earlier measurement results of the neutrino velocity, we attempt to resolve the apparent discrepancies between them from the viewpoint of mass-energy relation in special relativity. It is argued that a complicated tachyonic neutrino model or a mass-dependent Lorentz violation theory can do this job.
