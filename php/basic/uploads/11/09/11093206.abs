Title: Liouville Black Hole In A Noncommutative Space
Authors: K. Bilal and A. El Boukili and M. Nach and M. B. Sedra
Abstract: The space-noncommutativity adapted to the Liouville black hole theory is studied in the present work. Among our contributions, we present the solutions of noncommutative Liouville Black hole equations of motion and find their classical properties such as the ADM mass, the horizon and the scalar Ricci curvature.
