Title: Particle collisions near the cosmological horizon of a  Reissner-Nordstr√∂m de Sitter black hole
Authors: Changchun Zhong and Sijie Gao
Abstract: It has recently been shown that black holes can act as particle accelerators and two particles can collide with arbitrarily high center-of-mass (CM) energy under certain critical conditions. In this paper, we investigate particle collisions outside a Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter (RN-dS) black hole. We find that infinite CM energy can be produced near the cosmological horizon for generic spacetime configurations. Remarkably, such infinite CM energy does not require the black hole to be extremal, in contrast to spacetimes in the absence of cosmological constants. However, since the charge of an astrophysical body is negligible, the required charge to mass ratio of the particle is extremely higher than that of any elementary particle.
