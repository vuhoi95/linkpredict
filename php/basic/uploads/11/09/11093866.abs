Title: Holographic helical superconductors
Authors: Aristomenis Donos and Jerome P. Gauntlett
Abstract: We show that D=5 electrically charged AdS black branes can have instabilities associated with spatially modulated p-wave superconductors with helical structure. We show that the instabilities are present within N=4 $SU(2)\times U(1)$ gauged supergravity and hence within D=10 and D=11 supergravity.
