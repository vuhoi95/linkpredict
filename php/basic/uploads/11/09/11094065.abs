Title: A commutant realization of W^(2)_n at critical level
Authors: Thomas Creutzig and Peng Gao and Andrew R. Linshaw
Abstract: For n\geq 2, there is a free field realization of the affine vertex superalgebra A associated to psl(n|n) at critical level inside the bc\beta\gamma system W of rank n^2. We show that the commutant C=Com(A,W) is purely bosonic and is freely generated by n+1 fields. We identify the Zhu algebra of C with the ring of invariant differential operators on the space of n\times n matrices under SL_n \times SL_n, and we classify the irreducible, admissible C-modules with finite dimensional graded pieces. For n\leq 4, C is isomorphic to the W_n^{(2)}-algebra at critical level, and we conjecture that this holds for all n.
