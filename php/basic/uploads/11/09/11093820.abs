Title: No Classicalization Beyond Spherical Symmetry
Authors: Ratindranath Akhoury and Shinji Mukohyama and Ryo Saotome
Abstract: We point out that a field theory that exhibits the classicalization phenomenon for perfect spherical symmetry ceases to do so when the spherical symmetry is significantly relaxed. We first investigate a small non-spherical deformation and show that the classicalization radius tends to decrease in a region where a shell made of the field is slightly flattened. Next, in order to describe a sufficiently large flattened region, we consider a high-energy collision of planar shells and show that the system never classicalizes before reaching sub-cutoff lengths. This no-go result is further strengthened by an analysis of a small non-planar deformation. Finally, we show that the shape of a scattered planar wave is UV sensitive.
