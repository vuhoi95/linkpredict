Title: Superluminal neutrinos and domain walls
Authors: Peng Wang and Houwen Wu and Haitang Yang
Abstract: In this letter, we propose that the recent measurement of superluminal neutrinos in OPERA could be explained by the existence of a domain wall which is left behind after the phase transition of some scalar field in the universe. The scalar field couples to the neutrino and photon field with different effective couplings. It causes different effective metrics and the emergence of superluminal neutrinos. Moreover, if the supernova and the earth are in the same plane parallel to the wall, or the thickness of the wall is much smaller than the distance from the supernova to the earth, the contradiction between OPERA and SN1987a can be reconciled.
