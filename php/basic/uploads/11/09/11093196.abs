Title: Non-Gaussian Halo Mass Function and Non-Spherical Halo Collapse: Theory  vs. Simulations
Authors: Ixandra Achitouv and Pier Stefano Corasaniti
Abstract: The mass distribution of dark matter halos is a sensitive probe of primordial non-Gaussianity (NG). We derive an analytical formula of the halo mass function by perturbatively computing excursion set path-integrals for a non-Gaussian density field with non-vanishing skewness, fnl. We assume a stochastic barrier model which captures the main features of the ellipsoidal collapse of halos. Contrary to previous results based on extensions of the Press-Schechter formalism to NG initial conditions, we find that the non-spherical collapse of halos directly alter the signature of primordial NG. This points toward a potential degeneracy between the effect of primordial non-Gaussianity and that of non-linear halo collapse. The inferred mass function is found to be in remarkable agreement with N-body simulations of NG local type. Deviations are well within numerical uncertainties for all values of -80 < fNL^loc < 300 in the range of validity of the perturbative calculation. Moreover, the comparison with simulation results suggests that for fNL > 150 or fNL < -50 the non-linear collapse of halos, as described by our barrier model, strongly deviates from that of Gaussian initial conditions. This is not surprising since the effect of non-linear gravitational processes may be altered by initially large NG. Hence, in the lack of prior theoretical knowledge, halo collapse model parameters should be included in statistical halo mass function data analysis which aim to constrain the signature of primordial NG
