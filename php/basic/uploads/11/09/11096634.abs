Title: Connection between complete and Moebius forms of gauge invariant  operators
Authors: V. S. Fadin and R. Fiore and A. V. Grabovsky and A. Papa
Abstract: We study the connection between complete representations of gauge invariant operators and their Moebius representations acting in a limited space of functions. The possibility to restore the complete representations from Moebius forms in the coordinate space is proven and a method of restoration is worked out. The operators for transition from the standard BFKL kernel to the quasi-conformal one are found both in Moebius and total representations.
