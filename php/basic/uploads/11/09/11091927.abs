Title: Holographic Interface-Particle Potential
Authors: Koichi Nagasaki and Hiroaki Tanida and Satoshi Yamaguchi
Abstract: We consider two N=4 supersymmetric gauge theories connected by an interface and the gravity dual of this system. This interface is expressed by a fuzzy funnel solution of Nahm's equation in the gauge theory side. The gravity dual is a probe D5-brane in AdS_5 x S^5. The potential energy between this interface and a test particle is calculated in both the gauge theory side and the gravity side by the expectation value of a Wilson loop. In the gauge theory it is evaluated by just substituting the classical solution to the Wilson loop. On the other hand it is done by the on-shell action of the fundamental string stretched between the AdS boundary and the D5-brane in the gravity. We show the gauge theory result and the gravity one agree with each other.
