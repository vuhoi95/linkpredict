Title: Dirac returns: non-Abelian statistics of vortices with Dirac fermions
Authors: Shigehiro Yasui and Kazunori Itakura and Muneto Nitta
Abstract: Topological superconductors classified as type D admit zero-energy Majorana fermions inside vortex cores, and consequently the exchange statistics of vortices becomes non-Abelian, giving a promising example of non-Abelian anyons. On the other hand, types C and DIII admit zero-energy Dirac fermions inside vortex cores. It has been long believed that an essential condition for the realization of non-Abelian statistics is non-locality of Dirac fermions made of two Majorana fermions trapped inside two well-separated vortices as in the case of type D. Contrary to this conventional wisdom, however, we show that vortices with local Dirac fermions also obey non-Abelian statistics.
