Title: Gribov pendulum in the Coulomb gauge on curved spaces
Authors: Fabrizio Canfora and Alex Giacomini and Julio Oliva
Abstract: In this paper the generalization of the Gribov pendulum equation in the Coulomb gauge for curved spacetimes is analyzed on static spherically symmetric backgrounds. A rigorous argument for the existence and uniqueness of solution is provided in the asymptotically AdS case. The analysis of the strong and weak boundary conditions is equivalent to analyzing an effective one-dimensional Schrodinger equation. Necessary conditions in order for spherically symmetric backgrounds to admit solutions of the Gribov pendulum equation representing copies of the vacuum satisfying the strong boundary conditions are given. It is shown that asymptotically flat backgrounds do not support solutions of the Gribov pendulum equation of this type, while on asymptotically AdS backgrounds such ambiguities can appear. Some physical consequences are discussed.
