Title: Correlation functions of three heavy operators - the AdS contribution
Authors: Romuald A. Janik and Andrzej Wereszczynski
Abstract: We consider operators in N=4 SYM theory which are dual, at strong coupling, to classical strings rotating in S^5. Three point correlation functions of such operators factorize into a universal contribution coming from the AdS part of the string sigma model and a state-dependent S^5 contribution. Consequently a similar factorization arises for the OPE coefficients. In this paper we evaluate the AdS universal factor of the OPE coefficients which is explicitly expressed just in terms of the anomalous dimensions of the three operators.
