Title: Hamiltonian BF theory and projected Borromean Rings
Authors: Ernesto Contreras and Adalberto DÃ­az and Lorenzo Leal
Abstract: It is shown that the canonical formulation of the abelian BF theory in D = 3 allows to obtain topological invariants associated to curves and points in the plane. The method consists on finding the Hamiltonian on-shell of the theory coupled to external sources with support on curves and points in the spatial plane. We explicitly calculate a non-trivial invariant that could be seen as a "projection" of the Milnor's link invariant MU(1; 2; 3), and as such, it measures the entanglement of generalized (or projected) Borromeans Rings in the Euclidean plane.
