Title: Warped de Sitter compactifications in the scalar-tensor theory
Authors: Masato Minamitsuji and Kunihito Uzawa
Abstract: We present new solutions of warped compactifications in the higher-dimensional gravity coupled to the scalar and the form field strengths. These solutions are constructed in the D-dimensional spacetime with matter fields, with the internal space that has a finite volume. Our solutions give explicit examples where the cosmological constant or 0-form field strength leads to a de Sitter spacetime in arbitrary dimensions.
