Title: 4-point correlators in finite-temperature AdS/CFT: jet quenching  correlations
Authors: Peter Arnold and Diana Vaman
Abstract: There has been recent progress on computing real-time equilibrium 3-point functions in finite-temperature strongly-coupled N=4 super Yang-Mills (SYM). In this paper, we show an example of how to carry out a similar analysis for a 4-point function. We look at the stopping of high-energy "jets" in such strongly-coupled plasmas and relate the question of whether, on an event-by-event basis, each jet deposits its net charge over a narrow (~ 1/T) or wide (>> 1/T) spatial region. We relate this question to the calculation of a 4-point equilibrium correlator.
