Title: N=2 supersymmetric theories on squashed three-sphere
Authors: Yosuke Imamura and Daisuke Yokoyama
Abstract: We investigate a squashing deformation of 3d N=2 supersymmetric theories on three-sphere, which have four supercharges. The deformation preserves SU(2)_L x U(1)_r isometry and all four supersymmetries. We compute the partition function and find non-trivial dependence on the squashing parameter. We also consider the large N limit of a certain class of quiver gauge theories which have free energy of order N^{3/2}, and show that the free energy on the squashed sphere differs from that on round sphere by a certain factor depending only on the squashing parameter.
