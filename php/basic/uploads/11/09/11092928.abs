Title: New Black Holes Solutions in a Modified Gravity
Authors: M. Hamani Daouda and Manuel E. Rodrigues and M. J. S. Houndjo
Abstract: We present a theory of modified gravity, inspired by the gauge theories, where the commutator algebra of covariant derivative gives us an added term with respect to the General Relativity, which represents the interaction of gravity with a substratum. New spherically symmetric solutions of this theory are obtained and can be view as solutions that reproduce, the mass, the charge, the cosmological constant and the Rindler acceleration, without coupling with the matter content, i.e., in the vacuum.
