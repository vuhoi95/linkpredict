Title: Warm dark matter in the galaxies:theoretical and observational  progresses. Highlights and conclusions of the chalonge meudon workshop 2011
Authors: H. J. de Vega and N. G. Sanchez
Abstract: Warm Dark Matter (WDM) research is progressing fast, the subject is new and WDM essentially works, naturally reproducing the astronomical observations over all scales: small (galactic) and large (cosmological) scales (LambdaWDM). Evidence that Cold Dark Matter (LambdaCDM) and its proposed tailored cures do not work at small scales is staggering. Fedor Bezrukov, Pier-Stefano Corasaniti, Hector J. de Vega, Stefano Ettori, Frederic Hessmann, Ayuki Kamada, Marco Lombardi, Alexander Merle, Christian Moni Bidin, Angelo Nucciotti on behalf of the MARE collaboration, Sinziana Paduroiu, Henri Plana, Norma Sanchez, Patrick Valageas, Shun Zhou present here their highlights of the Workshop. LambdaWDM simulations with keV particles remarkably reproduce the observations, small and large structures and velocity functions. Cored DM halos and WDM are clearly determined from theory and astronomical observations, they naturally produce the observed structures at all scales. keV sterile neutrinos are the leading candidates, they naturally appear extensions of the standard model of particle physics. Astrophysical constraints including Lyman alpha bounds put its mass in the range 1< m <13 keV. Predictions for EUCLID and PLANCK have been presented. MARE and an adapted KATRIN experiment could detect a keV sterile neutrino. It will be a fantastic discovery to detect dark matter in a beta decay. A formidable WDM work to perform is ahead of us, these highlights point out some relevant research directions to put the effort. Photos of the Workshop are included (Abridged).
