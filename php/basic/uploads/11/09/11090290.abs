Title: The effective action of Double Field Theory
Authors: Gerardo Aldazabal and Walter Baron and Diego Marques and Carmen Nunez
Abstract: We perform a generalized Scherk-Schwarz dimensional reduction of Double Field Theory on a twisted double torus. The four dimensional effective action is shown to exactly reproduce the bosonic electric sector of gauged N = 4 supergravity. We present explicit expressions for the gaugings in terms of the twists, and analyze the associated string backgrounds. This framework provides a higher dimensional origin of the gaugings in terms of generalized fluxes.
