Title: Nonperturbative study of the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole form factors
Authors: Arttu Rajantie and David J. Weir
Abstract: The mass and interactions of a quantum 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole are measured nonperturbatively using correlation functions in lattice Monte Carlo simulations. A method of measuring the form factors for interactions between the monopole and fundamental particles, such as the photon, is demonstrated. These quantities are potentially of experimental relevance in searches for magnetic monopoles.
