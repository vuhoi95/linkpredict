Title: Aspects of Quantum Fermionic T-duality
Authors: P. A. Grassi and A. Mezzalira
Abstract: We study two aspects of fermionic T-duality: the duality in purely fermionic sigma models exploring the possible obstructions and the extension of the T-duality beyond classical approximation. We consider fermionic sigma models as coset models of supergroups divided by their maximally bosonic subgroup OSp(m|n)/SO(m) x Sp(n). Using the non-abelian T-duality and a non-conventional gauge fixing we derive their fermionic T-duals. In the second part of the paper, we prove the conformal invariance of these models at one and two loops using the Background Field Method and we check the Ward Identities.
