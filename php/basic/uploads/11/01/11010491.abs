Title: Quantization of general linear electrodynamics
Authors: Sergio Rivera and Frederic P. Schuller
Abstract: General linear electrodynamics allow for an arbitrary linear constitutive relation between the field strength two-form and induction two-form density if crucial hyperbolicity and energy conditions are satisfied, which render the theory predictive and physically interpretable. Taking into account the higher-order polynomial dispersion relation and associated causal structure of general linear electrodynamics, we carefully develop its Hamiltonian formulation from first principles. Canonical quantization of the resulting constrained system then results in a quantum vacuum which is sensitive to the constitutive tensor of the classical theory. As an application we calculate the Casimir effect in a bi-refringent linear optical medium.
