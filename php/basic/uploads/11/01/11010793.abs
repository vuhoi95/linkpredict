Title: New Two-Dimensional Quantum Models with Shape Invariance
Authors: F. Cannata and M. V. Ioffe and D. N. Nishnianidze
Abstract: Two-dimensional quantum models which obey the property of shape invariance are built in the framework of polynomial two-dimensional SUSY Quantum Mechanics. They are obtained using the expressions for known one-dimensional shape invariant potentials. The constructed Hamiltonians are integrable with symmetry operators of fourth order in momenta, and they are not amenable to the conventional separation of variables.
