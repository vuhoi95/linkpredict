Title: Topological Charge in Two Flavors QCD with Optimal Domain-Wall Fermion
Authors: Tung-Han Hsieh and Ting-Wai Chiu and Yao-Yuan Mao
Abstract: We measure the topological charge of the gauge configurations generated by lattice simulations of 2 flavors QCD on a $ 16^3 \times 32 $ lattice, with Optimal Domain-Wall Fermion (ODWF) at $ N_s = 16 $ and plaquette gauge action at $ \beta = 5.90 $. Using the Adaptive Thick-Restart Lanczos algorithm, we project the low-lying modes of the 4D effective Dirac operator of ODWF, and obtain the topological charge and topological susceptibility. Our result of topological susceptibility agrees with the sea-quark mass dependence predicted by the chiral perturbation theory, and provides a determination of the chiral condensate.
