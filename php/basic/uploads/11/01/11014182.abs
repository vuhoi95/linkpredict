Title: The 1/N expansion of colored tensor models in arbitrary dimension
Authors: Razvan Gurau and Vincent Rivasseau
Abstract: In this paper we extend the 1/N expansion introduced in [1] to group field theories in arbitrary dimension and prove that only graphs corresponding to spheres S^D contribute to the leading order in the large N limit.
