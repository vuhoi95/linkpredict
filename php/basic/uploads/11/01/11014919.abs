Abstract: We derive new dominant bounds on the coefficient of the effective operator generated by tree-level graviton exchange in large extra dimensions from pp \rightarrow jj data at LHC: M_T > 2.1TeV (ATLAS after 3.1/pb of integrated luminosity), M_T > 3.4 TeV (CMS after 36/pb), MT > 3.2 TeV (ATLAS after 36/pb). We clarify the role of on-shell graviton exchange and compare the full graviton amplitude to ATLAS data, setting bounds on the fundamental quantum-gravity scale.
