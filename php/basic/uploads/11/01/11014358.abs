Title: The Full Two-Loop R-parity Violating Renormalization Group Equations for  All Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model Couplings
Authors: A. F. Kord and A. Yazdanian
Abstract: We present the full two-loop $\beta$-functions for the minimal supersymmetric standard model couplings, extended to include R-parity violating couplings through explicit R-parity violation.
