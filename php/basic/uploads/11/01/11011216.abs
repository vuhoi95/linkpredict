Title: A New Scientific Revolution at the Horizon?
Authors: Gilles Cohen-Tannoudji and Sylvain Hudlet
Abstract: At this beginning of the 21st century, the situation of physics is not without analogy with that which prevailed a hundred years ago, with the outset of the double scientific revolution of relativity and quanta. On the one hand, recent progress of observational cosmology makes think that one has discovered a new universal constant, perhaps as fundamental as the velocity of light or the Planck's constant, the cosmological constant, which could explain the acceleration of the expansion of the universe. On the other hand, just like the efforts of Planck and Einstein to reconcile thermodynamics and the electromagnetic theory of light led to the operational beginning of quantum physics, the unexpected discovery of bonds between thermodynamics and general relativity makes to foresee new concepts, perhaps heralding a new scientific revolution, like that of holography and leads to consider a "thermodynamic route towards quantum cosmology." We will discuss the possible implications of these observational and theoretical developments.
