Abstract: In this note, we discuss the basic elements that should appear in a gravitational system dual to a confining gauge theory displaying color superconductivity at large baryon density. We consider a simple system with these minimal elements, and show that for a range of parameters, the phase structure of this model as a function of temperature and baryon chemical potential exhibits phases that can be identified with confined, deconfined, and color superconducting phases in the dual field theory. We find that the critical temperature at which the superconducting phase disappears is remarkably small (relative to the chemical potential). This small number arises from the dynamics, and is unrelated to any small parameter in the model that we study. We discuss similar models which exhibit flavor superconductivity.
