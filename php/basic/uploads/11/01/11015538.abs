Title: Ultraviolet Properties of the Higgs Sector in the Lee-Wick Standard  Model
Authors: J. R. Espinosa and B. Grinstein
Abstract: The Lee-Wick (LW) Standard Model (SM) offers a new solution to the hierarchy problem. We discuss, using effective potential techniques, its peculiar ultraviolet (UV) behaviour. We show how quadratic divergences in the Higgs mass Mh cancel as a result of the unusual dependence of LW fields on the Higgs background (in a manner reminiscent of Little Higgses). We then extract from the effective potential the renormalization group evolution of the Higgs quartic coupling lambda above the LW scale. After clarifying an apparent discrepancy with previous results for the LW Abelian Higgs model we focus on the LWSM. In contrast with the SM case, for any Mh, lambda grows monotonically and hits a Landau pole at a fixed trans-Planckian scale (never turning negative in the UV). Then, the perturbativity and stability bounds on Mh disappear. We identify a cutoff ~10^{16} GeV for the LWSM due to the hypercharge gauge coupling hitting a Landau pole. Finally, we also discuss briefly the possible impact of the UV properties of the LW models on their behaviour at finite temperature, in particular regarding symmetry nonrestoration.
