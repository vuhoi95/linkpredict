Title: Observational consequences of chaotic inflation with nonminimal coupling  to gravity
Authors: Andrei Linde and Mahdiyar Noorbala and Alexander Westphal
Abstract: Recently there was an extensive discussion of Higgs inflation in the theory with the potential \lambda(\phi^2-v^2)^2 and nonminimal coupling to gravity {\xi\over 2}\phi^2R, for \xi >> 1 and v<< 1. We extend this investigation to the theories m^2\phi^2 and \lambda(\phi^2-v^2)^2 with arbitrary values of \xi and v and describe implementation of these models in supergravity. We analyze observational consequences of these models and find a surprising coincidence of the inflationary predictions of the model \lambda(\phi^2-v^2)^2 with \xi <0 in the limit |\xi|v^2 \to 1 with the predictions of the Higgs inflation scenario for \xi >> 1.
