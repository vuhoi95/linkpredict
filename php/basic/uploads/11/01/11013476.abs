Title: Quasi-Topological Lifshitz Black Holes
Authors: W. G. Brenna and M. H. Dehghani and R. B. Mann
Abstract: We investigate the effects of including a quasi-topological cubic curvature term to the Gauss-Bonnet action to five dimensional Lifshitz gravity. We find that a new set of Lifshitz black hole solutions exist that are analogous to those obtained in third-order Lovelock gravity in higher dimensions. No additional matter fields are required to obtain solutions with asymptotic Lifshitz behaviour, though we also investigate solutions with matter. Furthermore, we examine black hole solutions and their thermodynamics in this situation and find that a negative quasi-topological term, just like a positive Gauss-Bonnet term, prevents instabilities in what are ordinarily unstable Einsteinian black holes.
