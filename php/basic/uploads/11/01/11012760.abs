Title: Regular black holes in UV self-complete quantum gravity
Authors: Euro Spallucci and Stefano Ansoldi
Abstract: In this letter we investigate the role of regular (curvature singularity-free) black holes in the framework of UV self-complete quantum gravity. The existence of a minimal length, shielding the trans-Planckian regime to any physical probe, is self-consistently included into the black hole probe itself. In this way we obtain to slightly shift the barrier below the Planck Length, with the UV self-complete scenario self-consistently confirmed.
