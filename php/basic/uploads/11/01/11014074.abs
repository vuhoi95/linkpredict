Title: Mapping Hawking temperature in the spinning constant curvature black  hole spaces into Unruh temperature
Authors: Huai-Fan Li and Bin Hu
Abstract: We established the equivalence between the local Hawking temperature measured by the time-like Killing observer located at some positions $r$ with finite distances from the outer horizon $r_+$ in the 5-dimensional spinning black hole space with both negative and positive constant curvature, and the Unruh temperature measured by the Rindler observer with constant acceleration in the 6-dimensional flat space by employing the globally embedding approach.
