Title: Twisted SUSY: twisted symmetry versus renormalizability
Authors: Marija Dimitrijevic and Biljana Nikolic and Voja Radovanovic
Abstract: We discuss a deformation of superspace based on a hermitian twist. The twist implies a $\star$-product that is noncommutative, hermitian and finite when expanded in power series of the deformation parameter. The Leibniz rule for the twisted SUSY transformations is deformed. A minimal deformation of the Wess-Zumino action is proposed and its renormalizability properties are discussed. There is no tadpole contribution, but the two-point function diverges. We speculate that the deformed Leibniz rule, or more generally the twisted symmetry, interferes with renormalizability properties of the model. We discuss different possibilities to render a renormalizable model.
