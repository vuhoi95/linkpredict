Title: An Angular Formalism for Spin One Half
Authors: Benjamin Koch and Nicol√°s Rojas
Abstract: Understanding spin one half is a crucial issue in the De Broglie Bohm framework. In this paper a concrete relativistic realization of spin one half in terms of angular coordinates is developed. A Lagrange formulation is found, equations of motion are derived, and Lorentz invariance is discussed.
