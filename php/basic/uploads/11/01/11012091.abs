Title: Hawking radiation as tunneling from squashed Kaluza-Klein black hole
Authors: Ken Matsuno and Koichiro Umetsu
Abstract: We discuss Hawking radiation from a five-dimensional squashed Kaluza-Klein black hole on the basis of the tunneling mechanism. A simple manner, which was recently suggested by Umetsu, is possible to extend the original derivation by Parikh and Wilczek to various black holes. That is, we use the two-dimensional effective metric, which is obtained by the dimensional reduction near the horizon, as the background metric. By using same manner, we derive both the desired result of the Hawking temperature and the effect of the back reaction associated with the radiation in the squashed Kaluza-Klein black hole background.
