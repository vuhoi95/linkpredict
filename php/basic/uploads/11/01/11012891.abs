Title: Superresonance effect from a rotating acoustic black hole and Lorentz  symmetry breaking
Authors: M. A. Anacleto and F. A. Brito and E. Passos
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of the acoustic superresonance phenomenon (analog to the superradiance in black hole physics), i.e., the amplification of a sound wave by reflection from the ergoregion of a rotating acoustic black hole with Lorentz symmetry breaking. For rotating black holes the effect of superradiance corresponds to the situation where the incident waves has reflection coefficient greater than one, and energy is extracted from them. For an acoustic Kerr-like black hole its rate of loss of mass is affected by the Lorentz symmetry breaking. We also have shown that for suitable values of the Lorentz violating parameter a wider spectrum of particle wave function can be scattered with increased amplitude by the acoustic black hole.
