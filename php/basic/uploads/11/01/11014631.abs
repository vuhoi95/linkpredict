Title: A Note on the Symmetry Reduction of SU(2) on Horizons of Various  Topologies
Authors: Andrew DeBenedictis and Steve Kloster and Johan Brannlund
Abstract: It is known that the SU(2) degrees of freedom manifest in the description of the gravitational field in loop quantum gravity are generally reduced to U(1) degrees of freedom on an $S^2$ isolated horizon. General relativity also allows black holes with planar, toroidal, or higher genus topology for their horizons. These solutions also meet the criteria for an isolated horizon, save for the topological criterion, which is not crucial. We discuss the relevant corresponding symmetry reduction for black holes of various topologies (genus 0 and $\geq 2$) here and discuss its ramifications to black hole entropy within the loop quantum gravity paradigm. Quantities relevant to the horizon theory are calculated explicitly using a generalized ansatz for the connection and densitized triad, as well as utilizing a general metric admitting hyperbolic sub-spaces. In all scenarios, the internal symmetry may be reduced to combinations of U(1).
