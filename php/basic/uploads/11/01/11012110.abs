Title: Self-dual formulations of d=3 gravity theories in the path-integral  framework
Authors: P. J. Arias and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We study the connection, at the quantum level, between d=2+1 dimensional self-dual models with actions of growing (from first to fourth) order, governing the dynamics of helicity +2 (or -2) massive excitations. We obtain identities between generating functionals of the different models using the path-integral framework, this allowing to establish dual maps among relevant vacuum expectation values. We check consistency of these v.e.v.'s with the gauge invariance gained in each mapping.
