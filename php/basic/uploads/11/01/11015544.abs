Title: Applications of Laplace-Beltrami operator for Jack polynomials
Authors: Wuxing Cai and Naihuan Jing
Abstract: We use a new method to study the Laplace-Beltrami type operator on the Fock space of symmetric functions, and as an example of our explicit computation we show that the Jack symmetric functions are the only family of eigenvectors of the differential operator. As applications of this explicit method we find a combinatorial formula for Jack symmetric functions and the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients in the Jack case. As further applications, we obtain a new determinantal formula for Jack symmetric functions. We also obtained a generalized raising operator formula for Jack symmetric functions, and a formula for the explicit action of Virasoro operators. Special cases of our formulas imply Mimachi-Yamada's result on Jack symmetric functions of rectangular shapes, as well as the explicit formula for Jack functions of two rows or two columns.
