Abstract: We study the entropy-corrected version of the new agegraphic dark energy (NADE) model and dark matter in a spatially non-flat Universe and in the framework of Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz cosmology. For the two cases containing noninteracting and interacting entropy-corrected NADE (ECNADE) models, we derive the exact differential equation that determines the evolution of the ECNADE density parameter. Also the deceleration parameter is obtained. Furthermore, using a parametrization of the equation of state parameter of the ECNADE model as $\omega_{\Lambda}(z)=\omega_0+\omega_1 z$, we obtain both $\omega_0$ and $\omega_1$. We find that in the presence of interaction, the equation of state parameter $\omega_0$ of this model can cross the phantom divide line which is compatible with the observation.
