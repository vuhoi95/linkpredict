Title: Symmetries of Snyder--de Sitter space and relativistic particle dynamics
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Kuldeep Kumar and Dibakar Roychowdhury
Abstract: We study the deformed conformal-Poincare symmetries consistent with the Snyder--de Sitter space. A relativistic particle model invariant under these deformed symmetries is given. This model is used to provide a gauge independent derivation of the Snyder--de Sitter algebra. Our results are valid in the leading order in the parameters appearing in the model.
