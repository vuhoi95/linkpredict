Title: The D^{2k} R^4 Invariants of N=8 Supergravity
Authors: Daniel Z. Freedman and Erik Tonni
Abstract: The existence of a linearized SUSY invariant for N=8 supergravity whose gravitational components are usually called R^4 was established long ago by on-shell superspace arguments. Superspace and string theory methods have also established analogous higher dimensional D^{2k} R^4 invariants. However, very little is known about the SUSY completions of these operators which involve other fields of the theory. In this paper we find the detailed component expansion of the linearized R^4 invariant starting from the corresponding superamplitude which generates all component matrix elements of the operator. It is then quite straightforward to extend results to the entire set of D^{2k} R^4 operators.
