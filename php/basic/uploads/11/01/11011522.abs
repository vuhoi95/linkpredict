Title: Dual of QCD with One Adjoint Fermion
Authors: Matin Mojaza and Marco Nardecchia and Claudio Pica and Francesco Sannino
Abstract: We construct the magnetic dual of QCD with one adjoint Weyl fermion. The dual is a consistent solution of the 't Hooft anomaly matching conditions, allows for flavor decoupling and remarkably constitutes the first nonsupersymmetric dual valid for any number of colors. The dual allows to bound the anomalous dimension of the Dirac fermion mass operator to be less than one in the conformal window.
