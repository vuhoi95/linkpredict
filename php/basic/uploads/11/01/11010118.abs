Title: Gauge invariant coupling of fields to torsion: a string inspired model
Authors: Srijit Bhattacharjee and Ayan Chatterjee
Abstract: In a consistent heterotic string theory, the Kalb-Ramond field, which is the source of spacetime torsion, is augmented by Yang-Mills and gravitational Chern-Simons terms. When compactified to 4-dimensions and in the field theory limit, such additional terms give rise to interactions with interesting astrophysical predictions like rotation of plane of polarization for electromagnetic and gravitational waves. On the other hand, if one is also interested in coupling 2 or 3-form (Abelian or non-Abelian) gauge fields to torsion, one needs another class of interaction. In this paper, we shall study this interaction and offer some astrophysical and cosmological predictions. We also comment on the possibility of such terms in loop quantum gravity where, if the Barbero-Immirzi parameter is promoted to a field, acts as a source for torsion.
