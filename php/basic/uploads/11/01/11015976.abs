Title: The Unruh effect revisited
Authors: Pietro Longhi and Roberto Soldati
Abstract: A new and exact derivation of the Bogoliubov coefficients is obtained for the simplest case of a spinless, neutral, massive field in a uniformly accelerated frame with a constant acceleration. The method can be suitably generalized in a straightforward manner to any field with spin and charges.
