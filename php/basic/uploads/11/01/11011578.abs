Abstract: We study spin imbalance effects on the Larkin-Ovchinikov-Fulde-Ferrel (LOFF) state relevant for superconductors under a strong magnetic field and spin polarized ultracold Fermi gas. We obtain the exact solution for the condensates with arbitrary spin imbalance and the fermion spectrum perturbatively in the presence of small spin imbalance. We also obtain fermion zero mode exactly without perturbation.
