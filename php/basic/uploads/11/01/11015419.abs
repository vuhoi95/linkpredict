Abstract: By using the method of group analysis, we obtain a new exact evolving and spherically symmetric solution of the Einstein-Cartan equations of motion, corresponding to a space-time threaded with a three-form Kalb-Ramond field strength. The solution describes in its more generic form, a space-time which scalar curvature vanishes for large distances and for large time. In static conditions, it reduces to a classical wormhole solution and to a exact solution with a localized scalar field and a torsion kink, already reported in literature. In the process we have found evidence towards the construction of more new solutions.
