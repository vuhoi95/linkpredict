Title: Axion arising from warped extra-dimensional gauge fields
Authors: Yannis Burnier and Florian Kuhnel
Abstract: We present a connection between two known solutions to the strong-CP problem: the standard introduction of axions and the extra-dimensional one, relying on topological arguments. Using an equivalent lower-dimensional set-up with a warped extra-dimension but without adding any new fields, it is shown that an additional light degree of freedom appears. Like an axion, it couples to the topological charge density via Fermionic loop corrections. Its decay constant is related to the geometry of the extra dimension and is suppressed by the warping scale.
