Title: Thermodynamics and Hawking radiation of five-dimensional rotating  charged GÃ¶del black holes
Authors: Shuang-Qing Wu and Jun-Jin Peng
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of G\"{o}del-type rotating charged black holes in five-dimensional minimal supergravity. These black holes exhibit some peculiar features such as the presence of closed time-like curves and the absence of globally spatial-like Cauchy surface. We explicitly compute their energies, angular momenta, and electric charges that are consistent with the first law of thermodynamics. Besides, We extend the covariant anomaly cancellation method, as well as the approach of the effective action, to derive their Hawking fluxes. Both the methods of the anomaly cancellation and effective action give the same Hawking fluxes as those from Planck distribution for blackbody radiation in the background of the charged rotating G\"{o}del black holes. Our results further support that Hawking radiation is a quantum phenomenon arising at the event horizon.
