Title: Creation of neutral fermions with anomalous magnetic moment from vacuum  by inhomogeneous magnetic field
Authors: S. P. Gavrilov and D. M. Gitman
Abstract: Until now a consistent description (based on QFT) of neutral particle creation (due to their magnetic moments) in strong inhomogeneous magnetic fields was unknown. To provide such a description is a part of the present article. In the framework of the developed approach, we demonstrate that in a specific cases, the problem can be technically reduced to the problem of charge particle creation by an electric field given by a nonlinear scalar potential. We analyze once again the latter problem, taking into account existing approaches and formulating for the first time its solution from the view point of QFT. As a final result, we calculate neutral particle creation form the vacuum by a linearly growing magnetic field.
