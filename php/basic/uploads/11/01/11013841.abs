Title: Holographic Flavored Quark-Gluon Plasmas
Authors: Francesco Bigazzi and Aldo L. Cotrone and Daniel Mayerson and Angel Paredes and Javier Tarrio
Abstract: Holography provides a novel method to study the physics of Quark Gluon Plasmas, complementary to the ordinary field theory and lattice approaches. In this context, we analyze the informations that can be obtained for strongly coupled Plasmas containing dynamical flavors, also in the presence of a finite baryon chemical potential. In particular, we discuss the jet quenching and the hydrodynamic transport coefficients.
