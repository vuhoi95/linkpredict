Abstract: We study the parameter space of D-dimensional cosmological Einstein gravity together with quadratic curvature terms. In D>4 there are in general two distinct (anti)-de Sitter vacua. We show that for appropriate choice of the parameters there exists a critical point for one of the vacua, for which there are only massless tensor, but neither massive tensor nor scalar, gravitons. At criticality, the linearized excitations have vanishing energy (as do black hole solutions). A further restriction of the parameters gives a one-parameter cosmological Einstein plus Weyl^2 model with a unique vacuum, whose \Lambda is determined.
