Title: Index for three dimensional superconformal field theories with general  R-charge assignments
Authors: Yosuke Imamura and Shuichi Yokoyama
Abstract: We derive a general formula of an index for three dimensional N=2 superconformal field theories with general R-charge assignments to chiral multiplets by using the localization method in S^2xS^1 background. As examples we compute the index for theories in a few mirror pairs, and confirm the agreement of the indices in each mirror pair.
