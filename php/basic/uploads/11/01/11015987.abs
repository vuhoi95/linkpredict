Title: Branes, Quantization and Fuzzy Spheres
Authors: Christian Saemann and Richard J. Szabo
Abstract: We propose generalized quantization axioms for Nambu-Poisson manifolds, which allow for a geometric interpretation of n-Lie algebras and their enveloping algebras. We illustrate these axioms by describing extensions of Berezin-Toeplitz quantization to produce various examples of quantum spaces of relevance to the dynamics of M-branes, such as fuzzy spheres in diverse dimensions. We briefly describe preliminary steps towards making the notion of quantized 2-plectic manifolds rigorous by extending the groupoid approach to quantization of symplectic manifolds.
