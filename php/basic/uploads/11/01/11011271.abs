Title: Localized fields on scalar global defects
Authors: F. A. Brito and H. Henrique
Abstract: We investigate the localization of modes on the worldvolume of a p-brane embedded in p+d+1-dimensional spacetime. The p-brane here is such that its profile is regarded as a scalar global defect and the localized modes are scalar modes that come from the fluctuations around such defect. The effective action on the brane is computed and the induced potentials are typically phi^4-type potentials that are flatter for lower d-dimensions. We also make a connection of such scalar global defects with black p-branes in certain limits.
