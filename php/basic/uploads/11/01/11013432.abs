Title: Hydrodynamics of holographic flavored plasmas
Authors: F. Bigazzi and A. L. Cotrone and J. Tarrio
Abstract: We provide a short review of the hydrodynamical properties of a class of strongly coupled thermal gauge theories, coupled to massless fundamental flavor fields, having a dual supergravity description. The analysis is valid for more general classes of nearly conformal holographic plasmas, where the breaking of conformality is driven by marginally (ir)relevant deformations.
