Title: Toric Construction of Global F-Theory GUTs
Authors: Johanna Knapp and Maximilian Kreuzer and Christoph Mayrhofer and Nils-Ole Walliser
Abstract: We systematically construct a large number of compact Calabi-Yau fourfolds which are suitable for F-theory model building. These elliptically fibered Calabi-Yaus are complete intersections of two hypersurfaces in a six dimensional ambient space. We first construct three-dimensional base manifolds that are hypersurfaces in a toric ambient space. We search for divisors which can support an F-theory GUT. The fourfolds are obtained as elliptic fibrations over these base manifolds. We find that elementary conditions which are motivated by F-theory GUTs lead to strong constraints on the geometry, which significantly reduce the number of suitable models. The complete database of models is available at http://hep.itp.tuwien.ac.at/f-theory/. We work out several examples in more detail.
