Title: A perturbative no-hair of form fields for higher dimensional static  black holes
Authors: Tetsuya Shiromizu and Seiju Ohashi and Kentaro Tanabe
Abstract: In this paper we examine the static perturbation of p-form field strengths around higher dimensional Schwarzschild spacetimes. As a result, we can see that the static perturbations do not exist when p\geq 3. This result supports the no-hair properties of p-form fields. However, this does not exclude the presence of the black objects having non-spherical topology.
