Abstract: We present a contemporary perspective on the String Landscape and the Multiverse of plausible string, M- and F-theory vacua. In contrast to traditional statistical classifications and capitulation to the anthropic principle, we seek only to demonstrate the existence of a non-zero probability for a universe matching our own observed physics within the solution ensemble. We argue for the importance of No-Scale Supergravity as an essential common underpinning for the spontaneous emergence of a cosmologically flat universe from the quantum "nothingness". Concretely, we continue to probe the phenomenology of a specific model which is testable at the LHC and Tevatron. Dubbed No-Scale F-SU(5), it represents the intersection of the Flipped SU(5) Grand Unified Theory (GUT) with extra TeV-Scale vector-like multiplets derived out of F-theory, and the dynamics of No-Scale Supergravity, which in turn imply a very restricted set of high energy boundary conditions. By secondarily minimizing the minimum of the scalar Higgs potential, we dynamically determine the ratio tan \beta \simeq 15-20 of up- to down-type Higgs vacuum expectation values (VEVs), the universal gaugino boundary mass M_{1/2} \simeq 450 GeV, and consequently also the total magnitude of the GUT-scale Higgs VEVs, while constraining the low energy Standard Model gauge couplings. In particular, this local minimum minimorum lies within the previously described "golden strip", satisfying all current experimental constraints. We emphasize, however, that the overarching goal is not to establish why our own particular universe possesses any number of specific characteristics, but rather to tease out what generic principles might govern the superset of all possible universes.
