Title: Heating up the Baryonic Branch with U-duality: a unified picture of  conifold black holes
Authors: Elena Caceres and Carlos Nunez and Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas
Abstract: We study different aspects of a U-duality recently presented by Maldacena and Martelli and apply it to non-extremal backgrounds. In particular, starting from new non-extremal wrapped D5 branes we generate new non-extremal generalizations of the Baryonic Branch of the Klebanov-Strassler solution. We also elaborate on different conceptual aspects of these U-dualities, like its action on (extremal and non-extremal) Dp branes, dual models for Yang-Mills-like theories, generic asymptotics and decoupling limit of the generated solutions.
