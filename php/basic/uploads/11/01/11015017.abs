Title: A two-component picture of the <A^2> condensate with instantons
Authors: David Vercauteren and Henri Verschelde
Abstract: We study the interplay between the <A^2> condensate and instantons in non-Abelian gauge theory. Therefore we use the formalism of Local Composite Operators, with which the vacuum expectation value of this condensate can be analytically computed. We first use the dilute gas approximation and partially solve the infrared problem of instanton physics. In order to find quantitative results, however, we turn to an instanton liquid model, where we find how the different contributions to the condensate add up.
