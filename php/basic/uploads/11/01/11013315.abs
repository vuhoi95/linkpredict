Abstract: We extend the "hard wall" gravity dual of QCD by including tensor fields b_{MN} that correspond to the QCD quark bilinear operators qbar sigma^{mu nu} q. These fields give rise to a spectrum of states which include the h_1 and b_1 mesons, as well as a tower of excited omega/rho meson states. We also identify the lowest-dimension term which leads to mixing between the new rho states and the usual tower of rho mesons when chiral symmetry is broken.
