Title: Supersymmetry and fluctuation relations for currents in closed networks
Authors: Nikolai A. Sinitsyn and Alexei Akimov and Vladimir Y. Chernyak
Abstract: We demonstrate supersymmetry in the counting statistics of stochastic particle currents and use it to derive exact nonperturbative relations for the statistics of currents induced by arbitrarily fast time-dependent protocols.
