Title: Relating Gribov-Zwanziger theory to effective Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Sudhaker Upadhyay and Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: We consider the Gribov-Zwanziger (GZ) theory with appropriate horizon term which exhibits the nilpotent BRST invariance. This infinitesimal BRST transformation has been generalized by allowing the parameter to be finite and field dependent (FFBRST). By constructing appropriate finite field dependent parameter we show that the generating functional of GZ theory with horizon term is related to that of Yang-Mills (YM) theory through FFBRST transformation.
