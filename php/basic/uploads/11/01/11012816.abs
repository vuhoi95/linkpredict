Title: An M-theory solution from null roots in E11
Authors: Laurent Houart and Axel Kleinschmidt and Josef Lindman HÃ¶rnlund
Abstract: We find a purely gravitational classical solution of M-theory/eleven-dimensional supergravity which corresponds to a solution of the E10 brane sigma-model involving a null root. This solution is not supersymmetric and is regularly embedded into E11.
