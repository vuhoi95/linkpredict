Title: Consistent truncations with massive modes and holography
Authors: Davide Cassani and Gianguido Dall'Agata and Anton F. Faedo
Abstract: We review the basic features of some recently found consistent Kaluza-Klein truncations including massive modes. We emphasize the general ideas underlying the reduction procedure, then we focus on type IIB supergravity on 5-dimensional manifolds admitting a Sasaki-Einstein structure, which leads to half-maximal gauged supergravity in five dimensions. Finally, we comment on the holographic picture of consistency.
