Title: Time transients in the quantum corrected Newtonian potential induced by  a massless nonminimally coupled scalar field
Authors: Anja Marunovic and Tomislav Prokopec
Abstract: We calculate the one loop graviton vacuum polarization induced by a massless, nonminimally coupled scalar field on Minkowski background. We make use of the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, which allows us to study time dependent phenomena. As an application we compute the leading quantum correction to the Newtonian potential of a point particle. The novel aspect of the calculation is the use of the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, within which we calculate the time transients induced by switching on of the graviton-scalar coupling.
