Title: D-Dimensional Log Gravity
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha and Reza Fareghbal
Abstract: We study Einstein gravity in dimensions $D\geq 4$ modified by curvature squared at critical point where the theory contains only massless gravitons. We show that at the critical point a new mode appears leading to a logarithmic gravity in the theory. The corresponding logarithmic solution may provide a gravity description of logarithmic CFT in higher dimensions. We note also that for special values of the parameters of the theory, the model admits solutions with non-relativistic isometries.
