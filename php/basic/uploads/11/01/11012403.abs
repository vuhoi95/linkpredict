Title: Off-shell N=(1,0), D=6 supergravity from superconformal methods
Authors: Frederik Coomans and Antoine Van Proeyen
Abstract: We use the superconformal method to construct the full off-shell action of N=(1,0), D=6 supergravity, which has apart from the graviton and the gravitino, a 2-form gauge field, a dilaton and a symplectic Majorana spinor. We give detailed formula for superconformal expressions that can be useful for extensions of the theory to more matter multiplets or gauged supergravity.
