Title: Four-Fermion Interaction in the Low-Energy Approximation of Quantum  Chromodynamics
Authors: S. V. Kutnii and P. I. Golod
Abstract: A model with the four-fermion interaction is derived using the self-consistent field method in the low-energy limit of quantum chromodynamics. The resulting Lagrangian contains not only the trivial and chiral terms but also the interaction of the vector and pseudovector currents.
