Title: Dynamics of the chiral phase transition from AdS/CFT duality
Authors: Gerald Guralnik and Zachary Guralnik and Cengiz Pehlevan
Abstract: We use Lorentzian signature AdS/CFT duality to study a first order phase transition in strongly coupled gauge theories which is akin to the chiral phase transition in QCD. We discuss the relation between the latent heat and the energy (suitably defined) of the component of a D-brane which lies behind the horizon at the critical temperature. A numerical simulation of a dynamical phase transition in an expanding, cooling Quark-Gluon plasma produced in a relativistic collision is carried out.
