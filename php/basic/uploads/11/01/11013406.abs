Title: Renormalization group analysis of cosmological constraint on the mass of  Higgs scalar
Authors: V. V. Kiselev and S. A. Timofeev
Abstract: The Higgs boson of Standard Model, minimally coupled to the gravitation, is not able to produce the inflation of early Universe if its mass exceeds the threshold value, which is equal to m_H^{min} = 142 GeV in the tree approximation for the scalar potential. Two-loop corrections modify the estimate as m_H^{min} = 150 \pm 3 GeV, so that higher-order corrections of perturbation theory are completely under control, though they are numerically important in respect of experimental searches.
