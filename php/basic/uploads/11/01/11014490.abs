Title: Primeval acceleration and bounce conditions within induced gravity
Authors: Nils M. Bezares-Roder and Hemwati Nandan and Umananda Dev Goswami
Abstract: A model of induced gravity with Higgs potential is analysed for the FLRW cosmology. Conditions of acceleration and signatures for the primeval universe along with the inflation are discussed. It is shown that the scalar-field excitations act quintessentially within effective pressure terms for a negative deceleration parameter. The violation of energy conditions and primeval acceleration appears naturally in the present model in view of the notions for inflationary universe with the avoidance of the Big Bang singularity.
