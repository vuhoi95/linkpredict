Abstract: Here we consider the entropy-corrected version of the holographic dark energy model in the non-flat universe. We obtain the equation of state parameter in the presence of interaction between dark energy and dark matter. Moreover, we reconstruct the potential and the dynamics of the quintessence, tachyon, K-essence and dilaton scalar field models according to the evolutionary behavior of the interacting entropy-corrected holographic dark energy model.
