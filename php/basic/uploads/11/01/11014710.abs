Title: Localizing fields on brane in magnetized backgound
Authors: C. Q. Geng and Shih-Hao Ho
Abstract: To localize the scalar, fermion, and abelian gauge fields on our 3-brane, a simple mechanism with a hypothetical "magnetic field" in the bulk is proposed. This mechanism is to treat all fields in the equal footing without ad hoc consideration. In addition, the machanism can be easily realized in a flat dimension six Minkowski space and it works even in the weak coupling limit.
