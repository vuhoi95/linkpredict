Authors: Sangmo Cheon and Hee-Cheol Kim and Seok Kim
Abstract: We find and study the gravity duals of the supersymmetric vacua of N=6 mass-deformed Chern-Simons-matter theory for M2-branes. The classical solution extends that of Lin, Lunin and Maldacena by introducing a Z_k quotient and discrete torsions. The gravity vacua perfectly map to the recently identified supersymmetric field theory vacua. We calculate the masses of BPS charged particles in the weakly coupled field theory, which agree with the classical open membrane analysis when both calculations are reliable. We also comment on how non-relativistic conformal symmetry is realized in our gravity duals in a non-geometric way.
