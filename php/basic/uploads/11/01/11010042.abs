Abstract: We have studied the quasinormal modes of a massive scalar field coupling to Einstein's tensor in the spacelike stretched $AdS_3$ black hole spacetime. We find that both the right-moving and left-moving quasinormal frequencies depend not only on the warped parameter $v$ of black hole, but also on the coupling between the scalar field and Einstein's tensor. Moreover, we also discuss the warped $AdS/CFT$ correspondence from the quasinormal modes and probe the effects of the coupling on the left and right conformal weights $h_L$ and $h_R$ of the operators dual to the scalar field in the boundary.
