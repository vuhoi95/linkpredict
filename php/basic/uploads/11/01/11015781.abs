Title: Holographic Entanglement Entropy in Lovelock Gravities
Authors: Jan de Boer and Manuela Kulaxizi and Andrei Parnachev
Abstract: We study entanglement entropies of simply connected surfaces in field theories dual to Lovelock gravities. We consider Gauss-Bonnet and cubic Lovelock gravities in detail. In the conformal case the logarithmic terms in the entanglement entropy are governed by the conformal anomalies of the CFT; we verify that the holographic calculations are consistent with this property. We also compute the holographic entanglement entropy of a slab in the Gauss-Bonnet examples dual to relativistic and non-relativistic CFTs and discuss its properties. Finally, we discuss features of the entanglement entropy in the backgrounds dual to renormalization group flows between fixed points and comment on the implications for a possible c-theorem in four spacetime dimensions.
