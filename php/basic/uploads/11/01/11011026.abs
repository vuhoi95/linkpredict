Title: Cosmological structure formation with clustering quintessence
Authors: Emiliano Sefusatti and Filippo Vernizzi
Abstract: We study large-scale structure formation in the presence of a quintessence component with zero speed of sound in the framework of Eulerian Perturbation Theory. Due to the absence of pressure gradients, quintessence and dark matter are comoving and can be studied as a unique fluid in terms of the total energy density contrast and the common velocity. In this description the clustering of quintessence enhances the linear term proportional to the velocity divergence in the continuity equation by a factor (1+w) Omega_Q / Omega_m. This is responsible for a rapid evolution of the growth rate at low redshifts, and modifies the standard relation between the velocity divergence and the growth factor. For the total fluid, the solutions for the linear growth function and growth rate can be written in integral forms and admit simple fitting formulae, as in the LambdaCDM case. At second order in perturbation theory, we derive an explicit expression for the kernels F_2 and G_2. They receive modifications of the order of the ratio between quintessence and total energy density perturbations, which affect the corresponding tree-level bispectra. We finally compute the cumulative signal-to-noise in the power spectrum, bispectrum and reduced bispectrum, expected for departures from a LambdaCDM cosmology both in the clustering and smooth quintessence scenarios. The reduced bispectrum, in particular, receives sensible modifications only in the clustering case and can potentially be used to detect or rule out the model.
