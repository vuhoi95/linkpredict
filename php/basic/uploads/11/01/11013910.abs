Abstract: In Kaluza-Klein models with an arbitrary number of toroidal internal spaces, we investigate soliton solutions which describe the gravitational field of a massive compact object. We single out the physically interesting solution corresponding to a point-like mass. For the general solution we obtain equations of state in the external and internal spaces. These equations demonstrate that the point-like mass soliton has dust-like equations of state in all spaces. We also obtain the PPN parameters, which give the possibility to obtain the formulas for perihelion shift, deflection of light and time delay of radar echoes. Additionally, the gravitational experiments lead to a strong restriction on the parameter of the model: $\tau = -(2.1\pm 2.3)\times 10^{-5}$. The point-like mass solution contradicts this restriction. The condition $\tau=0$ satisfies the experimental limitation and defines a new class of solutions which are indistinguishable from general relativity. We call such solutions latent solitons. Black strings and black branes belong to this class. Moreover, the condition of stability of the internal spaces singles out black strings/branes from the latent solitons and leads uniquely to the black string/brane equations of state $p_i=-\epsilon/2$, in the internal spaces and to the number of the external dimensions $d_0=3$. The investigation of multidimensional static spherically symmetric perfect fluid with dust-like equation of state in the external space confirms the above results.
