Title: Inflation and New Agegraphic Dark Energy
Authors: Cheng-Yi Sun and Rui-Hong Yue
Abstract: In the note, we extend the discussion of the new agegraphic dark energy (NADE) model to include the inflation stage. Usually, in the inflation models, for convenience the conformal time $\eta$ is set to be zero at the end of inflation. This is incompatible with the NADE model since $\eta=0$ indicates the divergence of NADE. To avoid the difficulty, we can redefine the conformal time as $\eta+\delta$. However, we find that the positive constant $\delta$ must be so large that NADE can not become dominated at present time.
