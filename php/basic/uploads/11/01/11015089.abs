Title: Charge Fluctuations in Soliton Anti-Soliton Systems Without Conjugation  Symmetry
Authors: R. L. P. G. Amaral and V. E. R. Lemes and O. S. Ventura
Abstract: We construct the charge operator and discuss the limits of their eigenvalues as the separation between background soliton and anti-solitons goes to infinity and analyze the fluctuations of the charge. This is performed in a (1+1)D model with charge conjugation breaking.
