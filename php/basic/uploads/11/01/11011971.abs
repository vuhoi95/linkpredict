Title: Critical Gravity in Four Dimensions
Authors: H. Lu and C. N. Pope
Abstract: We study four-dimensional gravity theories that are rendered renormalisable by the inclusion of curvature-squared terms to the usual Einstein action with cosmological constant. By choosing the parameters appropriately, the massive scalar mode can be eliminated and the massive spin-2 mode can become massless. This "critical" theory may be viewed as a four-dimensional analogue of chiral topologically massive gravity, or of critical "New Massive Gravity" with a cosmological constant, in three dimensions. We find that the on-shell energy for the remaining massless gravitons vanishes. There are also logarithmic spin-2 modes, which have positive energy. The mass and entropy of standard Schwarzschild type black holes vanish. The critical theory might provide a consistent toy model for quantum gravity in four dimensions.
