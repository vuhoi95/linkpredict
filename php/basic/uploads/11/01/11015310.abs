Title: Finite oscillator models: the Hahn oscillator
Authors: E. I. Jafarov and N. I. Stoilova and J. Van der Jeugt
Abstract: A new model for the finite one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is proposed based upon the algebra u(2)_{\alpha}. This algebra is a deformation of the Lie algebra u(2) extended by a parity operator, with deformation parameter {\alpha}. A class of irreducible unitary representations of u(2)_{\alpha} is constructed. In the finite oscillator model, the (discrete) spectrum of the position operator is determined, and the position wave functions are shown to be dual Hahn polynomials. Plots of these discrete wave functions display interesting properties, similar to those of the parabose oscillator. We show indeed that in the limit, when the dimension of the representations goes to infinity, the discrete wave functions tend to the continuous wave functions of the parabose oscillator.
