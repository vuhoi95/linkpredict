Title: General holographic superconductor models with backreactions
Authors: Qiyuan Pan and Bin Wang
Abstract: We study general models of holographic superconductors away from the probe limit. We find that the backreaction of the spacetime can bring richer physics in the phase transition. Moreover we observe that the ratio $\omega_g/T_c$ changes with the strength of the backreaction and is not a universal constant.
