Title: Super Landau-Ginzburg mirrors and algebraic cycles
Authors: Richard S. Garavuso and Ludmil Katzarkov and Maximilian Kreuzer and Alexander Noll
Abstract: We investigate the super Landau-Ginzburg mirrors of gauged linear sigma models which, in an appropriate low energy limit, reduce to nonlinear sigma models with Kaehler supermanifold target spaces of nonnegative super-first Chern class.
