Title: On W-algebra extensions of (2,p) minimal models: p > 3
Authors: Drazen Adamovic and Antun Milas
Abstract: This is a continuation of arXiv:0908.4053, where, among other things, we classified irreducible representations of the triplet vertex algebra W_{2,3}. In this part we extend the classification to W_{2,p}, for all odd p>3. We also determine the structure of the center of the Zhu algebra A(W_{2,p}) which implies the existence of a family of logarithmic modules having L(0)-nilpotent ranks 2 and 3. A logarithmic version of Macdonald-Morris constant term identity plays a key role in the paper.
