Abstract: With the help of the F-basis provided by the Drinfeld twist or factorizing F-matrix of the eight-vertex solid-on-solid (SOS) model, we obtain the determinant representations of the scalar products of Bethe states for the open XYZ chain with non-diagonal boundary terms. By taking the on shell limit, we obtain the determinant representations (or Gaudin formula) of the norms of the Bethe states.
