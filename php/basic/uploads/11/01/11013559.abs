Title: On the Black-Hole/Qubit Correspondence
Authors: L. Borsten and M. J. Duff and A. Marrani and W. Rubens
Abstract: The entanglement classification of four qubits is related to the extremal black holes of the 4-dimensional STU model via a time-like reduction to three dimensions. This correspondence is generalised to the entanglement classification of a very special four-way entanglement of eight qubits and the black holes of the maximally supersymmetric N = 8 and exceptional magic N = 2 supergravity theories.
