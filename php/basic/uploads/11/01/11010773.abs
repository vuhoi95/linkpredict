Title: Factorization Method in Curvilinear Coordinates and Pairing of Levels  for Matrix Potentials
Authors: A. A. Andrianov and M. V. Ioffe and Tsu Zhun-Pin
Abstract: Multidimensional factorization method is formulated in arbitrary curvilinear coordinates. Particular cases of polar and spherical coordinates are considered and matrix potentials with separating variables are constructed. A new class of matrix potentials is obtained which reveals a double degeneracy or equidistant splitting of energy levels (hidden symmetry).
