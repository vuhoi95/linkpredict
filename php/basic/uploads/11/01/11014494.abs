Title: Geometrothermodynamics in Horava-Lifshitz gravity
Authors: Hernando Quevedo and Alberto Sanchez and Safia Taj and Alejandro Vazquez
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic geometries of the most general static, spherically symmetric, topological black holes of the Ho\v{r}ava--Lifshitz gravity. In particular, we show that a Legendre invariant metric derived in the context of geometrothermodynamics for the equilibrium manifold reproduces correctly the phase transition structure of these black holes. Moreover, the limiting cases in which the mass, the entropy or the Hawking temperature vanish are also accompanied by curvature singularities which indicate the limit of applicability of the thermodynamics and the geometrothermodynamics of black holes. The Einstein limit and the case of a black hole with flat horizon are also investigated.
