Title: Testing extra dimensions with boundaries using Newton's law  modifications
Authors: V. K. Oikonomou and K. Kleidis
Abstract: Extra dimensions with boundaries are often used in the literature, to provide phenomenological models that mimic the standard model. In this context, we explore possible modifications to Newton's law due to the existence of an extra-dimensional space, at the boundary of which the gravitational field obeys Dirichlet, Neumann or mixed boundary conditions. We focus on two types of extra space, namely, the disk and the interval. As we prove, in order to have a consistent Newton's law modification (i.e., of the Yukawa-type), some of the extra-dimensional spaces that have been used in the literature, must be ruled out.
