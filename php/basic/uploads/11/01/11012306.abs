Title: Exact beta-functions in softly-broken N=2 Chern-Simons matter theories
Authors: I. Jack and C. Luckhurst
Abstract: We present exact results for the beta-functions for the soft-breaking parameters in softly-broken N=2 Chern-Simons matter theories in terms of the anomalous dimension in the unbroken theory. We check our results explicitly up to the two loop level.
