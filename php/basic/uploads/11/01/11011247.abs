Title: IIB black hole horizons with five-form flux and KT geometry
Authors: U. Gran and J. Gutowski and G. Papadopoulos
Abstract: We investigate the near horizon geometry of IIB supergravity black holes with non-vanishing 5-form flux preserving at least two supersymmetries. We demonstrate that there are three classes of solutions distinguished by the choice of Killing spinors. We find that the spatial horizon sections of the class of solutions with an SU(4) invariant pure Killing spinor are hermitian manifolds and admit a hidden Kahler with torsion (KT) geometry compatible with the SU(4) structure. Moreover the Bianchi identity of the 5-form, which also implies the field equations, can be expressed in terms of the torsion H as d(\omega\wedge H)=\partial\bar\partial \omega^2=0, where omega is a Hermitian form. We give several examples of near horizon geometries which include group manifolds, group fibrations over KT manifolds and uplifted geometries of lower dimensional black holes. Furthermore, we show that the class of solutions associated with a Spin(7) invariant spinor is locally a product R^{1,1} x S, where S is a holonomy Spin(7) manifold.
