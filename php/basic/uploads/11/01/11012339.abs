Title: Galilean Conformal Algebra in Semi-Infinite Space
Authors: M. R. Setare and V. Kamali
Abstract: In the present work we considered Galilean conformal algebras (GCA), which arises as a contraction relativistic conformal algebras ($x_i\rightarrow \epsilon x_i$, $t\rightarrow t$, $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$). We can use the Galilean conformal symmetry to constrain two-point and three-point functions. Correlation functions in space-time without boundary condition were found in \cite{1}. In real situations there are boundary conditions in space-time, so we have calculated correlation functions for Galilean confrormal invariant fields in semi-infinite space with boundary condition in $r=0$. We have calculated two-point and three-point functions with boundary condition in fixed time.
