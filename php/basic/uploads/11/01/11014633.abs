Title: Higgs Portal to Visible Supersymmetry Breaking
Authors: K. -I. Izawa and Yuichiro Nakai and Takashi Shimomura
Abstract: We propose a supersymmetric extension of the standard model whose Higgs sector induces a spontaneous supersymmetry breaking by itself. Unlike the minimal extension, the current Higgs mass bound can be evaded even at the tree-level without the help of the soft breaking terms due to the usual hidden sector, as is reminiscent of the next to minimal case. We also have a possibly light pseudo-goldstino in our visible sector in addition to extra Higgs particles, both of which stem from supersymmetry breaking dynamics. In such a setup of visible supersymmetry breaking, we may see a part of supersymmetry breaking dynamics rather directly in future experiments.
