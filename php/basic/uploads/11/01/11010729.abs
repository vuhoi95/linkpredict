Abstract: We study the two particular models of g-essence with Yukawa type interactions between a scalar field $\phi$ and a classical Dirac field $\psi$. For the homogeneous, isotropic and flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe filled with the such g-essence, some exact solutions of these models are found. Moreover, we reconstruct the corresponding scalar and fermionic potentials.
