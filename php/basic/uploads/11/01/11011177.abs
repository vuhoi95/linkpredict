Title: Non-minimally Coupled Gravitational and Electromagnetic Fields: pp-Wave  Solutions
Authors: T. Dereli and O. Sert
Abstract: We give the Lagrangian formulation of a generic non-minimally extended Einstein-Maxwell theory with an action that is linear in the curvature and quadratic in the electromagnetic field. We derive the coupled field equations by a first order variational principle using the method of Lagrange multipliers. We look for solutions describing plane-fronted Einstein-Maxwell waves with parallel rays. We give a family of exact solutions associated with a partially massless spin-2 photon and a partially massive spin-2 graviton.
