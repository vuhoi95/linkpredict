Title: One-loop divergences for gravity non-minimally coupled to a multiplet of  scalar fields: calculation in the Jordan frame. I. The main results
Authors: Christian F. Steinwachs and Alexander Yu. Kamenshchik
Abstract: Using the generalized Schwinger-DeWitt technique, we calculate the divergent part of the one-loop effective action for gravity non-minimally coupled to a multiplet of scalar fields. All the calculations are consistently done in the Jordan frame.
