Title: Off-shell supergravity-matter couplings in three dimensions
Authors: Sergei M. Kuzenko and Ulf Lindstrom and Gabriele Tartaglino-Mazzucchelli
Abstract: We develop the superspace geometry of N-extended conformal supergravity in three space-time dimensions. General off-shell supergravity-matter couplings are constructed in the cases N=1,2,3,4.
