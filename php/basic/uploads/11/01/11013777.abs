Title: Peculiarities of String Theory on AdS(4) x CP(3)
Authors: Dmitri Sorokin and Linus Wulff
Abstract: We review peculiar features of type IIA string theory compactified on AdS(4) x CP(3) superspace, in particular, the structure of the Green-Schwarz action, issues with fixing its kappa-symmetry, classical integrability and the string instanton on CP(3)
