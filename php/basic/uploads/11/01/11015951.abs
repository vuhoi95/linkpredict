Title: Kink-antikink collisions in the phi^6 model
Authors: Patrick Dorey and Kieran Mersh and Tomasz Romanczukiewicz and Yasha Shnir
Abstract: We study kink-antikink collisions in the one-dimensional non-integrable scalar phi^6 model. Although the single-kink solutions for this model do not possess an internal vibrational mode, our simulations reveal a resonant scattering structure, thereby providing a counterexample to the standard belief that existence of such a mode is a necessary condition for multi-bounce resonances in general kink-antikink collisions. We investigate the two-bounce windows in detail, and present evidence that this structure is caused by existence of bound states in the spectrum of small oscillations about a combined kink-antikink configuration.
