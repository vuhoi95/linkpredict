Title: On Holographic Realization of Logarithmic GCA
Authors: Ali Hosseiny and Ali Naseh
Abstract: We study 2-dimensional Logarithmic Galilean Conformal Algebra (LGCA) by making use of a contraction of Topologically Massive Gravity at critical point. We observe that using a naive contraction at the critical point fails to give a well defined theory, though contracting the theory while we are approaching the critical point leads to a well behaved expressions for two point functions of the energy-momentum tensors of LGCA.
