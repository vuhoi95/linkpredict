Title: The universe formation by a space reduction cascade with random initial  parameters
Authors: S. G. Rubin and A. S. Zinger
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the creation of our universe using the idea of extra dimensions. The initial, multidimensional Lagrangian contains only metric tensor. We have found many sets of the numerical values of the Lagrangian parameters corresponding to the observed low-energy physics of our universe. Different initial parameters can lead to the same values of fundamental constants by the appropriate choice of a dimensional reduction cascade. This result diminishes the significance of the search for the 'unique' initial Lagrangian. We also have obtained a large number of low-energy vacua, which is known as a 'landscape' in the string theory.
