Title: An Ignoble Approach to Large Field Inflation
Authors: Nemanja Kaloper and Albion Lawrence and Lorenzo Sorbo
Abstract: We study an inflationary model developed by Kaloper and Sorbo, in which the inflaton is an axion with a sub-Planckian decay constant, whose potential is generated by mixing with a topological 4-form field strength. This gives a 4d construction of "axion monodromy inflation": the axion winds many times over the course of inflation and draws energy from the 4-form. The classical theory is equivalent to chaotic inflation with a quadratic inflaton potential. Such models can produce "high scale" inflation driven by energy densities of the order of $(10^{16}\ GeV)^4$, which produces primordial gravitational waves potentially accessible to CMB polarization experiments. We analyze the possible corrections to this scenario from the standpoint of 4d effective field theory, identifying the physics which potentially suppresses dangerous corrections to the slow-roll potential. This yields a constraint relation between the axion decay constant, the inflaton mass, and the 4-form charge. We show how these models can evade the fundamental constraints which typically make high-scale inflation difficult to realize. Specifically, the moduli coupling to the axion-four-form sector must have masses higher than the inflationary Hubble scale ($\la\ 10^{14}\ GeV$). There are also constraints from states that become light due to multiple windings of the axion, as happens in explicit string theory constructions of this scenario. Further, such models generally have a quantum-mechanical "tunneling mode" in which the axion jumps between windings, which must be suppressed. Finally, we outline possible observational signatures.
