Title: Asymptotic freedom of Yang-Mills theory with gravity
Authors: Sarah Folkerts and Daniel F. Litim and Jan M. Pawlowski
Abstract: We study the behaviour of Yang-Mills theory under the inclusion of gravity. In the weak- gravity limit, the running gauge coupling receives no contribution from the gravitational sector, if all symmetries are preserved. This holds true with and without cosmological constant. We also show that asymptotic freedom persists in general field-theory-based gravity scenarios including gravitational shielding as well as asymptotically safe gravity.
