Title: Dirac quantization of noncommutative Abelian Proca field
Authors: F. Darabi and F. Naderi
Abstract: Dirac formalism of Hamiltonian constraint systems is studied for the noncommutative Abelian Proca field. It is shown that the system of constraints are of second class in agreement with the fact that the Proca field is not guage invariant. Then, the system of second class constraints is quantized by introducing Dirac brackets in the reduced phase space.
