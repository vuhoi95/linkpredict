Title: Thermodynamic Origin of the Cardassian Universe
Authors: Chao-Jun Feng and Xin-Zhou Li and Xian-Yong Shen
Abstract: In the Cadassian universe, one can explain the acceleration of the universe without introducing dark energy component. However, the dynamical equations of this model can not be directly obtained from the action principle. Recently, works on the relation between thermodynamics and gravity indicates that gravity force may not be the fundamental force. In this paper, we study the thermodynamics of the Cardassian universe, and regard it as the origin of this cosmological model. We find that the corresponding entropy obeys ordinary area law when the area of the trapping horizon is small, while it becomes a constant when area is going to be large in the original and modified polytropic Cardassian model, and it has a maximum value in the exponential one. It seems that the Cardassian universe only contains finite information according to the holographic principle, which states that all the information in the bulk should be encoded in the boundary of the bulk.
