Title: Modified Gravity Tomography
Authors: Philippe Brax and Anne-Christine Davis and Baojiu Li
Abstract: We consider the effect of a scalar field degree of freedom on the dynamics of gravity from small to large scales. We show that the effects of modified gravity can be completely captured by the time variations of the scalar field mass and its coupling to matter. This leads to a parameterisation of modified gravity where local constraints are easy to analyse and large scale scale structure effects apparent.
