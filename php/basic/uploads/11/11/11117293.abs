Title: N=1 Supersymmetric Double Field Theory
Authors: Olaf Hohm and Seung Ki Kwak
Abstract: We construct the N=1 supersymmetric extension of double field theory for D=10, including the coupling to an arbitrary number n of abelian vector multiplets. This theory features a local O(1,9+n) x O(1,9) tangent space symmetry under which the fermions transform. It is shown that the supersymmetry transformations close into the generalized diffeomorphisms of double field theory.
