Title: Production of a KK-graviton and a Vector Boson in ADD Model via Gluon  fusion
Authors: Ambresh Shivaji and V. Ravindran and Pankaj Agrawal
Abstract: In the models with large extra-dimensions, we examine the production of a vector boson (\gamma / Z) in association with the Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes of the graviton via gluon fusion. At the leading order, the process takes place through quark-loop box and triangle diagrams and it is ultraviolate finite. We report the results for the LHC. We also discuss the issues of anomaly and decoupling of heavy quarks in the amplitude.
