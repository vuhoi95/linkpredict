Title: Nambu-Goldstone dynamics and generalized coherent-state functional  integrals
Authors: Massimo Blasone and Petr Jizba
Abstract: The present paper gives a new method of attack on the Nambu-Goldstone dynamics in spontaneously broken theories. Since the target space of the Nambu-Goldstone fields is a group coset space, their effective quantum dynamics can be naturally phrased in terms of generalized coherent-state functional integrals. As an explicit example of this line of reasoning we construct a low-energy effective Lagrangian for the Heisenberg ferromagnet in broken phase. The leading field configuration in the WKB approximation leads to the Landau-Lifshitz equation for quantum ferromagnet. The corresponding linearized equations allow to identify the Nambu-Goldstone boson with ferromagnetic magnon.
