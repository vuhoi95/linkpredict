Title: Classical and quantum free motions in the tomographic probability  representation
Authors: Vladimir I. Man'ko and Franco Ventriglia
Abstract: Based on a geometric picture, the example of free particle motion for both classical and quantum domains is considered in the tomographic probability representation. Wave functions and density operators as well as optical and symplectic tomograms are obtained as solutions of kinetic classical and quantum equations for the state tomograms. The difference of tomograms of free particle for classical and quantum states is discussed.
