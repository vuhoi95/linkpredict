Title: f(R) Gravities, Killing Spinor Equations, "BPS" Domain Walls and  Cosmology
Authors: Haishan Liu and H. Lu and Zhao-Long Wang
Abstract: We derive the condition on f(R) gravities that admit Killing spinor equations and construct explicit such examples. The Killing spinor equations can be used to reduce the fourth-order differential equations of motion to the first order for both the domain wall and FLRW cosmological solutions. We obtain exact "BPS" domain walls that describe the smooth Randall-Sundrum II, AdS wormholes and the RG flow from IR to UV. We also obtain exact smooth cosmological solutions that describe the evolution from an inflationary starting point with a larger cosmological constant to an ever-expanding universe with a smaller cosmological constant. In addition, We find exact smooth solutions of pre-big bang models, bouncing or crunching universes. An important feature is that the scalar curvature R of all these metrics is varying rather than a constant. Another intriguing feature is that there are two different f(R) gravities that give rise to the same "BPS" solution. We also study linearized f(R) gravities in (A)dS vacua.
