Title: Conformal Smectics and their Many Metrics
Authors: Gareth P. Alexander and Randall D. Kamien and Ricardo A. Mosna
Abstract: We establish that equally-spaced smectic configurations enjoy an infinite-dimensional conformal symmetry and show that there is a natural map between them and null hypersurfaces in maximally-symmetric spacetimes. By choosing the appropriate conformal factor it is possible to restore additional symmetries of focal structures only found before for smectics on flat substrates.
