Title: BCJ and KK Relations from BRST Symmetry and Supergravity Amplitudes
Authors: P. A. Grassi and A. Mezzalira and L. Sommovigo
Abstract: We use Pure Spinor string theory to construct suitable kinematical factors which explicitly satisfy the Kleiss-Kuijf (KK) relations. Using the formula conceived by Bern et al. and employed by us for 4- and 5-point amplitudes in a previous work, we are able to compute the 6-point supergravity amplitude from the corresponding SYM building blocks given by Mafra et al.. We derive the KK and Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) identities from the BRST invariance and we discuss the relations between Bern et al. building blocks and those of Mafra et al..
