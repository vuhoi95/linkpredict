Title: Quantum Field Theory in Graphene
Authors: I. V. Fialkovsky and D. V. Vassilevich
Abstract: This is a short non-technical introduction to applications of the Quantum Field Theory methods to graphene. We derive the Dirac model from the tight binding model and describe calculations of the polarization operator (conductivity). Later on, we use this quantity to describe the Quantum Hall Effect, light absorption by graphene, the Faraday effect, and the Casimir interaction.
