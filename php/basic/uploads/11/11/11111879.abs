Title: Discretisations, Constraints and Diffeomorphisms in Quantum Gravity
Authors: Benjamin Bahr and Rodolfo Gambini and Jorge Pullin
Abstract: In this review we discuss the interplay between discretization, constraint implementation, and diffeomorphism symmetry in Loop Quantum Gravity and Spin Foam models. To this end we review the Consistent Discretizations approach, which is an application of the master constraint program to construct the physical Hilbert space of the canonical theory, as well as the Perfect Actions approach, which aims at finding a path integral measure with the correct symmetry behavior under diffeomorphisms.
