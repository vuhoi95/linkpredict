Title: Synchrotron radiation in a chromo-magnetic field
Authors: Alaa Dbeyssi and Dima Al Dirani and H. Zaraket
Abstract: We study the generalization of QED synchrotron radiation to the QCD case with a chromomagnetic field using the Schwinger {\it et al} source method. It is shown that the QED case can be obtained as a special limit. The comparison with the path integral approach of Zakharov has shown consistent results.
