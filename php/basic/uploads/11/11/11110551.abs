Title: The generalized Kaehler geometry of N=(2,2) WZW-models
Authors: Alexander Sevrin and Wieland Staessens and Dimitri Terryn
Abstract: N=(2,2), d=2 supersymmetric non-linear sigma-models provide a physical realization of Hitchin's and Gualtieri's generalized Kaehler geometry. A large subclass of such models are comprised by WZW-models on even-dimensional reductive group manifolds. In the present paper we analyze the complex structures, type changing, the superfield content and the affine isometries compatible with the extra supersymmetry. The results are illustrated by an exhaustive discussion of the N=(2,2) WZW-models on S3xS1 and S3xS3 where various aspects of generalized Kaehler and Calabi-Yau geometry are verified and clarified. The examples illustrate a slightly weaker definition for an N=(2,2) superconformal generalized Kaehler geometry compared to that for a generalized Calabi-Yau geometry.
