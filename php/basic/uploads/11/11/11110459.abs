Title: Duality Invariant Actions and Generalised Geometry
Authors: David S. Berman and Hadi Godazgar and Malcolm J. Perry and Peter West
Abstract: We construct the non-linear realisation of the semi-direct product of E(11) and its first fundamental representation at lowest order and appropriate to spacetime dimensions four to seven. This leads to a non-linear realisation of the duality groups and introduces fields that depend on a generalised space which possess a generalised vielbein. We focus on the part of the generalised space on which the duality groups alone act and construct an invariant action.
