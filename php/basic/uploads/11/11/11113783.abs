Title: Holographic non-relativistic fermionic fixed point by the charged  dilatonic black hole
Authors: Wei-Jia Li and Rene Meyer and Hongbao Zhang
Abstract: Driven by the landscape of garden-variety condensed matter systems, we have investigated how the dual spectral function behaves at the non-relativistic as well as relativistic fermionic fixed point by considering the probe Dirac fermion in an extremal charged dilatonic black hole with zero entropy. Although the pattern for both of the appearance of flat band and emergence of Fermi surface is qualitatively similar to that given by the probe fermion in the extremal Reissner-Nordstrom AdS black hole, we find a distinctly different low energy behavior around the Fermi surface, which can be traced back to the different near horizon geometry. In particular, with the peculiar near horizon geometry of our extremal charged dilatonic black hole, the low energy behavior exhibits the universal linear dispersion relation and scaling property, where the former indicates that the dual liquid is a Fermi one while the latter implies that the dual liquid is not exactly of Landau Fermi type.
