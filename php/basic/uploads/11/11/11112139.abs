Title: Higher spin AdS_3 supergravity and its dual CFT
Authors: Thomas Creutzig and Yasuaki Hikida and Peter B. Ronne
Abstract: Vasiliev's higher spin supergravity theory on three dimensional anti-de Sitter space is studied and, in particular, the partition function is computed at one loop level. The dual conformal field theory is proposed to be the N=(2,2) CP^N Kazama-Suzuki model in two dimensions. The proposal is based on symmetry considerations and comparison of the bulk partition function with the conformal field theory. Our findings suggest that the theory is strong-weak self-dual.
