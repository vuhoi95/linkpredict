Title: Effects of deformed phase space on scalar field cosmology
Authors: S. Pérez-Payán and M. Sabido and C. Yee
Abstract: The effects of phase space deformations in standard scalar field cosmology are studied. The deformation is introduced by modifying the symplectic structure of the minisuperspace variables to have a deformed Poisson algebra among the coordinates and the canonical momenta. It is found that in the deformed minisuperspace model the volume of the universe is non singular. Finally, the late time evolution gives rise to an accelerating scale factor, this acceleration is a consequence of the noncommutative deformation.
