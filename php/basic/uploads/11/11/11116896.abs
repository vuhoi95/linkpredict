Title: Bicategories in field theories - an invitation
Authors: Thomas Nikolaus and Christoph Schweigert
Abstract: We explain some applications of bicategories in both classical and quantum field theory. This includes a modern perspective on some pioneering work of Max Kreuzer and Bert Schellekens on rational conformal field theory.
