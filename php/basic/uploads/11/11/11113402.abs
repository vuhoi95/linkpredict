Title: New N=1 Superconformal Field Theories In Four Dimensions
Authors: Ibrahima Bah and Brian Wecht
Abstract: We construct a large new family of four-dimensional N=1 superconformal field theories by coupling Gaiotto's T_N theories to N=1 vector multiplets. In particular, we consider theories in which various T_N blocks are linked together via bifundamental and adjoint chiral superfields, with no superpotential. We find that while some of these constructions appear to give new strongly coupled SCFTs, others lead to violations of the a-theorem, and thus do not appear to be good interacting theories.
