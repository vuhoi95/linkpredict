Title: The disorder parameter of dual superconductivity in QCD revisited
Authors: Claudio Bonati and Guido Cossu and Massimo D'Elia and Adriano Di Giacomo
Abstract: We discover the origin of the pathologies of the disorder parameter used in previous papers to detect dual superconductivity of QCD vacuum, and we remove them by defining an improved disorder parameter. A check of the approach is made by numerical simulations of SU(2) gauge theory, which demonstrate that the approach is consistent and with it that deconfinement is a transition from dual superconductor to normal.
