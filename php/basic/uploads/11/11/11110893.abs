Title: 2PI Effective Action and Evolution Equations of N = 4 super Yang-Mills
Authors: Jelena Smolic and Milena Smolic
Abstract: We employ nPI effective action techniques to study N = 4 super Yang-Mills, and write down the 2PI effective action of the theory. We also supply the evolution equations of two-point correlators within the theory.
