Title: Moduli space volume of vortex and localization
Authors: Akiko Miyake and Kazutoshi Ohta and Norisuke Sakai
Abstract: Volume of moduli space of BPS vortices on a compact genus h Riemann surface Sigma_h is evaluated by means of topological field theory and localization technique. Vortex in Abelian gauge theory with a single charged scalar field (ANO vortex) is studied first and is found that the volume of the moduli space agrees with the previous results obtained more directly by integrating over the moduli space metric. Next we extend the evaluation to non-Abelian gauge groups and multi-flavors of scalar fields in the fundamental representation. We find that the result of localization can be consistently understood in terms of moduli matrix formalism wherever possible. More details are found in our paper in Prog.Theor.Phys.126 (2011) 637.
