Title: Dynamical CP violation at finite temperature
Authors: Wang Dianfu and Sun Xiaoyu and Liang Chao
Abstract: Based on the generalized Yang-Mills model, CP violation behavior at finite temperature is investigated, and it is shown that dynamical CP violation of the generalized Yang-Mills model at zero temperature can be restored at finite temperature.
