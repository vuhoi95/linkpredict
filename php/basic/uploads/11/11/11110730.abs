Title: Accelerating BTZ spacetime
Authors: Wei Xu and Kun Meng and Liu Zhao
Abstract: An exact solution of $(2+1)$-dimensional Einstein gravity with cosmological constant is studied. The corresponding spacetime is interpreted as an accelerating BTZ spacetime. The proper acceleration, horizon structure, temperature and entropy are presented in detail. The metric being studied is very similar to the one studied by Astorino in arXiv:1101.2616, but the range of parameters is different which results in significant changes in the causal structures.
