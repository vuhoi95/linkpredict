Title: The transient acceleration from time-dependent interacting dark energy  models
Authors: Xi-ming Chen and Yungui Gong and Emmanuel N. Saridakis
Abstract: The transient acceleration which the current cosmic acceleration is not eternal is possible by introducing the interaction between dark matter and dark energy. If the energy transfer is from dark energy to dark matter, then it is possible to realize the transient acceleration. We study the possibility of transient acceleration by considering two time-dependent phenomenological interaction forms so that the energy transfer increases as the universe evolves. Starting from a simple and extending to a more complicated ansatz, we obtain analytical expressions for the evolutions of the deceleration and the various energy density parameters. We find the ranges of the parameters in the models for a transient acceleration.
