Title: Hawking Radiation and Tunneling Mechanism for a New Class of Black Holes  in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity
Authors: Kenji Muneyuki and Nobuyoshi Ohta
Abstract: We study the Hawking radiation in a new class of black hole solutions in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory. The black hole has been argued to have vanishing mass and entropy, but finite Hawking temperature. To check if it really emits radiation, we analyse the Hawking radiation using the original method of quantization of scalar field in the black hole background and the quantum tunneling method, and confirm that it emits radiation at the Hawking temperature. A general formula is derived for the Hawking temperature and backreaction in the tunneling approach. Physical implications of these results are discussed.
