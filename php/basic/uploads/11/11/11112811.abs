Title: Real-space entanglement spectrum of quantum Hall systems
Authors: J. Dubail and N. Read and E. H. Rezayi
Abstract: We study the real-space entanglement spectrum for fractional quantum Hall systems, which maintains locality along the spatial cut, and provide evidence that it possesses a scaling property. We also consider the closely-related particle entanglement spectrum, and carry out the Schmidt decomposition of the Laughlin state analytically at large size.
