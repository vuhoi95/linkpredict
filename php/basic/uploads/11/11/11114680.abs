Title: Susceptibility amplitude ratio for generic competing systems
Authors: C. F. Farias and Marcelo M. Leite
Abstract: We calculate the susceptibility amplitude ratio near a generic higher character Lifshitz point up to one-loop order. We employ a renormalization group treatment with $L$ independent scaling transformations associated to the various inequivalent subspaces in the anisotropic case in order to compute the ratio above and below the critical temperature and demonstrate its universality. Furthermore, the isotropic results with only one type of competition axes have also been shown to be universal. We describe how the simpler situations of $m$-axial Lifshitz points as well as ordinary (noncompeting) systems can be retrieved from the present framework.
