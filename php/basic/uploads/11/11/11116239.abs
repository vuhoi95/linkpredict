Title: Quantum tunneling from scalar fields in rotating black strings
Authors: H. Gohar and K. Saifullah
Abstract: Using the Hamilton-Jacobi method of quantum tunneling and complex path integration, we study Hawking radiation of scalar particles from rotating black strings. We discuss tunneling of both charged and uncharged scalar particles from the event horizons. For this purpose, we use the Klein-Gordon equation and find the tunneling probability of outging scalar particles. The procedure gives Hawking temperature for rotating charged black strings as well.
