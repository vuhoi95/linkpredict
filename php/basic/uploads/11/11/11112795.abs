Title: Quantum Mechanics of the Interior of Radiating 2-D Black Holes
Authors: Jack Gegenberg and Gabor Kunstatter and Timothy Taves
Abstract: We study the homogeneous sector of the RST model describing the gravitational dynamics, including back-reaction, of radiating 2-d black holes. We find the exact solutions both in conformal gauge and in time-parametrized form, isolate the black hole sector of the classical phase space and quantize the near singularity dynamics in conformal gauge. We show that different choices of measure and different self-adjoint extensions can lead to inequivalent quantum theories, all of which resolve the singularity. For a specific range of extension parameters, the Hamiltonian spectrum admits bound states that correspond physically to stable remnants. Finally, we argue that our work provides a good starting point for quantization of the full homogeneous theory using both reduced and Dirac quantization.
