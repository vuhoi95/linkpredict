Title: The Schwinger Model in Point Form
Authors: Daniel Kupelwieser and Wolfgang Schweiger and William H. Klink
Abstract: We attempt to solve the Schwinger model, i.e. massless QED in 1+1 dimensions, by quantizing it on a space-time hyperboloid x_\mu x^\mu =\tau^2. The Fock-space representation of the 2-momentum operator is derived and its algebraic structure is analyzed. We briefly outline a solution strategy.
