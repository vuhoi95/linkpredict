Title: Initial Systematic Investigations of the Landscape of Low Layer NAHE  Variation Extensions
Authors: Timothy Renner and Jared Greenwald and Douglas Moore and Gerald Cleaver
Abstract: The discovery that the number of physically consistent string vacua is on the order of 10^500 has prompted several statistical studies of string phenomenology. Contained here is one such study that focuses on the Weakly Coupled Free Fermionic String (WCFFHS) formalism. Presented here are systematic extensions of a variation on the NAHE (Nanopoulos, Antoniadis, Hagelin, Ellis) set of basis vectors. This variation is more conducive to the production of "mirrored" models, in which the observable and hidden sector particles are identical. This study is a parallel to the extensions of the NAHE set itself (referenced herein), and presents statistics related to similar model properties. Statistical coupling between specific gauge groups and ST SUSYs is also examined. Finally, a model with completely mirrored gauge groups is discussed.
