Title: Fermion mass hierarchy in a multiple warped braneworld model
Authors: R. S. Hundi and Soumitra SenGupta
Abstract: A geometric understanding of the origin of mass hierarchy among the standard model fermions have been addressed in a multiple warped spacetime. We show that the requirement of $10^{16}$ order warping between the Planck and the visible branes without creating any significant hierarchy among the moduli results into splitting of fermion masses in the standard model. Values of the various parameters of the extra dimensional model and the corresponding fermion masses are determined.
