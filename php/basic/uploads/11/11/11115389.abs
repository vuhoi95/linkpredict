Title: Stability of accelerating cosmology in two scalar-tensor theory: Little  Rip versus de Sitter
Authors: Yusaku Ito and Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: We develop the general reconstruction scheme in two scalar model. The quintom-like theory which may describe (different) non-singular Little Rip or de Sitter cosmology is reconstructed. (In)stability of such dark energy cosmologies as well as the flow to fixed points is studied. The stability of Little Rip universe which leads to dissolution of bound objects sometime in future indicates that no classical transition to de Sitter space occurs.
