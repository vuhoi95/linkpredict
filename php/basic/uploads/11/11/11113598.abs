Title: Supersymmetrization Schemes of D=4 Maxwell Algebra
Authors: Kiyoshi Kamimura and Jerzy Lukierski
Abstract: The Maxwell algebra, an enlargement of Poincare algebra by Abelian tensorial generators, can be obtained in arbitrary dimension D by the suitable contraction of O(D-1,1) \oplus O(D-1,2) (Lorentz algebra \oplus AdS algebra). We recall that in D=4 the Lorentz algebra O(3,1) is described by the realification Sp_R(2|C) of complex algebra Sp(2|C)\simeq Sl(2|C) and O(3,2)\simeq Sp(4). We study various D=4 N-extended Maxwell superalgebras obtained by the contractions of real superalgebras OSp_R(2N-k; 2|C)\oplus OSp(k;4), (k=1,2,...,2N) (extended Lorentz superalgebra \oplus extended AdS superalgebra). If N=1 (k=1,2) one arrives at two different versions of simple Maxwell superalgebra. For any fixed N we get 2N different superextensions of Maxwell algebra with n-extended Poincare superalgebras (1\leq n \leq N) and the internal symmetry sectors obtained by suitable contractions of the real algebra O_R(2N-k|C)\oplus O(k). Finally the comments on possible applications of Maxwell superalgebras are presented.
