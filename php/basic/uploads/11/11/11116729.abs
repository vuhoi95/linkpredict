Title: Perturbations around the AdS Born-Infeld black holes
Authors: Yunqi Liu and Bin Wang
Abstract: We study the quasinormal mode of the perturbation of the scalar field interacting with the electromagnetic field in the backgrounds of Schwarzschild AdS black hole, the Reissner-Nordstrom AdS black hole and the Born-Infeld AdS black hole. We disclose influence by the electric charge $Q$, the coupling between the scalar and electromagnetic field $q$ and the Born-Infeld parameter $b$ on the quasinormal frequencies of the scalar perturbation. We observe the possible growing mode in the perturbation when the scalar field strongly couples to the electromagnetic field. When the electromagnetic field becomes nonlinear described by the Born-Infeld electrodynamics, the nonlinearity described by the Born-Infeld parameter can hinder the growing mode to appear in the scalar perturbation. The quasinormal mode of the scalar field perturbation can help us further understand the physics in the holographic superconductor.
