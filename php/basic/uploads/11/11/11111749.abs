Title: An invitation to algebraic topological string theory
Authors: Nils Carqueville and Michael M. Kay
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to provide a short invitation to the universal algebraic approach to topological string theory. In the first section we make an attempt to explain the origin of this approach and how it fits into the bigger picture of full string theory, while in the second half of this note we will introduce the relevant notions in more detail and discuss some of our main results on bulk-deformed open topological string amplitudes.
