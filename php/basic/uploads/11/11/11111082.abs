Title: Towards a gravity dual of the unitary Fermi gas
Authors: Xavier Bekaert and Elisa Meunier and Sergej Moroz
Abstract: Inspired by the method of null dimensional reduction and by the holographic correspondence between Vasiliev's higher-spin gravity and the critical O(N) model, a bulk dual of the unitary and the ideal non-relativistic Fermi gases is proposed.
