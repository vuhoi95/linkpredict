Abstract: Using a correspondence between the f(T)-gravity with the power-law entropy corrected version of the holographic dark energy model, we reconstruct the holographic f(T)-gravity model with power-law entropy correction. We fit the model parameters by using the latest observational data including type Ia supernovea, baryon acoustic oscillation, cosmic microwave background, and Hubble parameter data. We also check the viability of our model using a cosmographic analysis approach. Using the best-fit values of the model, we obtain the evolutionary behaviors of the effective torsion equation of state parameter of the power-law entropy corrected holographic f(T)-gravity model as well as the deceleration parameter of the universe. We also investigate different energy conditions in our model. Furthermore, we examine the validity of the generalized second law of gravitational thermodynamics. Finally, we point out the growth rate of matter density perturbation in our model. We conclude that in power-law entropy corrected holographic f(T)-gravity model, the universe begins a matter dominated phase and approaches a de Sitter regime at late times, as expected. It also can justify the transition from the quintessence state to the phantom regime in the near past as indicated by recent observations. Moreover, this model is consistent with current data, passes the cosmographic test and fits the data of the growth factor well as the LCDM model.
