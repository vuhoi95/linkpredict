Title: Minimal length, maximal momentum and the entropic force law
Authors: Kourosh Nozari and Pouria Pedram and M. Molkara
Abstract: Different candidates of quantum gravity proposal such as string theory, noncommutative geometry, loop quantum gravity and doubly special relativity, all predict the existence of a minimum observable length and/or a maximal momentum which modify the standard Heisenberg uncertainty principle. In this paper, we study the effects of minimal length and maximal momentum on the entropic force law formulated recently by E. Verlinde.
