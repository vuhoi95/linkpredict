Title: On quantum L-operator for two-dimensional lattice Toda model
Authors: A. Bytsko and I. Davydenkova
Abstract: The two-dimensional quantum lattice Toda model for the affine and simple Lie algebras of the type A is considered. For its known L-operator a correction of the second order in the lattice parameter is found. It is proved that the equation determining a correction of the third order has no solutions.
