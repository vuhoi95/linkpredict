Title: Heavy quarks in a magnetic field
Authors: Elias Kiritsis and George Pavlopoulos
Abstract: The motion of a heavy charged quark in a magnetic field is analyzed in the vacuum of strongly coupled CFT. The motion of the quark is dissipative. It moves in spiral until it eventually comes to rest. The world-sheet geometry is locally AdS_2 but has a time dependent horizon. The string profile in the static gauge extends from the boundary till a point where an embedding singularity exists. Connections with other circular string motions are established.
