Title: On the perturbative generation of the higher-derivative Lorentz-breaking  terms
Authors: T. Mariz and J. R. Nascimento and A. Yu. Petrov
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the perturbative generation of the higher-derivative Lorentz-breaking terms for the gauge field, that is, the Myers-Pospelov term and the higher-derivative Carroll-Field-Jackiw term. These terms are explicitly calculated in the one-loop approximation and shown to be finite and ambiguous.
