Abstract: In this proceeding we review some of our recent results for the vector meson electromagnetic form factors and structure functions in the Sakai-Sugimoto model. The latter is a string model that describes many features of the non-perturbative regime of Quantum Chromodynamics in the large $N_c$ limit.
