Title: The Non-SUSY Baryonic Branch: Soft Supersymmetry Breaking of N=1 Gauge  Theories
Authors: Stephen Bennett and Elena Caceres and Carlos Nunez and Daniel Schofield and Steve Young
Abstract: We study a non-supersymmetric deformation of the field theory dual to the baryonic branch of Klebanov-Strassler. Using a combination of analytical (series expansions) and numerical methods we construct non-supersymmetric backgrounds that smoothly interpolate between the desired UV and IR behaviors. We calculate various observables of the field theory and propose a picture of soft breaking by gaugino masses that is consistent with the various calculations on the string side.
