Title: Corrections to the Cardy-Verlinde formula from the modified dispersion  relation in extra dimensions
Authors: A. S. Sefiedgar and H. R. Sepangi
Abstract: The modified dispersion relation as a common feature of all quantum gravity scenarios provides a perturbation framework upon which the black hole thermodynamics can be corrected. In this letter, we obtain the corrections to the $d$-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole thermodynamics by utilizing the extra dimensional form of the modified dispersion relation, leading to the modification of the Cardy-Verlinde formula. Furthermore, we show that the modified dispersion relation corrections to the Cardy-Verlinde formula can be taken into account by redefining the Virasoro operator and the central charge.
