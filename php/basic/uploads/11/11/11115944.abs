Title: Exact chiral invariance at finite density on the lattice
Authors: R. V. Gavai and Sayantan Sharma
Abstract: We propose a lattice action for the overlap Dirac matrix with nonzero chemical potential which is shown to preserve the chiral invariance on the lattice exactly. We further demonstrate it to arise from the Domain wall by letting the chemical potential count only the physically relevant wall modes.
