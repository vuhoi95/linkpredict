Title: Compelling evidence of renormalons in QCD from high order perturbative  expansions
Authors: Clemens Bauer and Gunnar S. Bali and Antonio Pineda
Abstract: We compute the static self-energy of SU(3) gauge theory in four spacetime dimensions to order \alpha^{20} in the strong coupling constant. We employ lattice regularization to enable a numerical simulation within the framework of stochastic perturbation theory. We find perfect agreement with the factorial growth of high order coefficients predicted by the conjectured renormalon picture based on the operator product expansion.
