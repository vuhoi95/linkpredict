Title: Effect of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle on Post-Inflation  Preheating
Authors: Wissam Chemissany and Saurya Das and Ahmed Farag Ali and Elias C. Vagenas
Abstract: We examine effects of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle, predicted by various theories of quantum gravity to replace the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle near the Planck scale, on post inflation preheating in cosmology, and show that it can predict either an increase or a decrease in parametric resonance and a corresponding change in particle production. Possible implications are considered.
