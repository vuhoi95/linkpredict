Title: A hidden BFKL / XXX s = -1/2 spin chain mapping
Authors: Alberto Romagnoni and Agustin Sabio Vera
Abstract: A new mapping between the BFKL equation and Beisert's representation of the XXX Heisenberg ferromagnet with spin s = - 1/2 is given. The action of the Hamiltonian operator of a spin chain with SL(2) invariance on a symmetric double copy of a harmonic oscillator excited state is shown to be identical to the action of the BFKL Hamiltonian on the gluon Green function for the azimuthal-angle averaged forward scattering case. A natural mapping between the gluon Green function, discretized in virtuality space, and the double harmonic oscillator excited state emerges.
