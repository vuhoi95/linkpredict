Title: Micro black holes in the laboratory
Authors: Marcus Bleicher and Piero Nicolini and Martin Sprenger and Elizabeth Winstanley
Abstract: The possibility of creating microscopic black holes is one of the most exciting predictions for the LHC, with potentially major consequences for our current understanding of physics. We briefly review the theoretical motivation for micro black hole production, and our understanding of their subsequent evolution. Recent work on modelling the radiation from quantum-gravity-corrected black holes is also discussed.
