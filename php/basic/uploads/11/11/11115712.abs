Title: Spectral-Function Sum Rules in Supersymmetry Breaking Models
Authors: Ryuichiro Kitano and Masafumi Kurachi and Mitsutoshi Nakamura and Naoto Yokoi
Abstract: The technique of Weinberg's spectral-function sum rule is a powerful tool for a study of models in which global symmetry is dynamically broken. It enables us to convert information on the short-distance behavior of a theory to relations among physical quantities which appear in the low-energy picture of the theory. We apply such technique to general supersymmetry breaking models to derive new sum rules.
