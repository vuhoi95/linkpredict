Title: Statistical interparticle potential on noncommutative space
Authors: Sunandan Gangopadhyay and Ram Narayan Deb and Frederik. G. Scholtz
Abstract: We compute the statistical potential between two particles in the coherent state formalism on the deformed configuration space. The result obtained by using the coherent states having a further degree of freedom (proposed in \cite{rohwer}) is compatible with Pauli's exclusion principle reassuring the fact that noncommutative quantum mechanics may in some way encode the notion of physical extent and structure.
