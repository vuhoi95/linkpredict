Title: Dressed Wilson loops as dual condensates in response to magnetic fields
Authors: Falk Bruckmann and Gergely Endrodi
Abstract: We introduce dressed Wilson loops as a novel confinement observable. It consists of closed planar loops of arbitrary geometry but fixed area and its expectation values decay with the latter. The construction of dressed Wilson loops is based on chiral condensates in response to magnetic (and electric) fields, thus linking different physical concepts. We present results for generalized condensates and dressed Wilson loops on dynamical lattice configurations and confirm the agreement with conventional Wilson loops in the limit of large probe mass. We comment on the renormalization of dressed Wilson loops.
