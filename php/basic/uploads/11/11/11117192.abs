Title: Gauge invariance in Loop Quantum Cosmology : Hamilton-Jacobi and  Mukhanov-Sasaki equations for scalar perturbations
Authors: Thomas Cailleteau and Aurelien Barrau
Abstract: Gauge invariance of scalar perturbations is studied together with the associated equations of motion. Extending methods developed in the framework of hamiltonian General Relativity, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is investigated into the details in Loop Quantum Cosmology. The gauge-invariant observables are built and their equations of motions are reviewed both in Hamiltonian and Lagrangian approaches. This method is applied to scalar perturbations with either holonomy or inverse-volume corrections.
