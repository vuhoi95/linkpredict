Title: Higher derivative type II string effective actions, automorphic forms  and E11
Authors: Finn Gubay and Peter West
Abstract: By dimensionally reducing the ten-dimensional higher derivative type IIA string theory effective action we place constraints on the automorphic forms that appear in the effective action in lower dimensions. We propose a number of properties of such automorphic forms and consider the prospects that E11 can play a role in the formulation of the higher derivative string theory effective action.
