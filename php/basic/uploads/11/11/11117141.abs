Title: Hamilton Approach to QCD in Coulomb Gauge: Finite Temperatures and  Chiral Symmetry Breaking
Authors: Hugo Reinhardt and Davide R. Campagnari and Jan Heffner and Markus Pak
Abstract: I will review results obtained recently within the Hamilton approach to QCD in Coulomb gauge. The focus will be on finite-temperature Yang--Mills theory and chiral symmetry breaking in QCD.
