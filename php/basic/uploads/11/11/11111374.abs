Title: Hydrodynamics of a 5D Einstein-dilaton black hole solution and the  corresponding BPS state
Authors: Song He and Ya-Peng Hu and Jian-Hui Zhang
Abstract: We apply the potential reconstruction approach to generate a series of asymptotically AdS (aAdS) black hole solutions, with a self-interacting bulk scalar field. Based on the method, we reproduce the pure AdS solution as a consistency check and we also generate a simple analytic 5D black hole solution. We then study various aspects of this solution, such as temperature, entropy density and conserved charges. Furthermore, we study the hydrodynamics of this black hole solution in the framework of fluid/gravity duality, e.g. the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density. In a degenerate case of the 5D black hole solution, we find that the c function decreases monotonically from UV to IR as expected. Finally, we investigate the stability of the degenerate solution by studying the bosonic functional energy of the gravity and the Witten-Nester energy $E_{WN}$. We confirm that the degenerate solution is a BPS domain wall solution. The corresponding superpotential and the solution of the killing spinor equation are found explicitly.
