Title: Stringy Instantons in SU(N) N=2 Non-Conformal Gauge Theories
Authors: Hossein Ghorbani and Daniele Musso
Abstract: In this paper we explicitly obtain the leading corrections to the SU(N) N=2 prepotential due to stringy instantons both in flat space-time and in the presence of a non-trivial graviphoton background field. We show that the stringy corrections to the prepotential are expressible in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials. For N>2 the theory is not conformal; we discuss the introduction of an explicit dependence on the string scale \alpha' in the low-energy effective action through the stringy non-perturbative sector.
