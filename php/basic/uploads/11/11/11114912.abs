Title: Gauge Fixing of Modified Cubic Open Superstring Field Theory
Authors: Maiko Kohriki and Taichiro Kugo and Hiroshi Kunitomo
Abstract: The gauge-fixing problem of modified cubic open superstring field theory is discussed in detail both for the Ramond and Neveu-Schwarz sectors in the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) framework. We prove for the first time that the same form of action as the classical gauge-invariant one with the ghost-number constraint on the string field relaxed gives the master action satisfying the BV master equation. This is achieved by identifying independent component fields based on the analysis of the kernel structure of the inverse picture changing operator. The explicit gauge-fixing conditions for the component fields are discussed. In a kind of $b_0=0$ gauge, we explicitly obtain the NS propagator which has poles at the zeros of the Virasoro operator $L_0$.
