Title: Identities in Nonlinear Realizations of Supersymmetry
Authors: Haishan Liu and Hui Luo and Mingxing Luo and Liucheng Wang
Abstract: In this paper, we emphasize that a UV SUSY-breaking theory can be realized either linearly or nonlinearly. Both realizations form the dual descriptions of the UV SUSY-breaking theory. Guided by this observation, we find subtle identities involving the Goldstino field and matter fields in the standard nonlinear realization from trivial ones in the linear realization. Rather complicated integrands in the standard nonlinear realization are identified as total-divergences. Especially, identities only involving the Goldstino field reveal the self-consistency of the Grassmann algebra. As an application of these identities, we prove that the nonlinear Kahler potential without or with gauge interactions is unique, if the corresponding linear one is fixed. Our identities pick out the total-divergence terms and guarantee this uniqueness.
