Title: N=4 Instanton Calculus in Omega and R-R Backgrounds
Authors: Katsushi Ito and Hiroaki Nakajima and Takuya Saka and Shin Sasaki
Abstract: We study the instanton calculus for N=4 super Yang-Mills theory in ten-dimensional Omega-background with the R-symmetry Wilson line gauge field. From the ADHM construction of instantons in the background, we obtain the deformed instanton effective action. For a certain case we get the effective action of N=2^* theory in the Omega-background. We also study the low-energy effective D(-1)-brane action for the D3/D(-1)-brane system in the R-R 3-form field strength backgrounds and find that the action agrees with the instanton effective action in the Omega-background.
