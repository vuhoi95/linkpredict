Title: On Deformed Phase Space and $Λ$
Authors: E. Mena and S. Pérez-Payán and M. Sabido
Abstract: In this letter we study the effects of a noncommutative in the phase space of an empty (4+1) Kaluza-Klein universe with cosmological constant. We analyze the effects of the noncommutative deformations on the cosmological constant. Finally we comment on the possibility that the origin of the cosmological constant in this model, is related to the noncommutativity between the 4 dimensional scale factor and the compact extra dimension.
