Title: From confinement to new states of dense QCD matter
Authors: Kurt Langfeld and Andreas Wipf
Abstract: Transitions between centre sectors are related to confinement in pure Yang-Mills theories. We study the impact of these transitions in QCD-like theories for which centre symmetry is explicitly broken by the presence of matter. For low temperatures, we provide numerical evidence that centre transitions do occur with matter merely providing a bias towards the trivial centre sector until centre symmetry is spontaneously broken at high temperatures. The phenomenological consequences of these transitions for dense hadron matter are illustrated in an SU(3) effective quark theory: centre dressed quarks undergo condensation due to Bose-type statistics forming a hitherto unknown state of dense but cold quark matter.
