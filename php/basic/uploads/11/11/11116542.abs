Title: Twinlike Models for Self-Dual Maxwell-Higgs Theories
Authors: D. Bazeia and E. da Hora and R. Menezes
Abstract: In this work we present a theoretical framework that allows for the existence of coherent twinlike models in the context of self-dual Maxwell-Higgs theories. We verify the consistence of this framework by using it to develop some twinlike self-dual Maxwell-Higgs models. We use a combination of theoretical and numerical techniques to show that these models exhibit the very same topological BPS structures, including their field configurations and total energy. The study shows that it is possible to develop a completely consistent prescription, which extends the idea of twinlike models to the case of vortices in Maxwell-Higgs theories.
