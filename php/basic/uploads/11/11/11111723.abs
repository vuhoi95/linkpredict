Title: The Large N Limit of Toric Chern-Simons Matter Theories and Their Duals
Authors: Antonio Amariti and Claudius Klare and Massimo Siani
Abstract: We compute the large N limit of the localized three dimensional free energy of various field theories with known proposed AdS duals. We show that vector-like theories agree with the expected supergravity results, and with the conjectured F-theorem. We also check that the large N free energy is preserved by the three dimensional Seiberg duality for general classes of vector like theories. Then we analyze the behavior of the free energy of chiral-like theories by applying a new proposal. The proposal is based on the restoration of a discrete symmetry on the free energy before the extremization. We apply this procedure at strong coupling in some examples and we discuss the results. We conclude the paper by proposing an alternative geometrical expression for the free energy.
