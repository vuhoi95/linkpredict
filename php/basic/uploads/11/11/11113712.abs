Title: Multiple integral formula for the off-shell six vertex scalar product
Authors: Jan de Gier and Wellington Galleas and Mark Sorrell
Abstract: We write a multiple integral formula for the partition function of the Z-invariant six vertex model and demonstrate how it can be specialised to compute the norm of Bethe vectors. We also discuss the possibility of computing three-point functions in N= 4 SYM using these integral formul{\ae}.
