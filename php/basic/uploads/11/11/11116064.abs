Title: Two-potential theory of electric and magnetic charges via duality  transformation
Authors: Chandrasekhar Chatterjee and Indrajit Mitra and H. S. Sharatchandra
Abstract: Dirac, Schwinger and Zwanziger theories of electric and magnetic charges are obtained via duality transformation. Analogous construction for three Euclidean dimensions, with magnetic charges interacting with electric currents, is also done. The role of Dirac strings as dislocations in the configurations of gauge potential is emphasized.
