Title: Simple holographic duals to boundary CFTs
Authors: Marco Chiodaroli and Eric D'Hoker and Michael Gutperle
Abstract: By relaxing the regularity conditions imposed in arXiv:1107.1722 on half-BPS solutions to six-dimensional Type~4b supergravity, we enlarge the space of solutions to include two new half-BPS configurations, which we refer to as the \kap\ and the \funnel. We give evidence that the \kap\ and \funnel\ can be interpreted as fully back-reacted brane solutions with respectively $AdS_2$ and $AdS_2\times S^2$ world volumes. \kap\ and \funnel\ solutions with a single asymptotic $AdS_3 \times S^3$ region are constructed analytically. We argue that \kap\ solutions provide simple examples of holographic duals to boundary CFTs in two dimensions and present calculations of their holographic boundary entropy to support the BCFT dual picture.
