Title: Duality between 1+1 dimensional Maxwell-Dilaton gravity and Liouville  field theory
Authors: Simone Zonetti and Jan Govaerts
Abstract: We present an interesting reformulation of a collection of dilaton gravity models in two space-time dimensions into a field theory of two decoupled Liouville fields in flat space, in the presence of a Maxwell gauge field. An effective action is also obtained, encoding the dynamics of the dilaton field and the single gravitational degree of freedom in a decoupled regime. This effective action represents an interesting starting point for future work, including the canonical quantization of these classes of non trivial models of gravity coupled matter systems.
