Title: SUSY flavor structure of generic 5D supergravity models
Authors: Hiroyuki Abe and Hajime Otsuka and Yutaka Sakamura and Yusuke Yamada
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive and systematic analysis of the SUSY flavor structure of generic 5D supergravity models on $S^1/Z_2$ with multiple $Z_2$-odd vector multiplets that generate multiple moduli. The SUSY flavor problem can be avoided due to contact terms in the 4D effective K\"ahler potential peculiar to the multi-moduli case. A detailed phenomenological analysis is provided based on an illustrative model.
