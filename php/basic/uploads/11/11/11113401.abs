Title: Surprises in relativistic matter in a magnetic field
Authors: E. V. Gorbar and V. A. Miransky and I. A. Shovkovy
Abstract: A short review of recent advances in understanding the dynamics of relativistic matter in a magnetic field is presented. The emphasis is on the dynamics related to the generation of the chiral shift parameter in the normal ground state. We argue that the chiral shift parameter contributes to the axial current density, but does not modify the conventional axial anomaly relation. The analysis based on gauge invariant regularization schemes in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model suggests that these findings should be valid also in gauge theories. It is pointed out that the chiral shift parameter can affect observable properties of compact stars and modify the key features of the chiral magnetic effect in heavy ion collisions.
