Abstract: We look at properties of vortex solutions of the extended CP^N Skyrme-Faddeev model. We show that only holomorphic solutions of the CP^N model are also solutions of the Skyrme-Faddeev model. As the total energy of these solutions is infinite these solutions should be interpreted as describing time dependent vortices. We describe their dynamics and, in partcular, point out that one of the terms in the energy density is related to the Noether charge of the model.
