Title: Exact Coleman-de Luccia Instantons
Authors: Sugumi Kanno and Jiro Soda
Abstract: We present exact Coleman-de Luccia (CdL) instantons, which describe vacuum decay from Anti de Sitter (AdS) space, de Sitter (dS) space and Minkowski space to AdS space. We systematically obtain these exact solutions by considering deformation of Hawking-Moss (HM) instantons. We analytically calculate decay rates and discuss a subtlety in the interpretation.
