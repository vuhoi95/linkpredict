Abstract: First, the properties of a classical model of spontaneous symmetry breakdown are analyzed. Then, the pros and cons of some pedagogical non-relativistic quantum-mechanical models, also used to illustrate spontaneous symmetry breakdown, are discussed. Finally, a simple quantum-mechanical toy model (a spinor on the line, with a spin-dependent interaction) is presented, that exhibits the spontaneous breaking of an internal symmetry.
