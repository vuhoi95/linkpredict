Title: The Complete One-loop Spin Chain of N =1 SQCD
Authors: Pedro Liendo and Leonardo Rastelli
Abstract: We evaluate the complete planar one-loop dilation operator of N=1 Super QCD, at the large N Bank-Zaks fixed point near the upper edge of the superconformal window. The spin-chain Hamiltonian turns out to be entirely fixed by the constraints of superconformal symmetry, as in N=4 Super Yang-Mills and in N=2 SuperConformal QCD.
