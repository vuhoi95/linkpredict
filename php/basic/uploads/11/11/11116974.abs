Abstract: We present non-linear weak lensing predictions for coupled dark energy models using the CoDECS simulations. We calculate the shear correlation function and error covariance expected for these models, for forthcoming ground-based (such as DES) and space-based (Euclid) weak lensing surveys. We obtain predictions for the discriminatory power of a ground-based survey similar to DES and a space-based survey such as Euclid in distinguishing between $\Lambda$CDM and coupled dark energy models; we show that using the non-linear lensing signal we could discriminate between $\Lambda$CDM and exponential constant coupling models with $\beta_0\geq0.1$ at $4\sigma$ confidence level with a DES-like survey, and $\beta_0\geq0.05$ at $5\sigma$ confidence level with Euclid. We also demonstrate that estimating the coupled dark energy models' non-linear power spectrum, using the $\Lambda$CDM Halofit fitting formula, results in biases in the shear correlation function that exceed the survey errors.
