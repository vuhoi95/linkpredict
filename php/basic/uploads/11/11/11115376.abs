Abstract: In this work we carry out a noncommutative analysis of several Friedmann-Robert-Walker models, coupled to different types of perfect fluids and in the presence of a cosmological constant. The classical field equations are modified, by the introduction of a shift operator, in order to introduce noncommutativity in these models. We notice that the noncommutative versions of these models show several relevant differences with respect to the correspondent commutative ones.
