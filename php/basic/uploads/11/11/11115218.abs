Abstract: We consider a local action with both the real scalar field and its dual in two Euclidean dimensions. The role of singular line discontinuities is emphasized. Exotic properties of the correlation of the field with its dual, the generation of spin from scalar fields, and quantization of dual charges are pointed out. Wick's theorem and rotation properties of fermions are recovered for half-integer quantization.
