Abstract: We investigate and revisit certain aspects of relativistic baryons in the Skyrme model. Starting from static baryons in the helicity eigenstates, we generalize their wavefunctions to the non-static and relativistic regime. A new representation for gamma matrices in the SU(2) collective space is constructed and the corresponding Dirac equation is obtained. Furthermore, we extend the analysis of Adkins et al. concerning vector current vacuum expectation values for baryon states to arbitrary momenta and calculate baryon elastic form factors in a general framework exhibiting vector meson dominance.
