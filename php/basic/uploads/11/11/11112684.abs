Title: Hawking temperature for near-equilibrium black holes
Authors: Shunichiro Kinoshita and Norihiro Tanahashi
Abstract: We discuss the Hawking temperature of near-equilibrium black holes using a semiclassical analysis. We introduce a useful expansion method for slowly evolving spacetime, and evaluate the Bogoliubov coefficients using the saddle point approximation. For a spacetime whose evolution is sufficiently slow, such as a black hole with slowly changing mass, we find that the temperature is determined by the surface gravity of the past horizon. As an example of applications of these results, we study the Hawking temperature of black holes with null shell accretion in asymptotically flat space and the AdS-Vaidya spacetime. We discuss implications of our results in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence.
