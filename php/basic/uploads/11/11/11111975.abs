Title: The entropy of large black holes in loop quantum gravity: A  combinatorics/analysis approach
Authors: Xiangyu Cao and Aurelien Barrau
Abstract: The issue of a possible damping of the entropy periodicity for large black holes in Loop Quantum Gravity is highly debated. Using a combinatorics/analysis approach, we give strong arguments in favor of this damping, at least for prescriptions where the projection constraint is not fully implemented. This means that black holes in loop gravity exhibit an asymptotic Bekenstein-Hawking behavior, provided that a consistent choice of the Immirzi constant is made.
