Title: The Lattice Mean-Field Approximation of Gauge-Higgs Unification on the  Orbifold
Authors: Kyoko Yoneyama and Nikos Irges and Francesco Knechtli
Abstract: A possible extension of the Standard Model of elementary particles is Gauge-Higgs unification, where the Higgs field is identified with (some of) the extra dimensional components of a five-dimensional gauge field. In this scenario there is evidence for the potential and the mass of the Higgs field to be finite. Here we show the behavior of the static potential of a five-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory with orbifold boundary conditions. The potentials are computed within the mean-field approximation including first order corrections.
