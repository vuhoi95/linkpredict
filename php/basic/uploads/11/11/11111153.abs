Title: The n-point MHV one-loop Amplitude in N=4 Supergravity
Authors: David C. Dunbar and James H. Ettle and Warren B. Perkins
Abstract: We present an explicit formula for the n-point MHV one-loop amplitude in a N=4 supergravity theory. This formula is derived from the soft and collinear factorisations of the amplitude.
