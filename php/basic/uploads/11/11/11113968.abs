Title: Supersymmetric Extension of the Snyder Algebra
Authors: L. Gouba and A. Stern
Abstract: We obtain a minimal supersymmetric extension of the Snyder algebra and study its representations. The construction differs from the general approach given in Hatsuda and Siegel ({\tt hep-th/0311002}), and does not utilize super-de Sitter groups. The spectra of the position operators are discrete, implying a lattice description of space, and the lattice is compatible with supersymmetry transformations.
