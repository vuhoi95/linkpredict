Title: Holographic superconductor models with the Maxwell field strength  corrections
Authors: Qiyuan Pan and Jiliang Jing and Bin Wang
Abstract: We study the effect of the quadratic field strength correction to the usual Maxwell field on the holographic dual models in the backgrounds of AdS black hole and AdS soliton. We find that in the black hole background, the higher correction to the Maxwell field makes the condensation harder to form and changes the expected relation in the gap frequency. This effect is similar to that caused by the curvature correction. However, in the soliton background we find that different from the curvature effect, the correction to the Maxwell field does not influence the holographic superconductor and insulator phase transition.
