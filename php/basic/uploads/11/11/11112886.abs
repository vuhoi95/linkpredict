Title: Dynamical (super)symmetry vacuum properties of the supersymmetric  Chern-Simons-matter model
Authors: E. A. Gallegos and A. J. da Silva
Abstract: By computing the two-loop effective potential of the D=3 N=1 supersymmetric Chern-Simons model minimally coupled to a massless self-interacting matter superfield, it is shown that supersymmetry is preserved, while the internal U(1) and the scale symmetries are broken at two-loop order, dynamically generating masses both for the gauge superfield and for the real component of the matter superfield.
