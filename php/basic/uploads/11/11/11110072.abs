Title: On Braneworld Inflation Models in Light of WMAP7 data
Authors: R. Zarrouki and Z. Sakhi and M. Bennai
Abstract: We are interested on studing various inflationary spectrum perturbation parameters in the context of the Randall-Sandrum type 2 Braneworld model. We consider in particular three types of potentials. We apply the slow-roll approximation in the high energy limit to constraint the parameter potentials by confronting our results to recent WMAP7 observations. We show that, for some values of the e-folding number N; the monomial potential provides the best fit results to observations data.
