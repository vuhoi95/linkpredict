Title: Hamiltonian formulation of exactly solvable models and their physical  vacuum states
Authors: Lubomir Martinovic and Pierre Grange
Abstract: We clarify a few conceptual problems of quantum field theory on the level of exactly solvable models with fermions. The ultimate goal of our study is to gain a deeper understanding of differences between the usual ("spacelike") and light-front forms of relativistic dynamics. We show that by incorporating solutions of the operator field equations to the canonical formalism the spacelike and light front Hamiltonians of the derivative-coupling model acquire an equivalent structure. The same is true for the massive solvable theory, the Federbush model. In the conventional approach, the physical predictions in the two schemes disagree. Moreover, the derivative-coupling model is found to be almost identical to a free theory, in contrast to the conventional canonical treatment. Physical vacuum state of the Thirring model is then obtained by a Bogoliubov transformation as a coherent state quadratic in composite boson operators. To perform the same task in the Federbush model, we derive a massive version of Klaiber's bosonization and show that its light-front form is much simpler.
