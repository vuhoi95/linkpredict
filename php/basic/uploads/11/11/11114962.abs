Title: A local Hamiltonian for spherically symmetric gravity coupled to a  scalar field
Authors: Nestor Alvarez and Rodolfo Gambini and Jorge Pullin
Abstract: We present a gauge fixing of gravity coupled to a scalar field in spherical symmetry such that the Hamiltonian is an integral over space of a local density. Such a formulation had proved elusive over the years. As in any gauge fixing, it works for a restricted set of initial data. We argue that the set could be large enough to attempt a quantization the could include the important case of an evaporating black hole.
