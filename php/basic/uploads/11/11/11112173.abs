Title: Deforming solitons in generalized Abelian Higgs models
Authors: C. dos Santos and D. Rubiera-Garcia
Abstract: This work deals with several aspects of the extension to Abelian Higgs models of the deformation method originally developed for scalar field models. We present several examples allowing to transform self-dual solutions of different generalized Abelian Higgs models into scalar field models with or without a gauge field component. This is done through a parametrization of the soliton orbit in terms of the sine-Gordon static kink. We extend these ideas to a nonAbelian Higgs model.
