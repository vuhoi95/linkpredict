Title: Twisted Masses and Enhanced Symmetries: the A&D Series
Authors: Domenico Orlando and Susanne Reffert
Abstract: We study new symmetries between A and D type quiver gauge theories with different numbers of colors. We realize these gauge theories with twisted masses via a brane construction that reproduces all the parameters of the Gauge/Bethe correspondence.
