Title: Transport equations for the inflationary spectral index
Authors: Mafalda Dias and David Seery
Abstract: We present a simple and efficient method to compute the superhorizon evolution of the spectral index in multi-field inflationary models, using transport equation techniques. We illustrate the evolution of n_s with time for various interesting potentials.
