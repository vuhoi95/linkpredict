Title: Roots of Amplitudes
Authors: Bo Feng and Yin Jia and Hui Luo and Mingxing Luo
Abstract: In a recent paper [arXiv:1106.0166], boundary contributions in BCFW recursion relations have been related to roots of amplitudes. In this paper, we make several analyses regarding to this problem. Firstly, we use different ways to re-derive boundary BCFW recursion relations given in [arXiv:1106.0166]. Secondly, we generalize factorization limits to z-dependent ones, where information of roots is more transparent. Then, we demon- strate our analysis with several examples. In general, relations from factorization limits cannot guarantee to find explicit expressions for roots.
