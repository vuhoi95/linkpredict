Title: Scalar wormholes with nonminimal derivative coupling
Authors: Sergey Sushkov and Roman Korolev
Abstract: We consider static spherically symmetric wormhole configurations in a gravitational theory of a scalar field with a potential $V(\phi)$ and nonminimal derivative coupling to the curvature describing by the term $(\epsilon g_{\mu\nu} + \kappa G_{\mu\nu}) \phi^{,\mu}\phi^{,\nu}$ in the action. We show that the flare-out conditions providing the geometry of a wormhole throat could fulfilled both if $\epsilon=-1$ (phantom scalar) and $\epsilon=+1$ (ordinary scalar). Supposing additionally a traversability, we construct numerical solutions describing traversable wormholes in the model with arbitrary $\kappa$, $\epsilon=-1$ and $V(\phi)=0$ (no potential). The traversability assumes that the wormhole possesses two asymptotically flat regions with corresponding Schwarzschild masses. We find that asymptotical masses of a wormhole with nonminimal derivative coupling could be positive and/or negative depending on $\kappa$. In particular, both masses are positive only provided $\kappa<\kappa_1\le0$, otherwise one or both wormhole masses are negative. In conclusion, we give qualitative arguments that a wormhole configuration with positive masses could be stable.
