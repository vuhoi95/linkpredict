Title: Kaluza-Klein description of geometric phases in graphene
Authors: K. Bakke and A. Yu. Petrov and C. Furtado
Abstract: In this paper, we use the Kaluza-Klein approach to describe topological defects in a graphene layer. Using this approach, we propose a geometric model allowing to discuss the quantum flux in $K$-spin subspace. Within this model, the graphene layer with a topological defect is described by a four-dimensional metric, where the deformation produced by the topological defect is introduced via the three-dimensional part of metric tensor, while an Abelian gauge field is introduced via an extra dimension. We use this new geometric model to discuss the arising of topological quantum phases in a graphene layer with a topological defect.
