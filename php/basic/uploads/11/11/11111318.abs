Title: New results on twinlike models
Authors: D. Bazeia and R. Menezes
Abstract: In this work we study the presence of kinks in models described by a single real scalar field in bidimensional spacetime. We work within the first-order framework, and we show how to write first-order differential equations that solve the equations of motion. The first-order equations strongly simplify the study of linear stability, which is implemented on general grounds. They also lead to a direct investigation of twinlike theories, which is used to introduce a family of models that support the same defect structure, with the very same energy density and linear stability.
