Title: Non-Equilibrium Thermo Field Dynamics for Relativistic Complex Scalar  and Dirac Fields
Authors: Yuichi Mizutani and Tomohiro Inagaki
Abstract: Relativistic quantum field theories for complex scalar and Dirac fields are investigated in non-equilibrium thermo field dynamics. The thermal vacuum is defined by the Bogoliubov transformed creation and annihilation operators. Two independent Bogoliubov parameters are introduced for a charged field. Its difference naturally induces the chemical potential. Time-dependent thermal Bogoliubov transformation generates the thermal counter terms. We fix the terms by the self-consistency renormalization condition. Evaluating the thermal self-energy under the self-consistency renormalization condition, we derive the quantum Boltzmann equations for the relativistic fields.
