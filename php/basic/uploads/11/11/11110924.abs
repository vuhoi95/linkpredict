Title: Null geodesics in the Reissner-Nordstr√∂m Anti-de Sitter black holes
Authors: Norman Cruz and Marco Olivares and Joel Saavedra and J. R. Villanueva
Abstract: In this work we address the study of null geodesics in the background of Reissner-Nordstr\"om Anti de Sitter black holes. We compute the exact trajectories in terms of elliptic functions of Weierstrass, obtaining a detailed description of the orbits in terms of charge, mass and the cosmological constant. The trajectories of the photon are classified using the impact parameter.
