Abstract: New two-dimensional quantum model - the generalization of the Scarf II - is completely solved analytically for the integer values of parameter. This model being not amenable to conventional procedure of separation of variables is solved by recently proposed method of supersymmetrical separation. The latter is based on two constituents of SUSY Quantum Mechanics: the intertwining relations with second order supercharges and the property of shape invariance. As a result, all energies of bound states were found, and the analytical expressions for corresponding wave functions were obtained.
