Title: Stable black hole solutions with non-Abelian fields
Authors: Eugen Radu and D. H. Tchrakian
Abstract: We construct finite mass, asymptotically flat black hole solutions in d=4 Einstein-Yang-Mills theory augmented with higher order curvature terms of the gauge field. They possess non-Abelian hair in addition to Coulomb electric charge, and, below some non-zero critical temperature, they are thermodynamically preferred over the Reissner-Nordstrom solution. Our results indicate the existence of hairy non-Abelian black holes which are stable under linear, spherically symmetric perturbations.
