Title: Camouflaged Supersymmetry
Authors: Iosif Bena and Hagen Triendl and Bert Vercnocke
Abstract: We establish a relation between certain classes of flux compactifications and certain families of black hole microstate solutions. This connection reveals a rather unexpected result: there exist supersymmetric solutions of N=8 supergravity that live inside many N=2 truncations, but are not supersymmetric inside any of them. If this phenomenon is generic, it indicates the possible existence of much larger families of supersymmetric black rings and black hole microstates than previously thought.
