Title: Critical phenomena in Born-Infeld AdS black holes
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Dibakar Roychowdhury
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of critical phenomena in Born-Infeld AdS black holes using a canonical ensemble. The critical behavior has been studied near the critical point which is characterized by a discontinuity in the heat capacity at constant charge. We explicitly calculate the critical exponents of the relevant thermodynamic quantities. These exponents satisfy all the thermodynamic scaling laws. We also check the Generalized Homogeneous Function (GHF) hypothesis (or the scaling hypothesis) which is shown to be compatible with the thermodynamic scaling laws. Finally we check the validity of the scaling laws of second kind which include the critical exponents associated with the spatial correlation. In the appropriate limit our results also provide the corresponding expressions for the Reissner Nordstrom AdS case.
