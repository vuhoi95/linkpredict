Title: Isolated horizons in classical and quantum gravity
Authors: Jonathan Engle and Tomas Liko
Abstract: Isolated horizons are a quasi-local framework, developed over the last 15 years by many authors, for modeling black holes `in equilibrium' that involves assumptions only about geometric structures intrinsic to the horizon. We review the motivations for the framework, and the derivation of the key results, both classical and quantum.
