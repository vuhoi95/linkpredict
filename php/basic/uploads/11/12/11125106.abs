Title: 6D Effective Action of Heterotic Compactification on K3 with nontrivial  Gauge Bundles
Authors: Jan Louis and Martin Schasny and Roberto Valandro
Abstract: We compute the six-dimensional effective action of the heterotic string compactified on K3 for the standard embedding and for a class of backgrounds with line bundles and appropriate Yang-Mills fluxes. We compute the couplings of the charged scalars and the bundle moduli as functions of the geometrical K3 moduli from a Kaluza-Klein analysis. We derive the D-term potential and show that in the flux backgrounds U(1) vector multiplets become massive by a Stuckelberg mechanism.
