Title: Entropy of generic quantum isolated horizons
Authors: Jonathan Engle and Christopher Beetle
Abstract: We review our recent proposal of a method to extend the quantization of spherically symmetric isolated horizons, a seminal result of loop quantum gravity, to a phase space containing horizons of arbitrary geometry. Although the details of the quantization remain formally unchanged, the physical interpretation of the results can be quite different. We highlight several such differences, with particular emphasis on the physical interpretation of black hole entropy in loop quantum gravity.
