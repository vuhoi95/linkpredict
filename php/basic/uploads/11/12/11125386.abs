Title: Logarithmic entropy--corrected holographic dark energy with non--minimal  kinetic coupling
Authors: Ali R. Amani and J. Sadeghi and H. Farajollahi and M. Pourali
Abstract: In this paper, we have considered a cosmological model with the non--minimal kinetic coupling terms and investigated its cosmological implications with respect to the logarithmic entropy-- corrected holographic dark energy (LECHDE). The correspondence between LECHDE in flat FRW cosmology and the phantom dark energy model with the aim to interpret the current universe acceleration is also examined.
