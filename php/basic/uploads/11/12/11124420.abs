Title: The Coincidence Limit of the Graviton Propagator in de Donder Gauge on  de Sitter Background
Authors: E. O. Kahya and S. P. Miao and R. P. Woodard
Abstract: We explicitly work out the de Sitter breaking contributions to the recent solution for the de Donder gauge graviton propagator on de Sitter. We also provide explicit power series expansions for the two structure functions, which are suitable for implementing dimensional regularization. And we evaluate the coincidence limit of the propagator.
