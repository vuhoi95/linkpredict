Title: Significance of many-body contributions to Casimir energies
Authors: K. V. Shajesh and M. Schaden
Abstract: Irreducible many-body contributions to Green's functions and Casimir energies are defined. We show that the irreducible three-body contribution to Casimir energies are significant and can be more than twenty percent of the total interaction energy. Irreducible three-body contribution for three parallel semitransparent plates in the limit when two plates overlap is obtained in terms of irreducible two-body contributions and shown to be finite and well defined in this limit.
