Title: Chern-Simons effect on the dual hydrodynamics in the  Maxwell-Gauss-Bonnet gravity
Authors: Ya-Peng Hu and Chanyong Park
Abstract: Following the previous work 1103.3773, we give a more general and systematic discussion on the Chern-Simons effect in the 5-dimensional Maxwell-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. After constructing the first order perturbative black brane solution, we extract the stress tensor and charge current of dual fluid. From these results, we find out the dependence of some transport coefficients on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling $\alpha$ and Chern-Simons coupling $\kappa_{cs}$. We also show that the new anomalous term can provide an additional contribution to the anomalous chiral magnetic conductivity.
