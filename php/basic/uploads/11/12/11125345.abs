Title: Holographic hydrodynamics: models and methods
Authors: Nabamita Banerjee and Suvankar Dutta
Abstract: We review recent developments in holographic hydrodynamics. We start from very basic discussion on hydrodynamic systems and motivate why string theory is an essential tool to deal with these systems when they are strongly coupled. The main purpose of this review article is to understand different holographic techniques to compute transport coefficients (first order and higher order) and their corrections in presence of higher derivative terms in the bulk Lagrangian. We also mention some open challenges in this subject.
