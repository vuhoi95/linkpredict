Title: Î²-deformed matrix model and Nekrasov partition function
Authors: Takahiro Nishinaka and Chaiho Rim
Abstract: We study Penner type matrix models in relation with the Nekrasov partition function of four dimensional \mathcal{N}=2, SU(2) supersymmetric gauge theories with N_F=2,3 and 4. By evaluating the resolvent using the loop equation for general \beta, we explicitly construct the first half-genus correction to the free energy and demonstrate the result coincides with the corresponding Nekrasov partition function with general \Omega-background, including higher instanton contributions after modifying the relation of the Coulomb branch parameter with the filling fraction. Our approach complements the proof using the Selberg integrals directly which is useful to find the contribution in the series of instanton numbers for a given deformation parameter.
