Title: The colour octet representation of the non-forward BFKL Green function
Authors: G. Chachamis and A. Sabio Vera
Abstract: We factorize the infrared divergences of the non-forward BFKL Green function for a general t-channel projection of the color quantum numbers and study the properties of the infrared finite remainder in the case of color octet exchange. The octet Green function is compared with the singlet case for different values of the momentum transfer. The octet Green function plays an important role in the calculation of the finite remainder of the two-loop six-point MHV planar amplitude in N = 4 SYM as it was demonstrated by Bartels, Lipatov and one of us in http://arXiv.org/abs/arXiv:0802.2065 and http://arXiv.org/abs/arXiv:0807.0894. A comparison with regularizations preserving conformal invariance at large momentum transfer is shown.
