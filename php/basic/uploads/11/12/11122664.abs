Title: Black Holes and Groups of Type E7
Authors: Sergio Ferrara and Alessio Marrani
Abstract: We report some results on the relation between extremal black holes in locally supersymmetric theories of gravity and groups of type E7, appearing as generalized electric-magnetic duality symmetries in such theories. Some basics on the covariant approach to the stratification of the relevant symplectic representation are reviewed, along with a connection between special Kaehler geometry and a "generalization" of groups of type E7.
