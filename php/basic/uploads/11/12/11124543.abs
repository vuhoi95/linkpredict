Title: Functional Integration and High Energy Scattering of Particles with  Anomalous Magnetic Moments in Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Nguyen Suan Han and Nguyen Nhu Xuan and Le Thi Hai Yen
Abstract: The functional integration method is used for studying the scattering of a scalar pion on nucleon with the anomalous magnetic moment in the framework of nonrenomalizable quantum field theory. In the asymptotic region s {\to} {\infty}, |t| << s the representation of eikonal type for the amplitude of pion-nucleon scattering is obtained. The anomalous magnetic moment leads to additional terms in the amplitude which describe the spin flips in the scattering process. It is shown that the renormalization problem does not arise in the asymptotic s {\to} {\infty} since the unrenomalized divergences disappear in this approximation. Coulomb interference is considered as an application.
