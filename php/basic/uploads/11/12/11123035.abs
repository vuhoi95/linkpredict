Title: Geometry of open strings ending on backreacting D3-branes
Authors: Raphael Benichou and John Estes
Abstract: We investigate open string theory on backreacting D3-branes using a spacetime approach. We study in detail the half-BPS supergravity solutions describing open strings ending on D3-branes, in the near horizon of the D3-branes. We recover quantitatively several non-trivial features of open string physics including the appearance of D3-brane spikes, the polarization of fundamental strings into D5-branes, and the Hanany-Witten effect. Finally we detail the computation of the gravitational potential between two open strings, and contrast it with the holographic computation of Wilson lines. We argue that the D-brane backreaction has a large influence on the low-energy gravity, which may lead to experimental tests for string theory brane-world scenarios.
