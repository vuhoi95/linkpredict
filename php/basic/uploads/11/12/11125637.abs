Title: Field-parametrization dependence of Dirac's method for constrained  Hamiltonians with first-class constraints: failure or triumph? Non-covariant  models

Abstract: We argue that the field-parametrization dependence of Dirac's procedure, for Hamiltonians with first-class constraints not only preserves covariance in covariant theories, but in non-covariant gauge theories it allows one to find the natural field parametrization in which the Hamiltonian formulation automatically leads to the simplest gauge symmetry.
