Title: Reduced classes and curve counting on surfaces I: theory
Authors: M. Kool and R. P. Thomas
Abstract: We develop a theory of \emph{reduced} Gromov-Witten and stable pair invariants of surfaces and their canonical bundles. We show that classical Severi degrees are special cases of these invariants. This proves a special case of the MNOP conjecture, and allows us to generalise the G\"ottsche conjecture to the non-ample case. In a sequel we prove this generalisation. We prove a remarkable property of the moduli space of stable pairs on a surface. It is the zero locus of a section of a bundle on a smooth compact ambient space, making calculation with the reduced virtual cycle possible.
