Title: Gravity Amplitudes from a Gaussian Matrix Model
Authors: Jonathan J. Heckman and Herman Verlinde
Abstract: We reformulate MHV scattering amplitudes in 4D gauge theory and supergravity as correlation functions of bilinear operators in a supersymmetric gaussian matrix model. The model retains the symmetries of an S(4) of radius L and the matrix variables are represented as linear operators acting on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space. Bilinear fields of the model generate a current algebra. In the large N double scaling limit where l_pl ~ L / sqrt(N) is held fixed, there is an emergent flat 4D space-time with a built in short distance cutoff.
