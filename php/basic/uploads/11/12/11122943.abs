Title: Yang-Mills condensates in cosmology
Authors: D. V. Gal'tsov and E. A. Davydov
Abstract: We discuss homogeneous and isotropic cosmological models driven by SU(2) gauge fields in the framework of Einstein gravity. There exists a Yang-Mills field configuration, parametrized by a single scalar function, which consists of parallel electric and magnetic fields and has the stress tensor mimicking an homogeneous and isotropic fluid. The unique SU(2) gauge theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking sharing the same property is the Yang-Mills coupled to the complex doublet Higgs, this exists only in the case of the closed universe. This model contains an intrinsic mechanism for inflation due to the Higgs potential. Our second goal is to show that a successful inflation can be achieved also within the pure Yang-Mills theory adding an appropriate theta-term.
