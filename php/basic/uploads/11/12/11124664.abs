Abstract: We study the possible dynamical emergence of IR conformal invariance describing the low energy excitations of near-extremal R-charged global AdS5 black holes. We find interesting behavior especially when we tune parameters in such a way that the relevant extremal black holes have classically vanishing horizon area, i.e. no classical ground-state entropy, and when we combine the low energy limit with a large N limit of the dual gauge theory. We consider both near-BPS and non-BPS regimes and their near horizon limits, emphasize the differences between the local AdS3 throats emerging in either case, and discuss potential dual IR 2d CFTs for each case. We compare our results with the predictions obtained from the Kerr/CFT correspondence, and obtain a natural quantization for the central charge of the near-BPS emergent IR CFT which we interpret in terms of the open strings stretched between giant gravitons.
