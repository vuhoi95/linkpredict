Title: Higher spin quasinormal modes and one-loop determinants in the BTZ black  hole
Authors: Shouvik Datta and Justin R. David
Abstract: We solve the wave equations of arbitrary integer spin fields in the BTZ black hole background and obtain exact expressions for their quasinormal modes. We show that these quasinormal modes precisely agree with the location of the poles of the corresponding two point function in the dual conformal field theory as predicted by the AdS/CFT correspondence. We then use these quasinormal modes to construct the one-loop determinant of the higher spin field in the thermal BTZ background. This is shown to agree with that obtained from the corresponding heat kernel constructed recently by group theoretic methods.
