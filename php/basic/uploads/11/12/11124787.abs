Title: Four-loop anomalous dimensions in Leigh-Strassler deformations
Authors: J. A. Minahan and C. Sieg
Abstract: We determine the scalar part of the four-loop chiral dilatation operator for Leigh-Strassler deformations of N=4 super Yang-Mills. This is sufficient to find the four-loop anomalous dimensions for operators in closed scalar subsectors. This includes the SU(2) subsector of the (complex) beta-deformation, where we explicitly compute the anomalous dimension for operators with a single impurity. It also includes the "3-string null" operators of the cubic Leigh-Strassler deformation. Our four-loop results show that the rational part of the anomalous dimension is consistent with a conjecture made in arXiv:1108.1583 based on the three-loop result of arXiv:1008.3351 and the N=4 magnon dispersion relation. Here we find additional zeta(3) terms.
