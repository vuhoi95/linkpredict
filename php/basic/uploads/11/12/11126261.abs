Title: Flavor of quiver-like realizations of effective supersymmetry
Authors: Roberto Auzzi and Amit Giveon and Sven Bjarke Gudnason
Abstract: We present a class of supersymmetric models which address the flavor puzzle and have an inverted hierarchy of sfermions. Their construction involves quiver-like models with link fields in generic representations. The magnitude of Standard-Model parameters is obtained naturally and a relatively heavy Higgs boson is allowed without fine tuning. Collider signatures of such models are possibly within the reach of LHC in the near future.
