Title: On Ward Identities in Lifshitz-like Field Theories
Authors: Pedro R. S. Gomes and M. Gomes
Abstract: In this work, we develop a normal product algorithm suitable to the study of anisotropic field theories in flat space, apply it to construct the symmetries generators and describe how their possible anomalies may be found. In particular, we discuss the dilatation anomaly in a scalar model with critical exponent z=2 in six spatial dimensions.
