Title: Dynamical classicalization
Authors: J. Rizos and N. Tetradis
Abstract: We integrate numerically the nonlinear equation of motion for a collapsing spherical wavepacket in the context of theories that are expected to display behavior characteristic of classicalization. The classicalization radius sets the scale for the onset of significant deformations of the collapsing configuration, which result in the formation of shock fronts. A characteristic observable feature of the classicalization process is the creation of an outgoing field configuration that extends far beyond the classicalization radius. This feature develops before the deformed wavepacket reaches distances of the order of the fundamental scale. We find that in some models the scattering problem may not have real solutions over the whole space at late times. We determine the origin of this behavior and discuss the consistency of the underlying models.
