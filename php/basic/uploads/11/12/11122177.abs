Title: Holographic Meson Spectra in the Dense Medium with Chiral Condensate
Authors: Chanyong Park and Bum-Hoon Lee and Sunyoung Shin
Abstract: We study two $1/N_c$ effects on the meson spectra by using the AdS/CFT correspondence where the $1/N_c$ corrections from the chiral condensate and the quark density are controlled by the gravitational backreaction of the massive scalar field and U(1) gauge field respectively. The dual geometries with zero and nonzero current quark masses are obtained numerically. We discuss meson spectra and binding energy of heavy quarkonium with the subleading corrections in the hard wall model.
