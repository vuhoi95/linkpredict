Title: The Quantum Affine Origin of the AdS/CFT Secret Symmetry
Authors: Marius de Leeuw and Vidas Regelskis and Alessandro Torrielli
Abstract: We find a new quantum affine symmetry of the S-matrix of the one-dimensional Hubbard chain. We show that this symmetry originates from the quantum affine superalgebra U_q(gl(2|2)), and in the rational limit exactly reproduces the secret symmetry of the AdS/CFT worldsheet S-matrix.
