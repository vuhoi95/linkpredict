Title: Free massless higher-superspin superfields on the anti-de Sitter  superspace
Authors: S. M. Kuzenko and A. G. Sibiryakov
Abstract: Free massless higher-superspin superfields on the N=1, D=4 anti-de Sitter superspace are introduced. The linearized gauge transformations are postulated. Two families of dually equivalent gauge-invariant action functionals are constructed for massless half-integer-superspin s+1/2 (s >= 2) and integer-superspin s (s >= 1) superfields. For s=1, one of the formulations for half-integer superspin multiplets reduces to linearized minimal N=1 supergravity with a cosmological term, while the other is the lifting to the anti-de Sitter superspace of linearized non-minimal n=-1 supergravity.
