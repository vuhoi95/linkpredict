Title: Yang-Mills theory at non-vanishing temperature
Authors: Leonard Fister and Jan M. Pawlowski
Abstract: We compute ghost and gluon propagators of Yang-Mills theory in the Landau gauge at non-vanishing temperature within a functional renormalisation group setting. We construct purely thermal flows, that project onto thermal fluctuations only. For temperatures and momenta above the confinement-deconfinement temperature Tc the electric propagator shows a thermal suppression due to Debye screening. The magnetic gluon propagator shows a thermal scaling and tends towards the three-dimensional one. In this region both propagators match the lattice propagators. The thermal scaling is also reflected in the infrared suppression of the ghost-gluon vertex. For temperatures below Tc the electric propagator shows an enhancement which is in qualitative agreement with the lattice behaviour.
