Title: A holographic map of action onto entropy
Authors: D. Acosta and P. Fernandez de Cordoba and J. M. Isidro and J. L. G. Santander
Abstract: We propose a holographic correspondence between the action integral I describing the mechanics of a finite number of degrees of freedom in the bulk, and the entropy S of the boundary (a holographic screen) enclosing that same volume. The action integral must be measured in units of (i times) Planck's constant, while the entropy must be measured in units of Boltzmann's constant. In this way we are led to an intriguing relation between the second law of thermodynamics and the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics.
