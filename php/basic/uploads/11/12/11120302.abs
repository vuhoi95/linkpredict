Title: Spacetime as a topological insulator: Mechanism for the origin of the  fermion generations
Authors: David B. Kaplan and Sichun Sun
Abstract: We suggest a mechanism whereby the three generations of quarks and leptons correspond to surface modes in a five-dimensional theory. These modes arise from a nonlinear fermion dispersion relation in the extra dimension, much in the same manner as fermion surface modes in a topological insulator or lattice implementation of domain wall fermions. We also show that the topological properties can persist in a deconstructed version of the model in four dimensions.
