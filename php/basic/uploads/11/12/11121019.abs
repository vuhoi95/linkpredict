Title: Quantum simulation of an extra dimension
Authors: O. Boada and A. Celi and M. Lewenstein and J. I. Latorre
Abstract: We present a general strategy to simulate a D+1-dimensional quantum system using a D-dimensional one. We analyze in detail a feasible implementation of our scheme using optical lattice technology. The simplest non-trivial realization of a fourth dimension corresponds to the creation of a bivolume geometry. We also propose single- and many-particle experimental signatures to detect the effects of the extra dimension.
