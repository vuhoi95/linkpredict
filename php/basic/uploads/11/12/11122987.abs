Title: A Note on Kahler Potential of Charged Matter in F-theory
Authors: Teruhiko Kawano and Yoichi Tsuchiya and Taizan Watari
Abstract: We study the Kahler potential of charged matter fields, whose profiles have a peak on their matter curve --- on an "intersection" of 7-branes, in an F-theory compactification. It is shown that the Kahler potential is exactly given by the integral over the matter curve, but not by the integral over the whole GUT surface of 7-branes.
