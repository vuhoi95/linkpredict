Title: Conformal couplings of a scalar field to higher curvature terms
Authors: Julio Oliva and Sourya Ray
Abstract: We present a simple way of constructing conformal couplings of a scalar field to higher order Euler densities. This is done by constructing a four-rank tensor involving the curvature and derivatives of the field, which transforms covariantly under local Weyl rescalings. The equation of motion for the field, as well as its energy momentum tensor are shown to be of second order. The field equations for the spherically symmetric ansatz are integrated, and for generic non-homogeneous couplings, the solution is given in terms of a polynomial equation, in close analogy with Lovelock theories.
