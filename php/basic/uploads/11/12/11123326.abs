Title: Magnetized Black Hole on Taub-Nut Instanton
Authors: Petya G. Nedkova and Stoytcho S. Yazadjiev
Abstract: We present an exact solution to the 5D Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton equations describing a static black hole on Taub-Nut instanton. By construction the solution does not possess a charge, but is magnetized along the compact dimension. As a limit we obtain a new regular solution representing a magnetized Kaluza- Klein monopole. We investigate the relevant physical properties and derive the Smarr-like relations.
