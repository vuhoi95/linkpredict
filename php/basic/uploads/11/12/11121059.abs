Title: Higgs Mass Prediction for Realistic String/M Theory Vacua
Authors: Gordon Kane and Piyush Kumar and Ran Lu and Bob Zheng
Abstract: Recently it has been recognized that in compactified string/M-theories that satisfy cosmological constraints, it is possible to derive some robust and generic predictions for particle physics and cosmology with very mild assumptions. When the matter and gauge content below the compactification scale is that of the MSSM, it is possible to make precise predictions. In this case, we predict that there will be a single Standard Model-like Higgs boson with a calculable mass 105 GeV $\lesssim M_h \lesssim$ 129 GeV depending on tan beta (the ratio of the Higgs vevs in the MSSM). For tan beta > 7, the prediction is : 122 GeV $\lesssim M_h \lesssim$ 129 GeV.
