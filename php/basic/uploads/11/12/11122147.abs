Abstract: We continue the development of a theory of off-shell supersymmetric representations analogous to that of compact Lie algebras such as SU(3). For off-shell 4D, N = 1 systems, quark-like representations have been identified [1] in terms of cis-Adinkras and trans-Adinkras and it has been conjectured that arbitrary representations are composites of $n_c$-cis and $n_t$-trans representations. Analyzing the real scalar and complex linear superfield multiplets, these "chemical enantiomer" numbers are found to be $n_c$ = $n_t$ = 1 and $n_c$ = 1, $n_t$ = 2, respectively.
