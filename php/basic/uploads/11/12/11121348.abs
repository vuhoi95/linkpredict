Title: Repulsive long-range forces between anisotropic atoms and dielectrics
Authors: K. V. Shajesh and M. Schaden
Abstract: We investigate long-range forces between atoms with anisotropic electric polarizability interacting with dielectrics having anisotropic permittivity in the weak-coupling approximation. Unstable configurations in which the force between the objects is repulsive are constructed. Such configurations exist for three anisotropic atoms as well as for an anisotropic atom above a dielectric plate with a hole whose permittivity is anisotropic. Apart from the absolute magnitude of the force, the dependence on the configuration is qualitatively the same as for metallic objects for which the anisotropy is a purely geometric effect. In the weak limit closed analytic expressions for rather complicated configurations are obtained. The non-monotonic dependence of the interaction energy on separation is related to the fact that the electromagnetic Green's dyadic is not positive definite. The analysis in the weak limit is found to also semi-quantitatively explain the dependence of Casimir forces on the orientation of anisotropic dielectrics observed experimentally. Contrary to the scalar case, irreducible electromagnetic three-body energies can change sign. We trace this to the fact that the electromagnetic Green's dyadic is not positive definite.
