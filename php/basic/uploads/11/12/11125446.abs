Title: Hidden Symmetries and Integrability in Higher Dimensional Rotating Black  Hole Spacetimes
Authors: Marco Cariglia and Pavel Krtous and David Kubiznak
Abstract: This is a short pedagogical introduction to the subject of Killing-Stackel and Killing-Yano tensors and their role in the integrability of various types of equations that are of physical interest in curved spacetime, the main application being higher dimensional rotating black holes with cosmological constant.
