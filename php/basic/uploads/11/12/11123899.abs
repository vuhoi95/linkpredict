Title: Paths with singularities in functional integrals of quantum field theory
Authors: V. V. Belokurov and E. T. Shavgulidze
Abstract: In the toy model ($ \phi^{4}$-interacting quantum field theory in one-dimensional "Euclidean" space-time) we prove that the functional integrals of the free field theory evaluated over the space of continuous functions are equal to the functional integrals of the interacting field theory evaluated over a set of spaces containing the spaces of discontinuous functions.
