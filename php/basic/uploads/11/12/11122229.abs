Title: Five-Dimensional Eguchi-Hanson Solitons in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity
Authors: Anson W. C. Wong and Robert B. Mann
Abstract: Eguchi-Hanson solitons are odd-dimensional generalizations of the four-dimensional Eguchi-Hanson metric and are asymptotic to AdS$_5$\mathbb{Z}_p$ when the cosmological constant is either positive or negative. We find soliton solutions to Lovelock gravity in 5 dimensions that are generalizations of these objects.
