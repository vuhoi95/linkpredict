Title: New results for the SQCD Hilbert series
Authors: Niko Jokela and Matti Jarvinen and Esko Keski-Vakkuri
Abstract: We derive new explicit results for the Hilbert series of N=1 supersymmetric QCD with U(N_c) and SU(N_c) color symmetry. We use two methods which have previously been applied to similar computational problems in the analysis of decay of unstable D-branes: expansions using Schur polynomials, and the log-gas approach related to random matrix theory.
