Title: Off-shell construction of superconformal Chern-Simons theories in three  dimensions
Authors: Masato Arai and Shin Sasaki
Abstract: We propose an off-shell construction of three-dimensional N = 3 and N = 4 superconformal Abelian Chern-Simons theories in the projective superspace formalism. We also construct coupling terms among the gauge fields and matter hypermultiplets.
