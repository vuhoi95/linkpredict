Title: Yang-Mills correlation functions at finite temperature
Authors: Leonard Fister and Jan M. Pawlowski
Abstract: We put forward a continuum approach for computing finite temperature correlation functions in Yang-Mills theory. This is done in a functional renormalisation group setting which allows for the construction of purely thermal RG-flows. This approach is applied to the ghost and gluon propagators as well as the ghost-gluon vertex in the Landau gauge. We present results in a temperature regime going from vanishing temperature to temperatures far above the confinement-deconfinement temperature Tc. Our findings compare well with the lattice results available.
