Authors: Aristomenis Donos and Jerome P. Gauntlett and Christiana Pantelidou
Abstract: The stability properties of a family of magnetic $AdS_{3}\times \mathbb{R}^{2}$ solutions of D=5, SO(6) gauged SUGRA are investigated in more detail. We construct an analogous family of magnetic $AdS_{2}\times \mathbb{R}^{2}$ solutions of D=4, SO(8) gauged SUGRA, including a family of supersymmetric solutions, and also investigate their stability. We construct supersymmetric domain walls that interpolate between AdS_5 and an $AdS_3\times\mathbb{R}^2$ solution and also between AdS_4 and an $AdS_2\times\mathbb{R}^2$ solution which provide stable zero temperature ground states for the corresponding dual CFTs. We also construct new families of electric $AdS_{2}\times \mathbb{R}^{3}$ and $AdS_{2}\times \mathbb{R}^{2}$ solutions.
