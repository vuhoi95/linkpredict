Title: The MSSM Spectrum from (0,2)-Deformations of the Heterotic Standard  Embedding
Authors: Volker Braun and Philip Candelas and Rhys Davies and Ron Donagi
Abstract: We construct supersymmetric compactifications of E_8 \times E_8 heterotic string theory which realise exactly the massless spectrum of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) at low energies. The starting point is the standard embedding on a Calabi-Yau threefold which has Hodge numbers (h^11,h^21) = (1,4) and fundamental group Z_12, which gives an E_6 grand unified theory with three net chiral generations. The gauge symmetry is then broken to that of the standard model by a combination of discrete Wilson lines and continuous deformation of the gauge bundle. On eight distinct branches of the moduli space, we find stable bundles with appropriate cohomology groups to give exactly the massless spectrum of the MSSM.
