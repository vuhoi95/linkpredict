Title: Symmetry breaking and restoration for interacting scalar and gauge  fields in Lifshitz type theories
Authors: K. Farakos and D. Metaxas
Abstract: We consider the one-loop effective potential at zero and finite temperature in field theories with anisotropic space-time scaling, with critical exponent $z=2$, including both scalar and gauge fields. Depending on the relative strength of the coupling constants for the gauge and scalar interactions, we find that there is a symmetry breaking term induced at one-loop at zero temperature and we find symmetry restoration through a first-order phase transition at high temperature.
