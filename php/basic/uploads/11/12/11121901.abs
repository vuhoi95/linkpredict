Title: Perfect Fluid Spherically-Symmetric Solutions in Massive Gravity
Authors: Y. Brihaye and Y. Verbin
Abstract: We study spherically-symmetric solutions in Massive Gravity generated by matter sources with polytropic equation of state. We concentrate in the non-perturbative regime where the mass term non-linearities are important, and present the main features of the solutions.
