Title: Three-magnetic fields
Authors: Tomi S. Koivisto and Federico R. Urban
Abstract: A completely new mechanism to generate the observed amount of large-scale cosmological magnetic fields is introduced in the context of three-form inflation. The amplification of the fields occurs via fourth order dynamics of the vector perturbations and avoids the backreaction problem that plagues most previously introduced mechanisms.
