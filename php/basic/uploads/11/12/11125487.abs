Title: AdS/CFT Dual Pairs from M5-Branes on Riemann Surfaces
Authors: Ibrahima Bah and Christopher Beem and Nikolay Bobev and Brian Wecht
Abstract: In this letter we describe an infinite family of new N=1 AdS_5/CFT_4 dual pairs which arise from M5-branes wrapping Riemann surfaces in Calabi-Yau threefolds. We use the relevant brane constructions to compute the central charges of the infrared fixed points from the M5-brane anomaly polynomial. We then present AdS_5 x M_6 solutions of eleven-dimensional supergravity which are dual to these CFTs at large N. Finally, we provide a purely four-dimensional field theory construction which flows to a special class of these fixed points. These theories will be further elaborated upon in a companion paper.
