Title: Character expansion for HOMFLY polynomials. I. Integrability and  difference equations
Authors: A. Mironov and A. Morozov and An. Morozov
Abstract: We suggest to associate with each knot the set of coefficients of its HOMFLY polynomial expansion into the Schur functions. For each braid representation of the knot these coefficients are defined unambiguously as certain combinations of the Racah symbols for the algebra SU_q. Then, the HOMFLY polynomials can be extended to the entire space of time-variables. The so extended HOMFLY polynomials are no longer knot invariants, they depend on the choice of the braid representation, but instead one can naturally discuss their explicit integrable properties. The generating functions of torus knot/link coefficients are turned to satisfy the Plucker relations and can be associated with tau-function of the KP hierarchy, while generic knots correspond to more involved systems. On the other hand, using the expansion into the Schur functions, one can immediately derive difference equations (A-polynomials) for knot polynomials which play a role of the string equation. This adds to the previously demonstrated use of these character decompositions for the study of beta-deformations from HOMFLY to superpolynomials.
