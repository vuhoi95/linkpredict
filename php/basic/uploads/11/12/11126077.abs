Title: String Scattering Amplitudes in High Energy Limits
Authors: Yi Yang and Jenchi Lee
Abstract: A very review of string scattering amplitudes in two important high energy limits: hard scattering and Regge scattering. Recent results of the symmetries in string theory by studying high energy string scattering anplitudes are showed.
