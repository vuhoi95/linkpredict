Title: The Faddeev-Mickelsson-Shatashvili anomaly and lifting bundle gerbes
Authors: Pedram Hekmati and Michael K. Murray and Danny Stevenson and Raymond F. Vozzo
Abstract: In gauge theory, the Faddeev-Mickelsson-Shatashvili anomaly arises as a prolongation problem for the action of the gauge group on a bundle of projective Fock spaces. In this paper, we study this anomaly from the point of view of bundle gerbes and give several equivalent descriptions of the obstruction. These include lifting bundle gerbes with non-trivial structure group bundle and bundle gerbes related to the caloron correspondence.
