Title: Classical and Quantum Bianchi Type III vacuum Horava - Lifshitz  Cosmology
Authors: T. Christodoulakis and N. Dimakis
Abstract: A diagonal Bianchi Type III space-time is treated, both at the classical and quantum level, in the context of Horava - Lifshitz gravity. The system of the classical equations of motion is reduced to one independent Abel's equation of the first kind. Closed form solution are presented for various values of the coupling constants appearing in the action. Due to the method used, solutions of Euclidean, Lorentzian and neutral signature are attained. The solutions corresponding to \lamda <> 1 are seen to develop curvature singularities as the other constants approach their Einsteinian values, in contrast to those with \lamda = 1 which tend to the known Einstein gravity solutions. At the quantum level, the resulting Wheeler-DeWitt equation is explicitly solved for \lamda = 1, \sigma = 0 and \lamda = 1/3 . The ensuing wave-functions diverge in the Einsteinian limit.
