Abstract: We use a mix of analytic and numerical methods to exhaustively study a class of asymptotically global AdS solitons and hairy black hole solutions in negative cosmological constant Einstein Maxwell gravity coupled to a charged massless scalar field. Our results depend sensitively on the charge 'e' of the scalar field. The solitonic branch of solutions we study hit the Chandrashekhar limit at finite mass at small 'e', but extends to arbitrarily large mass at larger 'e'. At low values of 'e' no hairy black holes exist. At intermediate values of 'e' hairy black holes exist above a critical charge. At large 'e' hairy black holes exist at all values of the charge. The lowest mass hairy black holes is a smooth zero entropy soliton at small charge, but a (probably) singular nonzero entropy hairy black hole at larger charge. In a phase diagram of solutions, the hairy black holes merge with the familiar Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS black holes along a curve that is determined by the onset of the superradiant instability in the latter family.
