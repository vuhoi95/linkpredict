Title: Conformal Symmetry for Black Holes in Four Dimensions
Authors: Mirjam Cvetic and Finn Larsen
Abstract: We show that the asymptotic boundary conditions of general asymptotically flat black holes in four dimensions can be modified such that a conformal symmetry emerges. The black holes with the asymptotic geometry removed in this manner satisfy the equations of motion of minimal supergravity in five dimensions. We develop evidence that a two dimensional CFT dual of general black holes in four dimensions account for their black hole entropy.
