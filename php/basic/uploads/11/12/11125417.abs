Title: R**2 correction to BMPV black hole entropy from Kerr/CFT correspondence
Authors: Hirotaka Hayashi and Ta-Sheng Tai
Abstract: Following Kerr/CFT correspondence, we compute the entropy of five-dimensional supersymmetric rotating BMPV black holes.We successfully reproduce Iyer-Wald formula in the presence of Gauss-Bonnet terms from the viewpoint of microscopic CFT. This further supports the higher-derivative version of Kerr/CFT prescription proposed in arXiv:0903.4176 for four-dimensional extremal Kerr black holes.
