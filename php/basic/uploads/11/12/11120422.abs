Authors: Sudhaker Upadhyay and Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: We consider the BRST invariant Gribov-Zwanziger theory with appropriate horizon term in Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism. The usual infinitesimal BRST transformation is generalized by considering the parameter finite and field dependent. We show that such finite field dependent BRST transformation with suitable choice of finite parameter relates the generating functional of Gribov-Zwanziger theory to that of the Yang-Mills theory.
