Title: A note on the Cardy formula and black holes in 3d (massive) bigravity
Authors: Máximo Bañados and Miguel Pino
Abstract: We report full agreement between the Bekenstein-Hawking semiclassical entropy and Cardy's formula for black holes in 3d (massive) bigravity. Since this theory does have local bulk local excitations (a massive graviton) and black holes are not locally AdS this example provides a non-trivial test of the robustness of the Cardy formula.
