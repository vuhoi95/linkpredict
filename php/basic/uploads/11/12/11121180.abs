Title: Angles, scales and parametric renormalization
Authors: Francis Brown and Dirk Kreimer
Abstract: We decompose renormalized Feynman rules according to the scale and angle dependence of amplitudes. We use parametric representations such that the resulting amplitudes can be studied in algebraic geometry.
