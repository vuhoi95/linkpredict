Title: Gravitationally dressed Fermi Liquids, Quasiunparticles and High Tc  Superconductivity
Authors: Djordje Minic and J. J. Heremans
Abstract: We clarify the new concept of gravitationally dressed Fermi liquids we have proposed to describe the normal state of high Tc superconductors. In this note we distinguish between weakly gravitationally dressed Fermi liquids which fall in the class of the canonical Fermi liquid theory (with quasiparticle excitations), and strongly gravitationally dressed Fermi liquids (with quasiunparticle excitations) which represent the high dimensional generalization of Luttinger liquids, with specific features. Such weakly or strongly gravitationally dressed Fermi liquids lead naturally to the previously proposed effective (weak or strong) gravitationally dressed Landau-Ginsburg description of either ordinary or high Tc superconductors.
