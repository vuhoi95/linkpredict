Title: One-Loop Kahler Metric of D-Branes at Angles
Authors: Marcus Berg and Michael Haack and Jin U Kang
Abstract: We evaluate string one-loop contributions to the Kahler metric of D-brane moduli (positions and Wilson lines), in toroidal orientifolds with branes at angles. Contributions due to bulk states in the loop are known, so we focus on the contributions due to states localized at intersections of orientifold images. We show that these quantum corrections vanish. This does not follow from the usual nonrenormalization theorems of supersymmetric field theory.
