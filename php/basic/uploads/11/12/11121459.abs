Title: Deep Inelastic Scattering from Holographic Spin-One Hadrons
Authors: Ezequiel Koile and Sebastian Macaluso and Martin Schvellinger
Abstract: We study deep inelastic scattering structure functions from hadrons using different holographic dual models which describe the strongly coupled regime of gauge theories in the large $N$ limit. Particularly, we consider scalar and vector mesons obtained from holographic descriptions with fundamental degrees of freedom, corresponding to ${\cal {N}}=2$ supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. We explicitly obtain analytic expressions for the full set of eight structure functions, i.e., $F_1$, $F_2$, $g_1$, $g_2$, $b_1$, $b_2$, $b_3$, $b_4$, arising from the standard decomposition of the hadronic tensor of spin-one hadrons. We obtain the relations $2 F_1 = F_2$ and $2 b_1 = b_2$. In addition, we find $b_1 \sim {\cal {O}}(F_1)$ as suggested by Hoodbhoy, Jaffe and Manohar for vector mesons. Also, we find new relations among some of these structure functions.
