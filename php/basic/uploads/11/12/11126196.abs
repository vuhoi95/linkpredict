Title: Dynamical Hawking radiation and holographic thermalization
Authors: Paul M. Chesler and Derek Teaney
Abstract: Using gauge/gravity duality, we study the thermalization of strongly coupled N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma. We analyze the expectation value of the stress tensor and scalar correlation functions and the applicability of the fluctuation dissipation theorem. Via gauge/gravity duality, this maps into studying the equilibration of a black hole geometry and its Hawking radiation.
