Title: The Conformal Transformation in General Single Field Inflation with  Non-Minimal Coupling
Authors: Takahiro Kubota and Nobuhiko Misumi and Wade Naylor and Naoya Okuda
Abstract: The method of a conformal transformation is applied to a general class of single field inflation models with non-minimal coupling to gravity and non-standard kinetic terms, in order to reduce the cosmological perturbative calculation to the conventional minimal coupling case to all orders in perturbation theory. Our analysis is made simple by the fact that all perturbation variables in the comoving gauge are conformally invariant to all orders. The structure of the vacuum, on which cosmological correlation functions are evaluated, is also discussed. We show how quantization in the Jordan frame for non-minimally coupled inflation models can be equivalently implemented in the Einstein frame. It is thereafter argued that the general N-point cosmological correlation functions (of the curvature perturbation) are independent of the conformal frame.
