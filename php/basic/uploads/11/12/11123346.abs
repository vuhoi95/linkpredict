Title: Towards the string dual of tumbling and cascading gauge theories
Authors: Eduardo Conde and Jerome Gaillard and Carlos Nunez and Maurizio Piai and Alfonso V. Ramallo
Abstract: We build type IIB backgrounds that can be interpreted as the dual description of field theories in which the dynamics shows many non-trivial phenomena, generalizing the baryonic branch of the Klebanov-Strassler system. We illustrate the steps of the explicit construction with a particularly interesting example. The dual field theory exhibits the expected behavior of an N=1 supersymmetric gauge theory which, over different ranges of the radial direction, is undergoing a cascade of Seiberg dualities, a period of running, a cascade of Higgsings (tumbling) and finally gaugino condensation.
