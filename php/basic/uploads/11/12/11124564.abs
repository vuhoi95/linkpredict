Title: Gauge theory webs and surfaces
Authors: Ozan ErdoÄŸan and George Sterman
Abstract: We analyze the perturbative cusp and closed polygons of Wilson lines for massless gauge theories in coordinate space, and express them as exponentials of two-dimensional integrals. These integrals have geometric interpretations, which link renormalization scales with invariant distances.
