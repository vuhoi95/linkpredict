Title: Nonlinear SUSY General Relativity Theory and Significances
Authors: Kazunari Shima and Motomu Tsuda
Abstract: We show some consequences of the nonlinear supersymmetric general relativity (NLSUSYGR) theory on particle physics, cosmology and their relations. They may give new insights into the SUSY breaking mechanism, dark energy, dark matter and the low enegy superpartner particles which are compatible with the recent LHC data.
