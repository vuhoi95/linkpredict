Title: Kohn's theorem and Newton-Hooke symmetry for Hill's equations
Authors: P. M. Zhang and G. W. Gibbons and P. A. Horvathy
Abstract: Hill's equations, which first arose in the study of the Earth-Moon-Sun system, admit the two-parameter centrally extended Newton-Hooke symmetry without rotations. This symmetry allows for extending Kohn's theorem about the center-of-mass decomposition. Particular light is shed on the problem using Duval's "Bargmann" framework. The separation of the center-of-mass motion into that of a guiding center and relative motion is derived by a generalized chiral decomposition.
