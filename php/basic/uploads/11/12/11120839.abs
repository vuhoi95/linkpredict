Title: On factorizing $F$-matrices in $Y(sl_n)$ and $U_q(\hat{sl_n})$ spin  chains
Authors: S. G. Mc Ateer and M. Wheeler
Abstract: We consider quantum spin chains arising from $N$-fold tensor products of the fundamental evaluation representations of $Y(sl_n)$ and $U_q(\hat{sl_n})$. Using the partial $F$-matrix formalism from the seminal work of Maillet and Sanchez de Santos, we derive a completely factorized expression for the $F$-matrix of such models and prove its equivalence to the expression obtained by Albert, Boos, Flume and Ruhlig. A new relation between the $F$-matrices and the Bethe eigenvectors of these spin chains is given.
