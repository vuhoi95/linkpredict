Title: Correlators in W_N Minimal Model Revisited
Authors: Chi-Ming Chang and Xi Yin
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of sphere and torus correlation functions in the W_N minimal model. In particular, we show that a large class of exact sphere three-point functions of W_N primaries, derived using affine Toda theory, exhibit large N factorization. This allows us to identify some fundamental particles and their bound states in the holographic dual, including light states. We also derive the torus two-point function of basic primaries, by directly constructing the relevant conformal blocks. The result can then be analytically continued to give the Lorentzian thermal two-point functions.
