Title: Thermodynamic Laws and Equipartition Theorem in Relativistic Brownian  Motion
Authors: T. Koide and T. Kodama
Abstract: We extend the stochastic energetics to a relativistic system. The thermodynamic laws and equipartition theorem are discussed for a relativistic Brownian particle and the first and the second law of thermodynamics in this formalism are derived. The relation between the relativistic equipartition relation and the rate of heat transfer is discussed in the relativistic case together with the nature of the noise term.
