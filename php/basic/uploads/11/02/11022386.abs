Title: Pseudo-Goldstini in Field Theory
Authors: Riccardo Argurio and Zohar Komargodski and Alberto Mariotti
Abstract: We consider two SUSY-breaking hidden sectors which decouple when their respective couplings to the visible particles are switched off. In such a scenario one expects to find two light fermions: the Goldstino and the pseudo-Goldstino. While the former remains massless in the rigid limit, the latter becomes massive due to radiative effects which we analyze from several different points of view. This analysis is greatly facilitated by a version of the Goldberger-Treiman relation, which allows us to write a universal non-perturbative formula for the mass. We carry out the analysis in detail in the context of gauge mediation, where we find that the pseudo-Goldstino mass is at least around the GeV scale and can be easily at the electroweak range, even in low scale models. This leads to interesting and unconventional possibilities in collider physics and it also has potential applications in cosmology.
