Title: SUSY Gauge Theories on Squashed Three-Spheres
Authors: Naofumi Hama and Kazuo Hosomichi and Sungjay Lee
Abstract: We study Euclidean 3D N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories on squashed three-spheres preserving isometries SU(2) x U(1) or U(1) x U(1). We show that, when a suitable background U(1) gauge field is turned on, these squashed spheres support charged Killing spinors and therefore N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories. We present the Lagrangian and supersymmetry rules for general gauge theories. The partition functions are computed using localization principle, and are expressed as integrals over Coulomb branch. For the squashed sphere with U(1) x U(1) isometry, its measure and integrand are identified with the building blocks of structure constants in Liouville or Toda conformal field theories with b \neq 1.
