Title: Non-Relativistic Solutions of N=2 Gauged Supergravity
Authors: Nick Halmagyi and Michela Petrini and Alberto Zaffaroni
Abstract: We find infinite families of supersymmetric solutions of four dimensional, N=2 gauged supergravity with Lifshitz, Schrodinger and also AdS symmetries. We focus on the canonical example of a single hypermultiplet and a single vector multiplet and find that the spectrum of solutions depends crucially on whether the gaugings are electric or magnetic but to a far milder extent on the strength of the gaugings. For purely electric or purely magnetic gaugings we generically find Lifshitz solutions, while for a mixed gauging we find Schrodinger and AdS solutions. For some of the gaugings the theory has a known lift to string/M-theory thus giving a higher dimensional embedding of our solutions.
