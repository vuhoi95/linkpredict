Title: Brane inflation in background supergravity
Authors: Sayantan Choudhury and Supratik Pal
Abstract: We propose a model of inflation in the framework of brane cosmology driven by background supergravity. Starting from bulk supergravity we construct the inflaton potential on the brane and employ it to investigate for the consequences to inflationary paradigm. To this end, we derive the expressions for the important parameters in brane inflation, which are somewhat different from their counterparts in standard cosmology, using the one loop radiative corrected potential. We further estimate the observable parameters and find them to fit well with recent observational data by confronting with WMAP7 using CAMB. We also analyze the typical energy scale of brane inflation with our model, which resonates well with present estimates from cosmology and standard model of particle physics.
