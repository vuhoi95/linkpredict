Title: Holographic Fermi surfaces and bulk dipole couplings
Authors: David Guarrera and John McGreevy
Abstract: Non-Fermi liquids can be studied using holographic duality. The low energy physics of a holographic Fermi surface is controlled by an emergent scale invariance. After reviewing these developments, we generalize the holographic calculation to include in the bulk action the leading irrelevant operator, which is a dipole coupling between the spinor field and the background gauge field. We find that this dipole coupling changes the attainable low-energy scaling dimensions, and changes the locations of the Fermi surfaces in momentum space. The structure of the holographic framework for non-Fermi liquids is, however, robust under this deformation.
