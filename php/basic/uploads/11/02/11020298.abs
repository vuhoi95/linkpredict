Title: Geometry and Phase Structure of Non-Relativistic Branes
Authors: Nabamita Banerjee and Suvankar Dutta and Dileep P. Jatkar
Abstract: We use the solution generating technique, the TsT transformation, to obtain new solutions in type II string theory as well as in M-theory. We explicitly work out examples starting with rotating D3 and M2 branes as well as D1-D5-p system. Among a variety of solutions, we find many of them have asymptotic Schr\"odinger symmetry. We also device a new method of deriving free energy of black brane systems, which is more efficient than the Euclidean action procedure. We test our method on known examples before applying it to new asymptotically Schr\"odinger backgrounds. We study phase structure of these backgrounds by analysing the free energy thus derived.
