Abstract: We investigate the superconformal indices for the Chern-Simons-matter theories proposed for M2-branes probing the cones over N^{010}/Z_k, Q^{111}, M^{32} with N=2,3 supersymmetries and compare them with the corresponding dual gravity indices. For N^{010}, we find perfect agreements. In addition, for N^{010}/Z_k, we also find an agreement with the gravity index including the contributions from two types of D6-branes wrapping RP^3. For Q^{111}, we find that the model obtained by adding fundamental flavors to the N=6 theory has the right structure to be the correct model. For M^{32}, we find the matching with the gravity index modulo contributions from peculiar saddle points.
