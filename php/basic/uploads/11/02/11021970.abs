Title: Dirichlet Higgs as radion stabilizer in warped compactification
Authors: Naoyuki Haba and Kin-ya Oda and Ryo Takahashi
Abstract: We study implications of generalized non-zero Dirichlet boundary condition along with the ordinary Neumann one on a bulk scalar in the Randall-Sundrum warped compactification. First we show profiles of vacuum expectation value of the scalar under the general boundary conditions. We also investigate Goldberger-Wise mechanism in several setups with the general boundary conditions of the bulk scalar field and find that the mechanism can work under non-zero Dirichlet boundary conditions with appropriate vacuum expectation values. Especially, we show that $SU(2)_R$ triplet Higgs in the bulk left-right symmetric model with custodial symmetry can be identified with the Goldberger-Wise scalar.
