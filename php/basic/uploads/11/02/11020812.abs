Title: The Exceptional (X_{\ell}) (q)-Racah Polynomials
Authors: Satoru Odake and Ryu Sasaki
Abstract: The exceptional Racah and q-Racah polynomials are constructed. Together with the exceptional Laguerre, Jacobi, Wilson and Askey-Wilson polynomials discovered by the present authors in 2009, they exhaust the generic exceptional orthogonal polynomials of a single variable.
