Title: Momentum Spectra for Dynamically Assisted Schwinger Pair Production
Authors: Markus Orthaber and Florian Hebenstreit and Reinhard Alkofer
Abstract: Recently the dynamically assisted Schwinger mechanism, i.e., electron-positron pair production from vacuum by a combination of laser pulses with different time scales has been proposed. The corresponding results, which suggest that the rate of produced pairs is significantly enhanced by dynamical effects, are verified. Employing the framework of quantum kinetic theory intrinsically enables us to additionally provide momentum space information on the generated positron spectrum.
