Title: Semiclassical string computation of strong-coupling corrections to  dimensions of operators in Konishi multiplet
Authors: R. Roiban and A. A. Tseytlin
Abstract: Following our earlier work in arXiv:0906.4294 we show how to use semiclassical string quantization approach to compute the leading corrections to the energy of AdS_5 x S^5 string states on the first excited string level that should correspond to operators in the Konishi multiplet of N=4 SYM theory. Compared to examples in our previous paper the string solutions we consider here carry an extra component of S^5 angular momentum J. This facilitates their identification with operators in the Konishi multiplet. We show that for such string states with J=2 the coefficient of the subleading lambda^(-1/4) term in the large string tension expansion of the energy is twice the one found in arXiv:0906.4294. The resulting value matches the one found for the Konishi state in the sl(2) sector from the Y-system/TBA approach, resolving an apparent disagreement claimed earlier.
