Abstract: We study the graviton phenomenology of TeV Little String Theory by exploiting its holographic gravity dual five-dimensional theory. This dual corresponds to a linear dilaton background with a large bulk that constrains the Standard Model fields on the boundary of space. The linear dilaton geometry produces a unique Kaluza-Klein graviton spectrum that exhibits a ~ TeV mass gap followed by a near continuum of narrow resonances that are separated from each other by only ~ 30 GeV. Resonant production of these particles at the LHC is the signature of this framework that distinguishes it from large extra dimensions where the KK states are almost a continuum with no mass gap, and warped models where the states are separated by a TeV.
