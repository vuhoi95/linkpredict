Title: On R-symmetric Fixed Points and Superconformality
Authors: Ignatios Antoniadis and Matthew Buican
Abstract: An important unanswered question in quantum field theory is to understand precisely under which conditions scale invariance implies invariance under the full conformal group. While the general answer in two dimensions has been known for over twenty years, a precise non-perturbative relation between scale and conformal invariance in higher dimensions has been lacking. In this note, we specialize to four dimensions and give a full quantum mechanical proof that certain unitary R-symmetric fixed points are necessarily superconformal. Among other consequences, this result implies that the infrared fixed points of N=1 supersymmetric quantum chromodynamics are superconformal.
