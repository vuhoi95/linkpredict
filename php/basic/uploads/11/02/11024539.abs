Title: Symplectic gaugings and the field-antifield formalism
Authors: Frederik Coomans and Jan De Rydt and Antoine Van Proeyen
Abstract: We give an example of how conventional gauging methods obstruct a systematic analysis of gauged supergravities. We discuss how the embedding tensor formalism deals with these problems and argue that the gauge algebra related to the embedding tensor formalism is soft, open and reducible. We connect the embedding tensor formalism to the field-antifield (or Batalin-Vilkovisky) formalism, which is the most general formulation known for gauge theories.
