Title: Uniqueness and Self-Conjugacy of Dirac Hamiltonians in arbitrary  Gravitational Fields
Authors: M. V. Gorbatenko and V. P. Neznamov
Abstract: Proofs of two statements are provided in this paper. First, the authors prove that the formalism of the pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics allows describing the Dirac particles motion in arbitrary stationary gravitational fields. Second, it is proved that using the Parker weight operator and the subsequent transition to the \eta -representation gives the transformation of the Schroedinger equation for nonstationary metric, when the evolution operator becomes self-conjugate. The scalar products in the \eta -representation are flat, which makes possible the use of a standard apparatus for the Hermitian quantum mechanics. Based on the results of this paper the authors draw a conclusion about solution of the problem of uniqueness and self-conjugacy of Dirac Hamiltonians in arbitrary gravitational fields including those dependent on time. The general approach is illustrated by the example of Dirac Hamiltonians for several stationary metrics, as well as for the cosmologically flat and the open Friedmann models.
