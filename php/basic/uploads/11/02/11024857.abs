Title: Freudenthal Duality and Generalized Special Geometry
Authors: Sergio Ferrara and Alessio Marrani and Armen Yeranyan
Abstract: Freudenthal duality, introduced in L. Borsten, D. Dahanayake, M. J. Duff and W. Rubens, Phys.Rev. D80, 026003 (2009), and defined as an anti-involution on the dyonic charge vector in d = 4 space-time dimensions for those dualities admitting a quartic invariant, is proved to be a symmetry not only of the classical Bekenstein-Hawking entropy but also of the critical points of the black hole potential. Furthermore, Freudenthal duality is extended to any generalized special geometry, thus encompassing all N > 2 supergravities, as well as N = 2 generic special geometry, not necessarily having a coset space structure.
