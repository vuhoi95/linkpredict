Title: Comments on Mesonic Correlators in the Worldline Formalism
Authors: Adi Armoni and Oded Mintakevich
Abstract: We elaborate on how to incorporate mesonic correlators into the worldline formalism. We consider possible applications to QCD-like theories in various dimensions. We focus on large-N_c two dimensional QCD (the 't Hooft model) and relate it to a single harmonic oscillator. We also discuss the dependence of the Peskin S-parameter on the number of massless flavors and their representation and compare our expression to the corresponding expression obtained at weak coupling. Finally, we use the worldline formalism to discuss how the Veneziano limit of QCD is realized in holography in the limit of small N_f/N_c.
