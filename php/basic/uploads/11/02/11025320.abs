Title: Fermion confinement induced by geometry
Authors: C. Romero and J. B. Formiga and C. Dariescu
Abstract: We consider a five-dimensional model in which fermions are confined in a hypersurface due to an interaction with a purely geometric field. Inspired by the Rubakov-Shaposhnikov field-theoretical model, in which massless fermions can be localized in a domain wall through the interaction of a scalar field, we show that particle confinement may also take place if we endow the five-dimensional bulk with a Weyl integrable geometric structure, or if we assume the existence of a torsion field acting in the bulk. In this picture, the kind of interaction considered in the Rubakov-Shaposhnikov model is replaced by the interaction of fermions with a geometric field, namely a Weyl scalar field or a torsion field. We show that in both cases the confinement is independent of the energy and the mass of the fermionic particle. We generalize these results to the case in which the bulk is an arbitrary n-dimensional curved space.
