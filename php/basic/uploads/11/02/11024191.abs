Title: A superspace module for the FeynRules package
Authors: Claude Duhr and Benjamin Fuks
Abstract: We describe an additional module for the Mathematica package FeynRules that allows for an easy building of any N=1 supersymmetric quantum field theory, directly in superspace. After the superfield content of a specific model has been implemented, the user can study the properties of the model, such as the supersymmetric transformation laws of the associated Lagrangian, directly in Mathematica. While the model dependent parts of the latter, i.e., the soft supersymmetry-breaking Lagrangian and the superpotential, have to be provided by the user, the model independent pieces, such as the gauge interaction terms, are derived automatically. Using the strengths of the Feynrules program, it is then possible to derive all the Feynman rules associated to the model and implement them in all the Feynman diagram calculators interfaced to FeynRules in a straightforward way.
