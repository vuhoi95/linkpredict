Title: Radiative Fermion Masses in Local D-Brane Models
Authors: C. P. Burgess and Sven Krippendorf and Anshuman Maharana and Fernando Quevedo
Abstract: In the context of D-brane model building, we present a realistic framework for generating fermion masses that are forbidden by global symmetries. We show that the string theoretical Large volume scenario circumvents the standard lore that fermion masses generated by loop effects are too small in generic gravity mediated scenarios. We argue that the fact that in toric singularity models, the up quark masses have always a zero eigenvalue, corresponding to the lightest generation, is due to the presence of approximate global symmetries that we explicitly identify in del Pezzo singularities. These symmetries are broken by global effects and therefore proportional to inverse powers of the volume. We estimate the generic size of radiative corrections to fermion masses in different phenomenological manifestations of the Large volume scenario. Concrete realizations in terms of flavor violating soft-terms are estimated and contrasted with current bounds on flavour changing neutral currents. Contributions from generic extra Higgs-like fields set bounds on their masses close to the GUT scale to produce realistic fermion masses.
