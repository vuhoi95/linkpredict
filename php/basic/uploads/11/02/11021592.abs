Title: From Dimensional Reduction of 4d Spin Foam Model to Adding  Non-Gravitational Fields to 3d Spin Foam Model
Authors: Somayeh Fani and Kamran Kaviani
Abstract: A Kaluza-Klein like approach for a 4d spin foam model is considered. By applying this approach to a model based on group field theory in 4d (TOCY model), and using the Peter-Weyl expansion of the gravitational field, reconstruction of new non gravitational fields and interactions in the action are found. The perturbative expansion of the partition function produces graphs colored with su(2) algebraic data, from which one can reconstruct a 3d simplicial complex representing space-time and its geometry; (like in the Ponzano-Regge formulation of pure 3d quantum gravity), as well as the Feynman graph for typical matter fields. Thus a mechanism for generation of matter and construction of new dimensions are found from pure gravity.
