Title: Abelian Decomposition of General Relativity
Authors: Y. M. Cho and S. H. Oh and Sang-Woo Kim
Abstract: Based on the view that Einstein's theory can be interpreted as a gauge theory of Lorentz group, we decompose the gravitational connection (the gauge potential of Lorentz group) $\vGm_\mu$ into the restricted connection made of the potential of the maximal Abelian subgroup $H$ of Lorentz group $G$ and the valence connection made of $G/H$ part of the potential which transforms covariantly under Lorentz gauge transformation. With this decomposition we show that the Einstein's theory can be decomposed into the restricted part made of the restricted connection which has the full Lorentz gauge invariance and the valence part made of the valence connection which plays the role of gravitational source of the restricted gravity. We show that there are two different Abelian decomposition of Einstein's theory, the light-like (or null) decomposition and the non light-like (or non-null) decomposition, because Lorentz group has two maximal Abelian subgroups. In this decomposition the role of the metric $g_\mn$ is replaced by a four-index metric tensor $\vg_\mn$ which transforms covariantly under the Lorentz group, and the metric-compatibility condition $\nabla_\alpha g_\mn=0$ of the connection is replaced by the gauge and generally covariant condition ${\mathscr D}_\mu \vg^\mn=0$. The decomposition shows the existence of a restricted theory of gravitation which has the full general invariance but is much simpler and has less physical degrees of freedom than Einstein's theory. Moreover, it tells that the restricted gravity can be written as an Abelian gauge theory, which implies that the graviton can be described by a massless spin-one field.
