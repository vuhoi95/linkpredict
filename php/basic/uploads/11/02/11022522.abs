Title: Supergroup approach to the Hubbard model
Authors: V. Zharkov and V. Kirchanov
Abstract: Based on the revealed hidden supergroup structure, we develop a new approach to the Hubbard model. We reveal a relation of even Hubbard operators to the spinor representation of the generators of the rotation group of four-dimensional spaces. We propose a procedure for constructing a matrix representation of translation generators, yielding a curved space on which dynamic superfields are defined. We construct a new deformed nonlinear superalgebra for the regime of spinless Hubbard model fermions in the case of large on-site repulsion and evaluate the effective functional for spinless fermions.
