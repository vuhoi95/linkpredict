Title: Integrable quantum spin chains and their classical continuous  counterparts
Authors: Jean Avan and Anastasia Doikou and Konstadinos Sfetsos
Abstract: We present certain classical continuum long wave-length limits of prototype integrable quantum spin chains, and define the corresponding construction of classical continuum Lax operators. We also provide two specific examples, i.e. the isotropic and anisotropic Heisenberg models.
