Title: Strange Metallic Behaviour and the Thermodynamics of Charged Dilatonic  Black Holes
Authors: Rene Meyer and B. Gouteraux and Bom Soo Kim
Abstract: We review a recent holographic analysis arXiv:1005.4690 of charged black holes with scalar hair in view of their applications to the cuprate high temperature superconductors. We show in particular that these black holes show an interesting phase structure including critical behaviour at zero temperature or charge, describe both conductors and insulators (including holographic Mott-like insulators), generically have no residual entropy and exhibit experimentally observed scaling relations between electronic entropy, specific heat and (linear) DC resistivity. Transport properties are discussed in the companion contribution to these proceedings.
