Authors: Iosif Bena and Gregory Giecold and Mariana Grana and Nick Halmagyi and Stefano Massai
Abstract: Continuing the programme of constructing the backreacted solution corresponding to smeared anti-D3 branes in the warped deformed conifold, we solve analytically the equations governing the space of first-order deformations around this solution. We express the results in terms of at most three nested integrals. These are the simplest expressions for the space of $SU(2) \times SU(2) \times \ZZ_2$-invariant deformations, in which the putative solution for smeared anti-D3 branes must live. We also explain why one cannot claim to identify this solution without fully relating the coefficients of the infrared and ultraviolet expansions of the deformation modes. The analytic solution we find is the first step in this direction.
