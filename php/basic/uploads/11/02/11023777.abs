Title: Finite axionic electrodynamics from a new noncommutative approach
Authors: Patricio Gaete and Euro Spallucci
Abstract: Using the gauge-invariant but path-dependent variables formalism, we compute the static quantum potential for noncommutative axionic electrodynamics (or axionic electrodynamics in the presence of a minimal length). Accordingly, we obtain an ultraviolet finite static potential which is the sum of a Yukawa-type and a linear potential, leading to the confinement of static charges. Interestingly, it should be noted that this calculation involves no theta expansion at all. The present result makes manifest the key role played by the new quantum of length in our analysis.
