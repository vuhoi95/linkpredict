Title: Statistical model and BPS D4-D2-D0 counting
Authors: Takahiro Nishinaka and Satoshi Yamaguchi
Abstract: We construct a statistical model that correctly reproduces the BPS partition function of D4-D2-D0 bound states on the resolved conifold. We prove that the known partition function of the BPS indices is reproduced by the counting "triangular partitions" problem. The wall-crossing phenomena in our model are also studied.
