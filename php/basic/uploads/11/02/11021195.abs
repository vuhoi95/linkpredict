Abstract: Generalized Haag's theorem has been proved in S O (1, k) invariant quantum field theory. Apart from the above mentioned k+1 variables there can be arbitrary number of additional coordinates including noncommutative ones in the theory. New consequences of generalized Haag's theorem are obtained. It has been proved that the equality of four-point Wightman functions in two theories leads to the equality of elastic scattering amplitudes and thus the total cross-sections in these theories. In space-space noncommutative quantum field theory in four-dimensional case it has been proved that if in one of the theories under consideration S-matrix is equal to unity, then in another theory S-matrix is unity as well.
