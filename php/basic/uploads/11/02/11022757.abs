Title: Amplitudes in Noncritical Dimensions and Dimensional Regularization
Authors: Koichi Murakami and Nobuyuki Ishibashi
Abstract: We study how the dimensional regularization works in the light-cone gauge string field theory. We show that it is not necessary to add a contact term to the string field theory action as a counter term in this regularization at least at the tree level. We also investigate the one-loop amplitudes of the bosonic theory in noncritical dimensions and show that they are modular invariant.
