Title: Brane tilings and supersymmetric gauge theories
Authors: Amihay Hanany and Giuseppe Torri
Abstract: In the last few years, brane tilings have proven to be an efficient and convenient way of studying supersymmetric gauge theories living on D3-branes or M2-branes. In these pages we present a quick and simple introduction to the subject, hoping this could tickle the reader's curiosity to learn more on this extremely fascinating subject.
