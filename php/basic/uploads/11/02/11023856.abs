Title: SIM(2) and supergraphs
Authors: Stanislav Petráš and Rikard von Unge and Jiří Vohánka
Abstract: We construct Feynman rules and Supergraphs in SIM(2) superspace. To test our methods we perform a one-loop calculation of the effective action of the SIM(2) supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model including a term which explicitly breaks Lorentz invariance. The renormalization of the model is also discussed.
