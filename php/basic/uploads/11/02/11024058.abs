Title: Monopole-Antimonopole Pair Dyons with Critical Electric Charges
Authors: Kok-Geng Lim and Rosy Teh and Khai-Ming Wong
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate some electrically charged magnetic solutions of the SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs field theory in the net zero topological charge sector. We only examine the case when the Higgs field vanishes at two points along the z-axis and when the Higgs field vanishes along a ring with the z-axis as its symmetry axis. We study the possible electric charges the dyons can carry in relation to the electric-magnetic charge separations and calculate for the finite total energy and magnet dipole moment of these dyons. These stationary dyon solutions do not satisfy the first order Bogomol'nyi equations and are non BPS solutions. They are axially symmetric saddle point solutions and are characterized by the electric charge parameter, $-1<\eta< 1$, which determines the net electric charges of these dyons. These dyon solutions are solved numerically when the magnetic charges are $n$ = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5; and when the strength of the Higgs field potential is non vanishing with $\lambda=1$. When $\lambda=1$, we found that the net electric charge approaches a finite critical value as $\eta$ approaches $\pm 1$. Hence the electromagnetic charge separation, total energy, and magnet dipole moment of the dyon also approach finite critical value.
