Title: Anisotropic Extra Dimensions
Authors: Eleftherios Papantonopoulos and Antonios Papazoglou and Minas Tsoukalas
Abstract: We consider the scenario where in a five-dimensional theory, the extra spatial dimension has different scaling than the other four dimensions. We find background maximally symmetric solutions, when the bulk is filled with a cosmological constant and at the same time it has a three-brane embedded in it. These background solutions are reminiscent of Randall-Sundrum warped metrics, with bulk curvature depending on the parameters of the breaking of diffeomorphism invariance. Subsequently, we consider the scalar perturbation sector of the theory and show that it has certain pathologies and the striking feature that in the limit where the diffeomorphism invariance is restored, there remain ghost scalar mode(s) in the spectrum.
