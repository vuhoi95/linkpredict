Title: The Konishi multiplet at strong coupling
Authors: Brenno Carlini Vallilo and Luca Mazzucato
Abstract: We introduce a method to compute from first principles the anomalous dimension of short operators in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory at strong coupling, where they are described in terms of superstring vertex operators in an anti-de Sitter background. We focus on the Konishi multiplet, dual to the first massive level of the superstring, and compute the one-loop correction to its anomalous dimension at strong coupling, using the pure spinor formalism for the superstring.
