Title: General properties of multiparton webs: proofs from combinatorics
Authors: Einan Gardi and Chris D. White
Abstract: Recently, the diagrammatic description of soft-gluon exponentiation in scattering amplitudes has been generalized to the multiparton case. It was shown that the exponent of Wilson-line correlators is a sum of webs, where each web is formed through mixing between the kinematic factors and colour factors of a closed set of diagrams which are mutually related by permuting the gluon attachments to the Wilson lines. In this paper we use replica trick methods, as well as results from enumerative combinatorics, to prove that web mixing matrices are always: (a) idempotent, thus acting as projection operators; and (b) have zero sum rows: the elements in each row in these matrices sum up to zero, thus removing components that are symmetric under permutation of gluon attachments. Furthermore, in webs containing both planar and non-planar diagrams we show that the zero sum property holds separately for these two sets. The properties we establish here are completely general and form an important step in elucidating the structure of exponentiation in non-Abelian gauge theories.
