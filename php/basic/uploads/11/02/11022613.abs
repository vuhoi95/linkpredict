Title: Photon Gas Thermodynamics in Doubly Special Relativity
Authors: Xinyu Zhang and Lijing Shao and Bo-Qiang Ma
Abstract: Doubly special relativity (DSR), with both an invariant velocity and an invariant length scale, elegantly preserves the principle of relativity between moving observers, and appears as a promising candidate of the quantum theory of gravity. We study the modifications of photon gas thermodynamics in the framework of DSR with an invariant length $|\lambda|$, after properly taking into account the effects of modified dispersion relation, upper bounded energy-momentum space, and deformed integration measure. We show that with a positive $\lambda$, the grand partition function, the energy density, the specific heat, the entropy, and the pressure are smaller than those of special relativity (SR), while the velocity of photons and the ratio of pressure to energy are larger. In contrast, with a negative $\lambda$, the quantum gravity effects show up in the opposite direction. However, these effects only manifest themselves significantly when the temperature is larger than $10^{-3} E_{\rm P}$. Thus, DSR can have considerable influence on the early universe in cosmological study.
