Title: Quantum D-branes and exotic smooth R^4
Authors: Torsten Asselmeyer-Maluga and Jerzy Krol
Abstract: In this paper, we present the idea that the formalism of string theory is connected with the dimension 4 in a new way, not covered by phenomenological or model-building approaches. The main connection is given by structures induced by small exotic smooth R^4's having intrinsic meaning for physics in dimension 4. We extend the notion of stable quantum D-branes in a separable noncommutative C* algebras over convolution algebras corresponding to the codimension-1 foliations of S^3 which are mainly connected to small exotic R^4. The tools of topological K-homology and K-theory as well KK-theory describe stable quantum branes in the C* algebras when naturally extended to algebras. In case of convolution algebras, small exotic smooth R^4's embedded in exotic R^4 correspond to a generalized quantum branes on the algebras. These results extend the correspondence between exotic R^4 and classical D and NS branes from our previous work.
