Title: The electroweak S and T parameters from a fixed point condition
Authors: M. Fabbrichesi and R. Percacci and A. Tonero and L. Vecchi
Abstract: We consider the standard model without the Higgs boson, where the Goldstone modes are described by a nonlinear sigma model. We study the renormalization group flow of the sigma model coupling f and of the electroweak parameters S and T. The condition that the couplings reach a fixed point at high energy leaves the low energy values of f and T arbitrary (to be determined experimentally) and fixes S to a value compatible with electroweak precision data.
