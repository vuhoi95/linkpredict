Abstract: QCD sum rules involving mixed inverse moment integration kernels are used in order to determine the running charm-quark mass in the $\bar{MS}$ scheme. Both the high and the low energy expansion of the vector current correlator are involved in this determination. The optimal integration kernel turns out to be of the form $p(s) = 1 - (s_0/s)^2$, where $s_0$ is the onset of perturbative QCD. This kernel enhances the contribution of the well known narrow resonances, and reduces the impact of the data in the range $s \simeq 20 - 25 GeV^2$. This feature leads to a substantial reduction in the sensitivity of the results to changes in $s_0$, as well as to a much reduced impact of the experimental uncertainties in the higher resonance region. The value obtained for the charm-quark mass in the $\bar{MS}$ scheme at a scale of 3 GeV is $\bar{m}_c (3 GeV) = 987 \pm 9 MeV$, where the error includes all sources of uncertainties added in quadrature.
