Abstract: The present work discusses an approach to access the physical spectrum of the Yang-Mills theory quantized in the Landau gauge. By using recent lattice data on the gluon propagator, it is possible to study the two-point functions of gauge invariant composite operators, from which masses of glueballs can be extracted. It turns out that the momentum dependence of the gluon propagator is very well reproduced by the corresponding tree-level gluon propagator obtained from the Refined Gribov-Zwanziger theory, which takes into account the presence of the Gribov horizon as well as the effect of condensates of mass dimension two. The resulting glueball masses are in good agreement with the available lattice data
