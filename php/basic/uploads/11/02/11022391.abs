Title: State-space geometry, non-extremal black holes and Kaluza-Klein  monopoles
Authors: Stefano Bellucci and Bhupendra Nath Tiwari
Abstract: We examine the statistical nature of the charged anticharged non-extremal black holes in string theory. From the perspective of the intrinsic Riemannian Geometry, the first principle of the statistical mechanics shows that the stability properties of general nonextremal nonlarge charged black brane solutions are divulged from the positivity of the corresponding principle minors of the space-state metric tensor. Under the addition of the Kaluza-Klein monopoles, a novel aspect of the Gaussian fluctuations demonstrates that the canonical fluctuations can be ascertained without any approximation. We offer the state-space geometric implication for the most general non-extremal black brane configurations in string theory.
