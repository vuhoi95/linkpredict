Title: Quantum Corrections for a Braneworld Black Hole
Authors: Mubasher Jamil and Farhad Darabi
Abstract: By using the quantum tunneling approach over semiclassical approximations, we study the quantum corrections to the Hawking temperature, entropy and Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area relation for a black hole lying on a brane.
