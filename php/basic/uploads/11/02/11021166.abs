Title: f(R) Gravity and Maxwell Equations from the Holographic Principle
Authors: Rong-Xin Miao and Jun Meng and Miao Li
Abstract: Extending the holographic program of [1], we derive f(R) gravity and the Maxwell equations from the holographic principle, using time-like holographic screen. We find that to derive the Einstein equations and f(R) gravity in a natural holographic approach, the quasi-static condition is necessary. We also find the surface stress tensor and the surface electric current, surface magnetic current on the holographic screen for f(R) gravity and Maxwell's theory, respectively.
