Title: A Quantum Affine Algebra for the Deformed Hubbard Chain
Authors: Niklas Beisert and Wellington Galleas and Takuya Matsumoto
Abstract: The integrable structure of the one-dimensional Hubbard model is based on Shastry's R-matrix and the Yangian of a centrally extended sl(2|2) superalgebra. Alcaraz and Bariev have shown that the model admits an integrable deformation whose R-matrix has recently been found. This R-matrix is of trigonometric type and here we derive its underlying exceptional quantum affine algebra. We also show how the algebra reduces to the above mentioned Yangian and to the conventional quantum affine sl(2|2) algebra in two special limits.
