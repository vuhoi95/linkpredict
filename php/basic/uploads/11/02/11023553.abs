Title: The Generalized Uncertainty Principle in f(R) Gravity for a Charged  Black Hole
Authors: Jackson Levi Said and Kristian Zarb Adami
Abstract: Using f (R) gravity in the Palatini formularism, the metric for a charged spherically symmetric black hole is derived, taking the Ricci scalar curvature to be constant. The generalized uncertainty principle is then used to calculate the temperature of the resulting black hole, through this the entropy is found correcting the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in this case. Using the entropy the tunneling probability and heat capacity are calculated up to the order of the Planck length, which produces an extra factor that becomes important as black holes become small, such as in the case of mini black holes.
