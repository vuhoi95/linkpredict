Title: Charged Dilatonic Black Holes and their Transport Properties
Authors: Blaise Gouteraux and Bom Soo Kim and Rene Meyer
Abstract: We briefly explain the consistency conditions imposed on the effective holographic theories, which are parameterized by two real exponents $(\gamma,\delta)$ that control the IR dynamics. The general scaling of DC resistivity with temperature at low temperature and AC conductivity at low frequency across the whole $(\gamma,\delta)$ plane are explained. There is a codimension-one region where the DC resistivity is linear in the temperature. For massive carriers, it is shown that when the scalar operator is not the dilaton, the DC resistivity scales as the heat capacity (and entropy) for $(2+1)$-dimensional systems. Regions are identified where the theory at finite density is a Mott-like insulator. This contribution is based on arXiv:1005.4690 with emphasis on the transport properties of charged dilatonic black holes with potential.
