Title: Physically motivated uncertainty relations at the Planck length for an  emergent non commutative spacetime
Authors: Luca Tomassini and Stefano Viaggiu
Abstract: We derive new space-time uncertainty relations (STUR) at the fundamental Planck length $L_P$ from quantum mechanics and general relativity (GR), both in flat and curved backgrounds. Contrary to claims present in the literature, our approach suggests that no minimal uncertainty appears for lengths, but instead for minimal space and four-volumes. Moreover, we derive a maximal absolute value for the energy density. Finally, some considerations on possible commutators among quantum operators implying our STUR are done.
