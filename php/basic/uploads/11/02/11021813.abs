Title: Thermodynamics in NJL-like models
Authors: A. V. Friesen and Yu. L. Kalinovsky and V. D. Toneev
Abstract: Thermodynamic behavior of conventional Nambu-Jona-Lasinio and Polyakov-loop-extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio models is compared. A particular attention is paid to the phase diagram in the ($T -\mu$) plane.
