Title: Charged Lifshitz Black Holes
Authors: M. H. Dehghani and R. Pourhasan and R. B. Mann
Abstract: We investigate modifications of the Lifshitz black hole solutions due to the presence of Maxwell charge in higher dimensions for arbitrary $z$ and any topology. We find that the behaviour of large black holes is insensitive to the topology of the solutions, whereas for small black holes significant differences emerge. We generalize a relation previously obtained for neutral Lifshitz black branes, and study more generally the thermodynamic relationship between energy, entropy, and chemical potential. We also consider the effect of Maxwell charge on the effective potential between objects in the dual theory.
