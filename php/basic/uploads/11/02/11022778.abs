Title: Propagators of Generalized Schr√∂dinger Equations Related by  Higher-Order Supersymmetry
Authors: Ekaterina Pozdeeva and Axel Schulze-Halberg
Abstract: We construct explicit integral relations between propagators of generalized Schr\"odinger equations that are linked by higher-order supersymmetry. Our results complement and extend the findings obtained in J. Phys.A 40, 10557 (2007) for the conventional Schr\"odinger equation.
