Title: Supersymmetry Breaking in a Minimal Anomalous Extension of the MSSM
Authors: A. Lionetto and A. Racioppi
Abstract: We study a supersymmetry breaking mechanism in the context of a minimal anomalous extension of the MSSM. The anomaly cancellation mechanism is achieved through suitable counterterms in the effective action, i.e. Green-Schwarz terms. We assume that the standard MSSM superpotential is perturbatively realized, i.e. all terms allowed by gauge symmetries, except for the $\mu$-term which has a non-perturbative origin. The presence of this term is expected in many intersecting D-brane models which can be considered as the ultraviolet completion of our model. We show how soft supersymmetry breaking terms arise in this framework and we study the effect of some phenomenological constraints on this scenario.
