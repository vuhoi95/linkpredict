Title: Electromagnetic Casimir Energies of Semi-Infinite Planes
Authors: Mohammad F. Maghrebi and Noah Graham
Abstract: Using recently developed techniques based on scattering theory, we find the electromagnetic Casimir energy for geometries involving semi-infinite planes, a case that is of particular interest in the design of microelectromechanical devices. We obtain both approximate analytic formulae and exact results requiring only modest numerical computation. Using these results, we analyze the effects of edges and orientation on the Casimir energy. We also demonstrate the accuracy, simplicity, and utility of our approximation scheme, which is based on a multiple reflection expansion.
