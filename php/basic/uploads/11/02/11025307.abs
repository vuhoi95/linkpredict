Title: Algorithmic derivation of functional renormalization group equations and  Dyson-Schwinger equations
Authors: Markus Q. Huber and Jens Braun
Abstract: We present the Mathematica application DoFun which allows to derive Dyson-Schwinger equations and renormalization group flow equations for n-point functions in a simple manner. DoFun offers several tools which considerably simplify the derivation of these equations from a given physical action. We discuss the application of DoFun by means of two different types of quantum field theories, namely a bosonic O(N) theory and the Gross-Neveu model.
