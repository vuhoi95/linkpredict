Title: The Yang Monopole in IIA Superstring: Multi-charge Disease and Enhancon  Cure
Authors: Adil Belhaj and Pablo Diaz and Antonio Segui
Abstract: A brane picture in Type IIA superstring for the Yang Monopole is reconsidered. It makes use of D2 and D4-branes wrapped on cycles in the K3 surface. When the model was first presented some problems concerning the charges of the monopoles arised. In this paper, they are shown to be cured by the model itself. Surprisingly, the incompatibility between the multi-charge configuration and the spherical symmetry of the Yang Monopole is seen in the brane description as the emergence of the enhancon shell and the fuzzy geometry. This consistency is deep and surprising, and is the point that triggered this work. It nontrivially relates a purely geometrical problem in ordinary spacetime with the emergence of noncommutative geometries. Besides, this paper includes an extended model for SO(4)-monopoles, a T-dual model in Type IIB superstring and an analysis on the possible duality between our model and another setup in M-Theory/Heterotics for the Yang monopole found before.
