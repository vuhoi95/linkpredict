Title: Modified Gravity Makes Galaxies Brighter

Abstract: We investigate the effect of modifed gravity with screening mechanisms, such as the chameleon or symmetron models, upon the structure of main sequence stars. We find that unscreened stars can be significantly more luminous and ephemeral than their screened doppelgangers. By embedding these stars into dwarf galaxies, which can be unscreened for values of the parameters not yet ruled out observationally, we show that the cumulative effect of their increased luminosity can enhance the total galactic luminosity. We estimate this enhancement and find that it can be considerable given model parameters that are still under experimental scrutiny. By looking for systematic offsets between screened dwarf galaxies in clusters and unscreened galaxies in voids, these effects could form the basis of an independent observational test that can potentially lower the current experimental bounds on the model independent parameters of these theories by and order of magnitude or more.
