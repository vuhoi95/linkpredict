Title: Hawking radiation of scalar particles from accelerating and rotating  black holes
Authors: Usman A. Gillani and Mudassar Rehman and K. Saifullah
Abstract: Hawking radiation of uncharged and charged scalars from accelerating and rotating black holes is studied. We calculate the tunneling probabilities of these particles from the rotation and acceleration horizons of these black holes. Using the tunneling method we recover the correct Hawking temperature as well.
