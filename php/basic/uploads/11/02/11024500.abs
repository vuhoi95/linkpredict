Title: Deformed brane with finite extra dimension
Authors: Yu-Xiao Liu and Chun-E Fu and Heng Guo and Hai-Tao Li
Abstract: We construct a deformed brane solution generated by a double-kink scalar field and a dilaton scalar field. In this brane scenario the extra dimension is finite, which is due to the introduction of the dilaton field with special form. The finity of the extra dimension will result in the localization of the zero mode for the vector fields. While the localization of the Kalb-Ramond fields {depends} on the coupling to the dilaton. For the fermion fields, {with different values of the dilaton-fermion coupling constant}, there are three types of the effective potential for the fermion KK modes. Moreover, we investigate the effect of the deformation of the brane on the localization, and find that the number of the resonances will increase with the distances of the two sub-branes.
