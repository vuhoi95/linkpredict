Title: A rigid Calabi--Yau 3-fold
Authors: Sara Angela Filippini and Alice Garbagnati
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to analyze some geometric properties of the rigid Calabi--Yau threefold $\mathcal{Z}$ obtained by a quotient of $E^3$, where $E$ is a specific elliptic curve. We describe the cohomology of $\mathcal{Z}$ and give a simple formula for the trilinear form on $Pic(\mathcal{Z})$. We describe some projective models of $\mathcal{Z}$ and relate these to its generalized mirror. A smoothing of a singular model is a Calabi--Yau threefold with small Hodge numbers which was not known before.
