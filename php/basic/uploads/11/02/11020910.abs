Title: Fuzzy extra dimensions and particle physics models
Authors: Athanasios Chatzistavrakidis and Harold Steinacker and George Zoupanos
Abstract: In the present contribution the construction of particle physics models in theories with fuzzy extra dimensions is discussed. We focus on a bottom-up approach where the structure of a higher-dimensional theory arises within ordinary four-dimensional field theory via an appropriate mechanism based on spontaneous symmetry breaking. Subsequently, possible ways to obtain particle physics models with realistic spectrum in this framework are exhibited.
