Title: Eluding SUSY at every genus on stable closed string vacua
Authors: Sergio L. Cacciatori and Matteo A. Cardella
Abstract: In closed string vacua, ergodicity of unipotent flows provide a key for relating vacuum stability to the UV behavior of spectra and interactions. Infrared finiteness at all genera in perturbation theory can be rephrased in terms of cancelations involving only tree-level closed strings scattering amplitudes. This provides quantitative results on the allowed deviations from supersymmetry on perturbative stable vacua. From a mathematical perspective, diagrammatic relations involving closed string amplitudes suggest a relevance of unipotent flows dynamics for the Schottky problem and for the construction of the superstring measure.
