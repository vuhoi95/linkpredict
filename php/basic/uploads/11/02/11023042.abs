Title: Complex linear superfield as a model for Goldstino
Authors: Sergei M. Kuzenko and Simon J. Tyler
Abstract: We propose a Goldstino model formulated in terms of a constrained complex linear superfield. Its comparison to other Goldstino models is given. Couplings to supersymmetric matter and supergravity are briefly described.
