Title: Gauge Mediation of Supersymmetry Breaking and the Froggatt-Nielsen  Mechanism
Authors: Zhong-hua Zhang and Da-Xin Zhang
Abstract: In the model of gauge mediation of SUSY breaking in the presence of tree-level mediation, the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism provides a different hierarchy of sparticle masses. We study the spectra and show the results to be like those in an effective supersymmetric model.
