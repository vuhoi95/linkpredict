Title: Constructing local bulk observables in interacting AdS/CFT
Authors: Daniel Kabat and Gilad Lifschytz and David A. Lowe
Abstract: Local operators in the bulk of AdS can be represented as smeared operators in the dual CFT. We show how to construct these bulk observables by requiring that the bulk operators commute at spacelike separation. This extends our previous work by taking interactions into account. Large-N factorization plays a key role in the construction. We show diagrammatically how this procedure is related to bulk Feynman diagrams.
