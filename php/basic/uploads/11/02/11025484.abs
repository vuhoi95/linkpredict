Title: Interacting Theory of Chiral Bosons and Gauge Fields on Noncommutative  Extended Minkowski Spacetime
Authors: Yan-Gang Miao and Ying-Jie Zhao
Abstract: Several interacting models of chiral bosons and gauge fields are investigated on the noncommutative extended Minkowski spacetime which was recently proposed from a new point of view of disposing noncommutativity. The models include the bosonized chiral Schwinger model, the generalized chiral Schwinger model (GCSM) and its gauge invariant formulation. We establish the Lagrangian theories of the models, and then derive the Hamilton's equations in accordance with the Dirac's method and solve the equations of motion, and further analyze the self-duality of the Lagrangian theories in terms of the parent action approach.
