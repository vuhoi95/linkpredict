Title: Zeros of the exceptional Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials
Authors: C. -L. Ho and R. Sasaki
Abstract: An interesting discovery in the last two years in the field of mathematical physics has been the exceptional $X_\ell$ Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials. Unlike the well-known classical orthogonal polynomials which start with constant terms, these new polynomials have the lowest degree $\ell=1,2,...$, and yet they form complete sets with respect to some positive-definite measure. In this paper, we study one important aspect of these new polynomials, namely, the behaviors of their zeros as some parameters of the Hamiltonians change.
