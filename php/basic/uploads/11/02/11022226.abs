Title: Discrete and continuum third quantization of Gravity
Authors: Steffen Gielen and Daniele Oriti
Abstract: We give a brief introduction to matrix models and the group field theory (GFT) formalism as realizations of the idea of a third quantization of gravity, and present in some more detail the idea and basic features of a continuum third quantization formalism in terms of a field theory on the space of connections, building up on the results of loop quantum gravity that allow to make the idea slightly more concrete. We explore to what extent one can rigorously define such a field theory. Concrete examples are given for the simple case of Riemannian GR in 3 spacetime dimensions. We discuss the relation between GFT and this formal continuum third quantized gravity, and what it can teach us about the continuum limit of GFTs.
