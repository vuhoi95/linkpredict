Title: Perturbation Theory in k-Inflation Coupled to Matter
Authors: Philippe Brax and Emeline Cluzel
Abstract: We consider k-inflation models where the action is a non-linear function of both the inflaton and the inflaton kinetic term. We focus on a scalar-tensor extension of k-inflation coupled to matter for which we derive a modified Mukhanov-Sasaki equation for the curvature perturbation. Significant corrections to the power spectrum appear when the coupling function changes abruptly along the inflationary trajectory. This gives rise to a modification of Starobinsky's model of perturbation features. We analyse the way the power spectrum is altered in the infrared when such features are present.
