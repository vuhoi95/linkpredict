Title: Reproducing neutrino effects on the matter power spectrum through a  degenerate Fermi gas approach
Authors: E. L. D. Perico and Alex E. Bernardini
Abstract: Modifications on the predictions about the matter power spectrum based on the hypothesis of a tiny contribution from a degenerate Fermi gas (DFG) test-fluid to some dominant cosmological scenario are investigated. Reporting about the systematic way of accounting for all the cosmological perturbations, through the Boltzmann equation we obtain the analytical results for density fluctuation, $\delta$, and fluid velocity divergence, $\theta$, of the DFG. Small contributions to the matter power spectrum are analytically obtained for the radiation-dominated background, through an ultra-relativistic approximation, and for the matter-dominated and $\Lambda$-dominated eras, through a non-relativistic approximation. The results can be numerically reproduced and compared with those of considering non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic neutrinos into the computation of the matter power spectrum. Lessons concerning the formation of large scale structures of a DFG are depicted, and consequent deviations from standard $\Lambda$CDM predictions for the matter power spectrum (with and without neutrinos) are quantified.
