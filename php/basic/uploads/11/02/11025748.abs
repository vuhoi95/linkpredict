Title: A Spinning Particle in a Mobius Strip
Authors: J. A. Nieto and R. Perez-Enriquez
Abstract: We develop the classical and quantum theory of a spinning particle moving in a Mobius strip. We first propose a Lagrangian for such a system and then we proceed to quantize the system via the constraint Hamiltonian system formalism. Our results may be of particular interest in several physical scenarios, including solid state physics and optics. In fact, the present work may shed some new light on the recent discoveries on condensed matter concerning topological insulators.
