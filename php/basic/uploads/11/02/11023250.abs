Title: Gauged Lifshitz scalar field theories in two dimensions
Authors: Myungseok Eune and Wontae Kim and Edwin J. Son
Abstract: We present two-dimensional gauged Lifshitz scalar field theories by considering the duality relation between the source current and the Noether current. Requiring the duality partially, we obtain a gauged model which recovers the bosonized Schwinger model for the IR limit. For the exact duality, however, the source current is not conserved, which means that the resulting theory is anomalous, so that the number of degrees of freedom is increased. The second model is consistently formulated by adding the Wess-Zumino type action to maintain the gauge invariance.
