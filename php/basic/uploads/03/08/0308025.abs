Title: The Cornell confining potential from spontaneous breaking of scale  symmetry
Authors: P. Gaete and E. I. Guendelman
Abstract: We show that one can obtain naturally the Cornell confining potential from the spontaneous symmetry breaking of scale invariance in gauge theory. At the classical level a confining force is obtained and at the quantum level, using a gauge invariant but path-dependent variables formalism, the Cornell confining potential is explicitly obtained.
