Title: Chiral zero modes in non local domain walls
Authors: C. D. Fosco and G. Torroba
Abstract: We study a generalization of the Callan-Harvey mechanism to the case of a non local mass. Using a 2+1 model as a concrete example, we show that both the existence and properties of localized zero modes can also be consistently studied when the mass is non local. After dealing with some general properties of the resulting integral equations, we show how non local masses naturally arise when radiative corrections are included. We do that for a 2+1 dimensional example, and also evaluate the zero mode of the resulting non local Dirac operator.
