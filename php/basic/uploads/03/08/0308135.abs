Title: Confinement versus Chiral Symmetry
Authors: Agnes Mocsy and Francesco Sannino and Kimmo Tuominen
Abstract: We construct an effective Lagrangian which illustrates why color deconfines when chiral symmetry is restored in hot gauge theories with quarks in the fundamental representation. For quarks in the adjoint representation we show that while deconfinement and the chiral transition do not need to coincide, entanglement between them is still present. Extension to the chemical potential driven transition is discussed.
