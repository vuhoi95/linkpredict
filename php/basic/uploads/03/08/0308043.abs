Title: A Hopf laboratory for symmetric functions
Authors: Bertfried Fauser and P. D. Jarvis
Abstract: An analysis of symmetric function theory is given from the perspective of the underlying Hopf and bi-algebraic structures. These are presented explicitly in terms of standard symmetric function operations. Particular attention is focussed on Laplace pairing, Sweedler cohomology for 1- and 2-cochains, and twisted products (Rota cliffordizations) induced by branching operators in the symmetric function context. The latter are shown to include the algebras of symmetric functions of orthogonal and symplectic type. A commentary on related issues in the combinatorial approach to quantum field theory is given.
