Title: Evolution of gravitational waves in Randall-Sundrum cosmology
Authors: Richard Easther and David Langlois and Roy Maartens and David Wands
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of gravitational wave perturbations about a brane cosmology embedded in a five-dimensional anti-de Sitter bulk. During slow-roll inflation in a Randall-Sundrum brane-world, the zero mode of the 5-dimensional graviton is generated, while the massive modes remain in their vacuum state. When the zero mode re-enters the Hubble radius during radiation domination, massive modes are generated. We show that modes decouple in the low-energy/near-brane limit and develop perturbative techniques to calculate the mode-mixing at finite energy.
