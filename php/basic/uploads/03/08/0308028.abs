Abstract: Propagators of diagonal and off-diagonal gluons are studied numerically in the Maximally Abelian gauge of the SU(2) lattice gauge theory. We have found the strong enhancement of the diagonal gluon in the infrared region. The enhancement factor is about 50 at the smallest available momentum, 325 MeV. We discuss also various analytical fits to the propagators.
