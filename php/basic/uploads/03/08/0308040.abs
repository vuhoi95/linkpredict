Title: Finite matrix model of quantum Hall fluids on $S^2$
Authors: Yi-Xin Chen and Mark D. Gould and Yao-Zhong Zhang
Abstract: Based on Haldane's spherical geometrical formalism of two-dimensional quantum Hall fluids, the relation between the noncommutative geometry of $S^2$ and the two-dimensional quantum Hall fluids is exhibited. If the number of particles $N$ is infinitely large, two-dimensional quantum Hall physics can be precisely described in terms of the noncommutative U(1) Chern-Simons theory proposed by Susskind, like in the case of plane. However, for the finite number of particles on two-sphere, the matrix-regularized version of noncommutative U(1) Chern-Simons theory involves in spinor oscillators. We establish explicitly such a finite matrix model on two-sphere as an effective description of fractional quantum Hall fluids of finite extent. The complete sets of physical quantum states of this matrix model are determined, and the properties of quantum Hall fluids related to them are discussed. We also describe how the low-lying excitations are constructed in terms of quasiparticle and quasihole excitations in the matrix model. It is shown that there consistently exists a Haldane's hierarchical structure of two-dimensional quantum Hall fluid states in the matrix model. These hierarchical fluid states are generated by the parent fluid state for particles by condensing the quasiparticle and quasihole excitations level by level, without any requirement of modifications of the matrix model.
