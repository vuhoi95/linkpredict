Title: Constraints on the Detectability of Cosmic Topology from Observational  Uncertainties
Authors: B. Mota and M. J. Reboucas and R. Tavakol
Abstract: Recent observational results suggest that our universe is nearly flat and well modelled within a $\Lambda$CDM framework. The observed values of $\Omega_{m}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ inevitably involve uncertainties. Motivated by this, we make a systematic study of the necessary and sufficient conditions for undetectability as well as detectability (in principle) of cosmic topology (using pattern repetition) in presence of such uncertainties. We do this by developing two complementary methods to determine detectability for nearly flat universes. Using the first method we derive analytical conditions for undetectability for infinite redshift, the accuracy of which is then confirmed by the second method. Estimates based on WMAP data together with other measurements of the density parameters are used to illustrate both methods, which are shown to provide very similar results for high redshifts.
