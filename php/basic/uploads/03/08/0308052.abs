Title: Exactly soluble model for self-gravitating D-particles with the wormhole
Authors: Won Tae Kim and Edwin J. Son
Abstract: We consider D-particles coupled to the CGHS dilaton gravity and obtain the exact wormhole geometry and trajectories of D-particles by introducing the exotic matter. The initial static wormhole background is not stable after infalling D-particles due to the classical backreaction of the geometry so that the additional exotic matter source should be introduced for the stability. Then, the traversable wormhole geometry naturally appears and the D-particles can travel through it safely. Finally, we discuss the dynamical evolution of the wormhole throat and the massless limit of D-particles.
