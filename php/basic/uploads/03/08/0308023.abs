Title: Determination of monopole condensate from monopole action in quenched  SU(2) QCD
Authors: M. N. Chernodub and Katsuya Ishiguro and Tsuneo Suzuki
Abstract: We study the effective monopole action obtained in the Maximal Abelian projection of quenched SU(2) lattice QCD. We determine the quadratic part of the lattice action using analytical blocking from continuum dual superconductor model to the lattice model. The leading contribution to the quadratic action depends explicitly on value of the monopole condensate. We show that the analytical monopole action matches the numerically obtained action in quenched SU(2) QCD with a good accuracy. The comparison of numerical and analytical results gives us the value of the monopole condensate in quenched SU(2) QCD, 243(42) MeV.
