Title: Self-consistent theory of compact QED3 with relativistic fermions
Authors: Matthew J. Case and Babak H. Seradjeh and Igor F. Herbut
Abstract: We consider three dimensional quantum electrodynamics (cQED3) with massless relativistic fermions coupled to a compact gauge field using a combined perturbative variational approach. Coupling to matter renders the bare interaction between magnetic monopoles logarithmic at large distances, suggesting the possibility of a confinement-deconfinement transition of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type in the theory. Our self-consistent calculation suggests, however, that screening effects always destabilise the confined phase, in agreement with the previous renormalisation group study of the same model.
