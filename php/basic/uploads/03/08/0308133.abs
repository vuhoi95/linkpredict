Title: Compactifications with S-Duality Twists
Authors: Chris Hull and Aybike Catal-Ozer
Abstract: We consider generalised Scherk Schwarz reductions of supergravity and superstring theories with twists by electromagnetic dualities that are symmetries of the equations of motion but not of the action, such as the S-duality of D=4, N=4 super-Yang-Mills coupled to supergravity. The reduction cannot be done on the action itself, but must be done either on the field equations or on a duality invariant form of the action, such as one in the doubled formalism in which potentials are introduced for both electric and magnetic fields. The resulting theory in odd-dimensions has massive form fields satisfying a self-duality condition $dA \sim m*A$. We construct such theories in D=3,5,7.
