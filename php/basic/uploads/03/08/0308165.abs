Title: Probable ratio of the vacuum energy in a Schwarzchild-de Sitter space
Authors: Li Xiang and Y. G. Shen
Abstract: The effects of the generalized uncertainty principle({\bf GUP}) on the cosmological constant problem are discussed in the Schwarzchild-deSitter spacetime, through studying the corrections to its thermodynamics. We derive the correction to the Hawking temperature of the cosmological horizon, by a heuristic method enlighten by gr-qc/0106080 . The logarithmic correction to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is also obtained. For an ordinary star (not a black hole), the probable ratio of the vacuum energy to the total energy within the cosmological horizon is 2/3, which roughly coincides with the evidences from the astronomical observations. For a black hole, the ratio tends to decrease. An inequality associating the energy density with the length of system is put forward for understanding the smallness of the cosmological constant, and the relation between the Bekenstein entropy bound and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is also briefly discussed.
