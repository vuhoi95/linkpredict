Title: Enhancement of Non-Gaussianity after Inflation
Authors: N. Bartolo and S. Matarrese and A. Riotto
Abstract: We study the evolution of cosmological perturbations on large scales, up to second order, for a perfect fluid with generic equation of state. Taking advantage of super-horizon conservation laws, it is possible to follow the evolution of the non-Gaussianity of perturbations through the different stages after inflation. We find that a large non-linearity is generated by the gravitational dynamics from the original inflationary quantum fluctuations. This leads to a significant enhancement of the tiny intrinsic non-Gaussianity produced during inflation in single-field slow-roll models.
