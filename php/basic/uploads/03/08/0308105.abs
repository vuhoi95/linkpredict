Title: Two-dimensional superstrings and the supersymmetric matrix model
Authors: John McGreevy and Sameer Murthy and Herman Verlinde
Abstract: We present evidence that the supersymmetric matrix model of Marinari and Parisi represents the world-line theory of N unstable D-particles in type II superstring theory in two dimensions. This identification suggests that the matrix model gives a holographic description of superstrings in a two-dimensional black hole geometry.
