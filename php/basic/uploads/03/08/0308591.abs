Title: Antiferromagnetic gap in the Hubbard model
Authors: T. Baier and E. Bick and C. Wetterich
Abstract: We compute the temperature dependence of the antiferromagnetic order parameter and the gap in the two dimensional Hubbard model at and close to half filling. Our approach is based on truncations of an exact functional renormalization group equation. The explicit use of composite bosonic degrees of freedom permits a direct investigation of the ordered low temperature phase. We show that the Mermin--Wagner theorem is not practically applicable for the spontaneous breaking of the continuous spin symmetry in the antiferromagnetic state. The critical behavior is dominated by the fluctuations of composite Goldstone bosons.
