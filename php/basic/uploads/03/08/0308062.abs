Title: The Darboux transformation and algebraic deformations of shape-invariant  potentials
Authors: David Gomez-Ullate and Niky Kamran and Robert Milson
Abstract: We investigate the backward Darboux transformations (addition of a lowest bound state) of shape-invariant potentials on the line, and classify the subclass of algebraic deformations, those for which the potential and the bound states are simple elementary functions. A countable family, $m=0,1,2,...$, of deformations exists for each family of shape-invariant potentials. We prove that the $m$-th deformation is exactly solvable by polynomials, meaning that it leaves invariant an infinite flag of polynomial modules $\mathcal{P}^{(m)}_m\subset\mathcal{P}^{(m)}_{m+1}\subset...$, where $\mathcal{P}^{(m)}_n$ is a codimension $m$ subspace of $<1,z,...,z^n>$. In particular, we prove that the first ($m=1$) algebraic deformation of the shape-invariant class is precisely the class of operators preserving the infinite flag of exceptional monomial modules $\mathcal{P}^{(1)}_n = < 1,z^2,...,z^n>$. By construction, these algebraically deformed Hamiltonians do not have an $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ hidden symmetry algebra structure.
