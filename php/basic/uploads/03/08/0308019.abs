Title: 2D Toda Chain, Commuting Difference Operators and Holomorphic Bundles
Authors: I. M. Krichever and S. P. Novikov
Abstract: High rank solutions to the 2D Toda Lattice System are constructed simultaneously with the effective calculation of coefficients of the high rank commuting ordinary difference operators. Our technic is based on the study of discrete dynamics of Tyurin Parameters characterizing the stable holomorphic vector bundles over the algebraic curves (Riemann Surfaces).
