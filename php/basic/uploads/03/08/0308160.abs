Title: Higgsino mass matrix ansatz for MSSM
Authors: Kang-Sin Choi and Ki-Young Choi and Kyuwan Hwang and Jihn E. Kim
Abstract: An ansatz, Det. $M_{\tilde H}=0,$ for the Higgsino mass matrix in string orbifold trinification is suggested toward the minimal supersymmetric standard model(MSSM). Small instanton solutions effective around the GUT scale can fulfil this condition. An argument that the couplings contain a moduli field is given for a dynamical realization of this Higgsino mass matrix ansatz.
