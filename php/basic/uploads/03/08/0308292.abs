Title: Tachyon Vortex
Authors: Dao-jun Liu and Xin-zhou Li
Abstract: The property and gravitational field of global string of tachyon matter are investigated in a four dimentional approximately cylindrically-symmetric spacetime with a deficit angle. Especially, we give an exact solution of the tachyon field in the flat spacetime background and we also find the solution of the metric in the linearized approximation of gravity.
