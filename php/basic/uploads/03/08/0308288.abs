Title: Kantowski-Sachs universe cannot be closed
Authors: Xin-zhou Li and Jian-gang Hao
Abstract: In this paper, by analyzing the instability against spatially homogeneous and anisotropic perturbations of the Kantowski-Sachs-type during different cosmological epoch, we show that it is a theoretical consequence of the general relativity that the KS universe must be open or flat if it underwent the matter dominated and/or radiation dominated era in its past evolution, which theoretically confirms the flatness of our observable universe.
