Title: Limits and Degenerations of Unitary Conformal Field Theories
Authors: Daniel Roggenkamp and Katrin Wendland
Abstract: In the present paper, degeneration phenomena in conformal field theories are studied. For this purpose, a notion of convergent sequences of CFTs is introduced. Properties of the resulting limit structure are used to associate geometric degenerations to degenerating sequences of CFTs, which, as familiar from large volume limits of non-linear sigma models, can be regarded as commutative degenerations of the corresponding ``quantum geometries''. As an application, the large level limit of the A-series of unitary Virasoro minimal models is investigated in detail. In particular, its geometric interpretation is determined.
