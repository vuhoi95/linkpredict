Title: Multi-dimensional classical and quantum cosmology: Exact solutions,  signature transition and stabilization
Authors: S. Jalalzadeh and F. Ahmadi and H. R. Sepangi
Abstract: We study the classical and quantum cosmology of a $(4+d)$-dimensional spacetime minimally coupled to a scalar field and present exact solutions for the resulting field equations for the case where the universe is spatially flat. These solutions exhibit signature transition from a Euclidean to a Lorentzian domain and lead to stabilization of the internal space, in contrast to the solutions which do not undergo signature transition. The corresponding quantum cosmology is described by the Wheeler-DeWitt equation which has exact solutions in the mini-superspace, resulting in wavefunctions peaking around the classical paths. Such solutions admit parametrizations corresponding to metric solutions of the field equations that admit signature transition.
