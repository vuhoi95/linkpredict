Title: No naked singularities in homogeneous, spherically symmetric bubble  spacetimes?
Authors: Olivier Sarbach and Luis Lehner
Abstract: We study the evolution of bubble spacetimes in vacuum and electrovac scenarios by numerical means. We find strong evidence against the formation of naked singularities in (i) scenarios with negative masses displaying initially collapsing conditions and (ii) scenarios with negative masses displaying initially expanding conditions, previously reported to give rise to such singularities. Additionally, we show that the presence of strong gauge fields implies that an initially collapsing bubble bounces back and expands. By fine-tuning the strength of the gauge field we find that the solution approaches a static bubble solution.
