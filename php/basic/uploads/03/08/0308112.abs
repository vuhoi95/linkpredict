Title: A quantum BRST anti-BRST approach to classical integrable systems
Authors: Michael Chesterman and Marcelo B. Silka
Abstract: We reformulate the conditions of Liouville integrability in the language of Gozzi et al.'s quantum BRST anti-BRST description of classical mechanics. The Das-Okubo geometrical Lax equation is particularly suited to this approach. We find that the Lax pair and inverse scattering wavefunction appear naturally in certain sectors of the quantum theory.
