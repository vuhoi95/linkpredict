Title: The Study of the Heisenberg-Euler Lagrangian and Some of its  Applications
Authors: S. R. Valluri and U. D. Jentschura and D. R. Lamm
Abstract: The Heisenberg-Euler Lagrangian is not only a topic of fundamental interest, but also has a rich variety of diverse applications in astrophysics, nonlinear optics and elementary particle physics etc. We discuss the series representation of this Lagrangian and a few of its applications in this study. [In an appendix, we discuss issues related to the renormalization - and the renormalization-group invariance - of the Heisenberg-Euler Lagrangian and its two-loop generalization.]
