Title: Chiral rings and GSO projection in Orbifolds
Authors: Sunggeun Lee and Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: The GSO projection in the twisted sector of orbifold background is sometimes subtle and incompatible descriptions are found in literatures. Here, from the equivalence of partition functions in NSR and GS formalisms, we give a simple rule of GSO projection for the chiral rings of string theory in $\C^r/\Z_n$, $r=1,2,3$. Necessary constructions of chiral rings are given by explicit mode analysis.
