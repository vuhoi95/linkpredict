Title: Asymptotic form of quasi-normal modes of large AdS black holes
Authors: Suphot Musiri and George Siopsis
Abstract: We discuss a method of calculating analytically the asymptotic form of quasi-normal frequencies for large AdS black holes in five dimensions. In this case, the wave equation reduces to a Heun equation. We show that the Heun equation may be approximated by a Hypergeometric equation at large frequencies. Thus we obtain the asymptotic form of quasi-normal frequencies in agreement with numerical results. We also present a simple monodromy argument that leads to the same results. We include a comparison with the three-dimensional case in which exact expressions are derived.
