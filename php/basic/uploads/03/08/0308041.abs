Title: Noncommutative Geometry, Quantum Hall Effect and Berry Phase
Authors: B. Basu and P. Bandyopadhyay
Abstract: Taking resort to Haldane's spherical geometry we can visualize fractional quantum Hall effect on the noncommutative manifold $M_4 \times Z_N$ with $N>2$ and odd. The discrete space leads to the deformation of symplectic structure of the continuous manifold such that the symplectic area is given by $\triangle p.\triangle q=2\pi m \hbar$ with $m$ an odd integer which is related to the Berry phase and the filling factor is given by $\frac{1}{m}$. We here argue that this is equivalent to the noncommutative field theory as prescribed by Susskind and Polychronakos which is characterized by area preserving diffeomorphism. The filling factor $\frac{1}{m}$ is determined from the change in chiral anomaly and hence the Berry phase as envisaged by the star product.
