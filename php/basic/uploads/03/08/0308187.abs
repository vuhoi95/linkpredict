Title: Type IIB String Backgrounds on Parallelizable PP-Waves and Conformal  Liouville Theory
Authors: M. Hssaini and M. B. Sedra
Abstract: The scope of this work concerns the adaptation of the parallelizability pp-wave (Ppp-wave) process to D=10 type IIB string backgrounds in the presence of the non-trivial anti-self dual R-R 5-form $\QTR{cal}{F}$. This is important in the sense that it gives rise to some unsuspected properties. In fact, exact solutions of type IIB string backgrounds on Ppp-waves are discussed. For the $u$-dependence of the dilaton field $\Phi $, we establish explicitly a correspondence between type IIB supergravity equations of motion and 2d-conformal Liouville field theory. We show also that the corresponding conserved conformal current $T(\Phi)$ coincides exactly with the trace of the symmetric matrix $\mu_{ij}$ appearing in the quadratic front factor $F=\mu _{ij}x^{i}x^{j}$ of the Ppp-wave. Furthermore, we consider the transverse space dependence of the dilaton $\Phi $ and show that the supergravity equations are easily solved for the linear realization of the dilaton field. Other remarkable properties related to this case are also discussed.
