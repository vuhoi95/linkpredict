Title: A String and M-theory Origin for the Salam-Sezgin Model
Authors: M. Cvetic and G. W. Gibbons and C. N. Pope
Abstract: An M/string-theory origin for the six-dimensional Salam-Sezgin chiral gauged supergravity is obtained, by embedding it as a consistent Pauli-type reduction of type I or heterotic supergravity on the non-compact hyperboloid ${\cal H}^{2,2}$ times $S^1$. We can also obtain embeddings of larger, non-chiral, gauged supergravities in six dimensions, whose consistent truncation yields the Salam-Sezgin theory. The lift of the Salam-Sezgin (Minkowski)$_4\times S^2$ ground state to ten dimensions is asymptotic at large distances to the near-horizon geometry of the NS5-brane.
