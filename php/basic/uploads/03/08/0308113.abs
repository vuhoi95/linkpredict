Title: Optical detection of fractional particle number in an atomic Fermi-Dirac  gas
Authors: Juha Javanainen and Janne Ruostekoski
Abstract: We study theoretically a Fermi-Dirac atomic gas in a one-dimensional optical lattice coupled to a coherent electromagnetic field with a topologically nontrivial soliton phase profile. We argue that the resulting fractional eigenvalues of the particle number operator can be detected via light scattering. This could be a truly quantum mechanical measurement of the particle number fractionalization in a dilute atomic gas.
