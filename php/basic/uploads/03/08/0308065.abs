Title: Quantum fluctuations of lightcone in 4-dimensional spacetime with  parallel plane boundaries
Authors: Hongwei Yu and Pu-Xun Wu
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations of lightcone are examined in a 4-dimensional spacetime with two parallel planes. Both the Dirichlet and the Neumann boundary conditions are considered. In all the cases we have studied, quantum lightcone fluctuations are greater where the Neumann boundary conditions are imposed, suggesting that quantum lightcone fluctuations depend not only on the geometry and topology of the spacetime as has been argued elsewhere but also on boundary conditions. Our results also show that quantum lightcone fluctuations are larger here than that in the case of a single plane. Therefore, the confinement of gravitons in a smaller region by the presence of a second plane reinforces the quantum fluctuations and this can be understood as a consequence of the uncertainty principle.
