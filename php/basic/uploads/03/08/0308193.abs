Title: UV divergence-free QFT on noncommutative plane
Authors: Anais Smailagic and Euro Spallucci
Abstract: We formulate Noncommutative Qauntum Field Theory in terms of fields defined as mean value over coherent states of the noncommutative plane. No *-product is needed in this formulation and noncommutativity is carried by a modified Fourier transform of fields. As a result the theory is UV finite and the cutoff is provided by the noncommutative parameter theta.
