Abstract: The local composite operator $A_{\mu}^{2}$ is analysed within the algebraic renormalization in Yang-Mills theories in linear covariant gauges. We establish that it is multiplicatively renormalizable to all orders of perturbation theory. Its anomalous dimension is computed to two-loops in the MSbar scheme.
