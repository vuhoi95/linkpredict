Title: Type IIB Colliding Plane Waves
Authors: M. Gutperle and B. Pioline
Abstract: Four-dimensional colliding plane wave (CPW) solutions have played an important role in understanding the classical non-linearities of Einstein's equations. In this note, we investigate CPW solutions in $2n+2$--dimensional Einstein gravity with a $n+1$-form flux. By using an isomorphism with the four-dimensional problem, we construct exact solutions analogous to the Szekeres vacuum solution in four dimensions. The higher-dimensional versions of the Khan-Penrose and Bell-Szekeres CPW solutions are studied perturbatively in the vicinity of the light-cone. We find that under small perturbations, a curvature singularity is generically produced, leading to both space-like and time-like singularities. For $n=4$, our results pertain to the collision of two ten-dimensional type IIB Blau - Figueroa o'Farrill - Hull - Papadopoulos plane waves.
