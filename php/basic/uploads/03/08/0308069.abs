Authors: Somdatta Bhattacharya and Sudipta Mukherji and Shibaji Roy
Abstract: Starting from the non-BPS D$(p+1)$-brane action we derive an effective action in $(p+1)$ space dimensions by studying the fluctuations of various bosonic fields around the time-like tachyonic kink solution (obtained by Wick rotation of the space-like tachyonic kink solution) of the non-BPS brane. In real time this describes the dynamics of a space-like or Euclidean brane in $(p+1)$-dimensions containing a Dirac-Born-Infeld part and a Wess-Zumino part. The WZ part is purely imaginary and so the action is complex if it represents the source of the time-dependent background of type II string theory i.e. the S-brane. On the other hand, the WZ part as well as the action is real if it represents the source in type II$^\ast$ string theory i.e. the E-brane. The DBI part is the same as obtained before using different method. This is then further illustrated by considering brane probe in space-like brane background.
