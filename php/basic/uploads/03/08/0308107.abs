Title: Superstar in Noncommutative Superspace via Covariant Quantization of the  Superparticle
Authors: Itzhak Bars and Cemsinan Deliduman and Andrea Pasqua and Bruno Zumino
Abstract: A covariant quantization method is developed for the off-shell superparticle in 10 dimensions. On-shell it is consistent with lightcone quantization, while off-shell it gives a noncommutative superspace that realizes non-linearly a hidden 11-dimensional super Poincare symmetry. The non-linear commutation rules are then used to construct the supersymmetric generalization of the covariant Moyal star product in noncommutative superspace. As one of the possible applications, we propose this new product as the star product in supersymmetric string field theory. Furthermore, the formalism introduces new techniques and concepts in noncommutative (super)geometry.
