Title: Properties of $2\times 2$ h-deformed quantum (super)matrices
Authors: Yun Li and Sicong Jing
Abstract: We investigate the $h$-deformed quantum (super)group of $2\times 2$ matrices and use a kind of contraction procedure to prove that the $n$-th power of this deformed quantum (super)matrix is quantum (super)matrix with the deformation parameter $nh$.
