Title: Quantization of Bosonic String Model in 26+2-dimensional Spacetime
Authors: Takuya Tsukioka and Yoshiyuki Watabiki
Abstract: We investigate the quantization of the bosonic string model which has a local U(1)_V * U(1)_A gauge invariance as well as the general coordinate and Weyl invariance on the world-sheet. The model is quantized by Lagrangian and Hamiltonian BRST formulations {\'a} la Batalin, Fradkin and Vilkovisky and noncovariant light-cone gauge formulation. Upon the quantization the model turns out to be formulated consistently in 26+2-dimensional background spacetime involving two time-like coordinates.
