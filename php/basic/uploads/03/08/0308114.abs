Authors: M. C. B. Abdalla and A. L. Gadelha and I. V. Vancea
Abstract: We review the construction of the $D$-branes at finite temperature as boundary states in the Fock space of thermal perturbative closed string. This is a talk presented by I. V. V. at Common Trends in Cosmology and Particle Physics June 2003, Balatonfured, Hungary.
