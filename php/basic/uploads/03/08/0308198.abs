Authors: G. Flores-Hidalgo and A. P. C. Malbouisson
Abstract: We consider a system consisting of a particle in the harmonic approximation, having frequency $\bar{\omega}$, coupled to a scalar field inside a spherical reflecting cavity of diameter $L$. By introducing {\it dressed} coordinates we define {\it dressed} states which allow a non-perturbative unified description of the radiation process, for weak and strong coupling regimes. We perform a study of the energy distribution in a small cavity, with the initial condition that the particle is in the first excited state. In the {\it weak} coupling regime, we conclude for the quasi-stability of the excited particle. For instance, for a frequency $\bar{\omega}$ of the order $\bar{\omega}\sim 4.00\times 10^{14}/s$ (in the visible red), starting from the initial condition that the particle is in the first excited level, we find that for a cavity with diameter $L\sim 1.0\times 10^{-6}m$, the probability that the particle be at any time still in the first excited level, will be of the order of 97%. For appropriate cavity dimensions, which are of the same order of those ensuring stability for weak coupling, we ensure for strong coupling the complete decay of the particle to the ground state in a small ellapsed time. Also we consider briefly the effects of a quartic interaction up to first order in the interaction parameter $\lambda$. We obtain for a large cavity an explicit $\lambda$-dependent expression for the particle radiation process. This formula is obtained in terms of the corresponding exact expression for the linear case and we conclude for the enhancement of the particle decay induced by the quartic interaction.
