Title: String theory T-duality and the zero point length of spacetime
Authors: A. Smailagic and E. Spallucci and T. Padmanabhan
Abstract: It has been often conjectured that the correct theory of quantum gravity will act as a UV regulator in the low energy limit of quantum field theory. Earlier work has shown that if the path integral defining the quantum field theory propagator is modified, so that the amplitude is invariant under the duality transformation l--> 1/l where l is the length of the path, then the propagator is UV-finite and exhibits a ``zero-point length'' of the spacetime. Since string theory uses extended structures and has a T-duality, these results should also emerge directly from string theory. We show, by explicit path integral computation, that this is indeed the case. The lowest order string theory correction to the propagator is the same as that obtained by the hypothesis of path integral duality.
