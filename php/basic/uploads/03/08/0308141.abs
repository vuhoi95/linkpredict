Title: Parallelisable Heterotic Backgrounds
Authors: Jos√© Figueroa-O'Farrill and Teruhiko Kawano and Satoshi Yamaguchi
Abstract: We classify the simply-connected supersymmetric parallelisable backgrounds of heterotic supergravity. They are all given by parallelised Lie groups admitting a bi-invariant lorentzian metric. We find examples preserving 4, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 of the 16 supersymmetries.
