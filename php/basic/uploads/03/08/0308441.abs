Title: Accelerated closed universes in scalar-tensor theories
Authors: Sergio del Campo and Patricio Salgado
Abstract: We describe an accelerating universe model in the context of a scalar-tensor theory. This model is intrinsically closed, and is filled with quintessence-like scalar field components, in addition to the Cold Dark Matter component. With a background geometry specified by the Friedman-Robertson-Walker metric, we establish conditions under which this closed cosmological model, described in a scalar-tensor theory, may look flat in a genuine Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory. Both models become indistinguishable at low enough redshift.
