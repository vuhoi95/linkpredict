Title: First-order phase transitions in confined systems
Authors: C. A. Linhares and A. P. C. Malbouisson and I. Roditi
Abstract: In a field-theoretical context, we consider the Euclidean $(\phi^4+\phi^6)_D$ model compactified in one of the spatial dimensions. We are able to determine the dependence of the transition temperature ($T_{c}$)for a system described by this model, confined between two parallel planes, as a function of the distance($L$) separating them. We show that $T_{c}$ is a concave function of $L^{-1}$. We determine a minimal separation below which the transition is suppressed.
