Title: On the embedding of branes in five-dimensional spaces
Authors: F. Dahia and C. Romero
Abstract: We investigate the embedding of four-dimensional branes in five-dimensional spaces. We firstly consider the case when the embedding space is a vacuum bulk whose energy-momentum tensor consists of a Dirac delta function with support in the brane. We then consider the embedding in the context of Randall-Sundrum-type models, taking into account $Z_{2}$ symmetry and a cosmological constant. We employ the Campbell-Magaard theorem to construct the embeddings and are led to the conclusion that the content of energy-matter of the brane does not necessarily determine its curvature. Finally, as an application to illustrate our results, we construct the embedding of Minkowski spacetime filled with dust.
