Title: Detailed Balance and Intermediate Statistics
Authors: R. Acharya and P. Narayana Swamy
Abstract: We present a theory of particles, obeying intermediate statistics ("anyons"), interpolating between Bosons and Fermions, based on the principle of Detailed Balance. It is demonstrated that the scattering probabilities of identical particles can be expressed in terms of the basic numbers, which arise naturally and logically in this theory. A transcendental equation determining the distribution function of anyons is obtained in terms of the statistics parameter, whose limiting values 0 and 1 correspond to Bosons and Fermions respectively. The distribution function is determined as a power series involving the Boltzmann factor and the statistics parameter and we also express the distribution function as an infinite continued fraction. The last form enables one to develop approximate forms for the distribution function, with the first approximant agreeing with our earlier investigation.
