Title: Rolling G_2 Moduli
Authors: Andre Lukas and Stephen Morris
Abstract: We study the time evolution of freely rolling moduli in the context of M-theory on a G_2 manifold. This free evolution approximates the correct dynamics of the system at sufficiently large values of the moduli when effects from non-perturbative potentials and flux are negligible. Moduli fall into two classes, namely bulk moduli and blow-up moduli. We obtain a number of non-trivial solutions for the time-evolution of these moduli. As a generic feature, we find the blow-up moduli always expand asymptotically at early and late time.
