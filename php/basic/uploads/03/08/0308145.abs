Title: A plausible upper limit on the number of e-foldings
Authors: Bin Wang and Elcio Abdalla
Abstract: Based solely on the arguments relating Friedmann equation and the Cardy formula we derive a bound for the number of e-folds during inflation for a standard Friedmann-Robertson-Walker as well as non-standard four dimensional cosmology induced by a Randall-Sundrum-type model.
