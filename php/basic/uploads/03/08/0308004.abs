Abstract: The length distribution and the monopole action of the infrared monopole clusters are studied numerically in quenched SU(2) QCD. We determine the effective entropy of the monopole currents which turns out to be a descending function of the blocking scale, indicating that the effective degrees of freedom of the extended monopoles are getting smaller as the blocking scale increases.
