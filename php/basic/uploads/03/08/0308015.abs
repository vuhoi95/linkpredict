Title: Mariño-Vafa Formula and Hodge Integral Identities
Authors: Chiu-Chu Melissa Liu and Kefeng Liu and Jian Zhou
Abstract: In this note we derive some consequences from the Mari\~no-Vafa formula and the cut-and-join equation, these include unified simple proofs of the $\lambda_g$ conjecture and some other Hodge integral identities. We also describe a proof of the ELSV formula relating Hurwitz numbers and Hodge integrals by using the cut-and-join equation, following our proof of the Mari\~no-Vafa formula.
