Title: Gravitational Localization of Matters in 6D
Authors: P. Midodashvili and L. Midodashvili
Abstract: We present a new 3-brane solution to Einstein's equations in (1+5)-spacetime with a negative bulk cosmological constant. This solution is a stringlike defect solution with decreasing scale function approaching a finite non-zero value in the radial infinity. It is shown that all local fields are localized on the brane only through the gravitational interaction.
