Title: The minimal conformal O(N) vector sigma model at d=3
Authors: Thorsten Leonhardt and Werner Ruehl
Abstract: For the minimal O(N) sigma model, which is defined to be generated by the O(N) scalar auxiliary field alone, all n-point functions, till order 1/N included, can be expressed by elementary functions without logarithms. Consequently, the conformal composite fields of m auxiliary fields possess at the same order such dimensions, which are m times the dimension of the auxiliary field plus the order of differentiation.
