Title: A String Motivated Approach to the Relativistic Point Particle
Authors: Michael Tuite and Siddhartha Sen
Abstract: Using concepts developed in string theory, Cohen, Moore, Nelson and Polchinski calculated the propagator for a relativistic point particle. Following these authors we extend the technique to include the case of closed world lines. The partition function found corresponds to the Feynmann and Schwinger proper time formalism. We also explicitly verify that the partition function is equivalent to the usual path length action partition function. As an example of a sum over closed world lines, we compute the Euler-Heisenberg effective Lagrangian in a novel way.
