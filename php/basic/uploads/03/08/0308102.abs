Title: D=4 supergravity dynamically coupled to superstring in a superfield  Lagrangian approach
Authors: Igor A. Bandos and Jose M. Isidro
Abstract: We elaborate a full superfield description of the interacting system of dynamical D=4, N=1 supergravity and dynamical superstring. As far as minimal formulation of the simple supergravity is used, such a system should contain as well the tensor (real linear) multiplet which describes the dilaton and the two-superform gauge field whose pull-back provides the Wess-Zumino term for the superstring. The superfield action is given by the sum of the Wess-Zumino action for D=4, N=1 superfield supergravity, the superfield action for the tensor multiplet in curved superspace and the Green-Schwarz superstring action. The latter includes the coupling to the tensor multiplet both in the Nambu-Goto and in the Wess-Zumino terms. We derive superfield equations of motion including, besides the superfield supergravity equations with the source, the source-full superfield equations for the linear multiplet. The superstring equations keep the same form as for the superstring in supergravity and 2-superform background. The analysis of gauge symmetries shows that the superfield description of the interacting system is gauge equivalent to the dynamical system described by the sum of the spacetime, component action for supergravity interacting with tensor multiplet and of the purely bosonic string action.
