Title: Perturbative calculation of quasi-normal modes of Schwarzschild black  holes
Authors: Suphot Musiri and George Siopsis
Abstract: We discuss a systematic method of analytically calculating the asymptotic form of quasi-normal frequencies of a four-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole by expanding around the zeroth-order approximation to the wave equation proposed by Motl and Neitzke. We obtain an explicit expression for the first-order correction and arbitrary spin. Our results are in agreement with the results from WKB and numerical analyses in the case of gravitational waves.
