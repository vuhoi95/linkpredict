Title: Time Quantization and q-Deformations
Authors: Claudio Albanese and Stephan Lawi
Abstract: We extend to quantum mechanics the technique of stochastic subordination, by means of which one can express any semi-martingale as a time-changed Brownian motion. As examples, we considered two versions of the q-deformed Harmonic oscillator in both ordinary and imaginary time and show how these various cases can be understood as different patterns of time quantization rules.
