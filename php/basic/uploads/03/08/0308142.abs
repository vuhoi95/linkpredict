Title: On the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for second class constrained systems
Authors: K D Rothe and F G Scholtz
Abstract: We discuss a general procedure for arriving at the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of second-class constrained systems, and illustrate it in terms of a number of examples by explicitely obtaining the respective Hamilton principal function, and verifying that it leads to the correct solution to the Euler-Lagrange equations.
