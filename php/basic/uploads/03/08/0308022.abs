Title: Naturally Light Fermions from Dimensional Reduction
Authors: W. Bietenholz and A. Gfeller and U. -J. Wiese
Abstract: We consider the 3-d Gross-Neveu model in the broken phase and construct a stable brane world by means of a domain wall and an anti-wall. Fermions of opposite chirality are localized on the walls and coupled through the 3-d bulk. At large wall separation \beta the 2-d correlation length diverges exponentially, hence a 2-d observer cannot distinguish this situation from a 2-d space-time. The 3-d 4-fermion coupling and \beta fix the effective 2-d coupling such that the asymptotic freedom of the 2-d model arises. This mechanism provides criticality without fine tuning.
