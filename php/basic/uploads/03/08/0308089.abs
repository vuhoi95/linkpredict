Title: Coherent Production of Pairs of Parabosons of Order 2
Authors: Nicholas Frascino and Charles A. Nelson
Abstract: A parameter-free statistical model is used to study multiplicity signatures for coherent production of charged-pairs of parabosons of order p=2 in comparison with those arising in the case of ordinary bosons, p=1. Two non-negative real parameters arise because "ab" and "ba" are fundamentally distinct pair operators of charge "+1", A-quanta and charge "-1", B-quanta parabosons. In 3D plots of P(q)_m = "The probability of m paraboson charged-pairs and q positive parabosons" versus < n > and < n^2 >, the p=1 curve is found to lie on the relatively narrow 2D p=2 surface.
