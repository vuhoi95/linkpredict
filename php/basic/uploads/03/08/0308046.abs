Title: Freund-Rubin Revisited
Authors: B. S. Acharya and F. Denef and C. Hofman and N. Lambert
Abstract: We utilise the duality between M theory and Type IIA string theory to show the existence of Freund-Rubin compactifications of M theory on 7-manifolds with singularities supporting chiral fermions. This leads to a concrete way to study phenomenologically interesting quantum gravity vacua using a holographically dual three dimensional field theory.
