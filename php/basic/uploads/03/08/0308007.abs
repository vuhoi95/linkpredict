Title: Blocked lattice monopoles in quenched SU(2) QCD and dual superconductor  model
Authors: M. N. Chernodub and Katsuya Ishiguro and Tsuneo Suzuki
Abstract: We study the action of the lattice monopoles in quenched SU(2) QCD in the Maximal Abelian projection. We relate the lattice action of the monopole currents to the monopole degrees of freedom of the continuum dual superconductor model and obtain the value of the monopole condensate.
