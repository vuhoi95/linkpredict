Title: Insertion and Elimination Lie Algebra: the Ladder case
Authors: Igor Mencattini and Dirk Kreimer
Abstract: We prove that insertion-elimination Lie algebra of Feynman graphs, in the ladder case, has a natural interpretation in terms of a certain algebra of infinite dimensional matrices. We study some aspects of its representation theory and we discuss some relations with the representation of the Heisenberg algebra
