Title: Effective actions, Wilson lines and the IR/UV mixing in noncommutative  supersymmetric gauge theories
Authors: Jonathan Levell and Gabriele Travaglini
Abstract: We study IR/UV mixing effects in noncommutative supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories with gauge group U(N) using background field perturbation theory. We compute three- and four-point functions of background fields, and show that the IR/UV mixed contributions to these correlators can be reproduced from an explicitly gauge-invariant effective action, which is expressed in terms of open Wilson lines.
