Title: Spinning Solitons of a Modified Non-Linear Schroedinger equation
Authors: Yves Brihaye and Betti Hartmann and Wojtek J. Zakrzewski
Abstract: We study soliton solutions of a modified non-linear Schroedinger (MNLS) equation. Using an Ansatz for the time and azimuthal angle dependence previously considered in the studies of the spinning Q-balls, we construct multi-node solutions of MNLS as well as spinning generalisations.
