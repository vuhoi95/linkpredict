Title: Exact solution of $Z_n$ Belavin model with open boundary condition
Authors: W. -L. Yang and R. Sasaki
Abstract: $Z_n$ Belavin model with open boundary condition is studied. The double-row transfer matrices of the model are diagonalized by algebraic Bethe ansatz method in terms of the intertwiner and the face-vertex correspondence relation. The eigenvalues and the corresponding Bethe ansatz equations are obtained.
