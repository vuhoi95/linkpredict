Title: Turbulent fields and their recurrences
Authors: Predrag Cvitanovic and Yueheng Lan
Abstract: We introduce a new variational method for finding periodic orbits of flows and spatio-temporally periodic solutions of classical field theories, a generalization of the Newton method to a flow in the space of loops. The feasibility of the method is demonstrated by its application to several dynamical systems, including the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system.
