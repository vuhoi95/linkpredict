Abstract: In this review we discuss constraints on minimal supersymmetric models of particle physics implied by the recent astrophysical observations of WMAP. Although the prospects of detecting supersymmetry increase and 90 percent of the available MSSM parameter space can safely be reached by the sensitivity of future colliders, nevertheless we pay particular emphasis on discussing regions of the appropriate phase diagrams, which -if realized - would imply that detection of supersymmetry, at least in the context of minimal models, could be out of colliders reach. We also discuss the importance of a precise determination of the radiative corrections to the muon anomalous magnetic moment, both theoretically and experimentally. Finally, we briefly commend upon recent evidence, supported by observations, on a dark energy component of the Universe, of as yet unknown origin, covering 73 percent of its energy content.
