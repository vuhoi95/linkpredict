Title: Randall-Sundrum Model in the Presence of a Brane Bulk Viscosity
Authors: I. Brevik and A. Hallanger
Abstract: The presence of a bulk viscosity for the cosmic fluid on a single Randall-Sundrum brane is considered. The spatial curvature is assumed to be zero. The five-dimensional Friedmann equation is derived, together with the energy conservation equation for the viscous fluid. These governing equations are solved for some special cases: (i) in the low-energy limit when the matter energy density is small compared with brane tension; (ii) for a matter-dominated universe, and (iii) for a radiation-dominated universe. Rough numerical estimates, for the extreme case when the universe is at its Planck time, indicate that the viscous effect can be significant.
