Title: Two-fermion relativistic bound states in Light-Front Dynamics
Authors: M. Mangin-Brinet and J. Carbonell and V. A. Karmanov
Abstract: In the Light-Front Dynamics, the wave function equations and their numerical solutions, for two fermion bound systems, are presented. Analytical expressions for the ladder one-boson exchange interaction kernels corresponding to scalar, pseudoscalar, pseudovector and vector exchanges are given. Different couplings are analyzed separately and each of them is found to exhibit special features. The results are compared with the non relativistic solutions.
