Title: Bitwistor formulation of massive spinning particle
Authors: S. Fedoruk and V. G. Zima
Abstract: Twistor formulation of massive arbitrary spin particle has been constructed. Twistor space of such particle is formed two twistors and two complex scalars which form together 'bosonic supertwistor'. The formulation is deduced from space-time one for spinning particle by means of introducing auxiliary harmonic variables and consequent partial fixing of gauges. It is carried out the canonical quantization of twistor massive particle with nonzero spin. It is found the eigenvalues of Casimir operators on particle states and harmonic expansion of wave function in spectrum.
