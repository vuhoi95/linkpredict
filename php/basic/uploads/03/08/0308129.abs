Title: Optical Activity From Extra Dimension
Authors: Avijit K. Ganguly and R. Parthasarathy
Abstract: Optical activity, like Faraday effect, is a rotation of the plane of polarization of propagating light in a medium and can be attributed to different sources with distinct signatures. In this note we discuss the effect of optical activity {\it{in vacuum}} due to Kaluza-Klein scalar field $\phi$, in the presence of an external electro-magnetic field. The astrophysical implication of this effect is indicated. We also point out the possibility of observing the same in laboratory conditions.
