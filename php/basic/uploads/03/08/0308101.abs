Title: Time and Geometric Quantization
Authors: A. A. Abrikosov Jr and E. Gozzi and D. Mauro
Abstract: In this paper we briefly review the functional version of the Koopman-von Neumann operatorial approach to classical mechanics. We then show that its quantization can be achieved by freezing to zero two Grassmannian partners of time. This method of quantization presents many similarities with the one known as Geometric Quantization.
