Title: Large-scale non-locality in "doubly special relativity" with an  energy-dependent speed of light
Authors: R. Sch√ºtzhold and W. G. Unruh
Abstract: There are two major alternatives for violating the (usual) Lorentz invariance at large (Planckian) energies or momenta - either not all inertial frames (in the Planck regime) are equivalent (e.g., there is an effectively preferred frame) or the transformations from one frame to another are (non-linearly) deformed (``doubly special relativity''). We demonstrate that the natural (and reasonable) assumption of an energy-dependent speed of light in the latter method goes along with violations of locality/separability (and even translational invariance) on macroscopic scales.
