Title: A Note on Inflation with Tachyon Rolling on the Gauss-Bonnet Brane
Authors: B. C. Paul and M. Sami
Abstract: In this paper we study the tachyonic inflation in brane world cosmology with Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulk. We obtain the exact solution of slow roll equations in case of exponential potential. We attempt to implement the proposal of Lidsey and Nunes, astro-ph/0303168, for the tachyon condensate rolling on the Gauss-Bonnet brane and discuss the difficulties associated with the proposal.
