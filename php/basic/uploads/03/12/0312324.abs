Title: Infrared behaviour and fixed points in Landau gauge QCD
Authors: Jan M. Pawlowski and Daniel F. Litim and Sergei Nedelko and Lorenz von Smekal
Abstract: We investigate the infrared behaviour of gluon and ghost propagators in Landau gauge QCD by means of an exact renormalisation group equation. We explain how, in general, the infrared momentum structure of Green functions can be extracted within this approach. An optimisation procedure is devised to remove residual regulator dependences. In Landau gauge QCD this framework is used to determine the infrared leading terms of the propagators. The results support the Kugo-Ojima confinement scenario. Possible extensions are discussed.
