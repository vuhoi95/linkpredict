Title: Kahler versus Non-Kahler Compactifications
Authors: Melanie Becker and Keshav Dasgupta
Abstract: We review our present understanding of heterotic compactifications on non-Kahler complex manifolds with torsion. Most of these manifolds can be obtained by duality chasing a consistent F-theory compactification in the presence of fluxes. We show that the duality map generically leads to non-Kahler spaces on the heterotic side, although under some special conditions we recover Kahler compactifications. The dynamics of the heterotic theory is governed by a new superpotential and minimizing this superpotential reproduces all the torsional constraints. This superpotential also fixes most of the moduli, including the radial modulus. We discuss some new connections between Kahler and non-Kahler compactifications, including some phenomenological aspects of the latter compactifications.
