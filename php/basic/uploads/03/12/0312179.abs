Title: The square root of the Dirac operator on the superspace and the Maxwell  equations
Authors: Adam Bzdak and Leszek Hadasz
Abstract: We re-consider the procedure of ``taking a square root of the Dirac equation'' on the superspace and show that it leads to the well known superfield W_\alpha and to the proper equations of motion for the components, i.e. the Maxwell equations and the massless Dirac equation.
