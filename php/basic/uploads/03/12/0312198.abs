Title: Regularization of the linearized gravitational self-force for branes
Authors: R. A. Battye and B. Carter and A. Mennim
Abstract: We discuss the linearized, gravitational self-interaction of a brane of arbitrary codimension in a spacetime of arbitrary dimension. We find that in the codimension two case the gravitational self-force is exactly zero for a Nambu-Goto equation of state, generalizing a previous result for a string in four dimensions. For the case of a 3-brane, this picks out the case of a six-dimensional brane-world model as having special properties which we discuss. In particular, we see that bare tension on the brane has no effect locally, suppressing the cosmological constant problem.
