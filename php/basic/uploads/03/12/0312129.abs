Title: The induced representation of the isometry group of the Euclidean  Taub-NUT space and new spherical harmonics
Authors: Ion I. Cotaescu and Mihai Visinescu
Abstract: It is shown that the SO(3) isometries of the Euclidean Taub-NUT space combine a linear three-dimensional representation with one induced by a SO(2) subgroup, giving the transformation law of the fourth coordinate under rotations. This explains the special form of the angular momentum operator on this manifold which leads to a new type of spherical harmonics and spinors.
