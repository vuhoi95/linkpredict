Title: Adventures in Thermal Duality (I): Extracting Closed-Form Solutions for  Finite-Temperature Effective Potentials in String Theory
Authors: Keith R. Dienes and Michael Lennek
Abstract: Thermal duality, which relates the physics of closed strings at temperature T to the physics at the inverse temperature 1/T, is one of the most intriguing features of string thermodynamics. Unfortunately, the classical definitions of thermodynamic quantities such as entropy and specific heat are not invariant under the thermal duality symmetry. In this paper, we investigate whether there might nevertheless exist special solutions for the string effective potential such that the duality symmetry will be preserved for all thermodynamic quantities. Imposing this as a constraint, we derive a series of unique functional forms for the complete temperature-dependence of the required string effective potentials. Moreover, we demonstrate that these solutions successfully capture the leading behavior of a variety of actual one-loop effective potentials for duality-covariant finite-temperature string ground states. This leads us to conjecture that our solutions might actually represent the exact effective potentials when contributions from all orders of perturbation theory are included.
