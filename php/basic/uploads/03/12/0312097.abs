Title: Linear Perturbations in Brane Gas Cosmology
Authors: Scott Watson and Robert Brandenberger
Abstract: We consider the effect of string inhomogeneities on the time dependent background of Brane Gas Cosmology. We derive the equations governing the linear perturbations of the dilaton-gravity background in the presence of string matter sources. We focus on long wavelength fluctuations and find that there are no instabilities. Thus, the predictions of Brane Gas Cosmology are robust against the introduction of linear perturbations. In particular, we find that the stabilization of the extra dimensions (moduli) remains valid in the presence of dilaton and string perturbations.
