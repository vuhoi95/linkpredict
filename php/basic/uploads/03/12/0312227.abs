Abstract: We investigate the stochasticity in temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation data from {\it Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe}. We show that the angular fluctuations of the temperature is a Markov process with a {\it Markov angular scale}, $\Theta_{\rm Markov}=1.01^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$. We characterize the complexity of the CMB fluctuations by means of a Fokker-Planck or Langevin equation and measure the associated Kramers-Moyal coefficients for the fluctuating temperature field $T(\hat n)$ and its increment, $\Delta T =T(\hat n_1) - T(\hat n_2)$. Through this method we show that temperature fluctuations in the CMB has fat tails compared to a Gaussian distribution.
