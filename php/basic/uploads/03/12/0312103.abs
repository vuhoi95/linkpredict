Title: Seiberg-Witten-type Maps for Currents and Energy-Momentum Tensors in  Noncommutative Gauge Theories
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Choonkyu Lee and Hyun Seok Yang
Abstract: We derive maps relating the currents and energy-momentum tensors in noncommutative (NC) gauge theories with their commutative equivalents. Some uses of these maps are discussed. Especially, in NC electrodynamics, we obtain a generalization of the Lorentz force law. Also, the same map for anomalous currents relates the Adler-Bell-Jackiw type NC covariant anomaly with the standard commutative-theory anomaly. For the particular case of two dimensions, we discuss the implications of these maps for the Sugawara-type energy-momentum tensor.
