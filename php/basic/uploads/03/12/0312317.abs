Title: Billiard representation for multidimensional multi-scalar cosmological  model with exponential potentials
Authors: H. Dehnen and V. D. Ivashchuk and V. N. Melnikov
Abstract: Multidimensional cosmological-type model with n Einstein factor spaces in the theory with l scalar fields and multiple exponential potential is considered. The dynamics of the model near the singularity is reduced to a billiard on the (N-1)-dimensional Lobachevsky space H^{N-1}, N = n+l. It is shown that for n > 1 the oscillating behaviour near the singularity is absent and solutions have an asymptotical Kasner-like behavior. For the case of one scale factor (n =1) billiards with finite volumes (e.g. coinciding with that of the Bianchi-IX model) are described and oscillating behaviour of scalar fields near the singularity is obtained.
