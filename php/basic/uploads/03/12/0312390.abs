Title: Multi-particle correlations in qp-Bose gas model
Authors: L. V. Adamska and A. M. Gavrilik
Abstract: The approach based on multimode system of q-deformed oscillators and the related picture of ideal gas of q-bosons enables to effectively describe the observed non-Bose type behaviour, in experiments on heavy-ion collisions, of the intercept (or the "strength") $\lambda$ of the two-particle correlation function of identical pions or kaons. In this paper we extend main results of that approach in the two aspects: first, we derive in explicit form the intercepts of n-particle correlation functions in the case of q-Bose gas model and, second, provide their explicit two-parameter (or qp-) generalization.
