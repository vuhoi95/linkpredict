Authors: F. A. Barone and R. M. Cavalcanti and C. Farina
Abstract: We compute the first radiative correction to the Casimir energy in the $(d+1)$-dimensional $\lambda|\phi|^{4}$ model submitted to quasi-periodic boundary conditions in one spatial direction. Our results agree with the ones found in the literature for periodic and anti-periodic boundary conditions, special cases of the quasi-periodic boundary conditions.
