Title: Operator Product Expansion and Zero Mode Structure in Logarithmic CFT
Authors: Michael Flohr and Marco Krohn
Abstract: The generic structure of 1-, 2- and 3-point functions of fields residing in indecomposable representations of arbitrary rank are given. These in turn determine the structure of the operator product expansion in logarithmic conformal field theory. The crucial role of zero modes is discussed in some detail.
