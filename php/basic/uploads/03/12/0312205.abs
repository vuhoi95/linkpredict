Title: Twisted determinants and bosonic open strings in an electromagnetic  field
Authors: Rodolfo Russo and Stefano Sciuto
Abstract: The bosonization equivalence between the 2-dimensional Dirac and Laplacian operators can be used to derive new interesting identities involving Theta functions. We use these formulae to compute the multiloop partition function of the bosonic open string in presence of a constant electromagnetic field.
