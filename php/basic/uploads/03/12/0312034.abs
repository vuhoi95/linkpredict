Title: Towards a renormalizable standard model without fundamental Higgs scalar
Authors: Holger Gies and Joerg Jaeckel and Christof Wetterich
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of constructing a renormalizable standard model with purely fermionic matter content. The Higgs scalar is replaced by point-like fermionic self-interactions with couplings growing large at the Fermi scale. An analysis of the UV behavior in the point-like approximation reveals a variety of non-Gaussian fixed points for the fermion couplings. If real, such fixed points would imply nonperturbative renormalizability and evade triviality of the Higgs sector. For point-like fermionic self-interactions and weak gauge couplings, one encounters a hierarchy problem similar to the one for a fundamental Higgs scalar.
