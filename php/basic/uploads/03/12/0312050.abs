Title: Superconformal Anomaly from AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: M. Chaichian and W. F. Chen
Abstract: For a classical superconformal gauge theory in a conformal supergravity background, its chiral R-symmetry anomaly, Weyl anomaly and super-Weyl anomaly constitute a supermultiplet. We review how these anomalies arise from the five-dimensional gauged supergravity in terms of the AdS/CFT correspondence at the gravity level. The holographic production of this full superconformal anomaly multiplet provides a support and test to the celebrated AdS/CFT conjecture.
