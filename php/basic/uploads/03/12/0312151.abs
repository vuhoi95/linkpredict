Title: A Scale Invariance due to Compositeness Condition in the Induced Gauge  Theory
Authors: Akira Akabane and Keiichi Akama
Abstract: The scale invariance of the coupling constant in the induced gauge theory due to its compositeness condition is demonstrated in the renormalization group flow of the finite-cutoff gauge theory at the leading order in 1/N, where N is the number of the matter fermion species.
