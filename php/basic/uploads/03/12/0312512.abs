Title: Solitons in Affine and Permutation Orbifolds
Authors: Victor G. Kac and Roberto Longo and Feng Xu
Abstract: We consider properties of solitons in general orbifolds in the algebraic quantum field theory framework and constructions of solitons in affine and permutation orbifolds. Under general conditions we show that our construction gives all the twisted representations of the fixed point subnet. This allows us to prove a number of conjectures: in the affine orbifold case we clarify the issue of ``fixed point resolutions''; in the permutation orbifold case we determine all irreducible representations of the orbifold, and we also determine the fusion rules in a nontrivial case, which imply an integral property of chiral data for any completely rational conformal net.
