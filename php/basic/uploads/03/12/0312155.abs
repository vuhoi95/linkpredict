Title: Twisted K-theory and loop group representations
Authors: Daniel S. Freed and Michael J. Hopkins and Constantin Teleman
Abstract: This is the third paper of a series relating the equivariant twisted $K$-theory of a compact Lie group $G$ to the ``Verlinde space'' of isomorphism classes of projective lowest-weight representations of the loop groups. Here, we treat arbitrary compact Lie groups. In addition, we discuss the relation to semi-infinite cohomology, the fusion product of Conformal Field theory, the r\^ole of energy and the topological Peter-Weyl theorem.
