Title: Phase spaces of Doubly Special Relativity
Authors: A. Blaut and M. Daszkiewicz and J. Kowalski-Glikman and S. Nowak
Abstract: We show that depending on the direction of deformation of $\kappa$-Poincar\'e algebra (time-like, space-like, or light-like) the associated phase spaces of single particle in Doubly Special Relativity theories have the energy-momentum spaces of the form of de Sitter, anti-de Sitter, and flat space, respectively.
