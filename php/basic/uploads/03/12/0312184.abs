Title: Novel Explicit Multi Spin String Solitons in AdS(5)
Authors: A. L. Larsen and A. Khan
Abstract: We find new explicit solutions describing closed strings spinning with equal angular momentum in two independent planes in AdS(5). These are 2N-folded strings in the radial direction and also winding M times around an angular direction. Thus in spacetime they consist of 2N segments. Solutions fulfilling the closed string periodicity conditions exist provided N/M>2, i.e. the strings must be folded at least six times in the radial coordinate. The strings are spinning, or actually orbiting, similarly to solutions found previously in black hole spacetimes, but unlike the one-spin solutions in AdS which spin around their center. For long strings we recover the logaritmic scaling relation between energy and spin known from the one-spin case, but different from other known two-spin cases.
