Title: Quiver Matrix Mechanics for IIB String Theory (I): Wrapping Membranes  and Emergent Dimension
Authors: Jian Dai and Yong-Shi Wu
Abstract: In this paper we present a discrete, non-perturbative formulation for type IIB string theory. Being a supersymmetric quiver matrix mechanics model in the framework of M(atrix) theory, it is a generalization of our previous proposal of compactification via orbifolding for deconstructed IIA strings. In the continuum limit, our matrix mechanics becomes a $(2+1)$-dimensional Yang-Mills theory with 16 supercharges. At the discrete level, we are able to construct explicitly the solitonic states that correspond to membranes wrapping on the compactified torus in target space. These states have a manifestly $SL(2,\integer)$-invariant spectrum with correct membrane tension, and give rise to an emergent flat dimension when the compactified torus shrinks to vanishing size.
