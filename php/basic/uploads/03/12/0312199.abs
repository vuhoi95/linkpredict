Title: Ginsparg-Wilson Relation and 't Hooft-Polyakov Monopole on Fuzzy  2-Sphere
Authors: Hajime Aoki and Satoshi Iso and Keiichi Nagao
Abstract: We investigate several properties of Ginsparg-Wilson fermion on fuzzy 2-sphere. We first examine chiral anomaly up to the second order of the gauge field and show that it is indeed reduced to the correct form of the Chern character in the commutative limit. Next we study topologically non-trivial gauge configurations and their topological charges. We investigate 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole type configuration on fuzzy 2-sphere and show that it has the correct commutative limit. We also consider more general configurations in our formulation.
