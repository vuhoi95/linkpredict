Title: Supersymmetric large-N reduced model with multiple matter
Authors: Hikaru Kawai and Tsunehide Kuroki and Takeshi Morita
Abstract: We showed in hep-th/0303210 that the Dijkgraaf-Vafa theory can be regarded as large-N reduction in the case of $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric U(N) gauge theories, with single adjoint matter. We generalize this to gauge theories with gauge groups being the products of some unitary groups coupled to bifundamental or fundamental matter. We show that some large-N reduced models of these theories are supermatrix models, whose free energy is equivalent to the prepotentials of the original gauge theories. The supermatrix model in our approach should be taken in the Veneziano limit $N_c,N_f \to \infty $ with $N_f/N_c$ fixed.
