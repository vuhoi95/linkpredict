Title: Space-Time Singularities and the Kahler Cone
Authors: Laur Jarv and Christoph Mayer and Thomas Mohaupt and Frank Saueressig
Abstract: We review recent results on the interplay between the five-dimensional space-time and the internal manifold in Calabi-Yau compactifications of M-theory. Black string, black hole and domain wall solutions as well as Kasner type cosmologies cannot develop a naked singularity as long as the moduli take values inside the Kahler cone.
