Title: More on a SUSYQM approach to the harmonic oscillator with nonzero  minimal uncertainties in position and/or momentum
Authors: C. Quesne and V. M. Tkachuk
Abstract: We continue our previous application of supersymmetric quantum mechanical methods to eigenvalue problems in the context of some deformed canonical commutation relations leading to nonzero minimal uncertainties in position and/or momentum. Here we determine for the first time the spectrum and the eigenvectors of a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator in the presence of a uniform electric field in terms of the deforming parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$. We establish that whenever there is a nonzero minimal uncertainty in momentum, i.e., for $\alpha \ne 0$, the correction to the harmonic oscillator eigenvalues due to the electric field is level dependent. In the opposite case, i.e., for $\alpha = 0$, we recover the conventional quantum mechanical picture of an overall energy-spectrum shift even when there is a nonzero minimum uncertainty in position, i.e., for $\beta \ne 0$. Then we consider the problem of a $D$-dimensional harmonic oscillator in the case of isotropic nonzero minimal uncertainties in the position coordinates, depending on two parameters $\beta$, $\beta'$. We extend our methods to deal with the corresponding radial equation in the momentum representation and rederive in a simple way both the spectrum and the momentum radial wave functions previously found by solving the differential equation. This opens the way to solving new $D$-dimensional problems.
