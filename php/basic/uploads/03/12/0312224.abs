Title: D-branes in the NS5 Near-horizon pp-Wave Background
Authors: S. F. Hassan and Rashmi R. Nayak and Kamal L. Panigrahi
Abstract: A class of Dp and Dp-D(p+4)-brane solutions are constructed in the Penrose limit of the linear-dilaton geometry. The classical solutions are shown to break all space-time supersymmetries. In the worldsheet description, the branes preserve as many supersymmetries as D-branes in flat space. It is shown that these supersymmetries do not have zero modes on the worldsheet and hence do not admit local space-time realizations. This indicates that, unlike the perturbative spectrum, the D-brane spectrum of strings in the linear-dilaton pp-wave is not similar to the flat space case.
