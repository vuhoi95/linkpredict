Title: Generalized holonomy of M-theory vacua
Authors: A. Batrachenko and M. J. Duff and James T. Liu and W. Y. Wen
Abstract: The number of M-theory vacuum supersymmetries, 0 <= n <= 32, is given by the number of singlets appearing in the decomposition of the 32 of SL(32,R) under H \subset SL(32,R) where H is the holonomy group of the generalized connection which incorporates non-vanishing 4-form. Here we compute this generalized holonomy for the n=16 examples of the M2-brane, M5-brane, M-wave, M-monopole, for a variety of their n=8 intersections and also for the n>16 pp waves.
