Title: Inflation in string-inspired cosmology and suppression of CMB low  multipoles
Authors: Yun-Song Piao and Shinji Tsujikawa and Xinmin Zhang
Abstract: We construct a string-inspired nonsingular cosmological scenario in which an inflaton field is driven up the potential before the graceful exit by employing a low-energy string effective action with an orbifold compactification. This sets up an initial condition for the inflaton to lead to a sufficient amount of $e$-foldings and to generate a nearly scale-invariant primordial density perturbation during slow-roll inflation. Our scenario provides an interesting possibility to explain a suppressed power spectrum at low multipoles due to the presence of the modulus-driven phase prior to slow-roll inflation and thus can leave a strong imprint of extra dimensions in observed CMB anisotropies.
