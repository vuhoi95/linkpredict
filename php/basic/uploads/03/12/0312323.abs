Title: Quantum Mechanics Model on KÃ¤hler conifold
Authors: Stefano Bellucci and Armen Nersessian and Armen Yeranyan
Abstract: We propose an exactly-solvable model of the quantum oscillator on the class of K\"ahler spaces (with conic singularities), connected with two-dimensional complex projective spaces. Its energy spectrum is nondegenerate in the orbital quantum number, when the space has non-constant curvature. We reduce the model to a three-dimensional system interacting with the Dirac monopole. Owing to noncommutativity of the reduction and quantization procedures, the Hamiltonian of the reduced system gets non-trivial quantum corrections. We transform the reduced system into a MIC-Kepler-like one and find that quantum corrections arise only in its energy and coupling constant. We present the exact spectrum of the generalized MIC-Kepler system. The one-(complex) dimensional analog of the suggested model is formulated on the Riemann surface over the complex projective plane and could be interpreted as a system with fractional spin.
