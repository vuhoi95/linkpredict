Title: On Higher Spin Theory: Strings, BRST, Dimensional Reductions
Authors: X. Bekaert and I. L. Buchbinder and A. Pashnev and M. Tsulaia
Abstract: We briefly review some modern developments in higher spin field theory and their links with superstring theory. The analysis is based on various BRST constructions allowing to derive the Lagrangians for massive and massless higher spin fields on flat or constant curvature backgrounds of arbitrary dimensions.
