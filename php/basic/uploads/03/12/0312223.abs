Title: Radionic Non-uniform Stable Black Strings
Authors: Takashi Tamaki and Sugumi Kanno and Jiro Soda
Abstract: Non-uniform black strings in the two-brane system are investigated using the effective action approach. It is shown that the radion acts as a non-trivial hair of black strings. The stability of solutions is demonstrated using the catastrophe theory. The black strings are shown to be non-uniform.
