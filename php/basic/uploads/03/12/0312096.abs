Title: Towards MIGO, the Matter-wave Interferometric Gravitational-wave  Observatory, and the Intersection of Quantum Mechanics with General  Relativity
Authors: Raymond Y. Chiao and Achilles D. Speliotopoulos
Abstract: A dynamical, non-Euclidean spacetime geometry in general relativity theory implies the possibility of gravitational radiation. Here we explore novel methods of detecting such radiation from astrophysical sources by means of matter-wave interferometers (MIGOs), using atomic beams emanating from supersonic atomic sources that are further cooled and collimated by means of optical molasses. While the sensitivities of such MIGOs compare favorably with LIGO and LISA, the sizes of MIGOs can be orders of magnitude smaller, and their bandwidths wider. Using a pedagogical approach, we place this problem into the broader context of problems at the intersection of quantum mechanics with general relativity.
