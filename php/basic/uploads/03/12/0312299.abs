Title: Superfield T-duality rules in ten dimensions with one isometry
Authors: Igor Bandos and Bernard Julia
Abstract: In this contribution we present the superfield T-duality rules relating type IIA and type IIB supergravity potentials for the case when both type IIA and type IIB superspaces have (at least) one isometry direction. We also give a brief review of T-duality and discuss the main steps of our approach to the derivation of the superfield T-duality rules, including the treatment of T-duality as an operation acting on differential forms rather than on the superspace coordinates.
