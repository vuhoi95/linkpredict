Title: Thermal Duality Confronts Entropy: A New Approach to String  Thermodynamics?
Authors: Keith R. Dienes and Michael Lennek
Abstract: One of the most intriguing features of string thermodynamics is thermal duality, which relates the physics at temperature T to the physics at inverse temperature 1/T. Unfortunately, the traditional definitions of thermodynamic quantities such as entropy and specific heat are not invariant under thermal duality transformations. In this paper, we propose several novel approaches towards dealing with this issue. One approach yields a "bootstrap" method of extracting possible exact, closed-form solutions for finite-temperature effective potentials in string theory. Another approach involves extending the usual definition of entropy by introducing additional terms which are suppressed by powers of the string scale. At high temperatures, however, these string corrections become significant and lead to a variety of surprising new phenomena as the temperature is increased.
