Title: Moduli Spaces of Standard Holomorphic Bundles on a Noncommutative  Complex Torus
Authors: Eunsang Kim and Hoil Kim
Abstract: In this paper we study the moduli space of standard holomorphic structures on a noncommutative complex two torus. It will be shown that the moduli space is naturally identified with the moduli space of stable bundles on an elliptic curve. We also propose that the mirror reflection of the noncommutative complex torus is the mirror reflection of the elliptic curve together with a linear foliation. From this we identify the moduli space of super cycles on the mirror reflection with the moduli space of standard holomorphic bundles on a noncommutative complex torus.
