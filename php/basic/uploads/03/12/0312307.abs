Title: Note on Gauge Theory on Fuzzy Supersphere
Authors: Satoshi Iso and Hiroshi Umetsu
Abstract: We construct a supermatrix model whose classical background gives two-dimensional noncommutative supersphere. Quantum fluctuations around it give the supersymmetric gauge theories on the fuzzy supersphere constructed by Klimcik. This model has a parameter $\beta$ which can tune masses of the particles in the model and interpolate various supersymmetric gauge theories on sphere.
