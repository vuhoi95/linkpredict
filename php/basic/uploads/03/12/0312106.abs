Title: Braneworld Kaluza-Klein Corrections in a Nutshell
Authors: Sugumi Kanno and Jiro Soda
Abstract: Evaluating Kaluza-Klein (KK) corrections is indispensable to test the braneworld scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel symmetry approach to a 4-dimensional effective action with KK corrections for the Randall-Sundrum two-brane system. The result can be used to assess the validity of the low energy approximation. Also, our result provides the basis for predicting CMB spectrum with KK corrections and the study of the transition from black strings to black holes.
