Title: De Sitter vacua from N=2 gauged supergravity
Authors: Klaus Behrndt and Swapna Mahapatra
Abstract: Typical de Sitter (dS) vacua of gauged supergravity correspond to saddle points of the potential and often the unstable mode runs into a singularity. We explore the possibility to obtain dS points where the unstable mode goes on both sides into a supersymmetric smooth vacuum. Within N=2 gauged supergravity coupled to the universal hypermultiplet, we have found a potential which has two supersymmetric minima (one of them can be flat) and these are connected by a de Sitter saddle point. In order to obtain this potential by an Abelian gauging, it was important to include the recently proposed quantum corrections to the universal hypermultiplet sector. Our results apply to four as well as five dimensional gauged supergravity theories.
