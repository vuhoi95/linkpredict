Title: The Two-Parameter Higher Order Differential Calculus and Curvature on a  Quantum Plane
Authors: M. El Baz and A. El Hassouni and Y. Hassouni and E. H. Zakkari
Abstract: We construct an associative differential algebra on a two-parameter quantum plane associated with a nilpotent endomorphism $d$ in the two cases $d^{2}=0$ and $d^3=0$ $(d^2\neq 0).$ The correspondent curvature is derived and the related non commutative gauge field theory is introduced.
