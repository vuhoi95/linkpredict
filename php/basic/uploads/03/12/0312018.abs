Title: Classical Principal Fibre Bundles from a Quantum Group Viewpoint
Authors: F. J. Vanhecke and C. Sigaud and A. R. da Silva
Abstract: In this short article we review how the classical theory of principal fibre bundles (PFB) transcribes in an algebraic formalism. In this dual formulation, a PFB is given by a right co-module algebra ${\cal P}$ over a Hopf algebra ${\cal H}$ with a mapping $\Delta_R:{\cal P}\to{\cal P}\otimes{\cal H}$. In our case ${\cal P}$ is the (commutative) C*-algebra of complex-valued continuous functions on the total space P and ${\cal H}$ is the Hopf algebra of complex-valued functions on the structure group G. These underlying spaces are endowed with a topology only. The subalgebra ${\cal B}$ of $\Delta_R$-invariant elements is identified with the algebra of complex-valued functions on the base space B. In order to define horizontal one-forms, a differential calculus is needed. Since no a priori differential structure is assumed, we use the calculus of the universal differential envelope $\Omega^\bullet({\cal P})$ which can be defined on any unital algebra. A connection on the PFB is then defined by a splitting of the universal one-forms as a direct sum of horizontal and vertical subspaces : $\Omega^1({\cal P})=\Gamma_{hor}\oplus\Gamma_{ver}$. In case of a strong connection in a trivial PFB, the general expression and gauge transformation of the connection one-form and the curvature two-form are given. A locally trivial PFB can be constructed through a gluing procedure of a cover of the algebra ${\cal P}$ (see this meeting's poster session P112, where examples are given).
