Abstract: We discuss the matching of the BPS part of the spectrum for (super)membrane, which gives the possibility of getting membrane's results via string calculations. In the small coupling limit of M--theory the entropy of the system coincides with the standard entropy of type IIB string theory (including the logarithmic correction term). The thermodynamic behavior at large coupling constant is computed by considering M--theory on a manifold with topology ${\mathbb T}^2\times{\mathbb R}^9$. We argue that the finite temperature partition functions (brane Laurent series for $p \neq 1$) associated with BPS $p-$brane spectrum can be analytically continued to well--defined functionals. It means that a finite temperature can be introduced in brane theory, which behaves like finite temperature field theory. In the limit $p \to 0$ (point particle limit) it gives rise to the standard behavior of thermodynamic quantities.
