Title: Covariant derivative expansion of fermionic effective action at high  temperatures
Authors: Dmitri Diakonov and Michaela Oswald
Abstract: We derive the fermionic contribution to the 1-loop effective action for A_4 and A_i fields at high temperatures, assuming that gluon fields are slowly varying but allowing for an arbitrary amplitude of A_4.
