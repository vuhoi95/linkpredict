Title: Effective Superpotentials, Geometry and Integrable Systems
Authors: Kristian D. Kennaway and Nicholas P. Warner
Abstract: We consider the effective superpotentials of N=1 SU(N_c) and U(N_c) supersymmetric gauge theories that are obtained from the N=2 theory by adding a tree-level superpotential. We show that several of the techniques for computing the effective superpotential are implicitly regularized by 2N_c massive fundamental quarks, i.e. the theory is embedded in the finite theory with nontrivial UV fixed point. In order to study N=1 and N=2 theories with fundamentals, we explicitly factorize the Seiberg-Witten curve for N_f != 0 and compare to the known form of the N=1 superpotential. N=2 gauge theories have an underlying integrable structure, and we obtain results on a new Lax matrix for N_f = N_c.
