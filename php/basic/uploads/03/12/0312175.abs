Title: Localized tachyon condensation and G-parity conservation
Authors: Sunggeun Lee and Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: We study the condensation of localized tachyon in non-supersymmetric orbifold ${\C^2/\Z_n}$. We first show that the G-parities of chiral primaries are preserved under the condensation of localized tachyon(CLT) given by the chiral primaries. Using this, we finalize the proof of the conjecture that the lowest-tachyon-mass-squared increases under CLT at the level of type II string with full consideration of GSO projection. We also show the equivalence between the $G$-parity given by $G=[jk_1/n]+ [jk_2/n]$ coming from partition function and that given by $G=\{jk_1/n\}k_2 -\{jk_2/n\}k_1$ coming from the monomial construction for the chiral primaires in the dual mirror picture.
