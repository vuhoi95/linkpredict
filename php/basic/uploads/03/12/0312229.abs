Title: Charged Dual String Vacua from Interacting Rotating Black Holes Via  Discrete and Nonlinear Symmetries
Authors: Alfredo Herrera-Aguilar and Marek Nowakowski
Abstract: Using the stationary formulation of the toroidally compactified heterotic string theory in terms of a pair of matrix Ernst potentials we consider the four-dimensional truncation of this theory with no U(1) vector fields excited. Imposing one time-like Killing vector permits us to express the stationary effective action as a model in which gravity is coupled to a matrix Ernst potential which, under certain parametrization, allows us to interpret the matter sector of this theory as a double Ernst system. We generate a web of string vacua which are related to each other via a set of discrete symmetries of the effective action (some of them involve S-duality transformations and possess non-perturbative character). Some physical implications of these discrete symmetries are analyzed and we find that, in some particular cases, they relate rotating black holes coupled to a dilaton with no Kalb--Ramond field, static black holes with non-trivial dilaton and antisymmetric tensor fields, and rotating and static naked singularities. Further, by applying a nonlinear symmetry, namely, the so-called normalized Harrison transformation, on the seed field configurations corresponding to these neutral backgrounds, we recover the U(1)^n Abelian vector sector of the four-dimensional action of the heterotic string, charging in this way the double Ernst system which corresponds to each one of the neutral string vacua, i.e., the stationary and the static black holes and the naked singularities.
