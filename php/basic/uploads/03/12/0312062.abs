Title: More Membrane Matrix Model Solutions - and Minimal Surfaces in S^7
Authors: Joakim Arnlind and Jens Hoppe
Abstract: New solutions to the classical equations of motion of a bosonic matrix-membrane are given. Their continuum limit defines 3-manifolds (in Minkowski space) whose mean curvature vanishes. Part of the construction are minimal surfaces in S^7, and their discrete analogues.
