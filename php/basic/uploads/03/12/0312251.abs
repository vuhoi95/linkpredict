Title: Cosmological billiards and oxidation
Authors: Sophie de Buyl and Marc Henneaux and Bernard Julia and Louis Paulot
Abstract: We show how the properties of the cosmological billiards provide useful information (spacetime dimension and $p$-form spectrum) on the oxidation endpoint of the oxidation sequence of gravitational theories. We compare this approach to the other available methods: $GL(n,R)$ subgroups and the superalgebras of dualities.
