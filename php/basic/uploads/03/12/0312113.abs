Title: Inflationary attractor in Gauss-Bonnet brane cosmology
Authors: Xin-He Meng and Peng Wang
Abstract: The inflationary attractor properties of the canonical scalar field and Born-Infeld field are investigated in the Randall-Sundrum II scenario with a Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulk action. We find that the inflationary attractor property will always hold for both the canonical and Born-Infeld fields for any allowed non-negative Gauss-Bonnet coupling. We also briefly discuss the possibility of explaining the suppressed lower multiples and running scalar spectral index simultaneously in the scenario of Gauss-Bonnet brane inflation.
