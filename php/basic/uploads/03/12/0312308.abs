Title: Perturbation theory of the space-time non-commutative real scalar field  theories
Authors: Chaiho Rim and Yunseok Seo and Jae Hyung Yee
Abstract: The perturbative framework of the space-time non-commutative real scalar field theory is formulated, based on the unitary S-matrix. Unitarity of the S-matrix is explicitly checked order by order using the Heisenberg picture of Lagrangian formalism of the second quantized operators, with the emphasis of the so-called minimal realization of the time-ordering step function and of the importance of the $\star$-time ordering. The Feynman rule is established and is presented using $\phi^4$ scalar field theory. It is shown that the divergence structure of space-time non-commutative theory is the same as the one of space-space non-commutative theory, while there is no UV-IR mixing problem in this space-time non-commutative theory.
