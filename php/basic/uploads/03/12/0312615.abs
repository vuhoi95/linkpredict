Title: Breakdown of Strong-Coupling Perturbation Theory in Doped Mott  Insulators
Authors: Philip Phillips and Dimitrios Galanakis and Tudor D. Stanescu
Abstract: We show that doped Mott insulators, such as the copper-oxide superconductors, are asymptotically slaved in that the quasiparticle weight, $Z$, near half-filling depends critically on the existence of the high energy scale set by the upper Hubbard band. In particular, near half filling, the following dichotomy arises: $Z\ne 0$ when the high energy scale is integrated out but Z=0 in the thermodynamic limit when it is retained. Slavery to the high energy scale arises from quantum interference between electronic excitations across the Mott gap. Broad spectral features seen in photoemission in the normal state of the cuprates are argued to arise from high energy slavery.
