Title: Nuttier (A)dS Black Holes in Higher Dimensions
Authors: Robert Mann and Cristian Stelea
Abstract: We construct new solutions of the vacuum Einstein field equations with cosmological constant. These solutions describe spacetimes with non-trivial topology that are asymptotically dS, AdS or flat. For a negative cosmological constant these solutions are NUT charged generalizations of the topological black hole solutions in higher dimensions. We also point out the existence of such NUT charged spacetimes in odd dimensions and we explicitly construct such spaces in 5 and 7 dimensions. The existence of such spacetimes with non-trivial topology is closely related to the existence of the cosmological constant. Finally, we discuss the global structure of such solutions and possible applications in string theory.
