Title: Stability of Covariant Relativistic Quantum Theory
Authors: Victor Wessels and Wayne Polyzou
Abstract: In this paper we study the relativistic quantum mechanical interpretation of the solution of the inhomogeneous Euclidean Bethe-Salpeter equation. Our goal is to determine conditions on the input to the Euclidean Bethe-Salpeter equation so the solution can be used to construct a model Hilbert space and a dynamical unitary representation of the Poincar\'e group. We prove three theorems that relate the stability of this construction to properties of the kernel and driving term of the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The most interesting result is that the positivity of the Hilbert space norm in the non-interacting theory is not stable with respect to Euclidean covariant perturbations defined by Bethe-Salpeter kernels. The long-term goal of this work is to understand which model Euclidean Green functions preserve the underlying relativistic quantum theory of the original field theory. Understanding the constraints imposed on the Green functions by the existence of an underlying relativistic quantum theory is an important consideration for formulating field-theory motivated relativistic quantum models.
