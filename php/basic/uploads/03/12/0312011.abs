Title: One-loop effective potential from higher-dimensional AdS black holes
Authors: Guido Cognola and Emilio Elizalde and Sergio Zerbini
Abstract: We study the quantum effects in a brane-world model in which a positive constant curvature brane universe is embedded in a higher-dimensional bulk AdS black hole, instead of the usual portion of the AdS$_5$. By using zeta regularisation, in the large mass regime, we explicitly calculate the one-loop effective potential due to the bulk quantum fields and show that it leads to a non-vanishing cosmological constant, which can definitely acquire a positive value.
