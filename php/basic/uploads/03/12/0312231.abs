Title: AdS/CFT Correspondence and string/gauge duality
Authors: Henrique Boschi-Filho and Nelson R. F. Braga
Abstract: The AdS/CFT correspondence is an exact duality between string theory in anti-de Sitter space and conformal field theories on its boundary. Inspired in this correspondence some relations between strings and non conformal field theories have been found. Exact dualities in the non conformal case are intricate but approximations can reproduce important physical results. A simple approximation consists in taking just a slice of the AdS space with a size related to an energy scale. Here we will discuss how this approach can be used to reproduce the scaling of high energy QCD scattering amplitudes. Also we show that very simple estimates for glueball mass ratios can emerge from such an approximation.
