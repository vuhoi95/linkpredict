Title: Once Again On the Klein Paradox
Authors: N. Kevlishvili and A. Khelashvili and T. Nadareishvili
Abstract: After the short survey of the Klein Paradox in 3-dimensional relativistic equations, we present a detailed consideration of Dirac modified equation, which follows by one particle infinite overweighting in Salpeter Equation. It is shown, that the separation of angular variables and reduction to radial equation is possible by using standard methods in momentum space. The kernel of the obtained radial equation differs from that of spinless Salpeter equation in bounded regular factor. That is why the equation has solutions of confined type for infinitely increasing potential.
