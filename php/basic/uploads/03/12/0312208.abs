Title: Flux Backgrounds in 2D String Theory
Authors: Sergei Gukov and Tadashi Takayanagi and Nicolaos Toumbas
Abstract: We study RR flux backgrounds in two dimensional type 0 string theories. In particular, we study the relation between the 0A matrix model and the extremal black hole in two dimensions. Using T-duality we find a dual flux background in type 0B theory and propose its matrix model description. When the Fermi level is set to zero this system remains weakly coupled and exhibits a larger symmetry related to the structure of flux vacua. Finally, we construct a two dimensional type IIB background as an orbifold of the 0B background.
