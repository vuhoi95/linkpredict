Abstract: We investigate scalar perturbations from inflation in a bulk inflaton braneworld model. Using the generalized longitudinal gauge, we derive and solve the full set of scalar perturbation equations. Our exact results support the recent argument that for the de Sitter brane the square of the radion mass is not positive, showing that unlike the flat brane case, the de Sitter brane is not stable.
