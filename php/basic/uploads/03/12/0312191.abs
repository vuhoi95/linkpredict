Abstract: We examine spherical p-branes in AdS_m x S^n, that wrap an S^p in either AdS_m (p=m-2) or S^n (p=n-2). We first construct a two-spin giant solution expanding in S^n and has spins both in AdS_m and S^n. For (m,n)={(5,5),(4,7),(7,4)}, it is 1/2 supersymmetric, and it reduces to the single-spin giant graviton when the AdS spin vanishes. We study some of its basic properties such as instantons, non-commutativity, zero-modes, and the perturbative spectrum. All vibration modes have real and positive frequencies determined uniquely by the spacetime curvature, and evenly spaced. We next consider the (0+1)-dimensional sigma-models obtained by keeping generally time-dependent transverse coordinates, describing warped product of a breathing-mode and a point-particle on S^n or AdS_m x S^1. The BPS bounds show that the only spherical supersymmetric solutions are the single and the two-spin giants. Moreover, we integrate the sigma-model and separate the canonical variables. We quantize exactly the point-particle part of the motion, which in local coordinates gives Poschl-Teller type potentials, and calculate its contribution to the anomalous dimension.
