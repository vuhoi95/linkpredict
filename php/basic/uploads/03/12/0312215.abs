Title: Symmetry breaking, permutation D-branes on group manifolds: boundary  states and geometric description
Authors: Gor Sarkissian and Marija Zamaklar
Abstract: We use the permutation symmetry between the product of several group manifolds in combination with orbifolds and T-duality to construct new classes of symmetry breaking branes on products of group manifolds. The resulting branes mix the submanifolds and break part of the diagonal chiral algebra of the theory. We perform a Langrangian analysis as well as a boundary CFT construction of these branes and find agreement between the two methods.
