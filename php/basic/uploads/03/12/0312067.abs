Title: Cosmic F- and D-strings
Authors: Edmund J. Copeland and Robert C. Myers and Joseph Polchinski
Abstract: Macroscopic fundamental and Dirichlet strings have several potential instabilities: breakage, tachyon decays, and confinement by axion domain walls. We investigate the conditions under which metastable strings can exist, and we find that such strings are present in many models. There are various possibilities, the most notable being a network of (p,q) strings. Cosmic strings give a potentially large window into string physics.
