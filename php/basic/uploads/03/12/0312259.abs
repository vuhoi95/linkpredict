Title: A Note on the Equality of Algebraic and Geometric D-Brane Charges in WZW  Models
Authors: Peter Bouwknegt and David Ridout
Abstract: The algebraic definition of charges for symmetry-preserving D-branes in Wess-Zumino-Witten models is shown to coincide with the geometric definition, for all simple Lie groups. The charge group for such branes is computed from the ambiguities inherent in the geometric definition.
