Title: Metric fluctuations and its evolution during inflation
Authors: Mariano Anabitarte and Mauricio Bellini
Abstract: W discuss the evolution of the fluctuations in a symmetric $\phi_c$-exponential potential which provides a power-law expansion during inflation using both, the gauge invariant field $\Phi$ and the Sasaki-Mukhanov field.
