Title: Nonequivalent Seiberg-Witten maps for noncommutative massive U(N) gauge  theory
Authors: Ricardo Amorim and Nelson R. F. Braga and Cristine N. Ferreira
Abstract: Massive vector fields can be described in a gauge invariant way with the introduction of compensating fields. In the unitary gauge one recovers the original formulation. Although this gauging mechanism can be extended to noncommutative spaces in a straightforward way, non trivial aspects show up when we consider the Seiberg-Witten map. As we show here, only a particular class of its solutions leads to an action that admits the unitary gauge fixing.
