Abstract: After an introduction recalling the theoretical motivation for low energy (100 GeV to TeV scale) supersymmetry, this review describes the theory and experimental implications of the soft supersymmetry-breaking Lagrangian of the general minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). Extensions to include neutrino masses and nonminimal theories are also discussed. Topics covered include models of supersymmetry breaking, phenomenological constraints from electroweak symmetry breaking, flavor/CP violation, collider searches, and cosmological constraints including dark matter and implications for baryogenesis and inflation.
