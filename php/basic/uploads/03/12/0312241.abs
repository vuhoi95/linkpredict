Title: Stability of fuzzy $S^2 \times S^2$ geometry in IIB matrix model
Authors: Takaaki Imai and Yastoshi Takayama
Abstract: We continue our study of the IIB matrix model on fuzzy $S^2 \times S^2$. Especially in this paper we focus on the case where the size of one of $S^2\times S^2$ is different from the other. By the power counting and SUSY cancellation arguments, we can identify the 't Hooft coupling and large $N$ scaling behavior of the effective action to all orders. We conclude that the most symmetric $S^2 \times S^2$ configuration where the both $S^2$s are of the same size is favored at the two loop level. In addition we develop a new approach to evaluate the amplitudes on fuzzy $S^2 \times S^2$.
