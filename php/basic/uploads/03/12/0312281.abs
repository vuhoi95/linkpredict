Title: 10d N=1 Massless BPS supermultiplets
Authors: H. Mkrtchyan and R. Mkrtchyan
Abstract: We consider d=10 N=1 supersymmetry algebra with maximal number of tensor charges Z and introduce a class of orbits of Z, invariant w.r.t. the $T_8$ subgroup of massless particles' little group $T_8\ltimes SO(8)$. For that class of orbits we classify all possible orbits and little groups, which appear to be semidirect products of $T_8\ltimes SO(k_1)\times ... SO(k_n)$ form, with $k_1+...+k_n=8$, where compact factor is embedded into SO(8) by triality map. We define actions of little groups on supercharge Q and construct corresponding supermultiplets. In some particular cases we show the existence of supermultiplets with both Fermi and Bose sectors consisting of the same representations of tensorial Poincare. In addition, complete classification of supermultiplets (not restricted to $T_8$-invariant orbits) with rank-2 matrix of supersymmetry charges anticommutator, is given.
