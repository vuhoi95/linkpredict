Abstract: We propose a multi-graviton theory with non-nearest-neighbor couplings in the theory space. The resulting four-dimensional discrete mass spectrum reflects the structure of a latticized extra dimension. For a plausible mass spectrum motivated by the discretized Randall-Sundrum brane-world, the induced cosmological constant turns out to be positive and may serve as a quite simple model for the dark energy of our accelerating universe.
