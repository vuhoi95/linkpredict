Title: NC Wilson lines and the inverse Seiberg-Witten map for nondegenerate  star products
Authors: Wolfgang Behr and Andreas Sykora
Abstract: Open Wilson lines are known to be the observables of noncommutative gauge theory with Moyal-Weyl star product. We generalize these objects to more general star products. As an application we derive a formula for the inverse Seiberg-Witten map for star products with invertible Poisson structures.
