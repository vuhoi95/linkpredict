Title: Radion effective theory in the detuned Randall-Sundrum model
Authors: Jonathan Bagger and Michele Redi
Abstract: We compute the two-derivative low-energy effective action for the radion in the (supersymmetric) Randall-Sundrum scenario with detuned brane tensions. At the classical level, a potential automatically stabilizes the distance between the branes. In the supersymmetric case, supersymmetry can be broken spontaneously by a vacuum expectation value for the fifth component of the graviphoton.
