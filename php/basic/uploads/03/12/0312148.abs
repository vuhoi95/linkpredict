Title: Supersymmetric Radius Stabilization in Warped Extra Dimensions
Authors: Nobuhito Maru and Nobuchika Okada
Abstract: We propose a simple model of extra-dimensional radius stabilization in a supersymmetric Randall-Sundrum model. In our model, we introduce only a bulk hypermultiplet and source terms (tadpole terms) on each boundary branes. With appropriate choice of model parameters, we find that the radius can be stabilized by supersymmetric vacuum conditions. Since the radion mass can be much larger than the gravitino mass and even the original supersymmetry breaking scale, radius stability is ensured even in the presence of supersymmetry breaking. We find a parameter region in which unwanted scalar masses induced by quantum corrections through the bulk hypermultiplet and a bulk gravity multiplet are suppressed and the anomaly mediation contribution dominates.
