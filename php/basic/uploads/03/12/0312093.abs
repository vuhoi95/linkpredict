Title: Non-linear electrodynamics and the acceleration of the universe
Authors: M. Novello and S. E. Perez Bergliaffa and J. Salim
Abstract: It is shown that the addition of a non-linear term to the Lagrangian of the electromagnetic field yields a fluid with an asymptotically super-negative equation of state, causing an accelerated expansion of the universe. Some general properties of nonlinear electromagnetism in cosmology are also discussed.
