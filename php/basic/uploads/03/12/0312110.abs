Title: Big Crunch Avoidance in k = 1 Semi-Classical Loop Quantum Cosmology
Authors: Parampreet Singh and Alexey Toporensky
Abstract: It is well known that a closed universe with a minimally coupled massive scalar field always collapses to a singularity unless the initial conditions are extremely fine tuned. We show that the corrections to the equations of motion for the massive scalar field, given by loop quantum gravity in high curvature regime, always lead to a bounce independently of the initial conditions. In contrast to the previous works in loop quantum cosmology, we note that the singularity can be avoided even at the semi-classical level of effective dynamical equations with non-perturbative quantum gravity modifications, without using a discrete quantum evolution.
