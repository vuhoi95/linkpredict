Title: 1+1 Dimensional Critical String Theory and Holography
Authors: Aaron Bergman and Jacques Distler and Uday Varadarajan
Abstract: In hep-th/0310120, Goheer, Kleban and Susskind argued that the holographic principle is inconsistent with the existence of stable, Lorentz invariant, 1+1 dimensional compactifications. We note some difficulties with their analysis and present two novel backgrounds of string theory with 1+1 noncompact dimensions that satisfy their conditions yet possess 16 or 24 supersymmetries. It is difficult to believe that such backgrounds could be unstable.
