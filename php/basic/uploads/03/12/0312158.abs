Title: Group Theoretical Structure and Inverse Scattering Method for super-KdV  Equation
Authors: Petr P. Kulish and Anton M. Zeitlin
Abstract: Using the group-theoretical approach to the inverse scattering method the supersymmetric Korteweg-de Vries equation is obtained by application of the Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction to osp(1|2) loop superalgebra. The direct and inverse scattering problems are discussed for the corresponding Lax pair.
