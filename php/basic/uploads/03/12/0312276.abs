Title: On a Classification of Irreducible Almost Commutative Geometries
Authors: Bruno Iochum and Thomas Schucker and Christoph Stephan
Abstract: We classify all irreducible, almost commutative geometries whose spectral action is dynamically non-degenerate. Heavy use is made of Krajewski's diagrammatic language. The motivation for our definition of dynamical non-degeneracy stems from particle physics where the fermion masses are non-degenerate.
