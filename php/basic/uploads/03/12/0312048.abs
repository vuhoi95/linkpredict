Title: Covariant description of parametrized nonrelativistic Hamiltonian  systems
Authors: Mauricio Mondragon and Merced Montesinos
Abstract: The various phase spaces involved in the dynamics of parametrized nonrelativistic Hamiltonian systems are displayed by using Crnkovic and Witten's covariant canonical formalism. It is also pointed out that in Dirac's canonical formalism there exists a freedom in the choice of the symplectic structure on the extended phase space and in the choice of the equations that define the constraint surface with the only restriction that these two choices combine in such a way that any pair (of these two choices) generates the same gauge transformation. The consequence of this freedom on the algebra of observables is also discussed.
