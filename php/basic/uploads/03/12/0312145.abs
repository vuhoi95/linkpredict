Title: Large N Duality, Lens Spaces and the Chern-Simons Matrix Model
Authors: Nick Halmagyi and Takuya Okuda and Vadim Yasnov
Abstract: We demonsrate that the spectral curve of the matrix model for Chern-Simons theory on the Lens space S^{3}/\ZZ_p is precisely the Riemann surface which appears in the mirror to the blownup, orbifolded conifold. This provides the first check of the $A$-model large $N$ duality for T^{*}(S^{3}/\ZZ_p), p>2.
