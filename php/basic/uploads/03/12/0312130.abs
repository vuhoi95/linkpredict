Title: Quasi-exact solvability of Dirac-Pauli equation and generalized Dirac  oscillators
Authors: Choon-Lin Ho and Pinaki Roy
Abstract: We demonstrate that neutral Dirac particles in external electric fields, which are equivalent to generalized Dirac oscillators, are physical examples of quasi-exactly solvable systems. Electric field configurations permitting quasi-exact solvability of the system based on the $sl(2)$ symmetry are discussed separately in spherical, cylindrical, and Cartesian coordinates. Some exactly solvable field configurations are also exhibited.
