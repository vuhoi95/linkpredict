Abstract: We examine the phenomenology of a warped 5-dimensional model based on SU(2)$_L \times$ SU(2)$_R \times$ U(1)$_{B-L}$ model which implements electroweak symmetry breaking through boundary conditions, without the presence of a Higgs boson. We use precision electroweak data to constrain the general parameter space of this model. Our analysis includes independent $L$ and $R$ gauge couplings, radiatively induced UV boundary gauge kinetic terms, and all higher order corrections from the curvature of the 5-d space. We show that this setup can be brought into good agreement with the precision electroweak data for typical values of the parameters. However, we find that the entire range of model parameters leads to violation of perturbative unitarity in gauge boson scattering and hence this model is not a reliable perturbative framework. Assuming that unitarity can be restored in a modified version of this scenario, we consider the collider signatures. It is found that new spin-1 states will be observed at the LHC and measurement of their properties would identify this model. However, the spin-2 graviton Kaluza-Klein resonances, which are a hallmark of the Randall-Sundrum model, are too weakly coupled to be detected.
