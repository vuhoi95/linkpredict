Title: A causal model for a closed universe
Authors: M. Cataldo and S. del Campo and P. Minning and F. Pena
Abstract: We study a closed model of a universe filled with viscous fluid and quintessence matter components. The dynamical equations imply that the universe might look like an accelerated flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe at low redshift. We consider here dissipative processes which obey a causal thermodynamics. Here, we account for the entropy production via causal dissipative inflation.
