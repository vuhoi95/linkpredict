Title: A Hidden Twelve-Dimensional SuperPoincare Symmetry In Eleven Dimensions
Authors: Itzhak Bars and Cemsinan Deliduman and Andrea Pasqua and Bruno Zumino
Abstract: First, we review a result in our previous paper, of how a ten-dimensional superparticle, taken off-shell, has a hidden eleven-dimensional superPoincare symmetry. Then, we show that the physical sector is defined by three first-class constraints which preserve the full eleven-dimensional symmetry. Applying the same concepts to the eleven dimensional superparticle, taken off-shell, we discover a hidden twelve dimensional superPoincare symmetry that governs the theory.
