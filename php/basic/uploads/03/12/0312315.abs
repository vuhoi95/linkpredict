Title: QED Revisited: Proving Equivalence Between Path Integral and Stochastic  Quantization
Authors: Helmuth Huffel and Gerald Kelnhofer
Abstract: We perform the stochastic quantization of scalar QED based on a generalization of the stochastic gauge fixing scheme and its geometric interpretation. It is shown that the stochastic quantization scheme exactly agrees with the usual path integral formulation.
