Abstract: Using superspace techniques we construct the general theory describing D=4, N=2 supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of vector and scalar--tensor multiplets. The scalar manifold of the theory is the direct product of a special Kaehler and a reduction of a Quaternionic-Kaehler manifold. We perform the electric gauging of a subgroup of the isometries of such manifold as well as ``magnetic'' deformations of the theory discussing the consistency conditions arising in this process. The resulting scalar potential is the sum of a symplectic invariant part (which in some instances can be recast into the standard form of the gauged N =2 theory) and of a non--invariant part, both giving new deformations. We also show the relation of such theories to flux ompactifications of type II string theories.
