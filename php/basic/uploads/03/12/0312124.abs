Title: Can the Local Supercluster explain the low CMB multipoles?
Authors: L. Raul Abramo and L. Sodre Jr
Abstract: We show that the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect caused by hot electrons in the Local Supercluster (LSC) can explain the abnormal quadrupole and octopole of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) that were measured by WMAP and COBE. The distortion needed to account for the low observed quadrupole is a spot in the direction of the LSC with a temperature decrease of order \Delta T \approx - 7 \mu K for \nu ~ 20 -- 90 Ghz photons. The temperature and density of the hot gas which can generate such an effect are consistent with observations of the X-ray background. If this hypothetic foreground is subtracted from the WMAP data, we find that the amplitude of the quadrupole (l=2) is substantially increased, and that the ``planarity'' of both the quadrupole and the octopole (l=3) are weakened. For smaller scales the effect decays and, at least in our simplified model, it does not affect the angular power spectrum at l>10. Moreover, since the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect increases the temperature of photons with frequencies above 218 GHz, observations sensitive in that range (such as PLANCK's HFI) will be able to confirm whether the LSC indeed affects the CMB.
