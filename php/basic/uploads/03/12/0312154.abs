Title: Nonabelian Bundle Gerbes, their Differential Geometry and Gauge Theory
Authors: Paolo Aschieri and Luigi Cantini and Branislav Jurco
Abstract: Bundle gerbes are a higher version of line bundles, we present nonabelian bundle gerbes as a higher version of principal bundles. Connection, curving, curvature and gauge transformations are studied both in a global coordinate independent formalism and in local coordinates. These are the gauge fields needed for the construction of Yang-Mills theories with 2-form gauge potential.
