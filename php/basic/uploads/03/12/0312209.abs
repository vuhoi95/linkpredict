Title: Causal Structure of d=5 Vacua and Axisymmetric Spacetimes
Authors: Bartomeu Fiol and Christiaan Hofman and Ernesto Lozano-Tellechea
Abstract: We study the structure of closed timelike curves (CTCs) for the near horizon limit of the five dimensional BMPV black hole, in its overrotating regime. We argue that Bousso's holographic screens are inside the chronologically safe region, extending a similar observation of Boyda et al. hep-th/0212087 for Goedel type solutions. We then extend this result to quite generic axisymmetric spacetimes with CTCs, showing that causal geodesics can't escape the chronologically safe region. As a spin-off of our results, we fill a gap in the identification of all maximally supersymmetric solutions of minimal five dimensional supergravity, bringing this problem to a full conclusion.
