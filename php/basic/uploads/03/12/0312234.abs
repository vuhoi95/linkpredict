Title: Geometric transitions, Chern-Simons gauge theory and Veneziano type  amplitudes
Authors: Tohru Eguchi and Hiroaki Kanno
Abstract: We consider the geometric transition and compute the all-genus topological string amplitudes expressed in terms of Hopf link invariants and topological vertices of Chern-Simons gauge theory. We introduce an operator technique of 2-dimensional CFT which greatly simplifies the computations. We in particular show that in the case of local Calabi-Yau manifolds described by toric geometry basic amplitudes are written as vacuum expectation values of a product vertex operators and thus appear quite similar to the Veneziano amplitudes of the old dual resonance models. Topological string amplitudes can be easily evaluated using vertex operator algebra.
