Title: M5-branes and Matrix Theory
Authors: Martin Cederwall and Henric Larsson
Abstract: We consider supermembranes ending on M5-branes, with the aim of deriving the appropriate matrix theories describing different situations. Special attention is given to the case of non-vanishing (selfdual) C-field. We identify the relevant deformation of the six-dimensional super-Yang-Mills theory whose dimensional reduction is the matrix theory for membranes in the presence of M5-branes. Possible applications and limitations of the models are discussed.
