Title: D-particles and the localization limit in quantum gravity
Authors: Giovanni Amelino-Camelia and Luisa Doplicher
Abstract: Some recent studies of the properties of D-particles suggest that in string theory a rather conventional description of spacetime might be available up to scales that are significantly smaller than the Planck length. We test this expectation by analyzing the localization of a space-time event marked by the collision of two D-particles. We find that a spatial coordinate of the event can indeed be determined with better-than-Planckian accuracy, at the price of a rather large uncertainty in the time coordinate. We then explore the implications of these results for the popular quantum-gravity intuition which assigns to the Planck length the role of absolute limit on localization.
