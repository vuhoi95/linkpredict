Title: Phantom Field and the Fate of Universe
Authors: M. Sami and Alexey Toporensky
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the cosmological dynamics of phantom field in a variety of potentials unbounded from above. We demonstrate that the nature of future evolution generically depends upon the steepness of the phantom potential and discuss the fate of Universe accordingly.
