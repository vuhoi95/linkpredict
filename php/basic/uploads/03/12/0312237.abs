Title: Holography, Dimensional Reduction and the Bekenstein Bound
Authors: Dongsu Bak and Ho-Ung Yee
Abstract: We consider dimensional reduction of the lightlike holography of the covariant entropy bound from D+1 dimensional geometry of M X S to the D dimensional geometry M. With a warping factor, the local Bekenstein bound in D+1 dimensions leads to a more refined form of the bound from the D dimensional view point. With this new local Bekenstein bound, it is quite possible to saturate the lightlike holography even with nonvanishing expansion rate. With a Kaluza-Klein gauge field, the dimensional reduction implies a stronger bound where the energy momentum tensor contribution is replaced by the energy momentum tensor with the electromagnetic contribution subtracted.
