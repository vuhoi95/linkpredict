Title: A Crystal-based Matter-wave Interferometric Gravitational-wave  Observatory
Authors: Raymond Y. Chiao and A. D. Speliotopoulos
Abstract: It is shown that atom interferometry allows for the construction of MIGO, the Matter-wave Interferometric Gravitational-wave Observatory. MIGOs of the same sensitivity as LIGO or LISA are expected to be orders of magnitude smaller than either one. A design for MIGO using crystalline diffraction gratings is introduced, and its sensitivity is calculated.
