Title: Classical Solutions in the BMN Matrix Model
Authors: Joakim Arnlind and Jens Hoppe
Abstract: Several reductions of the bosonic BMN matrix model equations to ordinary point particle Hamiltonian dynamics in the plane (or R^3) are given - as well as a few explicit solutions (some of which, as N->infinity, correspond to membranes rotating with constant angular velocity, others to higher dimensional objects).
