Title: Integrable Structure of Superconformal Field Theory and Quantum  super-KdV Theory
Authors: Petr P. Kulish and Anton M. Zeitlin
Abstract: The integrable structure of the two dimensional superconformal field theory is considered. The classical counterpart of our constructions is based on the $\hat{osp}(1|2)$ super-KdV hierarchy. The quantum version of the monodromy matrix associated with the linear problem for the corresponding L-operator is introduced. Using the explicit form of the irreducible representations of $\hat{osp}_q(1|2)$, the so-called "fusion relations" for the transfer matrices considered in different representations of $\hat{osp}_q(1|2)$ are obtained. The possible integrable perturbations of the model (primary operators, commuting with integrals of motion) are classified and the relation with the supersymmetric $\hat{osp}(1|2)$ Toda field theory is discussed.
