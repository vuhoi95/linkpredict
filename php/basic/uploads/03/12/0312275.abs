Title: Correlation Functions of The Tri-critical 3-states Potts Model
Authors: S. Balaska and K. Demmouche
Abstract: We build the Z$_{3}$ invariants fusion rules associated to the (D$_{4}$,A$_{6}$) conformal algebra. This algebra is known to describe the tri-critical Potts model. The 4-pt correlation functions of critical fields are developed in the bootstrap approach, and in the other hand, they are written in term of integral representation of the conformal blocks. By comparing both the expressions, one can determine the structure constantes of the operator algebra.
