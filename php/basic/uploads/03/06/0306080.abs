Title: Linearizing superon-graviton model(SGM)
Authors: K. Shima and M. Tsuda and M. Sawaguchi
Abstract: We attempt the linearization of N=1 SGM action describing the nonlinear supersymmetric gravitational interaction of superon(Nambu-Goldstone fermion). We find that 80+80 field contents may give the off-shell supermultiplet of the supergravity-like linearized theory and they are realized explicitly up to $O(\psi^2)$ as the composites, though they have modified SUSY transformations which closes on super-Poincar\'e algebra. Particular attentions are paid to the local Lorentz invariance in the minimal interaction.
