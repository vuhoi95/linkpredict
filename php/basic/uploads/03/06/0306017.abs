Title: Two-dimensional non-commutative Yang-Mills theory: coherent effects in  open Wilson line correlators
Authors: A. Bassetto and G. De Pol and F. Vian
Abstract: A perturbative calculation of the correlator of three parallel open Wilson lines is performed for the U(N) theory in two non-commutative space-time dimensions. In the large-N planar limit, the perturbative series is fully resummed and asymptotically leads to an exponential increase of the correlator with the lengths of the lines, in spite of an interference effect between lines with the same orientation. This result generalizes a similar increase occurring in the two-line correlator and is likely to persist when more lines are considered provided they share the same direction.
