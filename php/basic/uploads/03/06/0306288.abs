Title: The Off-shell (3/2, 2) Supermultiplets Revisited
Authors: S. James Gates, Jr. and Sergei M. Kuzenko and J. Phillips
Abstract: Using superspace projection operators we provide a classification of (3/2,2) off-shell supermultiplets which are realized in terms of a real axial vector superfield, with or without compensating superfields. Any linearized supergravity action is shown to be a superposition of those corresponding to (i) old minimal supergravity, (ii) new minimal supergravity and (iii) the novel (3/2,2) off-shell supermultiplet with 12+12 degrees of freedom obtained in hep-th/0201096.
