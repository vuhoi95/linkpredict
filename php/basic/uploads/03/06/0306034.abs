Abstract: Underlying a general noncommutative algebra with both noncommutative coordinates and noncommutative momenta in a (1+1)-dimensional spacetime, a chiral boson Lagrangian with manifest Lorentz covariance is proposed by linearly imposing a generalized self-duality condition on a noncommutative generalization of massless real scalar fields. A significant property uncovered for noncommutative chiral bosons is that the left- and right-moving chiral scalars cannot be distinguished from each other, which originates from the noncommutativity of coordinates and momenta. An interesting result is that Dirac's method can be consistently applied to the constrained system whose Lagrangian explicitly contains space and time. The self-duality of the noncommutative chiral boson action does not exist.
