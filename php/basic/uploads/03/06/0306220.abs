Title: Intersecting hyper-surfaces in dimensionally continued topological  density gravitation
Authors: Elias Gravanis and Steven Willison
Abstract: We consider intersecting hypersurfaces in curved spacetime with gravity governed by a class of actions which are topological invariants in lower dimensionality. Along with the Chern-Simons boundary terms there is a sequence of intersection terms that should be added in the action functional for a well defined variational principle. We construct them in the case of Characteristic Classes, obtaining relations which have a general topological meaning. Applying them on a manifold with a discontinuous connection 1-form we obtain the gravity action functional of the system and show that the junction conditions can be found in a simple algebraic way. At the sequence of intersections there are localised independent energy tensors, constrained only by energy conservation. We work out explicitly the simplest non trivial case.
