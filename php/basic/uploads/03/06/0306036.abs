Title: The Classical Solutions of the Dimensionally Reduced Gravitational  Chern-Simons Theory
Authors: D. Grumiller and W. Kummer
Abstract: The Kaluza-Klein reduction of the 3d gravitational Chern-Simons term to a 2d theory is equivalent to a Poisson-sigma model with fourdimensional target space and degenerate Poisson tensor of rank 2. Thus two constants of motion (Casimir functions) exist, namely charge and energy. The application of well-known methods developed in the framework of first order gravity allows to construct all classical solutions straightforwardly and to discuss their global structure. For a certain fine tuning of the values of the constants of motion the solutions of hep-th/0305117 are reproduced. Possible generalizations are pointed out.
