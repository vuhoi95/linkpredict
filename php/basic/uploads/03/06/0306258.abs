Title: Poincare invariant gravity with local supersymmetry as a gauge theory  for the M-algebra
Authors: Mokhtar Hassaine and Ricardo Troncoso and Jorge Zanelli
Abstract: Here we consider a gravitational action having local Poincare invariance which is given by the dimensional continuation of the Euler density in ten dimensions. It is shown that the local supersymmetric extension of this action requires the algebra to be the maximal extension of the N=1 super-Poincare algebra. The resulting action is shown to describe a gauge theory for the M-algebra, and is not the eleven-dimensional supergravity theory of Cremmer-Julia-Scherk. The theory admits a class of vacuum solutions of the form S^{10-d} x Y_{d+1}, where Y_{d+1} is a warped product of R with a d-dimensional spacetime. It is shown that a nontrivial propagator for the graviton exists only for d=4 and positive cosmological constant. Perturbations of the metric around this solution reproduce linearized General Relativity around four-dimensional de Sitter spacetime.
