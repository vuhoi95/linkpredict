Title: Cosmological anti-deSitter space-times and time-dependent AdS/CFT  correspondence
Authors: Mirjam Cvetic and Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: We study classes of five-dimensional cosmological solutions with negative curvature, which are obtained from static solutions by an exchange of a spatial and temporal coordinate, and in some cases by an analytic continuation. Such solutions provide a suitable laboratory to address the time-dependent AdS/CFT correspondence. For a specific example we address in detail the calculation of the boundary stress-energy and the Wilson line and find disagreement with the standard AdS/CFT correspondence. We trace these discrepancies to the time-dependent effects, such as particle creation, which we further study for specific backgrounds. We also identify specific time-dependent backgrounds that reproduce the correct conformal anomaly. For such backgrounds the calculation of the Wilson line in the adiabatic approximation indicates only a Coulomb repulsion.
