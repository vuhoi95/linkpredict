Title: Galilean noncommutative gauge theory: symmetries & vortices
Authors: P. A. Horvathy and L. Martina and P. C. Stichel
Abstract: Noncommutative Chern-Simons gauge theory coupled to nonrelativistic scalars or spinors is shown to admit the ``exotic'' two-parameter-centrally extended Galilean symmetry, realized in a unique way consistent with the Seiberg-Witten map. Nontopological spinor vortices and topological external-field vortices are constructed by reducing the problem to previously solved self-dual equations.
