Title: Perturbations in a non-singular bouncing Universe
Authors: M. Gasperini and M. Giovannini and G. Veneziano
Abstract: We complement the low-energy gravi-dilaton effective action of string theory with a non-local, general-covariant dilaton potential, and obtain homogeneous solutions describing a non-singular (bouncing-curvature) cosmology. We then compute, both analytically and numerically, the spectrum of amplified scalar and tensor perturbations, and draw some general lessons on how to extract observable consequences from pre-big bang and ekpyrotic scenarios.
