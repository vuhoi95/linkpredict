Abstract: Recently proposed nonlocal and nonperturbative late time behavior of the heat kernel is generalized to curved spacetimes. Heat kernel trace asymptotics is dominated by two terms one of which represents a trivial covariantization of the flat-space result and another one is given by the Gibbons-Hawking integral over asymptotically-flat infinity. Nonlocal terms of the effective action generated by this asymptotics might underly long- distance modifications of the Einstein theory motivated by the cosmological constant problem. New mechanisms of the cosmological constant induced by infrared effects of matter and graviton loops are briefly discussed.
