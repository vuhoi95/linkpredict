Title: Non-singular black-holes on the brane
Authors: S. Shankaranarayanan and Naresh Dadhich
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of obtaining non-singular black-hole solutions in the brane world model by solving the effective field equations for the induced metric on the brane. The Reissner-Nordstrom solution on the brane was obtained by Dadhich etal by imposing the null energy condition on the 3-brane for a bulk having non zero Weyl curvature. In this work, we relax the condition of vanishing scalar curvature $R$, however, retaining the null condition. We have shown that it is possible to obtain class of static non-singular spherically symmetric brane space-times admitting horizon. We obtain one such class of solution which is a regular version of the Reissner-Nordstrom solution in the standard general relativity.
