Title: Free tensor multiplets and strings in spontaneously broken  six-dimensional (2,0) theory
Authors: Par Arvidsson and Erik Flink and Mans Henningson
Abstract: We first review the representations of the six-dimensional (2,0) superalgebra on a free tensor multiplet and on a free string. We then construct a supersymmetric Lagrangian describing a free tensor multiplet. (It also includes a decoupled anti self-dual part of the three-form field strength.) This field theory is then rewritten in variables appropriate for analyzing a situation where the R-symmetry is spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation values of the scalar moduli fields. Finally, we construct a supersymmetric and kappa-symmetric action for a free string.
