Title: Comment on "The massive Thirring model from XYZ spin chain" by Kolanovic  et al
Authors: Takehisa Fujita and Takuya Kobayashi and Hidenori Takahashi
Abstract: It is shown that the continuum limit of the spin 1/2 Heisenberg XYZ model is far from sufficient for the site number of 16. Therefore, the energy spectrum of the XYZ model obtained by Kolanovic et al. has nothing to do with the massive Thirring model, but it shows only the spectrum of the finite size effects.
