Authors: Jan B. Gutowski and Dario Martelli and Harvey S. Reall
Abstract: A general form for all supersymmetric solutions of minimal supergravity in six dimensions is obtained. Examples of new supersymmetric solutions are presented. It is proven that the only maximally supersymmetric solutions are flat space, AdS_3 x S^3 and a plane wave. As an application of the general solution, it is shown that any supersymmetric solution with a compact horizon must have near-horizon geometry R^{1,1} x T^4, R^{1,1} x K3 or identified AdS_3 x S^3.
