Title: The Uses of Conformal Symmetry in QCD
Authors: V. M. Braun and G. P. Korchemsky and D. Mueller
Abstract: The Lagrangian of Quantum Chromodynamics is invariant under conformal transformations. Although this symmetry is broken by quantum corrections, it has important consequences for strong interactions at short distances and provides one with powerful tools in practical calculations. In this review we give a short exposition of the relevant ideas, techniques and applications of conformal symmetry to various problems of interest.
