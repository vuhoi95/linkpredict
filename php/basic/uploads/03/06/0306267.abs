Title: Topological charges for branes in M-theory
Authors: Emily J. Hackett-Jones and David C. Page and Douglas J. Smith
Abstract: We propose a simple form for the superalgebra of M2 and M5-brane probes in arbitrary supersymmetric backgrounds of 11D supergravity, extending previous results in the literature. In particular, we identify the topological charges in the algebras and find BPS bounds for the energies. The charges are given by the integral over a brane's spatial worldvolume of a certain closed form built out of the Killing spinors and background fields. The existence of such closed forms for arbitrary supersymmetric backgrounds generalises the existence of calibration forms for special holonomy manifolds.
