Title: Twisted Open Strings from Closed Strings: The WZW Orientation Orbifolds
Authors: M. B. Halpern and C. Helfgott
Abstract: Including {\it world-sheet orientation-reversing automorphisms} $\hat{h}_{\sigma} \in H_-$ in the orbifold program, we construct the operator algebras and twisted KZ systems of the general WZW {\it orientation orbifold} $A_g (H_-) /H_-$. We find that the orientation-orbifold sectors corresponding to each $\hat{h}_{\sigma} \in H_-$ are {\it twisted open} WZW strings, whose properties are quite distinct from conventional open-string orientifold sectors. As simple illustrations, we also discuss the classical (high-level) limit of our construction and free-boson examples on abelian $g$.
