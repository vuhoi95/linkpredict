Title: The UV/IR Interplay in Theories with Space-time Varying  Non-commutativity
Authors: Daniel Robbins and Savdeep Sethi
Abstract: We consider scalar field theory with space and space-time-dependent non-commutativity. In perturbation theory, we find that the structure of the UV/IR mixing is quite different from cases with constant non-commutativity. In particular, UV/IR mixing becomes intertwined in an interesting way with violations of momentum conservation.
