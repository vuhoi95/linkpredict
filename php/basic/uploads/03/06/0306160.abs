Title: Monopole-Antimonopole Solutions of the Skyrmed SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs  Model
Authors: Vanush Paturyan and D. H. Tchrakian
Abstract: Axially symmetric monopole anti-monopole dipole solutions to the second order equations of a simple SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs model featuring a quartic Skyrme-like term are constructed numerically. The effect of varying the Skyrme coupling constant on these solutions is studied in some detail.
