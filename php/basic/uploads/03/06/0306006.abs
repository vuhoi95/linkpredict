Title: An extension of Fourier analysis for the n-torus in the magnetic field  and its application to spectral analysis of the magnetic Laplacian
Authors: Makoto Sakamoto and Shogo Tanimura
Abstract: We solved the Schr{\"o}dinger equation for a particle in a uniform magnetic field in the n-dimensional torus. We obtained a complete set of solutions for a broad class of problems; the torus T^n = R^n / {\Lambda} is defined as a quotient of the Euclidean space R^n by an arbitrary n-dimensional lattice {\Lambda}. The lattice is not necessary either cubic or rectangular. The magnetic field is also arbitrary. However, we restrict ourselves within potential-free problems; the Schr{\"o}dinger operator is assumed to be the Laplace operator defined with the covariant derivative. We defined an algebra that characterizes the symmetry of the Laplacian and named it the magnetic algebra. We proved that the space of functions on which the Laplacian acts is an irreducible representation space of the magnetic algebra. In this sense the magnetic algebra completely characterizes the quantum mechanics in the magnetic torus. We developed a new method for Fourier analysis for the magnetic torus and used it to solve the eigenvalue problem of the Laplacian. All the eigenfunctions are given in explicit forms.
