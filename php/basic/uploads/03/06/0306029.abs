Title: On Koopman-von Neumann Waves II
Authors: E. Gozzi and D. Mauro
Abstract: In this paper we continue the study, started in [1], of the operatorial formulation of classical mechanics given by Koopman and von Neumann (KvN) in the Thirties. In particular we show that the introduction of the KvN Hilbert space of complex and square integrable "wave functions" requires an enlargement of the set of the observables of ordinary classical mechanics. The possible role and the meaning of these extra observables is briefly indicated in this work. We also analyze the similarities and differences between non selective measurements and two-slit experiments in classical and quantum mechanics.
