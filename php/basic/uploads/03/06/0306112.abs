Title: Asymptotically anti-de Sitter space-times: symmetries and conservation  laws revisited
Authors: Glenn Barnich and Friedemann Brandt and Kim Claes
Abstract: In this short note, we verify explicitly in static coordinates that the non trivial asymptotic Killing vectors at spatial infinity for anti-de Sitter space-times correspond one to one to the conformal Killing vectors of the conformally flat metric induced on the boundary. The fall-off conditions for the metric perturbations that guarantee finiteness of the associated conserved charges are derived.
