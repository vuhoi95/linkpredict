Title: A Proof of a Conjecture of Marino-Vafa on Hodge Integrals
Authors: Chiu-Chu Melissa Liu and Kefeng Liu and Jian Zhou
Abstract: We prove a remarkable formula for Hodge integrals conjectured by Marino and Vafa based on large N duality, using functorial virtual localization on certain moduli spaces of relative stable morphisms.
