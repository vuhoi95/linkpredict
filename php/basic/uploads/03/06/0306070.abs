Title: Asymptotic dynamics in 3D gravity with torsion
Authors: M. Blagojevic and M. Vasilic
Abstract: We study the nature of boundary dynamics in the teleparallel 3D gravity. The asymptotic field equations with anti-de Sitter boundary conditions yield only two non-trivial boundary modes, related to a conformal field theory with classical central charge. After showing that the teleparallel gravity can be formulated as a Chern-Simons theory, we identify dynamical structure at the boundary as the Liouville theory.
