Title: Noncommutative Self-Dual Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Hitoshi Nishino and Subhash Rajpoot
Abstract: We formulate noncommutative self-dual N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in D=2+2 dimensions. As in the corresponding commutative case, this theory can serve as the possible master theory of all the noncommutative supersymmetric integrable models in lower dimensions. As a by-product, noncommutative self-dual N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory is obtained in D=2+2. We also perform a dimensional reduction of the N=2 theory further into N=(2,2) in D=1+1, as a basis for more general future applications. As a typical example, we show how noncommutative integrable matrix N=(1,0) supersymmetric KdV equations in D=1+1 arise from this theory, via the Yang-Mills gauge groups GL(n, R) or SL(2n, R).
