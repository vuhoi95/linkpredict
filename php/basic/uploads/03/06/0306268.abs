Title: The Hamiltonian BRST quantization of a noncommutative nonabelian gauge  theory and its Seiberg-Witten map
Authors: Ricardo Amorim and Franz A. Farias
Abstract: We consider the Hamiltonian BRST quantization of a noncommutative non abelian gauge theory. The Seiberg-Witten map of all phase-space variables, including multipliers, ghosts and their momenta, is given in first order in the noncommutative parameter $\theta$. We show that there exists a complete consistence between the gauge structures of the original and of the mapped theories, derived in a canonical way, once we appropriately choose the map solutions.
