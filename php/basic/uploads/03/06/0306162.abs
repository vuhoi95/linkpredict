Title: Quasi exactly solvable (QES) equations with multiple algebraisations
Authors: Yves Brihaye and Betti Hartmann
Abstract: We review three examples of quasi exactly solvable (QES) Hamitonians which possess multiple algebraisations. This includes the most prominent example, the Lame equation, as well as recently studied many-body Hamiltonians with Weierstrass interaction potential and finally, a 2x2 coupled channel Hamiltonian.
