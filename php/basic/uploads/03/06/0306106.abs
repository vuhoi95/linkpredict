Abstract: We study the stability of five-dimensional Myers-Perry black holes with a single angular momentum under linear perturbations, and we compute the quasinormal modes (QNM's) of the black hole metric projected on the brane, using Leaver's continued fraction method. In our numerical search we do not find unstable modes. The damping time of modes having l=m=2 and l=m=1 tends to infinity as the black hole spin tends to the extremal value, showing a behaviour reminiscent of the one observed for ordinary 4-dimensional Kerr black holes.
