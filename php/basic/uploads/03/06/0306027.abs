Title: Non-Linear N-Parameter Spacetime Perturbations: Gauge Transformations
Authors: Carlos F. Sopuerta and Marco Bruni and Leonardo Gualtieri
Abstract: We introduce N-parameter perturbation theory as a new tool for the study of non-linear relativistic phenomena. The main ingredient in this formulation is the use of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. The associated machinery allows us to prove the main results concerning the consistency of the scheme to any perturbative order. Gauge transformations and conditions for gauge invariance at any required order can then be derived from a generating exponential formula via a simple Taylor expansion. We outline the relation between our novel formulation and previous developments.
