Title: Supergravity in (2+1) dimensions from (3+1)-dimensional Supergravity
Authors: Patricio Salgado and Fernando Izaurieta and Eduardo Rodriguez
Abstract: In the context of the formalism proposed by Stelle-West and Grignani-Nardelli, it is shown that Chern-Simons supergravity can be consistently obtained as a dimensional reduction of (3+1)-dimensional supergravity, when written as a gauge theory of the Poincare group. The dimensional reductions are consistent with the gauge symmetries, mapping (3+1)-dimensional Poincare supergroup gauge transformations onto (2+1)-dimensional Poincare supergroup ones.
