Title: Dynamical symmetry breaking and the Nambu-Goldstone theorem in the  Gaussian wave functional approximation
Authors: V. Dmitrasinovic and Issei Nakamura
Abstract: We analyze the group-theoretical ramifications of the Nambu-Goldstone [NG] theorem in the self-consistent relativistic variational Gaussian wave functional approximation to spinless field theories. In an illustrative example we show how the Nambu-Goldstone theorem would work in the O(N) symmetric $\phi^4$ scalar field theory, if the residual symmetry of the vacuum were lesser than O(N-1), e.g. if the vacuum were O(N-2), or O(N-3),... symmetric. [This does not imply that any of the "lesser" vacua is actually the absolute energy minimum: stability analysis has not been done.] The requisite number of NG bosons would be (2N - 3), or (3N - 6), ... respectively, which may exceed N, the number of elementary fields in the Lagrangian. We show how the requisite new NG bosons would appear even in channels that do not carry the same quantum numbers as one of N "elementary particles" (scalar field quanta, or Castillejo-Dalitz-Dyson [CDD] poles) in the Lagrangian, i.e. in those "flavour" channels that have no CDD poles. The corresponding Nambu-Goldstone bosons are composites (bound states) of pairs of massive elementary (CDD) scalar fields excitations. As a nontrivial example of this method we apply it to the physically more interesting 't Hooft $\sigma$ model (an extended $N_{f} = 2$ bosonic linear $\sigma$ model with four scalar and four pseudoscalar fields), with spontaneously and explicitly broken chiral $O(4) \times O(2) \simeq SU_{\rm R} (2) \times SU_{\rm L}(2) \times U_{\rm A}(1)$ symmetry.
