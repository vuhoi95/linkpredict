Abstract: We perform the generalised dimensional reduction of D=11 supergravity over three-dimensional group manifolds as classified by Bianchi. Thus, we construct eleven different maximal D=8 gauged supergravities, two of which have an additional parameter. One class of group manifolds (class B) leads to supergravities that are defined by a set of equations of motion that cannot be integrated to an action. All 1/2 BPS domain wall solutions are given. We also find a non-supersymmetric domain wall solution where the single transverse direction is time. This solution describes an expanding universe and upon reduction gives the Einstein-de Sitter universe in D=4. The uplifting of the different solutions to M-theory and the isometries of the corresponding group manifold are discussed.
