Title: Bi-element representations of ternary groups
Authors: Andrzej Borowiec and Wieslaw A. Dudek and Steven Duplij
Abstract: General properties of ternary semigroups and groups are considered. The bi-element representation theory in which every representation matrix corresponds to a pair of elements is built, connection with the standard theory is considered and several concrete examples are constructed. For clarity the shortened versions of classical Gluskin-Hossz\'{u} and Post theorems are given for them.
