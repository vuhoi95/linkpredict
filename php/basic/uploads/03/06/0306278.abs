Title: Supergravity vacua and lorentzian Lie groups
Authors: Ali Chamseddine and Jos√© Figueroa-O'Farrill and Wafic Sabra
Abstract: We classify maximally supersymmetric backgrounds (vacua) of chiral (1,0) and (2,0) supergravities in six dimensions and, by reduction, also those of the minimal N=2 supergravity in five dimensions. Up to R-symmetry, the (2,0) vacua are in one-to-one correspondence with (1,0) vacua, and these in turn are locally isometric to Lie groups admitting a bi-invariant lorentzian metric with anti-selfdual parallelising torsion, which we classify. We then show that the five-dimensional vacua are homogeneous spaces arising canonically as the spaces of right cosets of spacelike one-parameter subgroups.
