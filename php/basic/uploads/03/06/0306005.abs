Title: Adiabatic and entropy perturbations propagation in a bouncing Universe
Authors: Patrick Peter and Nelson Pinto-Neto and Diego A. Gonzalez
Abstract: By studying some bouncing universe models dominated by a specific class of hydrodynamical fluids, we show that the primordial cosmological perturbations may propagate smoothly through a general relativistic bounce. We also find that the purely adiabatic modes, although almost always fruitfully investigated in all other contexts in cosmology, are meaningless in the bounce or null energy condition (NEC) violation cases since the entropy modes can never be neglected in these situations: the adiabatic modes exhibit a fake divergence that is compensated in the total Bardeen gravitational potential by inclusion of the entropy perturbations.
