Abstract: We discuss the onset of the non-linear regime in the context of unified dark matter models involving a generalised Chaplygin gas. We show that the transition from dark matter-like to dark energy-like behaviour will never be smooth. In some regions of space the transition will never take place while in others it may happen sooner or later than naively expected. As a result the linear theory used in previous studies may break down late in the matter dominated era even on large cosmological scales. We study the importance of this effect showing that its magnitude depends on the exact form of the equation of state in the low density regime. We expect that our results will be relevant for other unified dark matter scenarios particularly those where the quartessence candidate is a perfect fluid.
