Abstract: We investigate the coherent bremsstrahlung by relativistic electrons in a single crystal excited by hypersonic vibrations. The formula for the corresponding differential cross-section is derived in the case of a sinusoidal wave. The conditions are specified under which the influence of the hypersound is essential. The case is considered in detail when the electron enters into the crystal at small angles with respect to a crystallographic axis. It is shown that in dependence of the parameters, the presence of hypersonic waves can either enhance or reduce the bremsstrahlung cross-section.
