Title: Vanishing of the conformal anomaly for strings in a gravitational wave
Authors: C. Duval and Z. Horvath and P. A. Horvathy
Abstract: Using the non-symmetric-connection approach proposed by Osborn, we demonstrate that, for a bosonic string in a specially chosen plane-fronted gravitational wave and an axion background, the conformal anomaly vanishes at the two-loop level. Under some conditions, the anomaly vanishes at all orders.
