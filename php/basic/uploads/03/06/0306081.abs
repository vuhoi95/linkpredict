Title: Zero mode in the time-dependent symmetry breaking of $λφ^4$  theory
Authors: Hyeong-Chan Kim and Jae Hyung Yee
Abstract: We apply the quartic exponential variational approximation to the symmetry breaking phenomena of scalar field in three and four dimensions. We calculate effective potential and effective action for the time-dependent system by separating the zero mode from other non-zero modes of the scalar field and treating the zero mode quantum mechanically. It is shown that the quantum mechanical properties of the zero mode play a non-trivial role in the symmetry breaking of the scalar $\lambda \phi^4$ theory.
