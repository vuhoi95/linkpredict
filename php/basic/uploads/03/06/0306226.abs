Title: Superstrings in Graviphoton Background and N=1/2+3/2 Supersymmetry
Authors: Nathan Berkovits and Nathan Seiberg
Abstract: Motivated by Ooguri and Vafa, we study superstrings in flat R^4 in a constant self-dual graviphoton background. The supergravity equations of motion are satisfied in this background which deforms the N=2 d=4 flat space super-Poincare algebra to another algebra with eight supercharges. A D-brane in this space preserves a quarter of the supercharges; i.e. N=1/2 supersymmetry is realized linearly, and the remaining N=3/2 supersymmetry is realized nonlinearly. The theory on the brane can be described as a theory in noncommutative superspace in which the chiral fermionic coordinates $\theta^\alpha$ of N=1 d=4 superspace are not Grassman variables but satisfy a Clifford algebra.
