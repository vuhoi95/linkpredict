Title: Exploring the holographic principle in asymptotically flat spacetimes  via the BMS group
Authors: Giovanni Arcioni and Claudio Dappiaggi
Abstract: We explore the holographic principle in the context of asymptotically flat spacetimes. In analogy with the AdS/CFT scenario we analyse the asympotically symmetry group of this class of spacetimes, the so called Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group. We apply the covariant entropy bound to relate bulk entropy to boundary symmetries and find a quite different picture with respect to the asymptotically AdS case. We then derive the covariant wave equations for fields carrying BMS representations to investigate the nature of the boundary degrees of freedom. We find some similarities with 't Hooft S-matrix proposal and suggest a possible mechanism to encode bulk data.
