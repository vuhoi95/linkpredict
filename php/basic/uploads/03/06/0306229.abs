Title: On the vacua in the massless Thirring model
Authors: M. Faber and A. N. Ivanov
Abstract: We calculate the most general effective potential for the massless Thirring model in dependence of the local fields of all fermion-antifermion collective excitations. We analyse the minima of this potential describing different vacua of the quantum system. We confirm the existence of the absolute minimum found in EPJC 20, 723 (2001) corresponding to the chirally broken phase of the massless Thirring model. As has been shown in EPJC 20, 723 (2001) this minimum is stable under quantum fluctuations.
