Title: Confinement from Merons
Authors: F. Lenz and J. W. Negele and M. Thies
Abstract: It is shown that an effective theory with meron degrees of freedom produces confinement in SU(2) Yang Mills theory. This effective theory is compatible with center symmetry. When the scale is set by the string tension, the action density and topological susceptibility are similar to those arising in lattice QCD.
