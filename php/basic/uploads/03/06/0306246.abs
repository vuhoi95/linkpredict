Title: On threshold amplitudes II: Amplitudes nullification via classical  symmetries
Authors: Joanna Domienik and Piotr Kosinski
Abstract: The Ward identities for amplitudes at the tree level are derived from symmetries of the corresponding classical dynamical systems. The results are applied to some 2 into n amplitudes.
