Title: Coulomb's law modification in nonlinear and in noncommutative  electrodynamics
Authors: Patricio Gaete and Iv√°n Schmidt
Abstract: We study the lowest-order modifications of the static potential for Born-Infeld electrodynamics and for the $\theta$-expanded version of the noncommutative U(1) gauge theory, within the framework of the gauge-invariant but path-dependent variables formalism. The calculation shows a long-range correction ($1/r^5$-type) to the Coulomb potential in Born-Infeld electrodynamics. However, the Coulomb nature of the potential (to order $e^2$) is preserved in noncommutative electrodynamics.
