Title: CMB Anisotropies in the Presence of Extra Dimensions
Authors: C. S. Rhodes and C. van de Bruck and Ph. Brax and A. C. Davis
Abstract: We discuss the effect of the time evolution of extra dimensions on CMB anisotropies and large-scale structure formation. We study the impact of scalar fields in a low-energy effective description of a general class of brane world models on the temperature anisotropy power spectrum. We show that when the coupling between these scalar fields and matter evolves over cosmological timescales, current observations of the CMB anisotropies can constrain primordial values of the fields in a manner complementary to local, late-time tests of gravity. We also present the effect of these fields on the polarization anisotropy spectra and the growth of large-scale structure, showing that future CMB observations will constrain theories of the Universe involving extra dimensions even further.
