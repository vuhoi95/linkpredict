Title: A twisted conformal field theory description of dissipative quantum  mechanics
Authors: G. Cristofano and V. Marotta and A. Naddeo
Abstract: We show how the recently proposed CFT for a bilayer Quantum Hall system at filling nu=m/pm+2, the Twisted Model (TM), is equivalent to the system of two massless scalar bosons with a magnetic boundary interaction as introduced in Nucl. Phys. B443 (1995) 444, at the so called magic points. We are then able to describe, within such a framework, the dissipative quantum mechanics of a particle confined to a plane and subject to an external magnetic field normal to it. Such an analogy is further developed in terms of the TM boundary states, by describing the interaction between an impurity with a Hall system.
