Title: Twisting Warped Supergravity
Authors: Jonathan Bagger and Dmitry Belyaev
Abstract: We study gauged five-dimensional supergravity on the interval [0,\pi R]. We find a set of boundary conditions with respect to which the theory is locally supersymmetric. For theories with detuned brane tensions (\Lambda_4<0), we show that these boundary conditions can be used to spontaneously break global supersymmetry. For the original, tuned Randall-Sundrum scenario (\Lambda_4=0), we prove that the locally supersymmetric boundary conditions are also globally supersymmetric. We lift the theory from [0,\pi R] to S^1 and R, with arbitrary twists for the fermions, and cast these results in the language of the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism.
