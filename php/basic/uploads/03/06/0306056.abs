Abstract: Oblique Dp-branes in the maximally supersymmetric type IIB plane-wave background are constructed in terms of boundary states, as well as from the open string point of view. These Dp-branes, whose existence was anticipated by Hikida and Yamaguchi from general supersymmetry arguments, have an isometry that is a subgroup of the diagonal SO(4) symmetry of the background. The oblique D3-brane is found to preserve four dynamical and four kinematical supersymmetries while the oblique D5-brane preserves one half of both the dynamical and kinematical supersymmetries. We also discuss the open-string boundary conditions for curved D7- and D5-branes, and analyze their supersymmetry.
