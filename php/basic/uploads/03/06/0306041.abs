Title: Abelian and nonabelian vector field effective actions from string field  theory
Authors: Erasmo Coletti and Ilya Sigalov and Washington Taylor
Abstract: The leading terms in the tree-level effective action for the massless fields of the bosonic open string are calculated by integrating out all massive fields in Witten's cubic string field theory. In both the abelian and nonabelian theories, field redefinitions make it possible to express the effective action in terms of the conventional field strength. The resulting actions reproduce the leading terms in the abelian and nonabelian Born-Infeld theories, and include (covariant) derivative corrections.
