Title: Higher order terms in the non-abelian D-brane effective action and  magnetic background fields
Authors: Alexander Sevrin and Alexander Wijns
Abstract: Recently a proposal for the non-abelian effective D-brane action was given through fourth order in alpha'. As the resulting expressions turned out to be quite involved, some checks of this result are called for. In the present paper we calculate the spectrum in the presence of constant magnetic background fields and compare it to the string theoretical result. Apart from a small typo in the original expression (the overall sign of thefourth order term), we obtain perfect agreement. We discuss potential applications.
