Abstract: 30-component, of the first order, equation for a spin 2 particle, equivalent to the second order Pauli-Fierz one, is generalized to presence of an external electromagnetic field as well as a curved background space-time geometry. The essential property of the generally covariant wave equation obtained is that here from the very beginning, in accordance with requirement of the Pauli-Fierz approach, a set of additional relations on 30-component wave function for eliminating complementary spin 0 and spin 1 fields is present at the starting equation.
