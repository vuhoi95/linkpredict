Title: Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays and Air Shower Simulations: a top-bottom  view

Abstract: Stable Superstring Relics (SSR) provide some of the candidates for the possible origin of the Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR). After a brief overview of the motivations for introducing such relics, we address the question whether statistical fluctuations in the formation of the air showers generated by the primary spectrum of protons can be separated from a possible signal of new physics hidden in the first impact with the atmosphere. Our results are generated by using minimal modifications in the cross section of the primaries, and using available simulation codes used by the experimental collaborations. The results indicate that substantial increases in the cross section of the first impact, possibly due to new interactions, are unlikely to be detected in geometrical and/or variations of multiplicities in the cascade.
