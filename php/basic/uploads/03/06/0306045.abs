Title: Exact Quantum State of Collapse and Black Hole Radiation
Authors: Cenalo Vaz and Louis Witten and T. P. Singh
Abstract: We construct an exact quantum gravitational state describing the collapse of an inhomogeneous spherical dust cloud using a lattice regularization of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. In the semiclassical approximation around a black hole, this state describes Hawking radiation. We show that the leading quantum gravitational correction to Hawking radiation renders the spectrum non-thermal.
