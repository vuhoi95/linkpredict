Title: Four-dimensional Hall mechanics as a particle on $\DC P^3$
Authors: Stefano Bellucci and Pierre-Yves Casteill and Armen Nersessian
Abstract: In order to establish an explicit connection between four-dimensional Hall effect on $S^4$ and six-dimensional Hall effect on $\DC P^3$, we perform the Hamiltonian reduction of a particle moving on $\DC P^3$ in a constant magnetic field to the four-dimensional Hall mechanics (i.e. a particle on $S^4$ in a SU(2) instanton field). This reduction corresponds to fixing the isospin of the latter system.
