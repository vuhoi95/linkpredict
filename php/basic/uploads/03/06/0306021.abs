Title: Higher curvature Lagrangians, conformal symmetry and microscopic entropy  of Killing horizons
Authors: M. Cvitan and S. Pallua and P. Prester
Abstract: We impose a certain class of boundary conditions on Killing horizon and show for Lagrangians with arbitrary curvature dependence that one can identify a Virasoro algebra with nontrivial central charge and calculable Hamiltonian eigenvalue. Entropy can then be calculated from Cardy formula.
