Title: A Novel Approach to the Cosmological Constant Problem
Authors: Alberto Iglesias and Zurab Kakushadze
Abstract: We propose a novel infinite-volume brane world scenario where we live on a non-inflating spherical 3-brane, whose radius is somewhat larger than the present Hubble size, embedded in higher dimensional bulk. Once we include higher curvature terms in the bulk, we find completely smooth solutions with the property that the 3-brane world-volume is non-inflating for a continuous range of positive values of the brane tension, that is, without fine-tuning. In particular, our solution, which is a near-BPS background with supersymmetry broken on the brane around TeV, is controlled by a single integration constant.
