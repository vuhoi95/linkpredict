Title: Fedosov supermanifolds: Basic properties and the difference in even and  odd cases
Authors: Bodo Geyer and Petr Lavrov
Abstract: We study basic properties of supermanifolds endowed with an even (odd) symplectic structure and a connection respecting this symplectic structure. Such supermanifolds can be considered as generalization of Fedosov manifolds to the supersymmetric case. Choosing an apporpriate definition of inverse (second-rank) tensor fields on supermanifolds we consider the symmetry behavior of tensor fields as well as the properties of the symplectic curvature and of the Ricci tensor on even (odd) Fedosov supermanifolds. We show that for odd Fedosov supermanifolds the scalar curvature, in general, is non-trivial while for even Fedosov supermanifolds it necessarily vanishes.
