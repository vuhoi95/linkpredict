Authors: M. Gadella and M. A. del Olmo and J. Tosiek
Abstract: Some properties of the star product of the Weyl type (i.e. associated with the Weyl ordering) are proved. Fedosov construction of the *-product on a 2-dimensional phase spacewith a constant curvature tensor is presented. Eigenvalue equations for momentum p and position q on a 2-dimensional phase space with constant curvature tensors are solved.
