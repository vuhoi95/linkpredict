Title: Two loop effective potential for < A^2_Î¼> in the Landau gauge in  quantum chromodynamics
Authors: R. E. Browne and J. A. Gracey
Abstract: We construct the effective potential for the dimension two composite operator 1/2 A^{a 2}_\mu in QCD with massless quarks in the Landau gauge for an arbitrary colour group at two loops. For SU(3) we show that an estimate for the effective gluon mass decreases as N_f increases.
