Title: No UV/IR Mixing in Unitary Space-Time Noncommutative Field Theory
Authors: P. Fischer and V. Putz
Abstract: In this article we calculate several divergent amplitudes in phi^4-theory on non-commutative space-time in the framework of Interaction Point Time Ordered Perturbation Theory (IPTOPT), continuing work done in hep-th/0209253. On the ground of these results we find corresponding Feynman rules which allow for a much easier diagrammatic calculation of amplitudes. The most important feature of the present theory is the lack of the UV/IR mixing problem in all amplitudes calculated so far. Although we are not yet able to give a rigorous proof, we provide a strong argument for this result to hold in general. Together with the found Feynman rules this opens promising vistas towards the systematic renormalization of non-commutative field theories.
