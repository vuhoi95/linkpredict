Title: Higher-Derivative Terms in N=2 Supersymmetric Effective Actions
Authors: Philip C. Argyres and Adel M. Awad and Gregory A. Braun and F. Paul Esposito
Abstract: We show how to systematically construct higher-derivative terms in effective actions in harmonic superspace despite the infinite redundancy in their description due to the infinite number of auxiliary fields. Making an assumption about the absence of certain superspace Chern-Simons-like terms involving vector multiplets, we write all 3- and 4-derivative terms on Higgs, Coulomb, and mixed branches. Among these terms are several with only holomorphic dependence on fields, and at least one satisfies a non-renormalization theorem. These holomorphic terms include a novel 3-derivative term on mixed branches given as an integral over 3/4 of superspace. As an illustration of our method, we search for Wess-Zumino terms in the low energy effective action of N=2 supersymmetric QCD. We show that such terms occur only on mixed branches. We also present an argument showing that the combination of space-time locality with supersymmetry implies locality in the anticommuting superspace coordinates of for unconstrained superfields.
