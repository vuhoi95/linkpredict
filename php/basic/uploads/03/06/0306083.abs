Title: No massless boson in chiral symmetry breaking in NJL and Thirring models
Authors: Makoto Hiramoto and Takehisa Fujita
Abstract: We show that the chiral symmetry breaking occurs in the vacuum of the massless Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) and Thirring models without a Goldstone boson. The basic reason of non-existence of the massless boson is due to the fact that the new vacuum after the symmetry breaking acquires nonzero fermion mass which inevitably leads to massive bosons. The new vacuum has a finite condensate of $<\bar \psi \psi>$ with the chiral current conservation. Thus, it contradicts the Goldstone theorem, and we show that the proof of the Goldstone theorem cannot be justified any more for fermion field theory models with regularizations.
