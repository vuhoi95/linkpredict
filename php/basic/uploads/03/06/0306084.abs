Title: Interplay between Zamolodchikov-Faddeev and Reflection-Transmission  algebras
Authors: M. Mintchev and E. Ragoucy
Abstract: We show that a suitable coset algebra, constructed in terms of an extension of the Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra, is homomorphic to the Reflection-Transmission algebra, as it appears in the study of integrable systems with impurity.
