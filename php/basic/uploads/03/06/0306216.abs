Title: Quiver Mechanics for Deconstructed Matrix String
Authors: Jian Dai and Yong-Shi Wu
Abstract: In this paper we propose a quiver model of matrix quantum mechanics with 8 supercharges which, on a Higgs branch, deconstructs the worldsheet of Matrix String Theory. This discrete model evades the fermion doubling problem and, in the continuum limit, enhances the number of supersymmetries to sixteen. Our model is motivated by orbifolding the Matrix Model, and the deconstruction {\it ansatz} exhibits a duality between target space compactification and worldsheet deconstruction.
