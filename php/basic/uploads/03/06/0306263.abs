Title: Noncommutative Monopoles and Riemann-Hilbert Problems
Authors: Olaf Lechtenfeld and Alexander D. Popov
Abstract: The Bogomolny equations for Yang-Mills-Higgs monopoles follow from a system of linear equations which may be solved through a parametric Riemann-Hilbert problem. We extend this approach to noncommutative R^3 and use it to (re)construct noncommutative Dirac, Wu-Yang, and BPS monopole configurations in a unified manner. In all cases we write down the underlying matrix-valued functions for multi-monopoles and solve the corresponding Riemann-Hilbert problems for charge one.
