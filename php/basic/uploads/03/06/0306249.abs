Title: Area Preserving Transformations in Non-commutative Space and NCCS Theory
Authors: M. Eliashvili and G. Tsitsishvili
Abstract: We propose an heuristic rule for the area transformation on the non-commutative plane. The non-commutative area preserving transformations are quantum deformation of the classical symplectic diffeomorphisms. Area preservation condition is formulated as a field equation in the non-commutative Chern-Simons gauge theory. The higher dimensional generalization is suggested and the corresponding algebraic structure - the infinite dimensional $\sin$-Lie algebra is extracted. As an illustrative example the second-quantized formulation for electrons in the lowest Landau level is considered.
