Title: Generalizing the N=2 supersymmetric RG flow solution of IIB supergravity
Authors: Krzysztof Pilch and Nicholas P. Warner
Abstract: We explicitly construct the supersymmetry transformations for the N=2 supersymmetric RG flow solution of chiral IIB supergravity. We show that the metric, dilaton/axion, five-index tensor and half of the three index tensor are determined algebraically in terms of the Killing spinor of the unbroken supersymmetry. The algebraic nature of the solution allows us to generalize this construction to a new class of N=2 supersymmetric solutions of IIB supergravity. Each solution in this class is algebraically determined by supersymmetry and is parametrized by a single function of two variables that satisfies a non-linear equation akin to the Laplace equation on the space transverse to the brane.
