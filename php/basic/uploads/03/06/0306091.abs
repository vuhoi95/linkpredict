Title: BPS orientifold planes from crosscap states in Calabi-Yau  compactifications
Authors: L. R. Huiszoon and K. Schalm
Abstract: We use the results of hep-th/0007174 on the simple current classification of open unoriented CFTs to construct half supersymmetry preserving crosscap states for rational Calabi-Yau compactifications. We show that the corresponding orientifold fixed planes obey the BPS-like relation M=exp(i*phi)Q. To prove this relation, it is essential that the worldsheet CFT properly includes the degrees of freedom from the uncompactified space-time component. The BPS-phase phi can be identified with the automorphism type of the crosscap states. To illustrate the method we compute crosscap states in Gepner models with each k_i odd.
