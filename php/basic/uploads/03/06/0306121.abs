Title: The Moduli of Reducible Vector Bundles
Authors: Yang-Hui He and Burt A. Ovrut and Rene Reinbacher
Abstract: A procedure for computing the dimensions of the moduli spaces of reducible, holomorphic vector bundles on elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds X is presented. This procedure is applied to poly-stable rank n+m bundles of the form V + pi* M, where V is a stable vector bundle with structure group SU(n) on X and M is a stable vector bundle with structure group SU(m) on the base surface B of X. Such bundles arise from small instanton transitions involving five-branes wrapped on fibers of the elliptic fibration. The structure and physical meaning of these transitions are discussed.
