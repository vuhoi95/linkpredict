Title: Chiral SU(N) Gauge Theories and the Konishi Anomaly
Authors: Riccardo Argurio and Gabriele Ferretti and Rainer Heise
Abstract: We study chiral SU(N) supersymmetric gauge theories with matter in the antifundamental and antisymmetric representations. For SU(5) with two families, we show how to reproduce the non-perturbatively generated superpotential, and we discuss dynamical supersymmetry breaking purely in terms of the Konishi anomaly. We apply the same technique in general to SU(N) with one family. We also briefly comment on the chiral ring for these theories.
