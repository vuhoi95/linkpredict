Title: Defect Lines and Boundary Flows
Authors: K. Graham and G. M. T. Watts
Abstract: Using the properties of defect lines, we study boundary renormalisation group flows. We find that when there exists a flow between maximally symmetric boundary conditions "a" and "b" then there also exists a boundary flow between "c x a" and "c x b" where "x" denotes the fusion product. We also discuss applications of this simple observation.
