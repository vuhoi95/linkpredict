Title: Probing TeV gravity with extensive air-showers
Authors: Maximo Ave and Eun-Joo Ahn and Marco Cavaglia and Angela V. Olinto
Abstract: Particle collisions with center-of-mass energy larger than the fundamental gravitational scale can generate non perturbative gravitational objects such as black holes and branes. In models with large extra dimensions, the fundamental gravitational scale may be around a TeV, making it possible for next generation particle colliders and ultra-high energy cosmic rays to produce such non perturbative gravitational objects. The decay of TeV gravitational objects is significantly different from standard model processes such that probes of these new ideas are within reach. We study the differences between standard model and TeV gravity interactions in extensive air showers (EAS) generated by ultra-high energy cosmic neutrinos. We show that discriminating TeV gravity from standard model interactions is generally difficult, but not impossible given a few unique signatures.
