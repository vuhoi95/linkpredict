Authors: Vadim B. Kuznetsov and Vladimir V. Mangazeev and Evgeny K. Sklyanin
Abstract: Applying Baxter's method of the Q-operator to the set of Sekiguchi's commuting partial differential operators we show that Jack polynomials P(x_1,...,x_n) are eigenfunctions of a one-parameter family of integral operators Q_z. The operators Q_z are expressed in terms of the Dirichlet-Liouville n-dimensional beta integral. From a composition of n operators Q_{z_k} we construct an integral operator S_n factorising Jack polynomials into products of hypergeometric polynomials of one variable. The operator S_n admits a factorisation described in terms of restricted Jack polynomials P(x_1,...,x_k,1,...,1). Using the operator Q_z for z=0 we give a simple derivation of a previously known integral representation for Jack polynomials.
