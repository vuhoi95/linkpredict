Title: Partition Function and Open/Closed String Duality in Type IIA String  Theory on a PP-wave
Authors: Hyeonjoon Shin and Katsuyuki Sugiyama and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We discuss partition functions of N=(4,4) type IIA string theory on the pp-wave background. This theory is shown to be modular invariant. The boundary states are constructed and possible D-brane instantons are classified. Then we calculate cylinder amplitudes in both closed and open string descriptions and check the open/closed string duality. Furthermore we consider general properties of modular invariant partition functions in the case of pp-waves.
