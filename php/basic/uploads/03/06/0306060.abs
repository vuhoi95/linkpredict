Title: The Extended Toda Hierarchy
Authors: Guido Carlet and Boris Dubrovin and Youjin Zhang
Abstract: We present the Lax pair formalism for certain extension of the continuous limit of the classical Toda lattice hierarchy, provide a well defined notion of tau function for its solutions, and give an explicit formulation of the relationship between the $CP^1$ topological sigma model and the extended Toda hierarchy. We also establish an equivalence of the latter with certain extension of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger hierarchy.
