Title: Is Cosmic Speed-Up Due to New Gravitational Physics?
Authors: Sean M. Carroll and Vikram Duvvuri and Mark Trodden and Michael S. Turner
Abstract: We show that cosmic acceleration can arise due to very tiny corrections to the usual gravitational action of General Relativity of the form $R^n$, with $n<0$. This eliminates the need for dark energy, though it does not address the cosmological constant problem. Since a modification to the Einstein-Hilbert action of the form $R^n$, with $n>0$, can lead to early-time inflation, our proposal provides a unified and purely gravitational origin for the early and late time accelerating phases of the Universe.
