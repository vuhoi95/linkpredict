Title: Strong ellipticity and spectral properties of chiral bag boundary  conditions
Authors: C. G. Beneventano and P. B. Gilkey and K. Kirsten and E. M. Santangelo
Abstract: We prove strong ellipticity of chiral bag boundary conditions on even dimensional manifolds. From a knowledge of the heat kernel in an infinite cylinder, some basic properties of the zeta function are analyzed on cylindrical product manifolds of arbitrary even dimension.
