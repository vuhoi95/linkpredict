Title: Twisted determinants on higher genus Riemann surfaces
Authors: Rodolfo Russo and Stefano Sciuto
Abstract: We study the Dirac and the Laplacian operators on orientable Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus g. In particular we compute their determinants with twisted boundary conditions along the b-cycles. All the ingredients of the final results (including the normalizations) are explicitly written in terms of the Schottky parametrization of the Riemann surface. By using the bosonization equivalence, we derive a multi-loop generalization of the well-known g=1 product formulae for the Theta-functions. We finally comment on the applications of these results to the perturbative theory of open charged strings.
