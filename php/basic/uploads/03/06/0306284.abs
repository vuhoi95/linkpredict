Title: Supergravity brane worlds and tachyon potentials
Authors: D. Bazeia and F. A. Brito and J. R. Nascimento
Abstract: We study massless and massive graviton modes that bind on thick branes which are supergravity domain walls solutions in $D$-dimensional supergravity theories where only the supergravity multiplet and the scalar supermultiplet are turned on. The domain walls are bulk solutions provided by tachyon potentials. Such domain walls are regarded as BPS branes of one lower dimension that are formed due to tachyon potentials on a non-BPS D-brane.
