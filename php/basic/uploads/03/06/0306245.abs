Title: Photon Mass Bound Destroyed by Vortices
Authors: Eric Adelberger and Gia Dvali and Andrei Gruzinov
Abstract: The Particle Data Group gives an upper bound on the photon mass $m < 2 \times 10^{-16}$eV from a laboratory experiment and lists, but does not adopt, an astronomical bound $m < 3 \times 10^{-27}$eV, both of which are based on the plausible assumption of large galactic vector-potential. We argue that the interpretations of these experiments should be changed, which alters significantly the bounds on $m$. If $m$ arises from a Higgs effect, both limits are invalid because the Proca vector-potential of the galactic magnetic field may be neutralized by vortices giving a large-scale magnetic field that is effectively Maxwellian. In this regime, experiments sensitive to the Proca potential do not yield a useful bound on $m$. As a by-product, the non-zero photon mass from Higgs effect predicts generation of a primordial magnetic field in the early universe. If, on the other hand, the galactic magnetic field is in the Proca regime, the very existence of the observed large-scale magnetic field gives $m^{-1}\gtrsim 1$kpc, or $m\lesssim 10^{-26}$eV.
