Title: Smooth branes and junction conditions in Einstein Gauss-Bonnet gravity
Authors: Nathalie Deruelle and Cristiano Germani
Abstract: Using "smooth brane" solutions of the field equations, we give an alternative derivation of the junction conditions for a "brane" in a five dimensional "bulk", when gravity is governed by the Einstein Lanczos (Gauss-Bonnet) equations.
