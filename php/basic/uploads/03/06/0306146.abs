Title: Spacetime decay of cones at strong coupling
Authors: Ruth Gregory and Jeff Harvey
Abstract: We study time dependent solutions in dilaton gravity which correspond to the decay of conical spacetimes. In string theory this can be interpreted as a strong coupling limit of the decay of a non-supersymmetric orbifold spacetime with localized tachyons.
