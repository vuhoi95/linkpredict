Title: Compactification in deconstructed gauge theory with topologically  non-trivial link fields
Authors: Yoshinori Cho and Nahomi Kan and Kiyoshi Shiraishi
Abstract: We investigate the mass spectrum of a scalar field in a world with latticized and circular continuum space where background fields takes a topological configuration. We find that the mass spectrum is related to the characteristic values of Mathieu functions. The gauge symmetry breaking in a similar spacetime is also discussed.
