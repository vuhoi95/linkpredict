Title: UV Finite Brane Decay
Authors: Joanna L. Karczmarek and Hong Liu and Juan Maldacena and Andrew Strominger
Abstract: The decay of an unstable D-brane via closed string emission and open string pair production is considered in subcritical string theory with a spacelike linear dilaton. The decay rate is given by the imaginary part of the annulus, which has ambiguities corresponding to the choices of incoming closed and open string vacua. An exact expression for the full annulus diagram is computed with a natural choice of incoming vacua. It is found that the ultraviolet divergences present in critical string theory in both of these processes are absent for any nonzero spacelike dilaton. Implications for the vexing issue of the tachyon dust are discussed.
