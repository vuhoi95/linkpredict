Title: Black strings in asymptotically plane wave geometries
Authors: Eric G. Gimon and Akikazu Hashimoto and Veronika E. Hubeny and Oleg Lunin and Mukund Rangamani
Abstract: We present a class of black string spacetimes which asymptote to maximally symmetric plane wave geometries. Our construction will rely on a solution generating technique, the null Melvin twist, which deforms an asymptotically flat black string spacetime to an asymptotically plane wave black string spacetime while preserving the event horizon.
