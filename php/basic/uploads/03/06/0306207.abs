Title: Calabi-Yau Connections with Torsion on Toric Bundles
Authors: D. Grantcharov and G. Grantcharov and Y. S. Poon
Abstract: We find sufficient conditions for a principal toric bundle over compact K\"ahler manifolds to admit Calabi-Yau connections with torsion. With the aids of a topological classification, we construct such geometry on $n(S^2\times S^4)#(n+1)(S^3\times S^3)$
