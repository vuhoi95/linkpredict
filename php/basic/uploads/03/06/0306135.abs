Title: Black Hole Attractor Varieties and Complex Multiplication
Authors: Monika Lynker and Vipul Periwal and Rolf Schimmrigk
Abstract: Black holes in string theory compactified on Calabi-Yau varieties a priori might be expected to have moduli dependent features. For example the entropy of the black hole might be expected to depend on the complex structure of the manifold. This would be inconsistent with known properties of black holes. Supersymmetric black holes appear to evade this inconsistency by having moduli fields that flow to fixed points in the moduli space that depend only on the charges of the black hole. Moore observed in the case of compactifications with elliptic curve factors that these fixed points are arithmetic, corresponding to curves with complex multiplication. The main goal of this talk is to explore the possibility of generalizing such a characterization to Calabi-Yau varieties with finite fundamental groups.
