Title: Lax pair and super-Yangian symmetry of the non-linear  super-Schr√∂dinger equation
Authors: V. Caudrelier and E. Ragoucy
Abstract: We consider a version of the non-linear Schr\"odinger equation with M bosons and N fermions. We first solve the classical and quantum versions of this equation, using a super-Zamolodchikov-Faddeev (ZF) algebra. Then we prove that the hierarchy associated to this model admits a super-Yangian Y(gl(M|N)) symmetry. We exhibit the corresponding (classical and quantum) Lax pairs. Finally, we construct explicitly the super-Yangian generators, in terms of the canonical fields on the one hand, and in terms of the ZF algebra generators on the other hand. The latter construction uses the well-bred operators introduced recently.
