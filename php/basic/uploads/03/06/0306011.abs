Title: Radiative corrections to the Casimir effect for the massive scalar field
Authors: F. A. Barone and R. M. Cavalcanti and C. Farina
Abstract: We compute the first radiative correction to the Casimir energy of a massive scalar field with a quartic self-interaction in the presence of two parallel plates. Three kinds of boundary conditions are considered: Dirichlet-Dirichlet, Neumann-Neumann and Dirichlet-Neumann. We use dimensional and analytical regularizations to obtain our physical results.
