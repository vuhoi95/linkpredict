Title: Remarks on supersymmetry of quantum systems with position-dependent  effective masses
Authors: A. de Souza Dutra and Marcelo Hott and C. A. S. Almeida
Abstract: We apply the supersymmetry approach to one-dimensional quantum systems with spatially-dependent mass, by including their ordering ambiguities dependence. In this way we extend the results recently reported in the literature. Furthermore, we point out a connection between these systems and others with constant masses. This is done through convenient transformations in the coordinates and wavefunctions.
