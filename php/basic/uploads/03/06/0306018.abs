Authors: V. S. Vladimirov and Ya. I. Volovich
Abstract: In this work nonlinear pseudo-differential equations with the infinite number of derivatives are studied. These equations form a new class of equations which initially appeared in p-adic string theory. These equations are of much interest in mathematical physics and its applications in particular in string theory and cosmology. In the present work a systematical mathematical investigation of the properties of these equations is performed. The main theorem of uniqueness in some algebra of tempored distributions is proved. Boundary problems for bounded solutions are studied, the existence of a space-homogenous solution for odd p is proved. For even p it is proved that there is no continuous solutions and it is pointed to the possibility of existence of discontinuous solutions. Multidimensional equation is also considered and its soliton and q-brane solutions are discussed.
