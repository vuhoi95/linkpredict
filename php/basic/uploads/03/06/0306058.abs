Title: Automorphisms of associative algebras and noncommutative geometry
Authors: Aristophanes Dimakis and Folkert Muller-Hoissen
Abstract: A class of differential calculi is explored which is determined by a set of automorphisms of the underlying associative algebra. Several examples are presented. In particular, differential calculi on the quantum plane, the $h$-deformed plane and the quantum group GLpq(2) are recovered in this way. Geometric structures like metrics and compatible linear connections are introduced.
