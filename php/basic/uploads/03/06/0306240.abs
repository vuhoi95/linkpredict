Title: Toward linearization of nonlinear supersymmetric Einstein-Hilbert-type  action of superon-graviton model(SGM)
Authors: K. Shima and M. Tsuda and M. Sawaguchi
Abstract: We attempt the linearization of the nonlinear supersymmetry encoded in the Einstein-Hilbert-type action {\it superon-graviton model(SGM)} describing the nonlinear supersymmetric gravitational interaction of Nambu-Goldstone fermion {\it superon}. We discuss the linearizaton procedure in detail by the heuristic arguments referring to supergravity, in which particular attentions are paid to the local Lorentz invariance in the minimal interaction. We show explicitly up to the leading order that 80(bosons)+80(fermions) may be the minimal off-shell supermultiplet of the linearized theory.
