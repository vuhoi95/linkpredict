Title: Exact constraints on the QCD Phase Diagram
Authors: D. Toublan and J. B. Kogut
Abstract: We derive exact constraints relating QCD at nonzero baryon chemical potential and temperature to QCD at nonzero isospin chemical potential and temperature, a theory which can be simulated by conventional methods. These results challenge the consistency of dynamical models of superconductivity and superfluidity in QCD.
