Title: Out of equilibrium correlation functions of quantum anisotropic XY  models: one-particle excitations
Authors: Luigi Amico and Andreas Osterloh
Abstract: We calculate exactly matrix elements between states that are not eigenstates of the quantum XY model for general anisotropy. Such quantities therefore describe non equilibrium properties of the system; the Hamiltonian does not contain any time dependence. These matrix elements are expressed as a sum of Pfaffians. For single particle excitations on the ground state the Pfaffians in the sum simplify to determinants.
