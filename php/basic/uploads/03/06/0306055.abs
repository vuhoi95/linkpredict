Title: Transplanckian Entanglement Entropy
Authors: Darwin Chang and Chong-Sun Chu and Feng-Li Lin
Abstract: The entanglement entropy of the event horizon is known to be plagued by the UV divergence due to the infinitely blue-shifted near horizon modes. In this paper we calculate the entanglement entropy using the transplanckian dispersion relation, which has been proposed to model the quantum gravity effects. We show that, very generally, the entropy is rendered UV finite due to the suppression of high energy modes effected by the transplanckian dispersion relation.
