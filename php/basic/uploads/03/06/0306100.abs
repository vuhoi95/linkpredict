Title: On the magnetic perturbation of the Ising model on the sphere
Authors: P. Grinza and N. Magnoli
Abstract: In this letter we will extend the analysis given by Al. Zamolodchikov for the scaling Yang-Lee model on the sphere to the Ising model in a magnetic field. A numerical study of the partition function and of the vacuum expectation values (VEV) is done by using the truncated conformal space (TCS) approach. Our results strongly suggest that the partition function is an entire function of the coupling constant.
