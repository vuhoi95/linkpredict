Title: Charged coherent states related to su_{q}(2) covariance
Authors: Yun Li and Sicong Jing
Abstract: A new kind of q-deformed charged coherent states is constructed in Fock space of two-mode q-boson system with su_{q}(2) covariance and a resolution of unity for these states is derived. We also present a simple way to obtain these coherent states using state projection method.
