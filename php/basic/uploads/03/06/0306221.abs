Title: Quantum Deformed Canonical Transformations, W_{\infty}-algebras and  Unitary Transformations
Authors: E. Gozzi and M. Reuter
Abstract: We investigate the algebraic properties of the quantum counterpart of the classical canonical transformations using the symbol-calculus approach to quantum mechanics. In this framework we construct a set of pseudo-differential operators which act on the symbols of operators, i.e., on functions defined over phase-space. They act as operatorial left- and right- multiplication and form a $W_{\infty}\times W_{\infty}$- algebra which contracts to its diagonal subalgebra in the classical limit. We also describe the Gel'fand-Naimark-Segal (GNS) construction in this language and show that the GNS representation-space (a doubled Hilbert space) is closely related to the algebra of functions over phase-space equipped with the star-product of the symbol-calculus.
