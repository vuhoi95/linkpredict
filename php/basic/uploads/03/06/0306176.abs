Title: Noncommutative field theory and violation of translation invariance
Authors: O. Bertolami and L. Guisado
Abstract: Noncommutative field theories with commutator of the coordinates of the form $[x^{\mu},x^{\nu}]=i \Lambda_{\quad \omega}^{\mu \nu}x^{\omega}$ are studied. Explicit Lorentz invariance is mantained considering $\Lambda $ a Lorentz tensor. It is shown that a free quantum field theory is not affected. Since invariance under translations is broken, the conservation of energy-momentum is violated, obeying a new law which is expressed by a Poincar\'e-invariant equation. The resulting new kinematics is studied and applied to simple examples and to astrophysical puzzles, such as the observed violation of the GZK cutoff. The $\lambda $$\Phi ^{4}$ quantum field theory is also considered in this context. In particular, self interaction terms violate the usual conservation of energy-momentum and, hence, the radiative correction to the propagator is altered. The correction to first order in $\lambda $ is calculated. The usual UV divergent terms are still present, but a new type of term also emerges, which is IR divergent, violates momentum conservation and implies a correction to the dispersion relation.
