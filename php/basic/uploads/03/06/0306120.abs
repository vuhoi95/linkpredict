Title: Charged Black Hole Solutions in Einstein-Born-Infeld gravity with a  Cosmological constant
Authors: Sharmanthie Fernando and Don Krug
Abstract: We construct black hole solutions to Einstein-Born-Infeld gravity with a cosmological constant. Since an elliptic function appears in the solutions for the metric, we construct horizons numerically. The causal structure of these solutions differ drastically from their counterparts in Einstein-Maxwell gravity with a cosmological constant. The charged de-Sitter black holes can have up to three horizons and the charged anti-de Sitter black hole can have one or two depending on the parameters chosen.
