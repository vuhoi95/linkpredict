Title: BIon Configuration with Fuzzy $S^2$ Structure
Authors: Yi-Xin Chen and Jing Shao
Abstract: Some configurations of general dielectric D2-brane with both electric and magnetic fields are investigated. We find two classical stable solutions describing a BIon configuration with $S^2$ structure and a cylindrical tube respectively. Both of them can be regarded as the blown-up objects of the Born-Infeld string. The dependence of the geometry of these configurations on the Born-Infeld fields is analyzed. Also we find that similar BIon configuration exists as a fuzzy object in a system with N D0-branes. Furthermore this configuration is demonstrated to be more stable than the usual dielectric spherical D2-brane.
