Title: Noncommutative Superspace, Supermatrix and Lowest Landau Level
Authors: Machiko Hatsuda and Satoshi Iso and Hiroshi Umetsu
Abstract: By using graded (super) Lie algebras, we can construct noncommutative superspace on curved homogeneous manifolds. In this paper, we take a flat limit to obtain flat noncommutative superspace. We particularly consider $d=2$ and $d=4$ superspaces based on the graded Lie algebras $osp(1|2)$, $su(2|1)$ and $psu(2|2)$. Jacobi identities of supersymmetry algebras and associativities of star products are automatically satisfied. Covariant derivatives which commute with supersymmetry generators are obtained and chiral constraints can be imposed. We also discuss that these noncommutative superspaces can be understood as constrained systems analogous to the lowest Landau level system.
