Title: Background field quantization and non-commutative Maxwell theory
Authors: Ashok Das and J. Frenkel and S. H. Pereira and J. C. Taylor
Abstract: We quantize non-commutative Maxwell theory canonically in the background field gauge for weak and slowly varying background fields. We determine the complete basis for expansion under such an approximation. As an application, we derive the Wigner function which determines the leading order high temperature behavior of the perturbative amplitudes of non-commutative Maxwell theory. To leading order, we also give a closed form expression for the distribution function for the non-commutative $U (1)$ gauge theory at high temperature.
