Title: D-Theory: Field Quantization by Dimensional Reduction of Discrete  Variables
Authors: R. Brower and S. Chandrasekharan and S. Riederer and U. -J. Wiese
Abstract: D-theory is an alternative non-perturbative approach to quantum field theory formulated in terms of discrete quantized variables instead of classical fields. Classical scalar fields are replaced by generalized quantum spins and classical gauge fields are replaced by quantum links. The classical fields of a d-dimensional quantum field theory reappear as low-energy effective degrees of freedom of the discrete variables, provided the (d+1)-dimensional D-theory is massless. When the extent of the extra Euclidean dimension becomes small in units of the correlation length, an ordinary d-dimensional quantum field theory emerges by dimensional reduction. The D-theory formulation of scalar field theories with various global symmetries and of gauge theories with various gauge groups is constructed explicitly and the mechanism of dimensional reduction is investigated.
