Title: Bose-Einstein Condensation and Free DKP field
Authors: R. Casana and V. Ya. Fainberg and B. M. Pimentel and J. S. Valverde
Abstract: The thermodynamical partition function of the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau theory is evaluated using the imaginary-time formalism of quantum field theory at finite temperature and path integral methods. The DKP partition function displays two features: (i) full equivalence with the partition function for charged scalar particles and charged massive spin 1 particles; and (ii) the zero mode sector which is essential to reproduce the well-known relativistic Bose-Einstein condensation for both theories.
