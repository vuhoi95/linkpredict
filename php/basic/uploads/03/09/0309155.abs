Title: Lorentz Invariance And Unitarity Problem In Non-Commutative Field Theory
Authors: Katsusada Morita and Yoshitaka Okumura and Eizou Umezawa
Abstract: It is shown that the one-loop two-point amplitude in {\it Lorentz-invariant} non-commutative (NC) $\phi^3$ theory is finite after subtraction in the commutative limit and satisfies the usual cutting rule, thereby eliminating the unitarity problem in Lorentz-non-invariant NC field theory in the approximation considered.
