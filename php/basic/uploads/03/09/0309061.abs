Title: Imaginary in all directions: an elegant formulation of special  relativity and classical electrodynamics
Authors: Martin Greiter and Dirk Schuricht
Abstract: A suitable parameterization of space-time in terms of one complex and three quaternionic imaginary units allows Lorentz transformations to be implemented as multiplication by complex-quaternionic numbers rather than matrices. Maxwell's equations reduce to a single equation.
