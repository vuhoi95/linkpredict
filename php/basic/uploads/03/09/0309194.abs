Authors: Boyu Hou and Ryu Sasaki and Wen-Li Yang
Abstract: Ruijsenaars-Schneider models associated with $A_{n-1}$ root system with a discrete coupling constant are studied. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are givein in terms of the Bethe ansatz formulas. Taking the "non-relativistic" limit, we obtain the spectrum of the corresponding Calogero-Moser systems in the third formulas of Felder et al [20].
