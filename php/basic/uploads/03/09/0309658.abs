Title: Low-Dimensional Spin Systems: Hidden Symmetries, Conformal Field  Theories and Numerical Checks
Authors: C. Degli Esposti Boschi and E. Ercolessi and G. Morandi
Abstract: We review here some general properties of antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin chains, emphasizing and discussing the role of hidden symmetries in the classification of the various phases of the models. We present also some recent results that have been obtained with a combined use of Conformal Field Theory and of numerical Density Matrix Renormalization Group techniques.
