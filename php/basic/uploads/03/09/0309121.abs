Title: Non BPS noncommutative vortices
Authors: G. S. Lozano and E. F. Moreno and M. J. Rodriguez and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We construct exact vortex solutions to the equations of motion of the Abelian Higgs model defined in non commutative space, analyzing in detail the properties of these solutions beyond the BPS point. We show that our solutions behave as smooth deformations of vortices in ordinary space time except for parity symmetry breaking effects induced by the non commutative parameter $\theta$.
