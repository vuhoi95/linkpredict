Authors: O. F. Dayi and K. Ulker and B. Yapiskan
Abstract: Parent actions for component fields are utilized to derive the dual of supersymmetric U(1) gauge theory in 4 dimensions. Generalization of the Seiberg-Witten map to the component fields of noncommutative supersymmetric U(1) gauge theory is analyzed. Through this transformation we proposed parent actions for noncommutative supersymmetric U(1) gauge theory as generalization of the ordinary case.Duals of noncommutative supersymmetric U(1) gauge theory are obtained. Duality symmetry under the interchange of fields with duals accompanied by the replacement of the noncommutativity parameter \Theta_{\mu\nu} with \tilde{\Theta}_{\mu \nu} = \epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\Theta^{\rho\sigma} of the non--supersymmetric case is broken at the level of actions. We proposed a noncommutative parent action for the component fields which generates actions possessing this duality symmetry.
