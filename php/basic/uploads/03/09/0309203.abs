Title: Gravitational energy loss in high energy particle collisions:  ultrarelativistic plunge into a multidimensional black hole
Authors: Emanuele Berti and Marco Cavaglia and Leonardo Gualtieri
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational energy emission of an ultrarelativistic particle radially falling into a D-dimensional black hole. We numerically integrate the equations describing black hole gravitational perturbations and obtain energy spectra, total energy and angular distribution of the emitted gravitational radiation. The black hole quasinormal modes for scalar, vector, and tensor perturbations are computed in the WKB approximation. We discuss our results in the context of black hole production at the TeV scale.
