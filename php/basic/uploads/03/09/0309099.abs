Title: Supersymmetry and the KdV equations for Integrable Hierarchies with a  Half-integer Gradation
Authors: H. Aratyn and J. F. Gomes and A. H. Zimerman
Abstract: Supersymmetry is formulated for integrable models based on the $sl(2|1)$ loop algebra endowed with a principal gradation. The symmetry transformations which have half-integer grades generate supersymmetry. The $sl(2|1)$ loop algebra leads to N=2 supersymmetric mKdV and sinh-Gordon equations. The corresponding N=1 mKdV and sinh-Gordon equations are obtained via reduction induced by twisted automorphism. Our method allows for a description of a non-local symmetry structure of supersymmetric integrable models.
