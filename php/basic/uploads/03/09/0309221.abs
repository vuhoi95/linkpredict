Title: Effective action for scalar fields and generalised zeta-function  regularisation
Authors: Guido Cognola and Sergio Zerbini
Abstract: Motivated by the study of quantum fields in a Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) spacetime, the one-loop effective action for a scalar field defined in the ultrastatic manifold $R\times H^3/\Gamma$, $H^3/\Gamma$ being the finite volume, non-compact, hyperbolic spatial section, is investigated by a generalisation of zeta-function regularisation. It is shown that additional divergences may appear at one-loop level. The one-loop renormalisability of the model is discussed and making use of a generalisation of zeta-function regularisation, the one-loop renormalisation group equations are derived.
