Title: QCD strings with spinning quarks
Authors: Theodore J. Allen and M. G. Olsson and Jeffrey R. Schmidt
Abstract: We construct a consistent action for a massive spinning quark on the end of a QCD string that leads to pure Thomas precession of the quark's spin. The string action is modified by the addition of Grassmann degrees of freedom to the string such that the equations of motion for the quark spin follow from boundary conditions, just as do those for the quark's position.
