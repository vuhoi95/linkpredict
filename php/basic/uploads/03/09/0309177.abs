Title: Geometric scaling as traveling waves
Authors: S. Munier and R. Peschanski
Abstract: We show the relevance of the nonlinear Fisher and Kolmogorov-Petrovsky- Piscounov (KPP) equation to the problem of high energy evolution of the QCD amplitudes. We explain how the traveling wave solutions of this equation are related to geometric scaling, a phenomenon observed in deep-inelastic scattering experiments. Geometric scaling is for the first time shown to result from an exact solution of nonlinear QCD evolution equations. Using general results on the KPP equation, we compute the velocity of the wave front, which gives the full high energy dependence of the saturation scale.
