Title: Quantum Hall effect on $S^3$, edge states and fuzzy $S^3/{\bf Z}_2$
Authors: V. P. Nair and S. Randjbar-Daemi
Abstract: We analyze the Landau problem and quantum Hall effect on $S^3$ taking a constant background field proportional to the spin connection on $S^3$. The effective strength of the field can be tuned by changing the dimension of the representation to which the fermions belong. The effective action for the edge excitations of a quantum Hall droplet in the limit of a large number of fermions is obtained. We find that the appropriate space for many of these considerations is $S^2 \times S^2$, which plays a role similar to that of ${\bf CP}^3$ vis-a-vis $S^4$. We also give a method of representing the algebra of functions on fuzzy $S^3/{\bf Z}_2$ in terms of finite dimensional matrices.
