Title: Very-extended Kac-Moody algebras and their interpretation at low levels
Authors: Axel Kleinschmidt and Igor Schnakenburg and Peter West
Abstract: We analyse the very-extended Kac-Moody algebras as representations in terms of certain A_d subalgebras and find the generators at low levels. Our results for low levels agree precisely with the bosonic field content of the theories containing gravity, forms and scalars which upon reduction to three dimensions can be described by a non-linear realisation. We explain how the Dynkin diagrams of the very-extended algebras encode information about the field content and generalised T-duality transformations.
