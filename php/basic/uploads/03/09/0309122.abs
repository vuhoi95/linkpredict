Title: Spinning strings, cosmic dislocations and chronology protection
Authors: Vitorio A. De Lorenci and Edisom S. Moreira Jr
Abstract: A massless scalar field is quantized in the background of a spinning string with cosmic dislocation. By increasing the spin density toward the dislocation parameter, a region containing closed timelike curves (CTCs) eventually forms around the defect. Correspondingly, the propagator tends to the ordinary cosmic string propagator, leading therefore to a mean-square field fluctuation, which remains well behaved throughout the process, unlike the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor, which diverges due to a subtle mechanism. These results suggest that back reaction leads to the formation of a "horizon" that protects from the appearance of CTCs.
