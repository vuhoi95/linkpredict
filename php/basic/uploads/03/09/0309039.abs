Title: Comments on D-brane Interactions in PP-wave Backgrounds
Authors: Atish Dabholkar and Joris Raeymaekers
Abstract: We calculate the interaction potential between widely separated D-branes in PP-wave backgrounds in string theory as well as in low-energy supergravity. Timelike and spacelike orientations are qualitatively different but in both cases the effective brane tensions and RR charges take the same values as in Minkowski space in accordance with the expectations from the sigma model perturbation theory.
