Title: Two-Field Q-ball Solutions of Supersymmetric Hybrid Inflation
Authors: Matt Broadhead and John McDonald
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of two-field Q-ball solutions of the scalar field equations of supersymmetric D- and F-term hybrid inflation. The solutions consist of a complex inflaton field together with a real symmetry breaking field. Such inflatonic Q-balls may play a fundamental role in reheating and the post-inflation era of supersymmetric hybrid inflation models.
