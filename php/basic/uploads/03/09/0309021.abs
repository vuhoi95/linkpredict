Title: Unitarity of Time-Like Noncommutative Gauge Theories: The Violation of  Ward Identities in Time-Ordered Perturbation Theory
Authors: Thorsten Ohl and Reinhold Rückl and Jörg Zeiner
Abstract: We study Ward identities for simple processes with external gauge bosons in the time-ordered perturbation theory approach to time-like noncommutative gauge theories. We demonstrate that these Ward identities cannot be satisfied when all orders in the noncommutativity parameters theta_i0 are taken into account. We conclude that in time-ordered perturbation theory one cannot solve the unitarity problem of time-like noncommutative quantum field theories.
