Title: New Phase Diagram for Black Holes and Strings on Cylinders
Authors: T. Harmark and N. A. Obers
Abstract: We introduce a novel type of phase diagram for black holes and black strings on cylinders. The phase diagram involves a new asymptotic quantity called the relative binding energy. We plot the uniform string and the non-uniform string solutions in this new phase diagram using data of Wiseman. Intersection rules for branches of solutions in the phase diagram are deduced from a new Smarr formula that we derive.
