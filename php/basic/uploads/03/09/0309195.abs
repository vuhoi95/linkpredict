Title: Spontaneous localization of bulk fields: the six-dimensional case
Authors: Hyun Min Lee and Hans Peter Nilles and Max Zucker
Abstract: We study N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories with $d=6$ bulk and $d=4$ brane fields charged under a U(1) gauge symmetry. Radiatively induced Fayet-Iliopoulos terms lead to an instability of the bulk fields. We compute the profile of the bulk zero modes and observe the phenomenon of spontaneous localization towards the position of the branes. While this mechanism is quite similar to the $d=5$ case, the mass spectrum of the excited Kaluza-Klein modes shows a crucial difference.
