Title: Strings in Gravimagnetic Fields
Authors: Yeuk-Kwan E. Cheung and Laurent Freidel and Konstantin Savvidy
Abstract: We provide a complete solution of closed strings propagating in Nappi-Witten space. Based on the analysis of geodesics we construct the coherent wavefunctions which approximate as closely as possible the classical trajectories. We then present a new free field realization of the current algebra using the gamma, beta ghost system. Finally we construct the quantum vertex operators, for the tachyon, by representing the wavefunctions in terms of the free fields. This allows us to compute the three- and four-point amplitudes, and propose the general result for N-point tachyon scattering amplitude.
