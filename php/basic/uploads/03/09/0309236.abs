Title: Inflating magnetically charged braneworlds
Authors: Inyong Cho and Alexander Vilenkin
Abstract: Numerical solutions of Einstein, scalar, and gauge field equations are found for static and inflating defects in a higher-dimensional spacetime. The defects have $(3+1)$-dimensional core and magnetic monopole configuration in $n=3$ extra dimensions. For symmetry-breaking scale $\eta$ below the critical value $\eta_c$, the defects are characterized by a flat worldsheet geometry and asymptotically flat extra dimensions. The critical scale $\eta_c$ is comparable to the higher-dimensional Planck scale and has some dependence on the gauge and scalar couplings. For $\eta=\eta_c$, the extra dimensions degenerate into a `cigar', and for $\eta>\eta_c$ all static solutions are singular. The singularity can be removed if the requirement of staticity is relaxed and defect cores are allowed to inflate. The inflating solutions have de Sitter worldsheets and cigar geometry in the extra dimensions. Exact analytic solutions describing the asymptotic behavior of these inflating monopoles are found and the parameter space of these solutions is analyzed.
