Title: Instanton Solutions for the Universal Hypermultiplet
Authors: M. Davidse and M. de Vroome and U. Theis and S. Vandoren
Abstract: We expand our previous analysis on fivebrane and membrane instanton solutions in the universal hypermultiplet, including near-extremal multi-centered solutions and mixed fivebrane-membrane charged instantons. The results are most conveniently described in terms of a double-tensor multiplet.
