Title: (0,2) Duality
Authors: Allan Adams and Anirban Basu and Savdeep Sethi
Abstract: We construct dual descriptions of (0,2) gauged linear sigma models. In some cases, the dual is a (0,2) Landau-Ginzburg theory, while in other cases, it is a non-linear sigma model. The duality map defines an analogue of mirror symmetry for (0,2) theories. Using the dual description, we determine the instanton corrected chiral ring for some illustrative examples. This ring defines a (0,2) generalization of the quantum cohomology ring of (2,2) theories.
