Title: Universal ratios along a line of critical points. The Ashkin--Teller  model
Authors: G. Delfino and P. Grinza
Abstract: The two-dimensional Ashkin-Teller model provides the simplest example of a statistical system exhibiting a line of critical points along which the critical exponents vary continously. The scaling limit of both the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases separated by the critical line are described by the sine-Gordon quantum field theory in a given range of its dimensionless coupling. After computing the relevant matrix elements of the order and disorder operators in this integrable field theory, we determine the universal amplitude ratios along the critical line within the two-particle approximation in the form factor approach.
