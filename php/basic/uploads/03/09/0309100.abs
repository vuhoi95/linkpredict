Title: Supermembrane with Non-Abelilan Gauging and Chern-Simons Quantization
Authors: Hitoshi Nishino and Subhash Rajpoot
Abstract: We present non-Abelian gaugings of supermembrane for general isometries for compactifications from eleven-dimensions, starting with Abelian case as a guide. We introduce a super Killing vector in eleven-dimensional superspace for a non-Abelian group G associated with the compact space B for a general compactification, and couple it to a non-Abelian gauge field on the world-volume. As a technical tool, we use teleparallel superspace with no manifest local Lorentz covariance. Interestingly, the coupling constant is quantized for the non-Abelian group G, due to its generally non-trivial mapping \pi_3(G).
