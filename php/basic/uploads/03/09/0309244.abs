Title: Supersymmetric coupling of a self-dual string to a (2,0) tensor  multiplet background
Authors: Par Arvidsson and Erik Flink and Mans Henningson
Abstract: We construct an interaction between a (2,0) tensor multiplet in six dimensions and a self-dual string. The interaction is a sum of a Nambu-Goto term, with the tension of the string given by the modulus of the scalar fields of the tensor multiplet, and a non-local Wess-Zumino term, that encodes the electromagnetic coupling of the string to the two-form gauge field of the tensor multiplet. The interaction is invariant under global (2,0) supersymmetry, modulo the equations of motion of a free tensor multiplet. It is also invariant under a local fermionic kappa-symmetry, as required by the BPS-property of the string.
