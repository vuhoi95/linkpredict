Title: Quest for Black Holes and Superstring Excitations in Cosmic Ray Data
Authors: Luis A. Anchordoqui and Jonathan L. Feng and Haim Goldberg and Alfred D. Shapere
Abstract: In this talk we discuss aspects of TeV-scale gravitational collapse to black holes and string balls and their subsequent evaporation. Special emphasis is placed on the interplay of the string/black hole correspondence principle. These ideas are then explored in the context of cosmic ray physics. First, the potential for observing showers mediated by black holes or superstring excitations is examined. Next, existing data from neutrino telescopes are used to constrain the parameter space for the unseen dimensions of the universe. Finally, we close with a discussion of future prospects.
