Title: On threshold amplitudes III: 2 into n processes
Authors: Joanna Domienik and Piotr Kosinski
Abstract: The 2 into n scattering with final particles at rest is discussed. The comparison with purely soft processes allows to identify symmetries responsible for vanishing of certain 2 into n amplitudes. Some examples are given.
