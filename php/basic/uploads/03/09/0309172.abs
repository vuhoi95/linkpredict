Authors: Abdullah Algin and Metin Arik and Ali Serdar Arikan
Abstract: A two-parameter deformed superoscillator system with SUq1/q2(n|m)-covariance is presented and used to construct a two-parameter deformed N=2 SUSY algebra. The Fock space representation of the algebra is discussed and the deformed Hamiltonian for such generalized superoscillators is obtained.
