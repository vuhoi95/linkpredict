Title: Biconformal supergravity and the AdS/CFT conjecture
Authors: Lara B. Anderson and James T. Wheeler
Abstract: Biconformal supergravity models provide a new gauging of the superconformal group relevant to the Maldacena conjecture. Using the group quotient method to biconformally gauge SU(2,2|N), we generate a 16-dim superspace. We write the most general even- and odd-parity actions linear in the curvatures, the bosonic sector of which is known to descend to general relativity on a 4-dim manifold.
