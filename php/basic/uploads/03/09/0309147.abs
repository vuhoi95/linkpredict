Title: Supersymmetric quantum mechanics from wrapped branes
Authors: Rafael Hernandez and Konstadinos Sfetsos
Abstract: We explicitly construct a solution of eight-dimensional gauged supergravity representing D6-branes wrapped on six-cycles inside Calabi-Yau fourfolds. The solution preserves two supercharges and asymptotically is a cone with the coset space SU(2)^4/U(1)^3 as its base. It is shown to correspond to an M-theory compactification on a Calabi-Yau manifold with SU(5) holonomy and we discuss in detail its geometrical and topological features. We also construct a family of related higher dimensional metrics having SU(n+1) holonomy, which of course have no brane interpretation.
