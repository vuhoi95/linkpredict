Title: Supersymmetry of Tensionless Rotating Strings in AdS_5 x S^5, and  Nearly-BPS Operators
Authors: David Mateos and Toni Mateos and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: It is shown that a class of rotating strings in AdS_5 x S^5 with SO(6) angular momenta (J,J',J') preserve 1/8-supersymmetry for large J,J', in which limit they are effectively tensionless; when J=0, supersymmetry is enhanced to 1/4. These results imply that recent checks of the AdS/CFT correspondence actually test a nearly-BPS sector.
