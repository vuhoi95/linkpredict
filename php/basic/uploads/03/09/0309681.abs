Title: New limits on Planck scale Lorentz violation in QED
Authors: T. Jacobson and S. Liberati and D. Mattingly and F. W. Stecker
Abstract: Constraints on possible Lorentz symmetry violation (LV) of order E/M_Planck for electrons and photons in the framework of effective field theory (EFT) are discussed. Using (i) the report of polarized MeV emission from GRB021206 and (ii) the absence of vacuum \v{C}erenkov radiation from synchrotron electrons in the Crab nebula, we improve previous bounds by 10^-10 and 10^-2 respectively. We also show that the LV parameters for positrons and electrons are different, discuss electron helicity decay, and investigate investigate how prior constraints are modified by the relations between LV parameters implied by EFT.
