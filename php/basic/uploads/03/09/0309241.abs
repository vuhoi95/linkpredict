Title: The 2PPI expansion: dynamical mass generation and vacuum energy
Authors: D. Dudal and H. Verschelde and R. E. Browne and J. A. Gracey
Abstract: We discuss the 2PPI expansion, a summation of the bubble graphs up to all orders, by means of the 2D Gross-Neveu toy model, whose exact mass gap and vacuum energy are known. Then we use the expansion to give analytical evidence that a dimension two gluon condensate exists for pure Yang-Mills in the Landau gauge. This <A^2> condensate consequently gives rise to a dynamical gluon mass.
