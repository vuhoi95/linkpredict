Title: 3D Oscillator and Coulomb Systems reduced from Kahler spaces
Authors: Armen Nersessian and Armen Yeranyan
Abstract: We define the oscillator and Coulomb systems on four-dimensional spaces with U(2)-invariant Kahler metric and perform their Hamiltonian reduction to the three-dimensional oscillator and Coulomb systems specified by the presence of Dirac monopoles. We find the Kahler spaces with conic singularity, where the oscillator and Coulomb systems on three-dimensional sphere and two-sheet hyperboloid are originated. Then we construct the superintegrable oscillator system on three-dimensional sphere and hyperboloid, coupled to monopole, and find their four-dimensional origins. In the latter case the metric of configuration space is non-Kahler one. Finally, we extend these results to the family of Kahler spaces with conic singularities.
