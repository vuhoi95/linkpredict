Authors: K. Ishikawa and T. Aoyama and Y. Ishizuka and N. Maeda
Abstract: The von Neumann lattice representation is a convenient representation for studying several intriguing physics of quantum Hall systems. In this formalism, electrons are mapped to lattice fermions. A topological invariant expression of the Hall conductance is derived and is used for the proof of the integer quantum Hall effect in the realistic situation. Anisotropic quantum Hall gas is investigated based on the Hartree-Fock approximation in the same formalism. Thermodynamic properties, transport properties, and unusual response under external modulations are found. Implications for the integer quantum Hall effect in the finite systems are also studied and a new quantum Hall regime with non-zero longitudinal resistance is shown to exist.
