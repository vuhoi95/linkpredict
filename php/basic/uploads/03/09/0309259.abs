Title: A cigar-like Universe
Authors: B. de Carlos and J. M. Moreno
Abstract: We study the localization of gravity on a string-like topological defect within a 6-dimensional space-time. Assuming zero cosmological constant we find complete numerical solutions to a set of first-order, Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommeferld (BPS)-like, equations for the metric and the scalar field, where the dynamics of the latter are dictated by a supergravity-type potential. Our axially symmetric solutions have no deficit angle and factorize as $AdS_5 \times S_1 $ far from the core. They are regular everywhere, providing complete smooth cigar-like geometries. The total energy of these configurations depends only on the boundary conditions for the warp factor and it is shown to vanish.
