Title: Analytic non-supersymmetric background dual of a confining gauge theory  and the corresponding plane wave theory of Hadrons
Authors: Stanislav Kuperstein and Jacob Sonnenschein
Abstract: We find a regular analytic 1st order deformation of the Klebanov-Strassler background. From the dual gauge theory point of view the deformation describes supersymmetry soft breaking gaugino mass terms. We calculate the difference in vacuum energies between the supersymmetric and the non-supersymmetric solutions and find that it matches the field theory prediction. We also discuss the breaking of the $U(1)_R$ symmetry and the space-time dependence of the gaugino bilinears two point function. Finally, we determine the Penrose limit of the non-supersymmetric background and write down the corresponding plane wave string theory. This string describes ``annulons''-heavy hadrons with mass proportional to large global charge. Surprisingly the string spectrum has two fermionic zero modes. This implies that the sector in the non-supersymmetric gauge theory which is the dual of the annulons is supersymmetric.
