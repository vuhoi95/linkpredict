Title: Relationship between (2+1) and 3+1)--Friedmann--Robertson--Walker  cosmologies
Authors: A. Garcia and M. Cataldo and S. del Campo
Abstract: In this work we establish the correspondence between solutions to the Friedmann--Robertson--Walker cosmologies for perfect fluid and scalar field sources, where both ones fulfill state equations of the form $p+\rho=\gamma f(\rho)$, not necessarily linear ones. Such state equations are of common use in the case of matter--fluids, nevertheless, for a scalar field, they introduce relationships on the potential and kinetic scalar field energies which restrict the set of solutions. A theorem on this respect is demonstrated: From any given (3+1)--cosmological solution, obeying the quoted state equations, one can derive its (2+1)--cosmological counterpart or vice-versa. Some applications are given.
