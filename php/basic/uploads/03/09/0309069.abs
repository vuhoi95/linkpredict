Title: Radiative Corrections with 5D Mixed Position-/Momentum-space Propagators
Authors: Martin Puchwein and Zoltan Kunszt
Abstract: In higher dimensional field theories with compactified dimensions there are three standard ways to do perturbative calculations: i) by the summation over Kaluza-Klein towers; ii) by the summation over winding numbers making use of the Poisson-resummation formula and iii) by using mixed propagators, where the coordinates of the four infinite dimensions are Fourier-transformed to momentum space while those of the compactified dimensions are kept in configuration space. The third method is broadly used in finite temperature field theory calculations. One of its advantage is that one can easily separate the ultraviolet divergent terms of the uncompactified theory from the non-local finite corrections arising from windings around the compact dimensions. In this note we demonstrate the use of this formalism by calculating one-loop self-energy corrections in a 5D theory formulated on the manifold M_4 \otimes S_1 and on the orbifold M_4 \otimes S_1/Z_2.
