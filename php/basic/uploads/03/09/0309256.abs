Title: On the nature of the anomalies in the supersymmetric kink
Authors: Kazuo Fujikawa and Anton Rebhan and Peter van Nieuwenhuizen
Abstract: We discuss the possibility to absorb all anomalies in the supersymmetry algebra of the N=(1,1) Wess-Zumino model in d=1+1 by a local counter term. This counter term corresponds to the change of the vacuum parameter $v_0^2$ in the model and the transition to an unconventional but admissible renormalization scheme. It does not modify the physical consequences such as BPS saturation, and thus the situation is rather different from gauge theory where local counter terms are required to absorb spurious gauge anomalies.
