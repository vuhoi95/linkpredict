Title: From the fuzzy disc to edge currents in Chern-Simons Theory
Authors: F. Lizzi and P. Vitale and A. Zampini
Abstract: We present a brief review of the fuzzy disc, the finite algebra approximating functions on a disc, which we have introduced earlier. We also present a comparison with recent papers of Balachandran, Gupta and K\"urk\c{c}\"{u}o\v{g}lu, and of Pinzul and Stern, aimed at the discussion of edge states of a Chern-Simons theory.
