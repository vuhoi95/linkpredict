Title: A reality proof in PT-symmetric quantum mechanics
Authors: Patrick Dorey and Clare Dunning and Roberto Tateo
Abstract: We review the proof of a conjecture concerning the reality of the spectra of certain PT-symmetric quantum mechanical systems, obtained via a connection between the theories of ordinary differential equations and integrable models. Spectral equivalences inspired by the correspondence are also discussed.
