Title: Phantom Cosmic Dynamics: Tracking Attractor and Cosmic Doomsday
Authors: Jian-gang Hao and Xin-zhou Li
Abstract: We study the dynamics of phantom model and give the conditions for potentials to admit tracking attractor, de Sitter attractor and big rip attractor. Especially, we show that phantom models with exponential and inverse power law potentials do not admit the tracking attractor solution. The "tachyonic" stability of the system at/near the attractors as well as the quantum stabiltiy have been studied.
