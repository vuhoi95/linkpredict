Title: On the Status of Highly Entropic Objects
Authors: Donald Marolf and Rafael Sorkin
Abstract: It has been proposed that the entropy of any object must satisfy fundamental (holographic or Bekenstein) bounds set by the object's size and perhaps its energy. However, most discussions of these bounds have ignored the possibility that objects violating the putative bounds could themselves become important components of Hawking radiation. We show that this possibility cannot a priori be neglected in existing derivations of the bounds. Thus this effect could potentially invalidate these derivations; but it might also lead to observational evidence for the bounds themselves.
