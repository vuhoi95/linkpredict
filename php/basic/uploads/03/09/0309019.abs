Title: Chiral anomaly for local boundary conditions
Authors: V. N. Marachevsky and D. V. Vassilevich
Abstract: It is known that in the zeta function regularization and in the Fujikawa method chiral anomaly is defined through a coefficient in the heat kernel expansion for the Dirac operator. In this paper we apply the heat kernel methods to calculate boundary contributions to the chiral anomaly for local (bag) boundary conditions. As a by-product some new results on the heat trace asymptotics are also obtained.
