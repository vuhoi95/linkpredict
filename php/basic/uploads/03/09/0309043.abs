Title: A World-Volume Perspective on the Recombination of Intersecting Branes
Authors: Johanna Erdmenger and Zachary Guralnik and Robert Helling and Ingo Kirsch
Abstract: We study brane recombination for supersymmetric configurations of intersecting branes in terms of the world-volume field theory. This field theory contains an impurity, corresponding to the degrees of freedom localized at the intersection. The Higgs branch, on which the impurity fields condense, consists of vacua for which the intersection is deformed into a smooth calibrated manifold. We show this explicitly using a superspace formalism for which the calibration equations arise naturally from F- and D-flatness.
