Title: Critical analysis of derivative dispersion relations at high energies
Authors: R. F. Avila and M. J. Menon
Abstract: We discuss some formal and fundamental aspects related with the replacement of integral dispersion relations by derivative forms, and their practical uses in high energy elastic hadron scattering, in particular $pp$ and $\bar{p}p$ scattering. Starting with integral relations with one subtraction and considering parametrizations for the total cross sections belonging to the class of entire functions in the logarithm of the energy, a series of results is deduced and our main conclusions are the following: (1) except for the subtraction constant, the derivative forms do not depend on any additional free parameter; (2) the only approximation in going from integral to derivative relations (at high energies) concerns to assume as zero the lower limit in the integral form; (3) the previous approximation and the subtraction constant affect the fit results at both low and high energies and therefore, the subtraction constant can not be disregarded; (4) from a practical point of view, for single-pole Pomeron and secondary reggeons parametrizations and center-of-mass energies above 5 GeV, the derivative relations with the subtraction constant as a free fit parameter are completely equivalent to the integral forms with finite (non-zero) lower limit. A detailed review on the conditions of validity and assumptions related with the replacement of integral by derivative relations is also presented and discussed.
