Title: Relaxation of twisted vortices in the Faddeev-Skyrme model
Authors: Jarmo Hietarinta and Juha Jäykkä and Petri Salo
Abstract: We study vortex knotting in the Faddeev-Skyrme model. Starting with a straight vortex line twisted around its axis we follow its evolution under dissipative energy minimization dynamics. With low twist per unit length the vortex forms a helical coil, but with higher twist numbers the vortex becomes knotted or a ring is formed around the vortex.
