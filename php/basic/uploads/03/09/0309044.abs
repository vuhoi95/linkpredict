Title: On effective superpotentials and Kutasov duality
Authors: Matthias Klein and Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: We derive the effective superpotential for an N=1 SU(N_c) gauge theory with one massless adjoint field and N_f massless fundamental flavors and cubic tree-level superpotential for the adjoint field. This is a generalization of the Affleck-Dine-Seiberg superpotential to gauge theories with one massless adjoint matter field. Using Kutasov's generalization of Seiberg duality, we then find the effective superpotential for a related theory with massive fundamental flavors.
