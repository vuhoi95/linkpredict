Title: Classical Liouville action on the sphere with three hyperbolic  singularities
Authors: Leszek Hadasz and Zbigniew Jaskolski
Abstract: The classical solution to the Liouville equation in the case of three hyperbolic singularities of its energy-momentum tensor is derived and analyzed. The recently proposed classical Liouville action is explicitly calculated in this case. The result agrees with the classical limit of the three point function in the DOZZ solution of the quantum Liouville theory.
