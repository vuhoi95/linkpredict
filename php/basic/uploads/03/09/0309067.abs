Title: Explicit formulas for the generalized Hermite polynomials in superspace
Authors: Patrick Desrosiers and Luc Lapointe and Pierre Mathieu
Abstract: We provide explicit formulas for the orthogonal eigenfunctions of the supersymmetric extension of the rational Calogero-Moser-Sutherland model with harmonic confinement, i.e., the generalized Hermite (or Hi-Jack) polynomials in superspace. The construction relies on the triangular action of the Hamiltonian on the supermonomial basis. This translates into determinantal expressions for the Hamiltonian's eigenfunctions.
