Abstract: The application of Random Matrix Theory to the Dirac operator of QCD yields predictions for the probability distributions of the lowest eigenvalues. We measured Dirac operator spectra using massless overlap fermions in quenched QCD at topological charge \nu = 0, +- 1 and +- 2, and found agreement with those predictions - at least for the first non-zero eigenvalue - if the volume exceeds about (1.2 fm)^4.
