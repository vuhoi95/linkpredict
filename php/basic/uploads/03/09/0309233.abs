Title: On the transformations of hamiltonian gauge algebra under rotations of  constraints
Authors: Igor Batalin and Igor Tyutin
Abstract: By explicit calculation of the effect of a ghost-dependent canonical transformation of BRST-charge, we derive the corresponding transformation law for structure coefficients of hamiltonian gauge algebra under rotation of constraints.We show the transformation law to deviate from the behaviour (expected naively) characteristic to a genuine connection.
