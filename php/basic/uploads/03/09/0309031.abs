Title: A New Matrix Model for Noncommutative Field Theory
Authors: Giovanni Landi and Fedele Lizzi and Richard J. Szabo
Abstract: We describe a new regularization of quantum field theory on the noncommutative torus by means of one-dimensional matrix models. The construction is based on the Elliott-Evans inductive limit decomposition of the noncommutative torus algebra. The matrix trajectories are obtained via the expansion of fields in a basis of new noncommutative solitons described by projections and partial isometries. The matrix quantum mechanics are compared with the usual zero-dimensional matrix model regularizations and some applications are sketched.
