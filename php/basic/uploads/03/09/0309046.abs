Title: Exit from inflation and a paradigm for vanishing cosmological constant  in self-tuning models
Authors: Jihn E. Kim and Hyun Min Lee
Abstract: We propose a paradigm for the inflation and the vanishing cosmological constant in a unified way with the self-tuning solutions of the cosmological constant problem. Here, we consider a time-varying cosmological constant in self-tuning models of the cosmological constant. As a specific example, we demonstrate it with a 3-form field in 5D.
