Title: Dynamics of Ferromagnetic Walls: Gravitational Properties
Authors: L. Campanelli and P. Cea and G. L. Fogli and L. Tedesco
Abstract: We discuss a new mechanism which allows domain walls produced during the primordial electroweak phase transition. We show that the effective surface tension of these domain walls can be made vanishingly small due to a peculiar magnetic condensation induced by fermion zero modes localized on the wall. We find that in the perfect gas approximation the domain wall network behaves like a radiation gas. We consider the recent high-red shift supernova data and we find that the corresponding Hubble diagram is compatible with the presence in the Universe of a ideal gas of ferromagnetic domain walls. We show that our domain wall gas induces a completely negligible contribution to the large-scale anisotropy of the microwave background radiation.
