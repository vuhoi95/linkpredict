Title: Matrix Cosmology
Authors: Joanna L. Karczmarek and Andrew Strominger
Abstract: Exact time-dependent solutions of c=1 string theory are described using the free fermion formulation. One such class of solutions describes draining of the Fermi sea and has a spacetime interpretation as closed string tachyon condensation. A second class of solutions, corresponding to droplets of Fermi liquid orbiting in phase space, describes closed cosmologies which bounce through singularities.
