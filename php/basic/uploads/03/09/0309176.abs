Title: Stress-energy tensor for a quantised bulk scalar field in the  Randall-Sundrum brane model
Authors: A. Knapman and D. J. Toms
Abstract: We calculate the vacuum expectation value of the stress-energy tensor for a quantised bulk scalar field in the Randall-Sundrum model, and discuss the consequences of its local behaviour for the self-consistency of the model. We find that, in general, the stress-energy tensor diverges in the vicinity of the branes. Our main conclusion is that the stress-energy tensor is sufficiently complicated that it has implications for the effective potential, or radion stabilisation, methods that have so far been used.
