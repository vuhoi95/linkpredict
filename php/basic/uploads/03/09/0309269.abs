Title: Algebras in tensor categories and coset conformal field theories

Abstract: The coset construction is the most important tool to construct rational conformal field theories with known chiral data. For some cosets at small level, so-called maverick cosets, the familiar analysis using selection and identification rules breaks down. Intriguingly, this phenomenon is linked to the existence of exceptional modular invariants. Recent progress in CFT, based on studying algebras in tensor categories, allows for a universal construction of the chiral data of coset theories which in particular also applies to maverick cosets.
