Title: Dynamics of radiating braneworlds
Authors: Emily Leeper and Roy Maartens and Carlos Sopuerta
Abstract: If the observable universe is a braneworld of Randall-Sundrum type, then particle interactions at high energies will produce 5-dimensional gravitons that escape into the bulk. As a result, the Weyl energy density on the brane does not behave like radiation in the early universe, but does so only later, in the low energy regime. Recently a simple model was proposed to describe this modification of the Randall-Sundrum cosmology. We investigate the dynamics of this model, and find the exact solution of the field equations. We use a dynamical systems approach to analyze global features of the phase space of solutions.
