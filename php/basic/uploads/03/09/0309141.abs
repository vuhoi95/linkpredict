Title: The noncommutative QED threshold energy versus the optimum collision  energy
Authors: Zheng-Mao Sheng and Yongming Fu and Haibo Yu
Abstract: Moller Scattering and Bhabha Scattering on noncommutative space-time is restudied. It is shown that the noncommutative correction of scattering cross sections is not monotonous enhancement with the total energy of colliding electrons, there is an optimum collision energy to get the greatest noncommutative correction. Most surprisingly, there is a linear relation between the noncommutative QED threshold energy and the optimum collision energy.
