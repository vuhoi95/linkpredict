Title: Anisotropic Quantum Hall Matrix Model
Authors: Ahmed Jellal and Rudolf A. Roemer and Michael Schreiber
Abstract: We consider the anisotropic effect in the quantum Hall systems by applying a confining potential that is not of parabolic type. This can be done by extending Susskind--Polychronakos's approach to involve the matrices of two coupled harmonic oscillators. Starting from its action, we employ a unitary transformation to diagonalize the model. The operators for building up the anisotropic ground state and creating the collective excitations can be constructed explicitly. Evaluating the area of the quantum Hall droplet, we obtain the corresponding filling factor which is found to depend on the anisotropy parameter and to vary with the magnetic field strength. This can be used to obtain the observed anisotropic filling factors, i.e. {9\over 2}, {11\over 2} and others.
