Title: Energy-entropy study of projected space-like monopoles in finite-T  quenched SU(2) QCD
Authors: Tsuneo Suzuki and M. N. Chernodub and Katsuya Ishiguro
Abstract: Properties of space-like monopoles projected on the 3D space in finite temperature quenched SU(2) QCD are studied. The monopole energy is derived from the effective action of the monopoles which is determined by an inverse Monte-Carlo method. Then the entropy is fixed with the help of the monopole-loop distribution.
