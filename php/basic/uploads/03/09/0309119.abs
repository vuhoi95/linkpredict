Title: On perturbative quantum field theory with boundary
Authors: Z. Bajnok and G. Bohm and G. Takacs
Abstract: Boundary quantum field theory is investigated in the Lagrangian framework. Models are defined perturbatively around the Neumann boundary condition. The analyticity properties of the Green functions are analyzed: Landau equations, Cutkosky rules together with the Coleman-Norton interpretation are derived. Illustrative examples as well as argument for the equivalence with other perturbative expansions are presented.
