Title: Covariant Gravitational Equations on Brane World with Gauss-Bonnet term
Authors: Kei-ichi Maeda and Takashi Torii
Abstract: We present the covariant gravitational equations to describe a four-dimensional brane world in the case with the Gauss-Bonnet term in a bulk spacetime, assuming that gravity is confined on the $Z_2$ symmetric brane. It contains some components of five-dimensional Weyl curvature ($E_{\mu\nu}$) which describes all effects from the bulk spacetime just as in the case of the Randall-Sundrum second model. Applying this formalism to cosmology, we derive the generalized Friedmann equation and calculate the Weyl curvature term, which is directly obtained from a black hole solution.
