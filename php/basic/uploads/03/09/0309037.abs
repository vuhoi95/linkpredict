Abstract: Perturbative corrections to N=1/2 supersymmetric U(N) gauge theory at one-loop order are studied. It is shown that whereas the quantum corrections to N=1 sector of the theory are not affected by the C-deformation, the non(anti)commutativity parameter C receives one-loop perturbative corrections. These perturbative corrections are computed by performing an explicit one-loop calculation of the three and four-point functions of the theory. The running of the non(anti)commutativity parameter C is also studied using an appropriate Callan-Symanzik equation.
