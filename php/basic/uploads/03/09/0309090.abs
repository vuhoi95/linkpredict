Title: Analytic determination of the asymptotic quasi-normal mode spectrum of  small Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes
Authors: K. H. C. Castello-Branco and E. Abdalla
Abstract: Following the monodromy technique performed by Motl and Neitzke, we consider the analytic determination of the highly damped (asymptotic) quasi-normal modes of small Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) black holes. We comment the result as compared to the recent numerical data of Konoplya and Zhidenko.
