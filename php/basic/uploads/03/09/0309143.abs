Title: Non-linear sigma-models in noncommutative geometry: fields with values  in finite spaces
Authors: Ludwik Dabrowski and Thomas Krajewski and Giovanni Landi
Abstract: We study sigma-models on noncommutative spaces, notably on noncommutative tori. We construct instanton solutions carrying a nontrivial topological charge q and satisfying a Belavin-Polyakov bound. The moduli space of these instantons is conjectured to consists of an ordinary torus endowed with a complex structure times a projective space $CP^{q-1}$.
