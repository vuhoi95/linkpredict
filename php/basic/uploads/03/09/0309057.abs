Title: On cosmologically induced hierarchies in string theory
Authors: E. Dudas and J. Mourad and C. Timirgaziu
Abstract: We propose, within a perturbative string theory example, a cosmological way to generate a large hierarchy between the observed Planck mass and the fundamental string scale. Time evolution results in three large space dimensions, one additional dimension transverse to our world and five small internal dimensions with a very slow time evolution. The evolution of the string coupling and internal space generate a large Planck mass. However due to an exact compensation between the time evolution of the internal space and that of the string coupling, the gauge and Yukawa couplings on our Universe are time independent.
