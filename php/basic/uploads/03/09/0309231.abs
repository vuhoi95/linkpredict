Title: D3-brane intersecting with dyonic BIon
Authors: S. Tamaryan and H. J. W. Mueller-Kirsten and D. K. Park
Abstract: The Born--Infeld theory of a D3-brane intersecting with(p,q) strings is reconsidered. From the assumption that the electromagnetic fields are those of a dyon, and using the kappa invariance of the action, the explicit scalar field and its charge are derived. Considering perturbations orthogonal to both branes, the SL(2,Z)-invariant S-matrix is obtained. Owing to the selfduality of the brane the latter can be evaluated explicitly in both high and low energy regions.
