Title: Gravitational F-terms of N=1 Supersymmetric SU(N) Gauge Theories
Authors: Harald Ita and Harald Nieder and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We use the generalized Konishi anomaly equations and R-symmetry anomaly to compute the exact perturbative and non-perturbative gravitational F-terms of four-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories. We formulate the general procedure for computation and consider chiral and non-chiral SU(N) gauge theories.
