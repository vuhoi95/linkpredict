Title: Generalized Virasoro anomaly and stress tensor for dilaton coupled  theories
Authors: A. Fabbri and S. Farese and J. Navarro-Salas
Abstract: We derive the anomalous transformation law of the quantum stress tensor for a 2D massless scalar field coupled to an external dilaton. This provides a generalization of the Virasoro anomaly which turns out to be consistent with the trace anomaly. We apply it together with the equivalence principle to compute the expectation values of the covariant quantum stress tensor on a curved background. Finally we briefly illustrate how to evaluate vacuum polarization and Hawking radiation effects from these results.
