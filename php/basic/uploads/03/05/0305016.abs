Title: Light quark masses, chiral condensate and quark-gluon condensate in  quenched lattice QCD with exact chiral symmetry
Authors: Ting-Wai Chiu and Tung-Han Hsieh
Abstract: We determine several quantities in quenched lattice QCD with exact chiral symmetry. For 100 gauge configurations generated with Wilson gauge action at $ \beta = 6.0 $ on the $ 16^3 \times 32 $ lattice, we compute quenched quark propagators for 13 bare quark masses. The pion decay constant is extracted from the pion propagator, and from which the inverse lattice spacing is determined to be $ a^{-1} = 1.979(6) $ GeV. The parameters ($ C, \delta, B $) in the pseudoscalar meson mass formula in quenched chiral perturbation theory (q$\chi$PT) to one-loop order are determined. Further, we measure the index (topological) susceptibility of these 100 gauge configurations, $ \chi_t = (175 \pm 6 {MeV})^4 $, from which we obtain an estimate of the mass of $ \eta' $ in q$\chi$PT, and the coefficient of quenched chiral logarithm, both in good agreement with the values determined from the pion masses, as well as with the theoretical estimates. With our values of $ C, \delta, B $, the experimental inputs of pion and kaon masses, and the pion decay constant, we determine the light quark masses: $ m_{u,d} = 4.1 \pm 0.3 $ MeV, and $ m_s = 92 \pm 9 $ MeV, in the $ \bar{MS} $ scheme at scale $ \mu = 2 $ GeV. Also, we determine the quark condensate $<\bar q q > = -(250 \pm 3 {MeV})^3 $, and the quark-gluon condensate $ g < \bar q \sigma_{\mu\nu} F_{\mu\nu} q > = -(434 \pm 4 {MeV})^5 $, in the $ \bar{MS} $ scheme at scale 2 GeV.
