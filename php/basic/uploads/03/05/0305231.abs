Title: Compact Einstein Spaces based on Quaternionic KÃ¤hler Manifolds
Authors: Mitsuo Hiragane and Yukinori Yasui and Hideki Ishihara
Abstract: We investigate the Einstein equation with a positive cosmological constant for $4n+4$-dimensional metrics on bundles over Quaternionic K\"ahler base manifolds whose fibers are 4-dimensional Bianchi IX manifolds. The Einstein equations are reduced to a set of non-linear ordinary differential equations. We numerically find inhomogeneous compact Einstein spaces with orbifold singularity.
