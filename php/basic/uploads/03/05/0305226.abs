Title: Algebraic brane dynamics on SU(2): excitation spectra
Authors: Jacek Pawelczyk and Harold Steinacker
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of D2-branes on SU(2) within a recently proposed matrix model, which works for finite radius of SU(2). The spectrum of single-brane excitations turns out to be free of tachyonic modes. It is similar to the spectrum found using DBI and CFT calculations, however the triplet of rotational zero modes is missing. This is attributed to a naive treatment of the quantum symmetries of the model. The mass of the lightest states connecting two different branes is also calculated, and found to be proportional to the arc length for small angles.
