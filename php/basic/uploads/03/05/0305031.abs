Title: Theta function parameterization and fusion for 3-D integrable Boltzmann  weights
Authors: G. von Gehlen and S. Pakuliak and S. Sergeev
Abstract: We report progress in constructing Boltzmann weights for integrable 3-dimensional lattice spin models. We show that a large class of vertex solutions to the modified tetrahedron equation can be conveniently parameterized in terms of N-th roots of theta-functions on the Jacobian of a compact algebraic curve. Fay's identity guarantees the Fermat relations and the classical equations of motion for the parameters determining the Boltzmann weights. Our parameterization allows to write a simple formula for fused Boltzmann weights R which describe the partition function of an arbitrary open box and which also obey the modified tetrahedron equation. Imposing periodic boundary conditions we observe that the R satisfy the normal tetrahedron equation. The scheme described contains the Zamolodchikov-Baxter-Bazhanov model and the Chessboard model as special cases.
