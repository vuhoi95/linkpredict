Title: Order ${\bf 1/N^3}$ corrections to the conformal anomaly of the (2,0)  theory in six dimensions
Authors: Paul Mansfield and David Nolland and Tatsuya Ueno
Abstract: Using Supergravity on $AdS_7\times S^4$ we calculate the bulk one-loop contribution to the conformal anomaly of the (2,0) theory describing $N$ coincident M5 branes. When this is added to the tree-level result, and an additional subleading order contribution calculated by Tseytlin, it gives an expression for the anomaly that interpolates correctly between the large $N$ theory and the free (2,0) tensor theory corresponding to N=1. Thus we can argue that we have identified the exact $N$-dependence of the anomaly, which may have a simple protected form valid away from the large $N$ limit.
