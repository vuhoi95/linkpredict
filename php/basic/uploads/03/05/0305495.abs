Title: Cosmic Degeneracy with Dark Energy Equation of State
Authors: James L. Crooks and James O. Dunn and Paul H. Frampton and Heather R. Norton and Tomo Takahashi
Abstract: We discuss a degeneracy between the geometry of the universe and the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm X}$ which exists in the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background. In particular, for the case with $w_{\rm X} < -1$, this degeneracy has interesting implications to a lower bound on $w_{\rm X}$ from observations. It is also discussed how this degeneracy can be removed using current observations of type Ia supernovae.
