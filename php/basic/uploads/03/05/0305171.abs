Title: Brane Inflation from Rotation of D4 Brane
Authors: Yun-Song Piao and Xinmin Zhang and Yuan-Zhong Zhang
Abstract: In this paper, a inflationary model from the rotation of D4-brane is constructed. We show that for a very wide rage of parameter, this model satisfies the observation and find that regarded as inflaton, the rotation of branes may be more nature than the distance between branes. Our model offers a new avenue for brane inflation.
