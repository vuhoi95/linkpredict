Title: Classically integrable field theories with defects
Authors: P. Bowcock and E. Corrigan and C. Zambon
Abstract: Some ideas and remarks are presented concerning a possible Lagrangian approach to the study of internal boundary conditions relating integrable fields at the junction of two domains. The main example given in the article concerns single real scalar fields in each domain and it is found that these may be free, of Liouville type, or of sinh-Gordon type.
