Title: Commuting quantum traces: the case of reflection algebras
Authors: Jean Avan and Anastasia Doikou
Abstract: We formulate a systematic construction of commuting quantum traces for reflection algebras. This is achieved by introducing two sets of generalized reflection equations with associated consistent fusion procedures. Products of their solutions yield commuting quantum traces.
