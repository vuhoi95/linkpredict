Title: General warped solutions in 5D dilaton gravity
Authors: Krzysztof A. Meissner and Marek Olechowski
Abstract: We present explicit analytic form of general warped solutions of the string inspired dilaton gravity system with bulk cosmological constant in 5 dimensions. The general solution allows for either nonvanishing effective 4-dimensional cosmological constant or the nontrivial 4-dimensional dilaton but not both.
