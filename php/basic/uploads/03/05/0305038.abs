Title: Generalized Hermite polynomials in superspace as eigenfunctions of the  supersymmetric rational CMS model
Authors: Patrick Desrosiers and Luc Lapointe and Pierre Mathieu
Abstract: We present an algebraic construction of the orthogonal eigenfunctions of the supersymmetric extension of the rational Calogero-Moser-Sutherland model with harmonic confinement. These eigenfunctions are the superspace extension of the generalized Hermite (or Hi-Jack) polynomials. The conserved quantities of the rational supersymmetric model are related to their trigonometric relatives through a similarity transformation. This leads to a simple expression between the corresponding eigenfunctions: the generalized Hermite superpolynomials are written as a differential operator acting on the corresponding Jack superpolynomials. As an aside, the maximal superintegrability of the supersymmetric rational Calogero-Moser-Sutherland model is demonstrated.
