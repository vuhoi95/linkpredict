Title: Phantom with Born-Infield type Lagrangian
Authors: Jian-gang Hao and Xin-zhou Li
Abstract: Recent analysis of the observation data indicates that the equation of state of the dark energy might be smaller than -1, which leads to the introduction of phantom models featured by its negative kinetic energy to account for the regime of equation of state $w<-1$. In this paper, we generalize the idea to the Born-Infield type Lagrangian with negative kinetic energy term and give the condition for the potential, under which the late time attractor solution exists and also analyze a viable cosmological model in such a scheme.
