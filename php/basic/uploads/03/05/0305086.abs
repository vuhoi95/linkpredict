Title: Brane Localized Curvature for Warped Gravitons
Authors: H. Davoudiasl and J. L. Hewett and T. G. Rizzo
Abstract: We study the effects of including brane localized curvature terms in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model of the hierarchy. This leads to the existence of brane localized kinetic terms for the graviton. Such terms can be induced by brane and bulk quantum effects as well as Higgs-curvature mixing on the brane. We derive the modified spectrum of Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons and their couplings to 4-dimensional fields in the presence of these terms. We find that the masses and couplings of the KK gravitons have considerable dependence on the size of the brane localized terms; the weak-scale phenomenology of the model is consequently modified . In particular, the weak-scale spin-2 graviton resonances which generically appear in the RS model may be significantly lighter than previously assumed. However, they may avoid detection as their widths may be too narrow to be observable at colliders. In the contact interaction limit, for a certain range of parameters, the experimental reach for the scale of the theory is independent of the size of the boundary terms.
