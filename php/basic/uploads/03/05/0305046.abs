Title: Baryon Charges in 4d Superconformal Field Theories and Their AdS Duals
Authors: Ken Intriligator and Brian Wecht
Abstract: We consider general aspects of the realization of R and non-R flavor symmetries in the AdS_5 x H_5 dual of 4d N=1 superconformal field theories. We find a general prescription for computing the charges under these symmetries for baryonic operators, which uses only topological information (intersection numbers) on H_5. We find and discuss a new correspondence between the nodes of the SCFT quiver diagrams and certain divisors in the associated geometry. We also discuss connections between the non-R flavor symmetries and the enhanced gauge symmetries in non-conformal theories obtained by adding wrapped branes.
