Title: Higher dimensional gravity invariant under the AdS group
Authors: Patricio Salgado and Fernando Izaurieta and Eduardo Rodriguez
Abstract: A higher dimensional gravity invariant both under local Lorentz rotations and under local Anti de Sitter boosts is constructed. It is shown that such a construction is possible both when odd dimensions and when even dimensions are considered. It is also proved that such actions have the same coefficients as those obtained by Troncoso and Zanelli.
