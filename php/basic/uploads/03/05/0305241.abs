Title: Brane in 6D with increasing gravitational trapping potential
Authors: Merab Gogberashvili and Douglas Singleton
Abstract: A new solution to Einstein equations in (1+5)-spacetime with an embedded (1+3) brane is given. This solution localizes the zero modes of all kinds of matter fields and 4-gravity on the (1+3) brane by an increasing, transverse gravitational potential. This localization occurs despite the fact that the gravitational potential is not a decreasing exponential, and asymptotically approaches a finite value rather than zero.
