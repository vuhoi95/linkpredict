Title: Some applications of renormalized RPA in bosonic field theories
Authors: H. Hansen and G. Chanfray
Abstract: We present some applications of the renormalized RPA in bosonic field theories. We first present some developments for the explicit calculation of the total energy in Phi^4 theory and discuss its phase structure in 1+1 dimensions. We also demonstrate that the Goldstone theorem is satisfied in the O(N) model within the renormalized RPA.
