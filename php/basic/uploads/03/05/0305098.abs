Title: Loss of coherence from discrete quantum gravity
Authors: Rodolfo Gambini and Rafael Porto and Jorge Pullin
Abstract: We show that a recent proposal for the quantization of gravity based on discrete space-time implies a modification of standard quantum mechanics that naturally leads to a loss of coherence in quantum states of the type discussed by Milburn. The proposal overcomes the energy conservation problem of previously proposed decoherence mechanisms stemming from quantum gravity. Mesoscopic quantum systems (as Bose--Einstein condensates) appear as the most promising testing grounds for an experimental verification of the mechanism.
