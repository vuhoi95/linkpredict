Title: Quark Propagator and Chiral Symmetry with String Tension
Authors: Ramesh Anishetty and Santosh Kumar Kudtarkar
Abstract: General properties of the light and heavy quark propagators have been investigated in the context of string tension interaction. Confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, spectral properties of the propagator are analytically studied and numerically validated. We show that the propagator is analytic in the infrared region even for massless quarks with a non zero radius of convergence. Emergence of more than one mass scale is exemplified. Massless limit of the quark propagator does exhibit critical behaviour.
