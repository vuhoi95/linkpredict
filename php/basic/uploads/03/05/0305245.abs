Title: Gauge symmetry enhancement in Hamiltonian formalism
Authors: Soon-Tae Hong and Joohan Lee and Tae Hoon Lee and Phillial Oh
Abstract: We study the Hamiltonian structure of the gauge symmetry enhancement in the enlarged CP(N) model coupled with U(2) Chern-Simons term, which contains a free parameter governing explicit symmetry breaking and symmetry enhancement. After giving a general discussion of the geometry of constrained phase space suitable for the symmetry enhancement, we explicitly perform the Dirac analysis of our model and compute the Dirac brackets for the symmetry enhanced and broken cases. We also discuss some related issues.
