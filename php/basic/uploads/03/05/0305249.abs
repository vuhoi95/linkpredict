Title: The energy-carrying velocity and rolling of tachyons of unstable  D-branes
Authors: Jin Hyun Chung and Won Sik L'Yi
Abstract: It is shown that the tachyons which originate from unstable D-branes carry energy and momentum at the velocity $\beta = c^2/v,$ where $v$ is the phase velocity which is greater than $c.$ For an observer who moves with the velocity $\beta,$ tachyon is observed to be moving from one of the ground states of the tachyon potential to the potential hill. It is found that tachyon either passes over the hill or bounces back to the original ground state. Another possible solution is the case which is margial to these, that is tachyon reaches to the top of the potential hill and stays there forever.
