Title: The Rolling Tachyon as a Matrix Model
Authors: Neil R. Constable and Finn Larsen
Abstract: We express all correlation functions in timelike boundary Liouville theory as unitary matrix integrals and develop efficient techniques to evaluate these integrals. We compute large classes of correlation functions explicitly, including an infinite number of terms in the boundary state of the rolling tachyon. The matrix integrals arising here also determine the correlation functions of gauge invariant operators in two dimensional Yang-Mills theory, suggesting an equivalence between the rolling tachyon and QCD_2.
