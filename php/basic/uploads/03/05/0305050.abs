Title: Considerations Concerning the Contributions of Fundamental Particles to  the Vacuum Energy Density
Authors: Giovanni Ossola and Alberto Sirlin
Abstract: The covariant regularization of the contributions of fundamental particles to the vacuum energy density is implemented in the Pauli-Villars, dimensional regularization, and Feynman regulator frameworks. Rules of correspondence between dimensional regularization and cutoff calculations are discussed. Invoking the scale invariance of free field theories in the massless limit, as well as consistency with the rules of correspondence, it is argued that quartic divergencies are absent in the case of free fields, while it is shown that they arise when interactions are present.
