Title: A theoretical case for negative mass-square for sub-eV particles
Authors: D. V. Ahluwalia-Khalilova and Irina Dymnikova
Abstract: Electroweak gauge bosons have masses of the order of 10^2 GeV, while masses of additional bosons involved in gravito-electroweak unification are expected to be still higher. These are at least eleven orders of magnitude higher than sub-eV range indications for neutrino masses. Under these circumstances we suspect that the sub-eV particles are created in a spacetime where gravitational effects of massive gauge bosons may become important. The question that we thus ask is: What is the spacetime group around a gravito-electroweak vertex? Modeling it as de-Sitter we find that sub-eV particles may carry a negative mass square of the order of - (3/8 \pi^3) (M_unif./M_Planck)^4 M_Planck^2. Neutrino oscillation data then hints at 30-75 TeV scale for M_unif., where M_unif. characterizes gravito-electroweak unification scale.
