Title: A minimal size for granular superconductors
Authors: L. M. Abreu and A. P. C. Malbouisson and I. Roditi
Abstract: We investigate the minimal size of small superconducting grains by means of a Ginzburg-Landau model confined to a sphere of radius $R$. This model is supposed to describe a material in the form of a ball, whose transition temperature when presented in bulk form, $T_{0}$, is known. We obtain an equation for the critical temperature as a function of $R$ and of $T_{0}$, allowing us to arrive at the minimal radius of the sphere below which no superconducting transition exists.
