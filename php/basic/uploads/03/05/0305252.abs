Title: Bound and anti-bound soliton states for a quantum integrable derivative  nonlinear Schrodinger model
Authors: B. Basu-Mallick and Tanaya Bhattacharyya and Diptiman Sen
Abstract: We find that localized quantum N-body soliton states exist for a derivative nonlinear Schrodinger (DNLS) model within an extended range of coupling constant (\xi_q) given by 0 < | \xi_q | < 1/\hbar \tan [\pi/(N-1)]. We also observe that soliton states with both positive and negative momentum can appear for a fixed value of \xi_q. Thus the chirality property of classical DNLS solitons is not preserved at the quantum level. Furthermore, it is found that the solitons with positive (negative) chirality have positive (negative) binding energy.
