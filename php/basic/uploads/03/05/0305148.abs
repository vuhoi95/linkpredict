Title: Unusual Properties of Superoscillating Particles
Authors: Achim Kempf and Paulo J. S. G. Ferreira
Abstract: It has been found that functions can oscillate locally much faster than their Fourier transform would suggest is possible - a phenomenon called superoscillation. Here, we consider the case of superoscillating wave functions in quantum mechanics. We find that they possess rather unusual properties which raise measurement theoretic, thermodynamic and information theoretic issues. We explicitly determine the wave functions with the most pronounced superoscillations, together with their scaling behavior. We also address the question how superoscillating wave functions could be produced.
