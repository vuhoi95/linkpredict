Title: Extrema bounds for the soft Pomeron intercept
Authors: E. G. S. Luna and M. J. Menon
Abstract: By using an extended Regge parametrization and taking into account the discrepancies in the high-energy pp and p(bar)p total cross section data, in both accelerator and cosmic-ray regions, we estimate extrema bounds for the soft Pomeron intercept. First we consider two ensembles of data with either the CDF or the E710 and E811 results for the p(bar)p total cross section at 1.8 TeV, from which we obtain the bounds 1.102 and 1.081, respectively. These ensembles are then combined with the highest and lowest estimations for the pp total cross section from cosmic-ray experiments (6-40 TeV), leading to the upper and lower bounds 1.109 and 1.082, respectively. The effects of simultaneous fits to total cross sections and the rho parameter, individual fits to total cross sections, and the influence of the subtraction constant in the dispersion relations are also presented. Our global results favor the E710 and E811 data.
