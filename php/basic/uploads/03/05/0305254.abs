Title: The stability of a bouncing universe
Authors: M. Novello and J. M. Salim
Abstract: We investigate the stability of a spatially homogeneous and isotropic non-singular cosmological model. We show that the complete set of independent perturbations (the electric part of the perturbed Weyl tensor and the perturbed shear) are regular and well behaved functions which have no divergences, contrary to previous claims in the literature.
