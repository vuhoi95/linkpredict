Title: Hidden Symmetries of the AdS_5 x S^5 Superstring
Authors: Iosif Bena and Joseph Polchinski and Radu Roiban
Abstract: Attempts to solve Yang-Mills theory must eventually face the problem of analyzing the theory at intermediate values of the coupling constant. In this regime neither perturbation theory nor the gravity dual are adequate, and one must consider the full string theory in the appropriate background. We suggest that in some nontrivial cases the world sheet theory may be exactly solvable. For the Green-Schwarz superstring on AdS_5 x S^5 we find an infinite set of nonlocal classically conserved charges, of the type that exist in integrable field theories.
