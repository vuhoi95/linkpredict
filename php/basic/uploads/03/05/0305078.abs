Title: Kahler Potential for M-theory on a G_2 Manifold
Authors: Andre Lukas and Stephen Morris
Abstract: We compute the moduli Kahler potential for M-theory on a compact manifold of G_2 holonomy in a large radius approximation. Our method relies on an explicit G_2 structure with small torsion, its periods and the calculation of the approximate volume of the manifold. As a verification of our result, some of the components of the Kahler metric are computed directly by integration over harmonic forms. We also discuss the modification of our result in the presence of co-dimension four singularities and derive the gauge-kinetic functions for the massless gauge fields that arise in this case.
