Title: Gauge Fluctuations in Superconducting Films
Authors: L. M. Abreu and A. P. C. Malbouisson and I. Roditi
Abstract: In this paper we consider a superconducting film modeled by the Ginzburg-Landau model, confined between two parallel planes a distance $L$ apart from one another. Our approach is based on the Gaussian effective potential in the transverse unitarity gauge, which allows to treat gauge contributions in a compact form. Using techniques from dimensional and $zeta$-function regularizations, modified by the confinement conditions, we investigate the critical temperature as a function of the film thickness $L$. The contributions from the scalar self-interaction and from the gauge fluctuations are clearly identified. The model suggests the existence of a minimal critical thickness below which superconductivity is suppressed.
