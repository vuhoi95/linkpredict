Title: A technique for generating new solutions of Einstein's equations
Authors: Roberto Bergamini and Stefano Viaggiu
Abstract: We present a simple technique for generating new solutions of Einstein's equations using such function transformations that leave the field equations in the Ernst form. In this context we recover all the known covariant transformations of Ernst equations and we find the role of the analytic ones. Finally we obtain a new asymptotically flat solution starting from the Kerr solutions.
