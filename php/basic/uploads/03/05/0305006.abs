Title: A Ginsparg-Wilson Approach to Lattice Chern-Simons Theory
Authors: W. Bietenholz and P. Sodano
Abstract: The concept of lattice modified symmetry formulations is adapted to the parity symmetry of gauge fields and applied to the pure Abelian Chern-Simons action in three dimensions. We derive an analogue of the Ginsparg-Wilson relation for the parity anti-symmetry, which is motivated from the perfect lattice action, and which we denote as the Chern-Simons-Ginsparg-Wilson relation (CSGWR). In addition to the overlap type solutions, we construct explicitly simple and local polynomial solutions to the CSGWR. We show that these actions are exactly invariant under a lattice modified parity transformation. That transformation is local as well, and it turns into the standard parity transformation in the continuum limit.
