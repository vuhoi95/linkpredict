Title: Higher Dimensional Bell-Szekeres Metric
Authors: M. Gurses and Y. Ipekoglu and A. Karasu and C. Senturk
Abstract: The collision of pure electromagnetic plane waves with collinear polarization in N-dimensional (N=2+n) Einstein-Maxwell theory is considered. A class of exact solutions for the higher dimensional Bell-Szekeres metric is obtained and its singularity structure is examined.
