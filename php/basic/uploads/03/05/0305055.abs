Title: Comments on Supergravity Description of S-branes
Authors: Alex Buchel and Johannes Walcher
Abstract: This is a note on the coupled supergravity-tachyon matter system, which has been earlier proposed as a candidate for the effective space-time description of S-branes. In particular, we study an ansatz with the maximal ISO(p+1)xSO(8-p,1) symmetry, for general brane dimensionality p and homogeneous brane distribution in transverse space \rho_\perp. A simple application of singularity theorems shows that (for p \le 7) the most general solution with these symmetries is always singular. (This invalidates a recent claim in the literature.) We include a few general comments about the possibility of describing the decay of unstable D-branes in purely gravitational terms.
