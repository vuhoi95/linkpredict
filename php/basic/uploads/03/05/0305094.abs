Title: Dirac-Kaehler Fermion from Clifford Product with Noncommutative  Differential Form on a Lattice
Authors: Issaku Kanamori and Noboru Kawamoto
Abstract: We formulate Dirac-Kaehler fermion action by introducing a new Clifford product with noncommutative differential form on a lattice. Hermiticity of the Dirac-Kaehler action requires to choose the lattice structure having both orientabilities on a link. The Kogut-Susskind fermion and the staggered fermion actions are derived directly from the Dirac-Kaehler fermion formulated by the Clifford product. The lattice QCD action with Dirac-Kaehler matter fermion is also derived via an inner product defined by the Clifford product.
