Title: Spectrum of TeV Particles in Warped Supersymmetric Grand Unification
Authors: Yasunori Nomura and David R. Smith
Abstract: In warped supersymmetric grand unification, XY gauge particles appear near the TeV scale along with Kaluza-Klein towers of the standard model gauge fields. In spite of this exotic low-energy physics, MSSM gauge coupling unification is preserved and proton decay is naturally suppressed. In this paper we study in detail the low-lying mass spectrum of superparticles and GUT particles in this theory, taking supersymmetry breaking to be localized to the TeV brane. The masses of the MSSM particles, Kaluza-Klein modes, and XY states are all determined by two parameters, one which fixes the strength of the supersymmetry breaking and the other which sets the scale of the infrared brane. A particularly interesting result is that for relatively strong supersymmetry breaking, the XY gauginos and the lowest Kaluza-Klein excitations of the MSSM gauginos may both lie within reach of the LHC, providing the possibility that the underlying unified gauge symmetry and the enhanced N=2 supersymmetry of the theory will both be revealed.
