Title: Kappa-deformed quantum field theory and Casimir effect
Authors: M. V. Cougo-Pinto and C. Farina and J. F. M. Mendes
Abstract: We consider the quantization of a scalar kappa-deformed field up to the point of obtaining an expression for its vacuum energy. The expression is given by the half sum of the field frequencies, as in the non-deformed case, but with the frequencies obeying the kappa-deformed dispersion relation. We consider a set of kappa-deformed Maxwell equations and show that for the purpose of calculating the Casimir energy the Maxwell field, as in the non-deformed case, behaves as a pair of scalar fields. Those results provide a foundation for computing the Casimir energy starting from the the half sum of field frequencies. A method of calculation starting from this expression is briefly described.
