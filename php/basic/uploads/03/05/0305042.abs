Title: Derivation of String Field Theory from the Large N BMN Limit
Authors: Robert de Mello Koch and Aristomenis Donos and Antal Jevicki and Joao P. Rodrigues
Abstract: We continue the development of a systematic procedure for deriving closed string pp wave string field theory from the large N Berenstein-Maldacena-Nastase limit. In the present paper the effects of the Yang-Mills interaction are considered in detail for general BMN states. The SFT interaction with the appropriate operator insertion at the interaction point is demonstrated.
