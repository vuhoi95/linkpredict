Title: Field Theoretic Realizations for Cubic Supersymmetry
Authors: N. Mohammedi and G. Moultaka and M. Rausch de Traubenberg
Abstract: We consider a four dimensional space-time symmetry which is a non trivial extension of the Poincar\'e algebra, different from supersymmetry and not contradicting {\sl a priori} the well-known no-go theorems. We investigate some field theoretical aspects of this new symmetry and construct invariant actions for non-interacting fermion and non-interacting boson multiplets. In the case of the bosonic multiplet, where two-form fields appear naturally, we find that this symmetry is compatible with a local U(1) gauge symmetry, only when the latter is gauge fixed by a `t Hooft-Feynman term.
