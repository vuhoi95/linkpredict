Title: Open+Closed String Field Theory From Gauge Fields
Authors: Jaume Gomis and Sanefumi Moriyama and Jongwon Park
Abstract: We study open and closed string interactions in the Type IIB plane wave background using open+closed string field theory. We reproduce all string amplitudes from the dual N=2 Sp(N) gauge theory by computing matrix elements of the dilatation operator. A direct diagrammatic correspondence is found between string theory and gauge theory Feynman diagrams. The prefactor and Neumann matrices of open+closed string field theory are separately realized in terms of gauge theory quantities.
