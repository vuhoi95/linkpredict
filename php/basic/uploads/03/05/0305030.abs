Title: Dirac Monopoles in the Ernst--Schwarzschild Spacetime
Authors: A. A. Bytsenko and Yu. P. Goncharov
Abstract: It is discussed that the Ernst--Schwarzschild metric describing a nonrotating black hole in the external magnetic field admits the solutions of the Dirac monopole types for the corresponding Maxwell equations. The given solutions are obtained in explicit form and a possible influence of the conforming Dirac monopoles on Hawking radiation is also outlined.
