Title: New Global Defect Structures
Authors: D. Bazeia and J. Menezes and R. Menezes
Abstract: We investigate the presence of defects in systems described by real scalar field in (D,1) spacetime dimensions. We show that when the potential assumes specific form, there are models which support stable global defects for D arbitrary. We also show how to find first-order differential equations that solve the equations of motion, and how to solve models in D dimensions via soluble problems in D=1. We illustrate the procedure examining specific models and finding explicit solutions.
