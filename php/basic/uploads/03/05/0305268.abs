Title: Explicit description of twisted Wakimoto realizations of affine Lie  algebras
Authors: L. Feher and B. G. Pusztai
Abstract: In a vertex algebraic framework, we present an explicit description of the twisted Wakimoto realizations of the affine Lie algebras in correspondence with an arbitrary finite order automorphism and a compatible integral gradation of a complex simple Lie algebra. This yields generalized free field realizations of the twisted and untwisted affine Lie algebras in any gradation. The free field form of the twisted Sugawara formula and examples are also exhibited.
