Title: Goldstone bosons in the massless Thirring model. Witten's criterion
Authors: M. Faber and A. N. Ivanov
Abstract: We discuss the Ward identity and the low-energy theorem for the divergence of the axial-vector current in the massless Thirring model with fermion fields quantized in the chirally broken phase (Eur. Phys. J. C20, 723 (2001)). The Ward identity and the low-energy theorem are analysed in connection with Witten's criterion for Goldstone bosons (Nucl. Phys. B145, 110 (1978)). We show that the free massless (pseudo)scalar field bosonizing the massless Thirring model in the chirally broken phase satisfies Witten's criterion to interpret quanta of this field as Goldstone bosons. As has been shown in hep-th/0210104 and hep-th/0212226, Goldstone's criterion, the non-invariance of the wave function of the ground state, is also fulfilled.
