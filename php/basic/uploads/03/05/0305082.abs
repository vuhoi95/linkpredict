Title: Non-minimal couplings, quantum geometry and black hole entropy
Authors: Abhay Ashtekar and Alejandro Corichi
Abstract: The black hole entropy calculation for type I isolated horizons, based on loop quantum gravity, is extended to include non-minimally coupled scalar fields. Although the non-minimal coupling significantly modifies quantum geometry, the highly non-trivial consistency checks for the emergence of a coherent description of the quantum horizon continue to be met. The resulting expression of black hole entropy now depends also on the scalar field precisely in the fashion predicted by the first law in the classical theory (with the same value of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter as in the case of minimal coupling).
