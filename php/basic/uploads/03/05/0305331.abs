Title: Origin of quark masses and Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix in a gauge  theory with nonunitary parallel transporters
Authors: C. Lehmann and G. Mack and T. Pr√ºstel
Abstract: Starting from a characteristic biinvariance property of Higgs potentials in gauge theories with nonunitary parallel transporters, we explain how quarks of different flavor can acquire different masses by spontaneous symmetry breaking and what is the difference between colour and flavor. We present a gauge theoretic model where the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix becomes computable in principle. The model lives on a five dimensional space time with two four dimensional boundaries R and L a small distance d apart. Right handed quarks and leptons live on R and left handed quarks and leptons on L. Photons can propagate in the bulk. ee- and deep inelastic eN-scattering at energies larger than 1/d will be affected.
