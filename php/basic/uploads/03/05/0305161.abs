Title: On the Dependence of the Spectra of Fluctuations in Inflationary  Cosmology on Trans-Planckian Physics
Authors: Jerome Martin and R. H. Brandenberger
Abstract: We calculate the power spectrum of metric fluctuations in inflationary cosmology starting with initial conditions which are imposed mode by mode when the wavelength equals some critical length $\ell_{_{\rm C}}$ corresponding to a new energy scale $M_{_{\rm C}}$ at which trans-Planckian physics becomes important. In this case, the power spectrum can differ from what is calculated in the usual framework (which amounts to choosing the adiabatic vacuum state). The fractional difference in the results depends on the ratio $\sigma_0$ between the Hubble expansion rate $H_{\rm inf}$ during inflation and the new energy scale $M_{_{\rm C}}$. We show how and why different choices of the initial vacuum state (stemming from different assumptions about trans-Planckian physics) lead to fractional differences which depend on different powers of $\sigma_0$. As we emphasize, the power in general also depends on whether one is calculating the power spectrum of density fluctuations or of gravitational waves.
