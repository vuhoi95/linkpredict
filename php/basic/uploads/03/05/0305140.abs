Title: Beyond the Singularity of the 2-D Charged Black Hole
Authors: Amit Giveon and Eliezer Rabinovici and Amit Sever
Abstract: Two dimensional charged black holes in string theory can be obtained as exact (SL(2,R)xU(1))/U(1) quotient CFTs. The geometry of the quotient is induced from that of the group, and in particular includes regions beyond the black hole singularities. Moreover, wavefunctions in such black holes are obtained from gauge invariant vertex operators in the SL(2,R) CFT, hence their behavior beyond the singularity is determined. When the black hole is charged we find that the wavefunctions are smooth at the singularities. Unlike the uncharged case, scattering waves prepared beyond the singularity are not fully reflected; part of the wave is transmitted through the singularity. Hence, the physics outside the horizon of a charged black hole is sensitive to conditions set behind the past singularity.
