Abstract: We evaluate the noncommutative Chern-Simons action induced by fermions interacting with an Abelian gauge field in a noncommutative massive Thirring model in (2+1)-dimensional spacetime. This calculation is performed in the Dirac and Majorana representations. We observe that in Majorana representation when $\theta$ goes to zero we do not have induced Chern-Simons term in the dimensional regularization scheme.
