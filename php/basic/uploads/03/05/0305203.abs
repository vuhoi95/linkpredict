Title: Dynamical breaking of conformal symmetry in the massless Thirring model
Authors: M. Faber and A. N. Ivanov
Abstract: We discuss conformal invariance of the massless Thirring model. We show that conformal symmetry of the massless Thirring model is dynamically broken due to the constant of motion caused by the equations of motion. This confirms the existence of the chirally broken phase in the massless Thirring model (Eur. Phys. J. C20, 723 (2001), which is accompanied by the appearance of massless (pseudo)scalar Goldstone bosons (Eur. Phys. J. C24, 653 (2002), hep-th/0210104 and hep-th/0305174).
