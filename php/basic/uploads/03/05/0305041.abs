Title: Transmission resonances and supercritical states in a one dimensional  cusp potential
Authors: Victor M. Villalba and Walter Greiner
Abstract: We solve the two-component Dirac equation in the presence of a spatially one dimensional symmetric cusp potential. We compute the scattering and bound states solutions and we derive the conditions for transmission resonances as well as for supercriticality.
