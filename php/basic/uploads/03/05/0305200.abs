Abstract: Operator product expansions (OPE) for the product of a scalar field with its conjugate are presented as infinite sums of bilocal fields V_k (x_1, x_2) of dimension (k,k). For a {\it globally conformal invariant} (GCI) theory we write down the OPE of V_k into a series of {\it twist} (dimension minus rank) 2k symmetric traceless tensor fields with coefficients computed from the (rational) 4-point function of the scalar field. We argue that the theory of a GCI hermitian scalar field L(x) of dimension 4 in D = 4 Minkowski space such that the 3-point functions of a pair of L's and a scalar field of dimension 2 or 4 vanish can be interpreted as the theory of local observables of a conformally invariant fixed point in a gauge theory with Lagrangian density L(x).
