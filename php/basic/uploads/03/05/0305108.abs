Title: Orientifolds of type IIA strings on Calabi-Yau manifolds
Authors: Suresh Govindarajan and Jaydeep Majumder
Abstract: We identify type IIA orientifolds that are dual to M-theory compactifications on manifolds with G_2-holonomy. We then discuss the construction of crosscap states in Gepner models. (Based on a talk presented by S.G. at PASCOS 2003 held at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai during Jan. 3-8, 2003.)
