Title: Velocity and velocity-difference distributions in Burgers turbulence
Authors: S. Boldyrev and T. Linde and A. Polyakov
Abstract: We consider the one-dimensional Burgers equation randomly stirred at large scales by a Gaussian short-time correlated force. Using the method of dissipative anomalies, we obtain velocity and velocity-difference probability density functions and confirm the results with high-resolution numerical simulations.
