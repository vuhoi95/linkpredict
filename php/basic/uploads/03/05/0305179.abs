Title: Hagedorn vs. Hawking-Page transition in string theory
Authors: Alex Buchel and Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas
Abstract: We study the supergravity dual to the confinement/deconfinement phase transition for the N=4 SU(N) SYM on R x S^3 with a chemical potential conjugate to a U(1)\subset SO(6)_R charge. The appropriate supergravity system is a single charge black hole in D=5 N=8 gauged supergravity. Application of the gauge/string theory holographic renormalization approach leads to new expressions for the black hole ADM mass and its generalized free energy. We comment on the relation of this phase transition to the Hagedorn transition for strings in the maximally supersymmetric plane wave background with null RR five form field strength.
