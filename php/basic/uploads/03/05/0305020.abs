Abstract: We analyze the ghost condensates <f^{abc}c^{b}c^{c}>, <f^{abc}\oc^{b}\oc^{c}> and <f^{abc}\oc^{b}c^{c}> in Yang-Mills theory in the Curci-Ferrari gauge. By combining the local composite operator formalism with the algebraic renormalization technique, we are able to give a simultaneous discussion of <f^{abc}c^{b}c^{c}>, <f^{abc}\oc^{b}\oc^{c}> and <f^{abc}\oc^{b}c^{c}>, which can be seen as playing the role of the BCS, respectively Overhauser effect in ordinary superconductivity. The Curci-Ferrari gauge exhibits a global continuous symmetry generated by the Nakanishi-Ojima (NO) algebra. This algebra includes, next to the (anti-)BRST transformation, a SL(2,R) subalgebra. We discuss the dynamical symmetry breaking of the NO algebra through these ghost condensates. Particular attention is paid to the Landau gauge, a special case of the Curci-Ferrari gauge.
