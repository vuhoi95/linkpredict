Title: On the supermultiplet of anomalous currents in d=6
Authors: R. Manvelyan and W. Ruehl
Abstract: The multiplet of superconformal anomalous currents in the case $(1,0)$, $d=6$ is derived. The supersymmetric multiplet of anomalies contains the trace of the energy momentum tensor, the gamma trace of the supercurrent and some topological vector current with divergence equal to the $R$-current anomaly. The extension of this consideration to the $(2,0)$ case and some application and motivation coming from $AdS_{7}/CFT_{6}$ correspondence is discussed.
