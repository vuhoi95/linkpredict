Title: The unphysical nature of the SL(2,R) symmetry and its associated  condensates in Yang-Mills theories
Authors: Mboyo Esole and Filipe Freire
Abstract: BRST cohomology methods are used to explain the origin of the SL(2,R) symmetry in Yang-Mills theories. Clear evidence is provided for the unphysical nature of this symmetry. This is obtained from the analysis of a local functional of mass dimension two and constitutes a no-go statement for giving a physical meaning to condensates associated with the symmetry breaking of SL(2,R).
