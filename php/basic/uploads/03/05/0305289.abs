Title: Modular invariance, characteristic numbers and $Î·$ invariants
Authors: Fei Han and Weiping Zhang
Abstract: We generalize the "miraculous cancellation" formulas of Alvarez-Gaum\'e, Witten and Kefeng Liu to a twisted version where an extra complex line bundle is involved. We also apply our result to discuss intrinsic relations between the higher dimensional Rokhlin type congruence formulas of Ochanine [O1], Finashin [F] and Zhang [Z1, 2]. In particular, an analytic proof of the Finashin congruence formula is given.
