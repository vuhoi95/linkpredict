Title: Torsion nonminimally coupled to the electromagnetic field and  birefringence
Authors: Guillermo F. Rubilar and Yuri N. Obukhov and Friedrich W. Hehl
Abstract: In conventional Maxwell--Lorentz electrodynamics, the propagation of light is influenced by the metric, not, however, by the possible presence of a torsion T. Still the light can feel torsion if the latter is coupled nonminimally to the electromagnetic field F by means of a supplementary Lagrangian of the type l^2 T^2 F^2 (l = coupling constant). Recently Preuss suggested a specific nonminimal term of this nature. We evaluate the spacetime relation of Preuss in the background of a general O(3)-symmetric torsion field and prove by specifying the optical metric of spacetime that this can yield birefringence in vacuum. Moreover, we show that the nonminimally coupled homogeneous and isotropic torsion field in a Friedmann cosmos affects the speed of light.
