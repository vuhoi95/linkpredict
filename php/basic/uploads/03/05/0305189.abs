Title: Factorization of Seiberg-Witten Curves and Compactification to Three  Dimensions
Authors: Rutger Boels and Jan de Boer and Robert Duivenvoorden and Jeroen Wijnhout
Abstract: We continue our study of nonperturbative superpotentials of four-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories with gauge group U(N) on R^3 x S^1, broken to N=1 due to a classical superpotential. In a previous paper, hep-th/0304061, we discussed how the low-energy quantum superpotential can be obtained by substituting the Lax matrix of the underlying integrable system directly into the classical superpotential. In this paper we prove algebraically that this recipe yields the correct factorization of the Seiberg-Witten curves, which is an important check of the conjecture. We will also give an independent proof using the algebraic-geometrical interpretation of the underlying integrable system.
