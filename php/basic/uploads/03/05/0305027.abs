Title: The Stark effect in the charge-dyon system
Authors: Levon Mardoyan and Armen Nersessian and Mara Petrosyan
Abstract: The linear Stark effect in the MIC-Kepler problem describing the interaction of charged particle with Dirac's dyon is considered. It is shown that constant homogeneous electric field completely removes the degeneracy of the energy levels on azimuth quantum number
