Title: Dimensionally Reduced Gravitational Chern-Simons Term and its Kink
Authors: G. Guralnik and A. Iorio and R. Jackiw and S. -Y. Pi
Abstract: When the gravitational Chern-Simons term is reduced from 3 to 2 dimensions, the lower dimensional theory supports a symmetry breaking solution and an associated kink. Kinks in general relativity bear a close relation to flat space kinks, governed by identical potentials.
