Title: Non-linear gravitational clustering in scalar field cosmologies
Authors: S. Matarrese and M. Pietroni and C. Schimd
Abstract: Non-linear gravitational clustering in a universe dominated by dark energy, modelled by a `quintessence' scalar field, and cold dark matter with space-time varying mass is studied. Models of this type, where the variable mass is induced by dependence on the scalar field, as suggested by string theory or extra-dimensions, have been proposed as a viable solution of the coincidence problem. A general framework for the study of the non-linear phases of structure formation in scalar field cosmologies is provided, starting from a general relativistic treatment of the combined dark matter-dark energy system. As a first application, the mildly non-linear evolution of dark matter perturbations is obtained by a straightforward extension of the Zel'dovich approximation. We argue that the dark energy fluctuations may play an active role in cosmological structure formation if the scalar field effective potential develops a temporary spinodal instability during the evolution.
