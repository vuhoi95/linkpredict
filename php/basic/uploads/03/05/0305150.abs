Title: Instability of thick brane worlds
Authors: Kazuo Ghoroku and Masanobu Yahiro
Abstract: We examined 5d thick brane worlds constructed by a real scalar field. The solutions are obtained in terms of a simple form of smooth warp factor. For the case of dS brane, we found a disease of the solutions. For example, it is impossible to construct thick-brane worlds with our simple smoothing. This result is independent of supersymmetry or other symmetries.
