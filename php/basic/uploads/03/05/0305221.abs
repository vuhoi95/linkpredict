Title: Operator Mapping between RNS and Extended Pure Spinor Formalisms for  Superstring
Authors: Yuri Aisaka and Yoichi Kazama
Abstract: An explicit operator mapping in the form of a similarity transformation is constructed between the RNS formalism and an extension of the pure spinor formalism (to be called EPS formalism) recently proposed by the present authors. Due to the enlarged field space of the EPS formalism, where the pure spinor constraints are removed, the mapping is completely well-defined in contrast to the one given previously by Berkovits in the original pure spinor (PS) formalism. This map provides a direct demonstration of the equivalence of the cohomologies of the RNS and the EPS formalisms and is expected to be useful for better understanding of various properties of the PS and EPS formalisms. Furthermore, the method of construction, which makes systematic use of the nilpotency of the BRST charges, should find a variety of applications.
