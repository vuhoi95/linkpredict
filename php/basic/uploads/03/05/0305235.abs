Title: The group approach to AdS space propagators
Authors: Thorsten Leonhardt and Ruben Manvelyan and Werner Ruehl
Abstract: We show that AdS two-point functions can be obtained by connecting two points in the interior of AdS space with one point on its boundary by a dual pair of Dobrev's boundary-to-bulk intertwiners and integrating over the boundary point.
