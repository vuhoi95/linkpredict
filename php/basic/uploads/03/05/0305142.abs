Title: Vacuum Polarization by a Magnetic Flux in a Cosmic String Background
Authors: J. Spinelly and E. R. Bezerra de Mello
Abstract: In this paper we analyse the vacuum polarization effects due to a magnetic flux on massless fermionic fields in a cosmic string background. Three distinct configurations of magnetic fields are considered. In all of them the magnetic fluxes are confined in a long cylindrical tube of finite radius.
