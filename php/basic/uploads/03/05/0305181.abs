Title: Testing braneworlds with the binary pulsar
Authors: Ruth Durrer and Philippe Kocian
Abstract: In this letter we calculate the emission of gravity waves by the binary pulsar in the framework of five dimensional braneworlds. We consider only spacetimes with one compact extra-dimension. We show that the presence of additional degrees of freedom, especially the 'gravi-scalar' leads to a modification of Einstein's quadrupole formula. We compute the induced change for the binary pulsar PSR 1913+16 where it amounts to about 20% which is by far excluded by present experimental data.
