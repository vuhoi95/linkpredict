Title: Spectrum of One-Dimensional Anharmonic Oscillators
Authors: H. A. Alhendi and E. I. Lashin
Abstract: We use a power-series expansion to calculate the eigenvalues of anharmonic oscillators bounded by two infinite walls. We show that for large finite values of the separation of the walls, the calculated eigenvalues are of the same high accuracy as the values recently obtained for the unbounded case by the inner-product quantization method. We also apply our method to the Morse potential. The eigenvalues obtained in this case are in excellent agreement with the exact values for the unbounded Morse potential.
