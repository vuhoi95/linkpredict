Title: Landau-Ginzburg Realization of Open String TFT
Authors: Ilka Brunner and Manfred Herbst and Wolfgang Lerche and Bernhard Scheuner
Abstract: We investigate B-type topological Landau-Ginzburg theory with one variable, with D2-brane boundary conditions. We find that the allowed brane configurations are determined in terms of the possible factorizations of the superpotential, and compute the corresponding open string chiral rings. These are characterized by bosonic and fermionic generators that satisfy certain relations. Moreover we show that the disk correlators, being continuous functions of deformation parameters, satisfy the topological sewing constraints, thereby proving consistency of the theory. In addition we show that the open string LG model is, in its content, equivalent to a certain triangulated category introduced by Kontsevich, and thus may be viewed as a concrete physical realization of it.
