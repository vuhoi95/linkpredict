Title: String theory in Lorentz-invariant light cone gauge - II
Authors: Igor Nikitin and Lialia Nikitina
Abstract: We perform a quantization of 4-dimensional Nambu-Goto theory of open string in light cone gauge, related in Lorentz-invariant way with the world sheet. This allows to obtain a quantum theory without anomalies in Lorentz group. We consider a special type of gauge fixing conditions, imposed in oscillator sector of the theory, which lead to a relatively simple Hamiltonian mechanics, convenient for canonical quantization. We discuss the algebraic and geometric properties of this mechanics and determine its mass spectrum for the states of spin singlet S=0.
