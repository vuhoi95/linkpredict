Abstract: We point out that the worldvolume coordinate functions $\hat{x}^\mu(\xi)$ of a $p$-brane, treated as an independent object interacting with dynamical gravity, are Goldstone fields for spacetime diffeomorphisms gauge symmetry. The presence of this gauge invariance is exhibited by its associated Noether identity, which expresses that the source equations follow from the gravitational equations. We discuss the spacetime counterpart of the Higgs effect and show that a $p$-brane does not carry any local degrees of freedom, extending early known general relativity features. Our considerations are also relevant for brane world scenarios.
