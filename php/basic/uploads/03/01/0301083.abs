Title: Spin-1 gravitational waves and their natural sources
Authors: F. Canfora and G. Vilasi
Abstract: Non-vacuum exact gravitational waves invariant for a non Abelian two-dimensional Lie algebra generated by two Killing fields whose commutator is of light type, are described. The polarization of these waves, already known from previous works, is related to the sources. Non vacuum exact gravitational waves admitting only one Killing field of light type are also discussed.
