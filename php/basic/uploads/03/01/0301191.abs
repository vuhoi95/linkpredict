Title: Classical stability of stringy wormholes in flat and AdS spaces
Authors: Jin Young Kim and Yoonbai Kim and James E. Hetrick
Abstract: We study small fluctuations of the stringy wormhole solutions of graviton-dilaton-axion system in arbitrary dimensions. We show under O($d$)-symmetric harmonic perturbation that the Euclidean wormhole solutions are unstable in flat space irrespective of dimensions and in anti de Sitter space of $d=3$.
