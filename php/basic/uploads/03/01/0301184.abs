Title: Probes in fluxbranes and supersymmetry breaking through Hodge-duality
Authors: Jos Gheerardyn and Bert Janssen
Abstract: In this letter we consider what happens to an M2-brane probe when Minkowski space is dimensionally reduced to a fluxbrane solution of IIA supergravity. Given that fluxbrane reductions generally break supersymmetry, we look at how supersymmetry is realised on the D2-brane probe after dualisation. We also show how to extend this to more general non-linear sigma models.
