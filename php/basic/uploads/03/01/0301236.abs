Title: Geometry of differential operators, and odd Laplace operators
Authors: Hovhannes M. Khudaverdian and Theodore Voronov
Abstract: We solve the following problem: to describe in geometric terms all differential operators of the second order with a given principal symbol. Initially the operators act on scalar functions. Operator pencils acting on densities of arbitrary weights appear naturally in the course of study. We show that for the algebra of densities it is possible to establish a one-to-one correspondence between operators and brackets generated by them. Everything is applicable to supermanifolds as well as to usual manifolds. In the super case the problem is closely connected with the geometry of the Batalin--Vilkovisky formalism in quantum field theory, namely the description of the generating operators for an odd bracket. We give a complete answer. This text is a concise outline of the main results. A detailed exposition is in \texttt{arXiv:math.DG/0212311}.
