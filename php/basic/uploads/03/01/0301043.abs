Title: Conservation laws for non global Lagrangians
Authors: A. Borowiec and M. Ferraris and M. Francaviglia and M. Palese
Abstract: In the Lagrangian framework for symmetries and conservation laws of field theories, we investigate globality properties of conserved currents associated with non-global Lagrangians admitting global Euler--Lagrange morphisms. Our approach is based on the recent geometric formulation of the calculus of variations on finite order jets of fibered manifolds in terms of variational sequences.
