Title: Codimension Two Holography
Authors: Enrique Alvarez and Jorge Conde and Lorenzo Hernandez
Abstract: A holographic interpretation for some specific Ricci flat string backgrounds of the form $A_6\times C_4$ is proposed. The conjecture is that there is a Four-dimensional Euclidean Conformal Field Theory (ECFT) defined on a codimension two {\em submanifold} of the manifold $A_6$ (where one of the two remaining {\em holographic} coordinates of $A_6$ is timelike, and the other one spacelike), with central charge proportional to the radius of curvature of the six-dimensional manifold, $c\sim l^4$.
