Title: N=2 Supersymmetric SO(N)/Sp(N) Gauge Theories from Matrix Model
Authors: Changhyun Ahn and Soonkeon Nam
Abstract: We use the matrix model to describe the N=2 SO(N)/Sp(N) supersymmetric gauge theories with massive hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation. By taking the tree level superpotential perturbation made of a polynomial of a scalar chiral multiplet, the effective action for the eigenvalues of chiral multiplet can be obtained. By varying this action with respect to an eigenvalue, a loop equation is obtained. By analyzing this equation, we derive the Seiberg-Witten curve within the context of matrix model.
