Abstract: The orbifold GUT doublet-triplet splitting mechanism was discussed in 1994 in the framework of the NAHE-based free fermionic models in which the SO(10) GUT symmetry is broken to SO(6) X SO(4), SU(3) X SU(2) X U(1)^2, or SU(3) X U(1) X SU(2)^2. In this paper we study NAHE-based free fermionic models in which the SO(10) symmetry is broken at the string level to SU(4) X SU(2) X U(1). In addition to the doublet-triplet splitting this case also has the advantage of inducing the doublet-doublet splitting already at the string level. We demonstrate, however, that NAHE-based models with SU(4) X SU(2) X U(1) SO(10) subgroup are not viable. We show that, similarly to the LRS models, and in contrast to the FSU5, PS and SLM models, the SU421 case gives rise to models without an anomalous U(1) symmetry, and discuss the different cases in terms of their N=4 origins.
