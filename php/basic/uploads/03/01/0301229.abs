Title: Critical Behavior of Non Order-Parameter Fields
Authors: Agnes Mocsy and Francesco Sannino and Kimmo Tuominen
Abstract: We show that all of the relevant features of a phase transition can be determined using a non order parameter field which is a physical state of the theory. This fact allows us to understand the deconfining transition of the pure Yang-Mills theory via the physical excitations rather than using the Polyakov loop.
