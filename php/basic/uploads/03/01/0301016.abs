Title: Particle and light motion in a space-time of a five-dimensional rotating  black hole
Authors: Valeri Frolov and Dejan Stojkovic
Abstract: We study motion of particles and light in a space-time of a 5-dimensional rotating black hole. We demonstrate that the Myers-Perry metric describing such a black hole in addition to three Killing vectors possesses also a Killing tensor. As a result, the Hamilton-Jacobi equations of motion allow a separation of variables. Using first integrals we present the equations of motion in the first-order form. We describe different types of motion of particles and light and study some interesting special cases. We proved that there are no stable circular orbits in equatorial planes in the background of this metric.
