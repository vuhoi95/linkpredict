Abstract: We consider supersymmetric scenarios in which the scale of SUSY breaking is low, sqrt{F}=O(TeV). Instead of studying specific models of this type, e.g. those with extra dimensions and low fundamental scale, we follow a model-independent approach based on a general effective Lagrangian, in which the MSSM supermultiplets are effectively coupled to a singlet associated to SUSY breaking. Our goal is to analyse the interplay bewteen SUSY breaking and electroweak breaking, generalizing earlier results. The conventional MSSM picture can be substantially modified, mainly because the Higgs potential contains additional effective quartic terms and resembles that of two-Higgs-doublet models, with an additional singlet. Novel opportunities to achieve electroweak breaking arise, and the electroweak scale may be obtained in a less fine-tuned way. Also the Higgs spectrum can be strikingly changed, and the lightest state can be much heavier than in usual supersymmetric scenarios. Other effects appear in the chargino and neutralino sectors, which contain the goldstino. Finally, we discuss the role of electroweak breaking in processes in which two goldstinos could be emitted, such as fermion-antifermion annihilation and the invisible decay of a Z boson or of neutral Higgs bosons.
