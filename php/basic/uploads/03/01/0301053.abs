Title: Confinement of neutral fermions by a pseudoscalar double-step potential  in (1+1) dimensions
Authors: Antonio S. de Castro and Wiliam G. Pereira
Abstract: The problem of confinement of neutral fermions in two-dimensional space-time is approached with a pseudoscalar double-step potential in the Dirac equation. Bound-state solutions are obtained when the coupling is of sufficient intensity. The confinement is made plausible by arguments based on effective mass and anomalous magnetic interaction.
