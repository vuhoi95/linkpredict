Title: BRST-anti-BRST Symmetric Conversion of Second-Class Constraints
Authors: I. A. Batalin and M. A. Grigoriev
Abstract: A general method of the BRST--anti-BRST symmetric conversion of second-class constraints is presented. It yields a pair of commuting and nilpotent BRST-type charges that can be naturally regarded as BRST and anti-BRST ones. Interchanging the BRST and anti-BRST generators corresponds to a symmetry between the original second-class constraints and the conversion variables, which enter the formalism on equal footing.
