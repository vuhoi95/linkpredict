Title: Twisted Backgrounds, PP-Waves and Nonlocal Field Theories
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha and Ori J. Ganor
Abstract: We study partially supersymmetric plane-wave like deformations of string theories and M-theory on brane backgrounds. These deformations are dual to nonlocal field theories. We calculate various expectation values of configurations of closed as well as open Wilson loops and Wilson surfaces in those theories. We also discuss the manifestation of the nonlocality structure in the supergravity backgrounds. A plane-wave like deformation of little string theory has also been studied.
