Title: Scaling algebras and short-distance analysis for charge carrying quantum  fields
Authors: Claudio D`Antoni and Rainer Verch
Abstract: The paper "Scaling algebras and short-distance analysis for charge carrying quantum fields" by C. D'Antoni and R. Verch, hep-th/0301145, has been withdrawn by the authors since it was found that it overlaps considerably with independent work contained in the Ph.D.\ thesis by G. Morsella who, at the time when our preprint has been submitted to the arXiv, was just about to prepare his results for publication. It was hence agreed between G.\ Morsella and ourselves that it is more appropriate to produce a joint paper instead of two competing ones. This new paper, co-authored together with G.\ Morsella, will appear in due course to replace hep-th/0301145.
