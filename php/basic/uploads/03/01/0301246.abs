Title: Two-Graviton Interaction in PP-Wave Background in Matrix Theory and  Supergravity
Authors: Hok Kong Lee and Xinkai Wu
Abstract: We compute the two-body one-loop effective action for the matrix theory in the pp-wave background, and compare it to the effective action on the supergravity side in the same background. Agreement is found for the effective actions on both sides. This points to the existence of a supersymmetric nonrenormalization theorem in the pp-wave background.
