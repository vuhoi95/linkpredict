Title: Radiative corrections to the Casimir effect for the massive scalar field
Authors: F. A. Barone and R. M. Cavalcanti and C. Farina
Abstract: We compute the $O(\lambda)$ correction to the Casimir energy for the massive $\lambda\phi^4$ model confined between a pair of parallel plates. The calculations are made with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. The correction is shown to be sensitive to the boundary conditions, except in the zero mass limit, in which case our results agree with those found in the literature.
