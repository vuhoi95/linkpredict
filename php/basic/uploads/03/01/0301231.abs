Title: On Duality Walls in String Theory
Authors: Amihay Hanany and Johannes Walcher
Abstract: Following the RG flow of an N=1 quiver gauge theory and applying Seiberg duality whenever necessary defines a duality cascade, that in simple cases has been understood holographically. It has been argued that in certain cases, the dualities will pile up at a certain energy scale called the duality wall, accompanied by a dramatic rise in the number of degrees of freedom. In string theory, this phenomenon is expected to occur for branes at a generic threefold singularity, for which the associated quiver has Lorentzian signature. We here study sequences of Seiberg dualities on branes at the C_3/Z_3 orbifold singularity. We use the naive beta functions to define an (unphysical) scale along the cascade. We determine, as a function of initial conditions, the scale of the wall as well as the critical exponent governing the approach to it. The position of the wall is piecewise linear, while the exponent appears to be constant. We comment on the possible implications of these results for physical walls.
