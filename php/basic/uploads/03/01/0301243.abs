Title: On geometric equations and duality for free higher spins
Authors: Xavier Bekaert and Nicolas Boulanger
Abstract: We provide a general scheme for dualizing higher-spin gauge fields in arbitrary irreducible representations of GL(D,R). We also give a recipe for constructing Fronsdal-like field equations and Lagrangians for such exotic fields.
