Title: Vacuum stress around a topological defect
Authors: V. A. De Lorenci and E. S. Moreira, Jr.
Abstract: We show that a dispiration (a disclination plus a screw dislocation) polarizes the vacuum of a scalar field giving rise to an energy momentum tensor which, as seen from a local inertial frame, presents non vanishing off-diagonal components. The results may have applications in cosmology (chiral cosmic strings) and condensed matter physics (materials with linear defects).
