Title: Rolling down to D-brane and tachyon matter
Authors: Akira Ishida and Shozo Uehara
Abstract: We investigate the spatially inhomogeneous decay of an unstable D-brane and construct an asymptotic solution which describes a codimension one D-brane and the tachyon matter in boundary string field theory. In this solution, the tachyon matter exists around the lower-dimensional D-brane.
