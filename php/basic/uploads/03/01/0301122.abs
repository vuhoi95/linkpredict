Abstract: We study the classical stability of a class of S-brane geometries having cosmological horizons. By considering the perturbations of the metric in these geometries we establish that their horizons are unstable in the sense that an observer trying to cross the horizon experiences an infinite flux of radiation at the instant of crossing. The backreaction of this radiation is likely to convert the horizons into curvature singularities, similar to the instability of the internal Cauchy horizon of the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. We also compute the particle production by the time-dependent fields in the future regions of these geometries, and find that the spectrum of produced particles is thermal, with temperature coinciding with the Hawking temperature computed by euclideanizing the metric in the static region. Possible implications of these results are discussed.
