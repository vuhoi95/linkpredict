Title: Stability of six-dimensional hyperstring braneworlds
Authors: Christophe Ringeval and Patrick Peter and Jean-Philippe Uzan
Abstract: We study a six-dimensional braneworld model with infinite warped extra dimensions in the case where the four-dimensional brane is described by a topological vortex of a U(1) symmetry-breaking Abelian Higgs model in presence of a negative cosmological constant. A detailed analysis of the microscopic parameters leading to a finite volume space-time in the extra dimensions is numerically performed. As previously shown, we find that a fine-tuning is required to avoid any kind of singularity on the brane. We then discuss the stability of the vortex by investigating the scalar part of the gauge-invariant perturbations around this fine-tuned configuration. It is found that the hyperstring forming Higgs and gauge fields, as well as the background metric warp factors, cannot be perturbed at all, whereas transverse modes can be considered stable. The warped space-time structure that is imposed around the vortex thus appears severely constrained and cannot generically support nonempty universe models. The genericness of our conclusions is discussed; this will shed some light on the possibility of describing our space-time as a general six-dimensional warped braneworld.
