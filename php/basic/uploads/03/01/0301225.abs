Title: Supersymmetry on AdS3 and AdS4
Authors: D. G. C. McKeon and C. Schubert
Abstract: We consider a supersymmetric extension of the algebra associated with three and four dimensional Anti de Sitter space. A representation of the supersymmetry operators in superspace is given. Supersymmetry invariant models are constructed for the superspace associated with AdS3.
