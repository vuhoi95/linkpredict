Title: 3D N=2 massive super Yang-Mills and membranes/D2-branes in a curved  background
Authors: Seungjoon Hyun and Jeong-Hyuck Park and Sang-Heon Yi
Abstract: We present a three dimensional novel massive N=2 super Yang-Mills action as a low energy effective worldvolume description of the D2-branes on a pp-wave. The action contains the Myers term, mass terms for three Higgs, and terms mixing the electric fields with other two Higgs. We derive the action in three different ways, from the M-theory matrix model, from the supermembrane action, and from the Dirac-Born-Infeld action. We verify the consistent mutual agreement and comment how each approach is complementary to another. In particular, we give the eleven dimensional geometric interpretation of the vacua in the worldvolume theory as the membranes tilted to the eleventh direction with the giant gravitons around.
