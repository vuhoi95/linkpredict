Title: Weak decay of swirling protons and other processes
Authors: George E. A. Matsas and Daniel A. T. Vanzella
Abstract: We investigate the weak-interaction emission of spin-1/2 fermions from decaying (and non-decaying) particles endowed with uniform circular motion. The decay of swirling protons and the neutrino- antineutrino emission from circularly moving electrons are analyzed in some detail. The relevance of our results to astrophysics is commented.
