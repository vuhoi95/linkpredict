Title: On the property of Cachazo-Intriligator-Vafa prepotential at the  extremum of the superpotential
Authors: A. Dymarsky and V. Pestun
Abstract: We consider CIV-DV prepotential F for N=1 SU(n) SYM theory at the extremum of the effective superpotential and prove the relation $2F-S dF/dS = - 2 u_2 Lambda^2n /(n^2-1)$
