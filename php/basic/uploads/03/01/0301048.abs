Title: Deconstruction, Lattice Supersymmetry, Anomalies and Branes
Authors: Joel Giedt and Erich Poppitz and Moshe Rozali
Abstract: We study the realization of anomalous Ward identities in deconstructed (latticized) supersymmetric theories. In a deconstructed four-dimensional theory with N=2 supersymmetry, we show that the chiral symmetries only appear in the infrared and that the anomaly is reproduced in the usual framework of lattice perturbation theory with Wilson fermions. We then realize the theory on the world-volume of fractional D-branes on an orbifold. In this brane realization, we show how deconstructed theory anomalies can be computed via classical supergravity. Our methods and observations are more generally applicable to deconstructed/latticized supersymmetric theories in various dimensions.
