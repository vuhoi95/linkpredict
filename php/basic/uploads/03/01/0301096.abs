Title: Complete BFT Embedding of Massive Theory with One- and Two-form Gauge  Fields
Authors: Seung-Kook Kim and Yong-Wan Kim and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: We study the constraint structure of the topologically massive theory with one- and two-form fields in the framework of Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin embedding procedure. Through this analysis we obtain a new type of Wess-Jumino action with novel symmetry, which is originated from the topological coupling term, as well as the St\"uckelberg action related to the explicit gauge breaking mass terms from the original theory.
