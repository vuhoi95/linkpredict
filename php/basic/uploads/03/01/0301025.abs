Title: Supersymetry on the Noncommutative Lattice
Authors: Jun Nishimura and Soo-Jong Rey and Fumihiko Sugino
Abstract: Built upon the proposal of Kaplan et.al. [hep-lat/0206109], we construct noncommutative lattice gauge theory with manifest supersymmetry. We show that such theory is naturally implementable via orbifold conditions generalizing those used by Kaplan {\sl et.al.} We present the prescription in detail and illustrate it for noncommutative gauge theories latticized partially in two dimensions. We point out a deformation freedom in the defining theory by a complex-parameter, reminiscent of discrete torsion in string theory. We show that, in the continuum limit, the supersymmetry is enhanced only at a particular value of the deformation parameter, determined solely by the size of the noncommutativity.
