Title: Semiclassical decay of strings with maximum angular momentum
Authors: Roberto Iengo and Jorge G. Russo
Abstract: We study the classical breaking of a highly excited (closed or open) string state on the leading Regge trajectory, represented by a rotating soliton solution, and we find the resulting solutions for the outgoing two pieces, describing two specific excited string states. This classical picture reproduces very accurately the precise analytical relation of the masses $M_1$ and $M_2$ of the decay products found in a previous quantum computation. The decay rate is naturally described in terms of a semiclassical formula. We also point out some interesting features of the evolution after the splitting process.
