Title: A space-time approach to multigluon computations in QCD: An application  to effective action terms
Authors: A. I. Karanikas and C. N. Ktorides
Abstract: The applicability of the space-time formulation of the gluonic sector of QCD in terms of the Polyakov worldline path integral, via the use of the background field gauge fixing method, is extended to multi-gluon loop configurations. Relevant master formulas are derived for the computation of effective action terms.
