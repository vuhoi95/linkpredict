Title: Finite Temperature effects on the Induced Chern-Simons term in  noncommutative geometry
Authors: B. Chandrasekhar and Prasanta K. Panigrahi
Abstract: The one-loop contribution to vacuum polarization is calculated for the adjoint fermions in three dimensional noncommutative spaces, both at zero and finite temperature. At zero temperature, we confirm a previously found result for the parity odd part and subsequently analyze the even parity part, which exhibits UV/IR mixing. We discuss in detail, two regimes of the high temperature behavior of the parity odd part. When the thermal wavelength is much smaller, as compared to the noncommutativity scale, we find an interesting Fermi-Bose transmutation in the nonplanar part.
