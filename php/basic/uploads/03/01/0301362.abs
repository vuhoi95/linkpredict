Title: On algebraic supergroups, coadjoint orbits and their deformations
Authors: R. Fioresi and M. A. Lledo
Abstract: In this paper we study algebraic supergroups and their coadjoint orbits as affine algebraic supervarieties. We find an algebraic deformation quantization of them that can be related to the fuzzy spaces of non commutative geometry.
