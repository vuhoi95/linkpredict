Title: Lagrangian in quantum mechanics is a connection one-form
Authors: Pankaj Sharan and Pravabati Chingangbam
Abstract: We recast Dirac's Lagrangian in quantum mechanics in the language of vector bundles and show that the action is an operator-valued connection one-form. Phases associated with change of frames of reference are seen to be total differentials in the transformation of the action. The relativistic case is discussed and we show that it gives the correct phase in the non-relativistic limit for uniform acceleration.
