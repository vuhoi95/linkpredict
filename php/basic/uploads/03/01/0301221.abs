Title: An overview of branes in the plane wave background
Authors: Kostas Skenderis and Marika Taylor
Abstract: We give an overview of D-branes in the maximally supersymmetric plane wave background of IIB supergravity. We start by reviewing the results of the probe analysis. We then present the open string analysis and show how certain spacetime symmetries are restored using worldsheet symmetries. We discuss the construction of these branes as boundary states and summarize what is known about the dual gauge theory description.
