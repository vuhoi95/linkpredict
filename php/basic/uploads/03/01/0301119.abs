Abstract: The quasi-isotropic inhomogeneous solution of the Einstein equations near a cosmological singularity in the form of a series expansion in the synchronous system of reference, first found by Lifshitz and Khalatnikov in 1960, is generalized to the case of a two-fluid cosmological model. This solution describes non-decreasing modes of adiabatic and isocurvature scalar perturbations and gravitational waves in the regime when deviations of a space-time metric from the homogeneous isotropic Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) background are large while locally measurable quantities like Riemann tensor components are still close to their FRW values. The general structure of the perturbation series is presented and the first coefficients of the series expansion for the metric tensor and the fluid energy densities and velocities are calculated explicitly.
