Title: Stabilization of the Yang-Mills chaos in non-Abelian Born-Infeld theory
Authors: D. V. Gal'tsov and V. V. Dyadichev
Abstract: We investigate dynamics of the homogeneous time-dependent SU(2) Yang-Mills fields governed by the non-Abelian Born-Infeld lagrangian which arises in superstring theory as a result of summation of all orders in the string slope parameter $\alpha'$. It is shown that generically the Born-Infeld dynamics is less chaotic than that in the ordinary Yang-Mills theory, and at high enough field strength the Yang-Mills chaos is stabilized. More generally, a smothering effect of the string non-locality on behavior of classical fields is conjectured.
