Title: Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz for boundary sine-Gordon model
Authors: Taejun Lee and Chaiho Rim
Abstract: (R-channel) TBA is elaborated to find the effective central charge dependence on the boundary parameters for the massless boundary sine-Gordon model with the coupling constant $(8\pi) /\beta^2 = 1+ \lambda $ with $\lambda$ a positive integer. Numerical analysis of the massless boundary TBA demonstrates that at an appropriate boundary parameter range (cusp point) there exists a singularity crossing phenomena and this effect should be included in TBA to have the right behavior of the effective central charge.
