Title: Supersymmetric and Kappa-invariant Coincident D0-Branes
Authors: Sudhakar Panda and Dmitri Sorokin
Abstract: We propose a generic supersymmetric and kappa-invariant action for describing coincident D0-branes with non-abelian matter fields on their worldline. The action is shown to be in agreement with the Matrix Theory limit of the ND0-brane effective action.
