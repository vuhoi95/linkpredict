Title: A note on the triviality of kappa-deformations of gravity
Authors: D. Grumiller and W. Kummer and D. V. Vassilevich
Abstract: Some simple observations concerning certain kappa-deformations in the framework of 2D dilaton gravity formulated as Poisson-sigma models are discussed, and the question of (non-)triviality is addressed.
