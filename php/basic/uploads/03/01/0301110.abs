Title: Radiation from accelerated black holes in de Sitter universe
Authors: Pavel Krtous and Jiri Podolsky
Abstract: Radiative properties of gravitational and electromagnetic fields generated by uniformly accelerated charged black holes in asymptotically de Sitter spacetime are studied by analyzing the C-metric exact solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations with a positive cosmological constant. Its global structure and physical properties are thoroughly discussed. We explicitly find and describe the specific pattern of radiation which exhibits the dependence of the fields on a null direction along which the (spacelike) conformal infinity is approached. This directional characteristic of radiation supplements the peeling behavior of the fields near the infinity. The interpretation of the solution is achieved by means of various coordinate systems, and suitable tetrads. Relation to the Robinson-Trautman framework is also presented.
