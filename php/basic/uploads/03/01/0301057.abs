Title: Fermionic characters for graded parafermions
Authors: L. Bégin and J. -F. Fortin and P. Jacob and P. Mathieu
Abstract: Fermionic-type character formulae are presented for charged irreduciblemodules of the graded parafermionic conformal field theory associated to the coset $osp(1,2)_k/u(1)$. This is obtained by counting the weakly ordered `partitions' subject to the graded $Z_k$ exclusion principle. The bosonic form of the characters is also presented.
