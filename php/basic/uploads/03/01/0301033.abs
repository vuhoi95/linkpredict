Title: Basic Twist Quantization of osp(1|2) and kappa-- Deformation of D=1  Superconformal Mechanics
Authors: A. Borowiec and J. Lukierski and V. N. Tolstoy
Abstract: The twisting function describing a nonstandard (super-Jordanian) quantum deformation of $osp(1|2)$ is given in explicite closed form. The quantum coproducts and universal R-matrix are presented. The non-uniqueness of the twisting function as well as two real forms of the deformed $osp(1|2)$ superalgebras are considered. One real quantum $osp(1|2)$ superalgebra is interpreted as describing the $\kappa$-deformation of D=1, N=1 superconformal algebra, which can be applied as a symmetry algebra of N=1 superconformal mechanics.
