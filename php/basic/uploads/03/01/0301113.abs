Title: Peierls Brackets in Field Theory
Authors: Giuseppe Bimonte and Giampiero Esposito and Giuseppe Marmo and Cosimo Stornaiolo
Abstract: Peierls brackets are part of the space-time approach to quantum field theory, and provide a Poisson bracket which, being defined for pairs of observables which are group invariant, is group invariant by construction. It is therefore well suited for combining the use of Poisson brackets and the full diffeomorphism group in general relativity. The present paper provides an introduction to the topic, with applications to gauge field theory.
