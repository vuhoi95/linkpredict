Title: Cosmology of Rolling Tachyon
Authors: Chanju Kim and Hang Bae Kim and Yoonbai Kim and O-Kab Kwon
Abstract: We study dynamics of rolling tachyon and Abelian gauge field on unstable D-branes, of which effective action is given by Born-Infeld type nonlocal action. Possible cosmological evolutions are also discussed. In the Einstein frame of string cosmology, every expanding flat universe is proven to be decelerating.
