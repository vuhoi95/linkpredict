Title: Gauge theory solitons on noncommutative cylinder
Authors: S. V. Demidov and S. L. Dubovsky and V. A. Rubakov and S. M. Sibiryakov
Abstract: We generalize to noncommutative cylinder the solution generation technique, originally suggested for gauge theories on noncommutative plane. For this purpose we construct partial isometry operators and complete set of orthogonal projectors in the algebra of the cylinder, and an isomorphism between the free module and its direct sum with the Fock module on the cylinder. We construct explicitly the gauge theory soliton and evaluate the spectrum of perturbations about this soliton.
