Title: Almost-zero-energy Eigenvalues of Some Broken Supersymmetric Systems
Authors: Min-Young Choi and Choonkyu Lee
Abstract: For a quantum mechanical system with broken supersymmetry, we present a simple method of determining the ground state when the corresponding energy eigenvalue is sufficiently small. A concise formula is derived for the approximate ground state energy in an associated, well-separated, asymmetric double-well-type potential. Our discussion is also relevant for the analysis of the fermion bound state in the kink-antikink scalar background.
