Title: Quasinormal modes of the near extremal Schwarzschild-de Sitter black  hole
Authors: Vitor Cardoso and Jose' P. S. Lemos
Abstract: We present an exact expression for the quasinormal modes of scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations of a near extremal Scwarzschild-de Sitter black hole and we show why a previous approximation holds exactly in this near extremal regime. In particular, our results give the asymptotic behavior of the quasinormal frequencies for highly damped modes, which as recently attracted much attention due to the proposed identification of its real part with the Barbero-Immirzi parameter.
