Title: Black Hole Entropy from Spin One Punctures
Authors: Romesh K. Kaul and S. Kalyana Rama
Abstract: Recent suggestion, that the emission of a quantum of energy corresponding to the asymptotic value of quasinormal modes of a Schwarzschild black hole should be associated with the loss of spin one punctures from the black hole horizon, fixes the Immirzi parameter to a definite value. We show that saturating the horizon with spin one punctures reproduces the earlier formula for the black hole entropy, including the $ln (area)$ correction with definite coefficient (- 3/2) for large area.
