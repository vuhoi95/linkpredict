Title: Kaluza-Klein Monopole in AdS Spacetime
Authors: Vakif K. Onemli and Bayram Tekin
Abstract: We construct analogs of the flat space Kaluza-Klein (KK) monopoles in locally Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spaces for $D \ge 5+1$. We show that, unlike the flat space KK monopole, there is no five dimensional static KK monopole in AdS that smoothly reduces to the flat space one as the cosmological constant goes to zero. Thus, one needs at least two extra dimensions, one of which is compact, to get a static KK monopole in cosmological backgrounds.
