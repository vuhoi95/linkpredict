Title: On the SuperConformal Quantum Mechanics in the Nonlinear Realizations  Approach
Authors: V. P. Akulov and Oktay Cebecioglu and A. Pashnev
Abstract: In the framework of nonlinear realizations we rederive the action of the N=2 SuperConformal Quantum Mechanics (SCQM). We propose also the WZNW -- like construction of the interaction term in the lagrangian with the help of Cartan's Omega forms.
