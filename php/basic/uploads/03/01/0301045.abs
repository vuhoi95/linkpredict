Title: Half-monopoles and half-vortices in the Yang-Mills theory
Authors: E. Harikumar and Indrajit Mitra and H. S. Sharatchandra
Abstract: It is demonstrated that there are smooth Yang-Mills potentials which correspond to monopoles and vortices of one-half winding number. They are the generic configurations, in contrast to the integral winding number configurations like the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole.
