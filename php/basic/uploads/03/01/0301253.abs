Title: An example of localized D-branes solution on PP-wave backgrounds
Authors: L. F. Alday and M. Cirafici
Abstract: In this note we provide an explicit example of type IIB supersymmetric D3-branes solution on a pp-wave like background, consisting in the product of an eight-dimensional pp-wave times a two-dimensional flat space. An interesting property of our solution is the fully localization of the D3-branes (i.e. the solution depends on all the transverse coordinates). Then we show the generalization to other Dp-branes and to the D1/D5 system.
