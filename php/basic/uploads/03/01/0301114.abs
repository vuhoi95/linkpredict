Title: q-Deformed Kink Solutions
Authors: A. F. de Lima and R. de Lima Rodrigues
Abstract: The q-deformed kink of the $\lambda\phi^4-$model is obtained via the normalisable ground state eigenfunction of a fluctuation operator associated with the q-deformed hyperbolic functions. From such a bosonic zero-mode the q-deformed potential in 1+1 dimensions is found, and we show that the q-deformed kink solution is a kink displaced away from the origin.
