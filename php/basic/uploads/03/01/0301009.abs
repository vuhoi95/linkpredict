Title: Group classification of nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equations
Authors: Anatoly G. Nikitin and Roman O. Popovych
Abstract: The authors suggest a new powerful tool for solving group classification problems, that is applied to obtaining the complete group classification in the class of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations of the form $i\psi_t+\Delta\psi+F(\psi,\psi^*)=0$.
