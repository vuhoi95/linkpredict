Title: The Tachyon Inflationary Models with Exact Mode Functions
Authors: Xin-zhou Li and Xiang-hua Zhai
Abstract: We show two analytical solutions of the tachyon inflation for which the spectrum of curvature (density) perturbations can be calculated exactly to linear order, ignoring both gravity and the self-interactions of the tachyon field . The main feature of these solutions is that the spectral indices are independent with scale.
