Title: SYM Description of PP-wave String Interactions: Singlet Sector and  Arbitrary Impurities
Authors: Jaume Gomis and Sanefumi Moriyama and Jongwon Park
Abstract: We study string interactions among string states with arbitrary impurities in the Type IIB plane wave background using string field theory. We reproduce all string amplitudes from gauge theory by computing matrix elements of the dilatation operator in a previously proposed basis of states. A direct correspondence is found between the string field theory and gauge theory Feynman diagrams.
