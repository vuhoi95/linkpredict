Title: Asymptotic symmetries in 3d gravity with torsion
Authors: M. Blagojevic and M. Vasilic
Abstract: We study the nature of asymptotic symmetries in topological 3d gravity with torsion. After introducing the concept of asymptotically anti-de Sitter configuration, we find that the canonical realization of the asymptotic symmetry is characterized by the Virasoro algebra with classical central charge, the value of which is the same as in general relativity: c=3l/2G.
