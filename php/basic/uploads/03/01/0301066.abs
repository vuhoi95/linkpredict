Title: Harmonic oscillator on noncommutative spaces
Authors: I. Dadic and L. Jonke and S. Meljanac
Abstract: A generalized harmonic oscillator on noncommutative spaces is considered. Dynamical symmetries and physical equivalence of noncommutative systems with the same energy spectrum are investigated and discussed. General solutions of three-dimensional noncommutative harmonic oscillator are found and classified according to dynamical symmetries. We have found conditions under which three-dimensional noncommutative harmonic oscillator can be represented by ordinary, isotropic harmonic oscillator in effective magnetic field.
