Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional model of W3-gravity within Lagrangian quantization methods for general gauge theories. We use the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism to study the arbitrariness in the realization of the gauge algebra. We obtain a one-parametric non-analytic extension of the gauge algebra, and a corresponding solution of the classical master equation, related via an anticanonical transformation to a solution corresponding to an analytic realization. We investigate the possibility of closed solutions of the classical master equation in the Sp(2)-covariant formalism and show that such solutions do not exist in the approximation up to the third order in ghost and auxiliary fields.
