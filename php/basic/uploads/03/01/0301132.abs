Title: Schwinger Pair Production in Electric and Magnetic Fields
Authors: Sang Pyo Kim and Don N. Page
Abstract: Charged particles in static electric and magnetic fields have Landau levels and tunneling states from the vacuum. Using the instanton method of Phys. Rev. D 65, 105002 (2002), we obtain the formulae for the pair-production rate in spinor and scalar QED, which sum over all Landau levels and recover exactly the well-known results. The pair-production rates are calculated for an electric field of finite extent, with a constant magnetic field also present, and are shown to have boundary effects.
