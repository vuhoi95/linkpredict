Title: Superluminal pions in a hadronic fluid
Authors: Neven Bilic and Hrvoje Nikolic
Abstract: We study the propagation of pions at finite temperature and finite chemical potential in the framework of the linear sigma model with 2 quark flavors and $N_c$ colors. The velocity of massless pions in general differs from that of light. One-loop calculations show that in the chiral symmetry broken phase pions, under certain conditions, propagate faster than light.
