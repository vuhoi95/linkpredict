Title: Interaction of a TeV Scale Black Hole with the Quark-Gluon Plasma at LHC
Authors: Andrew Chamblin and Fred Cooper and Gouranga C. Nayak
Abstract: If the fundamental Planck scale is near a TeV, then parton collisions with high enough center-of-mass energy should produce black holes. The production rate for such black holes has been extensively studied for the case of a proton-proton collision at \sqrt s = 14 TeV and for a lead-lead collision at \sqrt s = 5.5 TeV at LHC. As the parton energy density is much higher at lead-lead collisions than in pp collisions at LHC, one natural question is whether the produced black holes will be able to absorb the partons formed in the lead-lead collisions and eventually `eat' the quark-gluon plasma formed at LHC. In this paper, we make a quantitative analysis of this possibility and find that since the energy density of partons formed in lead-lead collisions at LHC is about 500 GeV/fm^3, the rate of absorption for one of these black holes is much smaller than the rate of evaporation. Hence, we argue that black holes formed in such collisions will decay very quickly, and will not absorb very many nearby partons. More precisely, we show that for the black hole mass to increase via parton absorption at the LHC the typical energy density of quarks and gluons should be of the order of 10^{10} GeV/fm^3. As LHC will not be able to produce such a high energy density partonic system, the black hole will not be able to absorb a sufficient number of nearby partons before it decays. The typical life time of the black hole formed at LHC is found to be a small fraction of a fm/c.
