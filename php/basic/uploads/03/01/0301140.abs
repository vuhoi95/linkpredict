Title: Cosmological Aspects of Rolling Tachyon
Authors: M. Sami and Pravabati Chingangbam and Tabish Qureshi
Abstract: We examine the possibility of rolling tachyon to play the dual roll of inflaton at early epochs and dark matter at late times. We argue that enough inflation can be generated with the rolling tachyon either by invoking the large number of branes or brane world assisted inflation. However, reheating is problematic in this model.
