Title: Effective Superpotentials for SO/Sp with Flavor from Matrix Models
Authors: Yutaka Ookouchi and Yoshiyuki Watabiki
Abstract: We study matrix models related to $SO/Sp$ gauge theories with flavors. We give the effective superpotentials for gauge theories with arbitrary tree level superpotential up to first instanton level. For quartic tree level superpotential we obtained exact one-cut solution. We also derive Seiberg-Witten curve for these gauge theories from matrix model argument.
