Title: Quantum Theory of Noncommutative Fields
Authors: J. M. Carmona and J. L. Cortes and J. Gamboa and F. Mendez
Abstract: Generalizing the noncommutative harmonic oscillator construction, we propose a new extension of quantum field theory based on the concept of "noncommutative fields". Our description permits to break the usual particle-antiparticle degeneracy at the dispersion relation level and introduces naturally an ultraviolet and an infrared cutoff. Phenomenological bounds for these new energy scales are given.
