Title: Implications of area scaling of quantum fluctuations
Authors: Ram Brustein and David H. Oaknin and Amos Yarom
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations of a certain class of bulk operators defined in spatial sub-volumes of Minkowski space-time, have an unexpected area scaling property. We wish to present evidence that such area scaling may be ascribed to a boundary theory. We first highlight the implications of area scaling with two examples in which the boundary area of the spatial regions is not monotonous with their volume. Next, we prove that the covariance of two operators that are restricted to two different regions in Minkowski space scales linearly with their mutual boundary area. Finally, we present an example which demonstrates why this implies an underlying boundary theory.
