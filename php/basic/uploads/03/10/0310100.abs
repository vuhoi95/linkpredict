Authors: F. S. Nogueira and J. Smiseth and E. Smoergrav and A. Sudbo
Abstract: Compact abelian gauge theories in $d=2+1$ dimensions arise often as an effective field-theoretic description of models of quantum insulators. In this paper we review some recent results about the compact abelian Higgs model in $d=2+1$ in that context.
