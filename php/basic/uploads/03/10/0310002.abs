Title: Eigenvalue spacings for regular graphs
Authors: D. Jakobson and S. D. Miller and I. Rivin and Z. Rudnick
Abstract: We carry out a numerical study of fluctuations in the spectrum of regular graphs. Our experiments indicate that the level spacing distribution of a generic k-regular graph approaches that of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble of random matrix theory as we increase the number of vertices. A review of the basic facts on graphs and their spectra is included.
