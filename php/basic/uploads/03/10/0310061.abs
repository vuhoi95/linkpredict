Title: Planar Gravitational Corrections For Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
Authors: R. Dijkgraaf and M. T. Grisaru and H. Ooguri and C. Vafa and D. Zanon
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the contribution of planar diagrams to gravitational F-terms for N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories admitting a large N description. We show how the planar diagrams lead to a universal contribution at the extremum of the glueball superpotential, leaving only the genus one contributions, as was previously conjectured. We also discuss the physical meaning of gravitational F-terms.
