Title: Critical Phenomena in Continuous Dimension
Authors: H. Ballhausen and J. Berges and C. Wetterich
Abstract: We present a calculation of critical phenomena directly in continuous dimension d employing an exact renormalization group equation for the effective average action. For an Ising-type scalar field theory we calculate the critical exponents nu(d) and eta(d) both from a lowest--order and a complete first--order derivative expansion of the effective average action. In particular, this can be used to study critical behavior as a function of dimensionality at fixed temperature.
