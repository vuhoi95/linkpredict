Title: Universal R operator with Jordanian deformation of conformal symmetry
Authors: S. Derkachov and D. Karakhanyan and R. Kirschner
Abstract: The Jordanian deformation of $sl(2)$ bi-algebra structure is studied in view of physical applications to breaking of conformal symmetry in the high energy asymptotics of scattering. Representations are formulated in terms of polynomials, generators in terms of differential operators. The deformed $R$ operator with generic representations is analyzed in spectral and integral forms.
