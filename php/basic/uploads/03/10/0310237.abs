Title: G_2 invariant 7D Euclidean super Yang-Mills theory as a  higher-dimensional analogue of the 3D super-BF theory
Authors: D. M"ulsch and B. GEyer
Abstract: A formulation of the N_T=1, D=8 Euclidean super Yang-Mills theory with generalized self-duality and reduced Spin(7)-invariance is given which avoids the peculiar extra constraints of Nishino and Rajpoot, hep-th/0210132. Its reduction to 7 dimensions leads to the G_2-invariant N_T=2, D=7 super Yang-Mills theory which may be regarded as a higher-dimensional analogue of the N=2, D=3 super-BF theory. When reducing further that G_2-invariant theory to 3 dimensions one gets the N_T=2 super-BF theory coupled to a spinorial hypermultiplet.
