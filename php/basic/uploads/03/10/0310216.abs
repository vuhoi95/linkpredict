Title: Phase Transition in Light-Front $Ï†^4_{1+1}$

Abstract: We reproduce Chang's duality condition in a regularized $\phi^4_{1+1}$ theory quantized on a light front. The regularization involves higher derivatives in the Lagrangian, renders the model finite in the ultraviolet, and does not require introduction of a finite size of the system. It is demonstrated that the light-front quantization is a natural way to treat systems with higher derivatives. The phase transition is related to the presence of tachyons in the regularized theory. Prospects for computing the critical coupling in this formulation are briefly discussed.
