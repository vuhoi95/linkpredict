Title: Superspace Gauge Fixing of Topological Yang-Mills Theories
Authors: Clisthenis P. Constantinidis and Olivier Piguet and Wesley Spalenza
Abstract: We revisit the construction of topological Yang-Mills theories of the Witten type with arbitrary space-time dimension and number of ``shift supersymmetry'' generators, using a superspace formalism. The super-BF structure of these theories is exploited in orderto determine their actions uniquely, up to the ambiguities due to the fixing of the Yang-Mills and BF gauge invariance. UV finiteness to all orders of perturbation theory is proved in a gauge of the Landau type.
