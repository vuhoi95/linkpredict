Title: Local Lagrangian for Exponentially Large Extra Dimensions
Authors: Michael J. May and Raman Sundrum
Abstract: We write an explicit local action for a large extra dimensions stabilization scenario due to Arkani-Hamed, Hall, Smith and Weiner (AHSW). Our action allows the AHSW proposal to be generalized to non-Poincare invariant configurations, supersymmetric extensions, quantum effective field theory, and cosmological scenarios. The central step in constructing the action is working in terms of the four form gauge field which is the "electric-magnetic" dual to the "magnetic" scalar of AHSW. The action is manifestly invariant under higher general coordinate invariance.
