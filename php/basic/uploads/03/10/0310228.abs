Title: D-branes of Covariant AdS Superstrings
Authors: Makoto Sakaguchi and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We consider D-branes of open superstrings in the AdS_5 x S^5 background. The possible configurations of D-branes preserving half of supersymmetries are classified by analyzing the kappa-invariance of an open superstring in a covariant manner. We also revisit the classification of D-branes in the pp-wave background. It is shown that Penrose limits of the possible D-branes in the AdS_5 x S^5 give all of the D-branes in the pp-wave. In addition, 1/4 supersymmetric D-string, which is related to the D-string preserving 8 dynamical supersymmetries in the pp-wave, is presented. We also discuss the relation between our branes and the AdS branes in a brane probe analysis.
