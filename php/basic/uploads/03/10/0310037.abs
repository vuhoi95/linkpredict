Title: On-shell symmetries
Authors: L. Fatibene and M. Ferraris and M. Francaviglia
Abstract: We define on-shell symmetries and characterize them for Lagrangian systems. The terms appearing in the variation of the Poincare'-Cartan form, which vanish because of field equations, are found to be strongly constrained if the space of solutions has to be preserved. The behaviour with respect to solution dragging is also investigated in order to discuss relations with the theory of internal symmetries of a PDE.
