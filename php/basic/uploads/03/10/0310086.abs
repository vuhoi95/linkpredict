Title: Supersymmetry breaking by Wilson lines in AdS$_5$
Authors: Jonathan Bagger and Michele Redi
Abstract: In the Randall-Sundrum compactification of AdS$_5$ with detuned brane tensions, supersymmetry can be spontaneously broken by a non-trivial Wilson line for the graviphoton. The supersymmetry breaking vanishes in the tuned limit. This effect is equivalent to supersymmetry breaking by Scherk-Schwarz boundary conditions.
