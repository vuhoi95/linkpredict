Title: Dark energy equation of state and anthropic selection
Authors: Jaume Garriga and Andrei Linde and Alexander Vilenkin
Abstract: We explore the possibility that the dark energy is due to a potential of a scalar field and that the magnitude and the slope of this potential in our part of the universe are largely determined by anthropic selection effects. We find that, in some models, the most probable values of the slope are very small, implying that the dark energy density stays constant to very high accuracy throughout cosmological evolution. In other models, however, the most probable values of the slope are such that the slow roll condition is only marginally satisfied, leading to a re-collapse of the local universe on a time-scale comparable to the lifetime of the sun. In the latter case, the effective equation of state varies appreciably with the redshift, leading to a number of testable predictions.
