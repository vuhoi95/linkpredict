Title: Subleading critical exponents from the renormalisation group
Authors: Daniel F. Litim and Lautaro Vergara
Abstract: We study exact renormalisation group equations for the 3d Ising universality class. At the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, symmetric and antisymmetric correction-to-scaling exponents are computed with high accuracy for an optimised cutoff to leading order in the derivative expansion. Further results are derived for other cutoffs including smooth, sharp and background field cutoffs. An estimate for higher order corrections is given as well. We establish that the leading antisymmetric corrections to scaling are strongly subleading compared to the leading symmetric ones.
