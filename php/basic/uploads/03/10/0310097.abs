Title: Linearizing N = 1 nonlinear supersymmetry with higher derivative terms  of a Nambu-Goldstone fermion
Authors: Kazunari Shima and Motomu Tsuda
Abstract: We investigate for N = 1 supersymmetry (SUSY) the relation between a scalar supermultiplet of linear SUSY and a nonlinear (NL) SUSY model including apparently pathological higher derivaive terms of a Nambu-Goldstone (N-G) fermion besides the Volkov-Akulov (V-A) action. SUSY invariant relations with higher derivative terms of the N-G fermion, which connect the linear and NL SUSY models, are constructed at leading orders by heuristic arguments. We discuss a higher derivative action of the N-G fermion in the NL SUSY model, which apparently includes a (Weyl) ghost field. By using this relation, we also explicitly prove an equivalence between the standard NL SUSY V-A model and our NL SUSY model with the pathological higher derivatives as an example with respect to the universality of NL SUSY actions with the N-G fermion.
