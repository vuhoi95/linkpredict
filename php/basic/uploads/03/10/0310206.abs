Title: Suppressing CMB Quadrupole with a Bounce from Contracting Phase to  Inflation
Authors: Yun-Song Piao and Bo Feng and Xinmin Zhang
Abstract: Recent released WMAP data show a low value of quadrupole in the CMB temperature fluctuations, which confirms the early observations by COBE. In this paper, a scenario, in which a contracting phase is followed by an inflationary phase, is constructed. We calculate the perturbation spectrum and show that this scenario can provide a reasonable explanation for lower CMB anisotropies on large angular scales.
