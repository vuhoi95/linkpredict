Title: Chronological structure of a Goedel type universe with negative  cosmological constant
Authors: Klaus Behrndt and Markus PÃ¶ssel
Abstract: We show that the Goedel solution of five-dimensional gauged supergravity contains either closed time-like curves through every space-time point or none at all, dependent on the rotational parameter. In addition, we present a deformation of that solution with a parameter kappa which characterizes the symmetry of four-dimensional base space: for kappa = 1, 0, -1 it has spherical, flat and hyperbolic symmetry, respectively. Also investigated are the causal properties of the lifted solution in 10 dimensions.
