Title: Localisation of Fermions to brane: Codimension $d \geq 2$
Authors: W. Nahm and D. H. Tchrakian
Abstract: We investigate $4+d$ dimensional fermionic models in which the system in codimension-$d$ supports a topologically stable solution, and in which the fermion may be localised to the brane, with power law in 'instanton' backgrounds and exponentially in 'soliton' backgrounds. When the fermions are isoscalars, the mechanism fails, while for isospinor fermions it is successful. As backgrounds we consider instantons of Yang--Mills and sigma models in even codimensions, solitons of sigma models in odd codimensions, as well as solitons of Higgs and Goldstone models in all codimensions.
