Title: Gauge theories on the kappa-Minkowski spacetime
Authors: Marija Dimitrijevic and Frank Meyer and Lutz MÃ¶ller and Julius Wess
Abstract: This study of gauge field theories on kappa-deformed Minkowski spacetime extends previous work on field theories on this example of a noncommutative spacetime. We construct deformed gauge theories for arbitrary compact Lie groups using the concept of enveloping algebra-valued gauge transformations and the Seiberg-Witten formalism. Derivative-valued gauge fields lead to field strength tensors as the sum of curvature- and torsion-like terms. We construct the Lagrangians explicitly to first order in the deformation parameter. This is the first example of a gauge theory that possesses a deformed Lorentz covariance.
