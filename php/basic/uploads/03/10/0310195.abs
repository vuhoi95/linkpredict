Title: Two-Dimensional Unoriented Strings And Matrix Models
Authors: Jaume Gomis and Anton Kapustin
Abstract: We investigate unoriented strings and superstrings in two dimensions and their dual matrix quantum mechanics. Most of the models we study have a tachyon tadpole coming from the RP^2 worldsheet which needs to be cancelled by a renormalization of the worldsheet theory. We find evidence that the dual matrix models describe the renormalized theory. The singlet sector of the matrix models is integrable and can be formulated in terms of fermions moving in an external potential and interacting via the Calogero-Moser potential. We show that in the double-scaling limit the latter system exhibits particle-hole duality and interpret it in terms of the dual string theory. We also show that oriented string theories in two dimensions can be continuously deformed into unoriented ones by turning on non-local interactions on the worldsheet. We find two unoriented superstring models for which only oriented worldsheets contribute to the S-matrix. A simple explanation for this is found in the dual matrix model.
