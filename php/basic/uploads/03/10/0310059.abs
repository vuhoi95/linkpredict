Title: D-braneworld cosmology II: Higher order corrections
Authors: Tomoko Uesugi and Tetsuya Shiromizu and Takashi Torii and Keitaro Takahashi
Abstract: We investigate braneworld cosmology based on the D-brane initiated in our previous paper. The brane is described by a Born-Infeld action and the gauge field is contained. The higher order corrections of an inverse string tension will be addressed. The results obtained by the truncated argument are altered by the higher order corrections. The equation of state of the gauge field on the brane is radiation-like in low energy scales and almost dust-like fluid in high energy scales. Our model is, however, limited below a critical finite value of the energy density. For the description of full history of our universe the presence of a S-brane might be essential.
