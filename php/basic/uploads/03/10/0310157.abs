Title: Non-perturbative gauge superpotentials from supergravity
Authors: Emiliano Imeroni and Alberto Lerda
Abstract: We study U(N) SQCD with N_f <= N flavors of quarks and antiquarks by engineering it with a configuration of fractional D3-branes on a C^3 / Z_2 x Z_2 orbifold. In particular we show how the moduli space of the gauge theory naturally emerges from the classical geometry produced by the D3-branes, and how the non-perturbatively generated superpotential is recovered from geometrical data.
