Title: Monopole and Berry Phase in Momentum Space in Noncommutative Quantum  Mechanics
Authors: Alain Berard and Herve Mohrbach
Abstract: To build genuine generators of the rotations group in noncommutative quantum mechanics, we show that it is necessary to extend the noncommutative parameter $\theta $ to a field operator, which one proves to be only momentum dependent. We find consequently that this field must be obligatorily a dual Dirac monopole in momentum space. Recent experiments in the context of the anomalous Hall effect provide for a monopole in the crystal momentum space. We suggest a connection between the noncommutative field and the Berry curvature in momentum space which is at the origine of the anomalous Hall effect.
