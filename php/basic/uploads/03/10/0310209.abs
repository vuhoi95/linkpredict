Title: Mixed symmetry gauge fields in a flat background
Authors: Xavier Bekaert and Nicolas Boulanger
Abstract: We present a list of all inequivalent bosonic covariant free particle wave equations in a flat spacetime of arbitrary dimension. The wave functions are assumed to have a finite number of components. We relate these wave equations to equivalent versions obtained following other approaches.
