Title: Charged Tensor Matter Fields and Lorentz Symmetry Violation via  Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
Authors: L. P. Colatto and A. L. A. Penna and W. C. Santos
Abstract: We consider a model with a charged vector field along with a Cremmer-Scherk-Kalb-Ramond (CSKR) matter field coupled to a U(1) gauge potential. We obtain a natural Lorentz symmetry violation due to the local U(1) spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism triggered by the imaginary part of the vector matter. The choice of the unitary gauge leads to the decoupling of the gauge-KR sector from the Higgs-KR sector. The excitation spectrum is carefully analyzed and the physical modes are identified. We propose an identification of the neutral massive spin-1 Higgs-like field with the massive Z' boson of the so-called mirror matter models.
