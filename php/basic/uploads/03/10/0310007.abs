Title: Green functions of the Dirac equation with magnetic-solenoid field
Authors: S. P. Gavrilov and D. M. Gitman and A. A. Smirnov
Abstract: Various Green functions of the Dirac equation with a magnetic-solenoid field (the superposition of the Aharonov-Bohm field and a collinear uniform magnetic field) are constructed and studied. The problem is considered in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions for the natural extension of the Dirac operator (the extension obtained from the solenoid regularization). Representations of the Green functions as proper time integrals are derived. The nonrelativistic limit is considered. For the sake of completeness the Green functions of the Klein-Gordon particles are constructed as well.
