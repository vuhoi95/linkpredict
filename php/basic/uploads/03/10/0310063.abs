Title: The group approach to AdS space propagators: A fast algorithm
Authors: Thorsten Leonhardt and Ruben Manvelyan and Werner Ruhl
Abstract: In this letter we show how the method of [4] for the calculation of two-point functions in d+1-dimensional AdS space can be simplified. This results in an algorithm for the evaluation of the two-point functions as linear combinations of Legendre functions of the second kind. This algorithm can be easily implemented on a computer. For the sake of illustration, we displayed the results for the case of symmetric traceless tensor fields with rank up to l=4.
