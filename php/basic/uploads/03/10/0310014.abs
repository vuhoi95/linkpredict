Title: Parton Model from Bi-local Solitonic Picture of the Baryon in  two-dimensions
Authors: V. John and G. S. Krishnaswami and S. G. Rajeev
Abstract: We study a previously introduced bi-local gauge invariant reformulation of two dimensional QCD, called 2d HadronDynamics. The baryon arises as a topological soliton in HadronDynamics. We derive an interacting parton model from the soliton model, thus reconciling these two seemingly different points of view. The valence quark model is obtained as a variational approximation to HadronDynamics. A succession of better approximations to the soliton picture are obtained. The next simplest case corresponds to a system of interacting valence, `sea' and anti-quarks. We also obtain this `embellished' parton model directly from the valence quark system through a unitary transformation. Using the solitonic point of view, we estimate the quark and anti-quark distributions of 2d QCD. Possible applications to Deep Inelastic Structure Functions are pointed out.
