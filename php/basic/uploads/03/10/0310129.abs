Title: New Results on Holographic Three-Point Functions
Authors: Massimo Bianchi and Wolfgang MÃ¼ck and Maurizio Prisco
Abstract: We exploit a gauge invariant approach for the analysis of the equations governing the dynamics of active scalar fluctuations coupled to the fluctuations of the metric along holographic RG flows. In the present approach, a second order ODE for the active scalar emerges rather simply and makes it possible to use the Green's function method to deal with (quadratic) interaction terms. We thus fill a gap for active scalar operators, whose three-point functions have been inaccessible so far, and derive a general, explicitly Bose symmetric formula thereof. As an application we compute the relevant three-point function along the GPPZ flow and extract the irreducible trilinear couplings of the corresponding superglueballs by amputating the external legs on-shell.
