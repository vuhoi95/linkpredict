Title: Supergravity Solutions for $AdS_3 \times S^3$ branes
Authors: Jason Kumar and Arvind Rajaraman
Abstract: We find a large class of supersymmetric solutions in the $AdS_3 \times S^3$ background with NS fluxes. This two-parameter family of solutions preserves 8 of the 16 supersymmetries of the background.
