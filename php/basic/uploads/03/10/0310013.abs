Title: Lorentz and Galilei Invariance on Lattices
Authors: Decio Levi and Piergiulio Tempesta and Pavel Winternitz
Abstract: We show that the algebraic aspects of Lie symmetries and generalized symmetries in nonrelativistic and relativistic quantum mechanics can be preserved in linear lattice theories. The mathematical tool for symmetry preserving discretizations on regular lattices is the umbral calculus.
