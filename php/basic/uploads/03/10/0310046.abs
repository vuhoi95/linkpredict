Title: Boundary Action of N=2 Super-Liouville Theory
Authors: Changrim Ahn and Masayoshi Yamamoto
Abstract: We derive a boundary action of N=2 super-Liouville theory which preserves both N=2 supersymmetry and conformal symmetry by imposing explicitly $T={\bar T}$ and $G={\bar G}$. The resulting boundary action shows a new duality symmetry.
