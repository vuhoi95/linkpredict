Title: Counter-example to conjectured SU(N) character asymptotics
Authors: T. Tate and S. Zelditch
Abstract: We give a counterexample to the large $N$ asymptotics of character values $\chi_R(U)$ of irreducible characters of SU(N) conjectured in papers of Gross-Matytsin and Kazakov-Wynter in 1995. Our counterexample is based on Kostant's calculation of values of SU(N) characters on Coxeter elements.
