Title: Adding a Myers Term to the IIB Matrix Model
Authors: Peter Austing and John F. Wheater
Abstract: We show that Yang-Mills matrix integrals remain convergent when a Myers term is added, and stay in the same topological class as the original model. It is possible to add a supersymmetric Myers term and this leaves the partition function invariant.
