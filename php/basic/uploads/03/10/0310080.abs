Title: The Rogers-Selberg recursions, the Gordon-Andrews identities and  intertwining operators
Authors: Stefano Capparelli and James Lepowsky and Antun Milas
Abstract: Using the theory of intertwining operators for vertex operator algebras we show that the graded dimensions of the principal subspaces associated to the standard modules for $\hat{\goth{sl}(2)}$ satisfy certain classical recursion formulas of Rogers and Selberg. These recursions were exploited by Andrews in connection with Gordon's generalization of the Rogers--Ramanujan identities and with Andrews' related identities. The present work generalizes the authors' previous work on intertwining operators and the Rogers--Ramanujan recursion.
