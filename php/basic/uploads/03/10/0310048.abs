Title: Nonsingular Increasing Gravitational Potential for the Brane in 6D
Authors: Merab Gogberashvili and Douglas Singleton
Abstract: We present a new (1+3)-brane solution to Einstein equations in (1+5)-space. As distinct from previous models this solution is free of singularities in the full 6-dimensional space-time. The gravitational potential transverse to the brane is an increasing (but not exponentially) function and asymptotically approaches a finite value. The solution localizes the zero modes of all kinds of matter fields and Newtonian gravity on the brane. An essential feature of the model is that different kind of matter fields have different localization radii.
