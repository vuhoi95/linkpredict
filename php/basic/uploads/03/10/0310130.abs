Title: Massless Localized Vector Field on a Wall in D=5 SQED with Tensor  Multiplets
Authors: Youichi Isozumi and Keisuke Ohashi and Norisuke Sakai
Abstract: Massless localized vector field is obtained in five-dimensional supersymmetric (SUSY) QED coupled to tensor multiplets as a half BPS solution. The four-dimensional gauge coupling is obtained as a topological charge. We also find all the (bosonic) massive modes exactly for a particular value of a parameter, demonstrating explicitly the existence of a mass gap. The four-dimensional Coulomb law is shown to hold for sources placed on the wall.
