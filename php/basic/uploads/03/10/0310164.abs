Title: Type I D-branes in an H-flux and twisted KO-theory
Authors: V. Mathai and M. K. Murray and D. Stevenson
Abstract: Witten has argued that charges of Type I D-branes in the presence of an H-flux, take values in twisted KO-theory. We begin with the study of real bundle gerbes and their holonomy. We then introduce the notion of real bundle gerbe KO-theory which we establish is a geometric realization of twisted KO-theory. We examine the relation with twisted K-theory, the Chern character and provide some examples. We conclude with some open problems.
