Title: Forms on vector bundles over compact hyperbolic manifolds and entropy  bounds
Authors: A. A. Bytsenko and V. S. Mendes and A. C. Tort
Abstract: We analyze gauge theories based on abelian $p-$forms in real compact hyperbolic manifolds. The explicit thermodynamic functions associated with skew--symmetric tensor fields are obtained via zeta--function regularization and the trace tensor kernel formula. Thermodynamic quantities in the high--temperature expansions are calculated and the entropy/energy ratios are established.
