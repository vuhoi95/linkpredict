Title: Giant Gravitons in type IIA PP-wave Background
Authors: Yi-Xin Chen and Jing Shao
Abstract: We examine giant gravitons with a worldvolume magnetic flux $q$ in type IIA pp-wave background and find that they can move away from the origin along $x^4$ direction in target space satisfying $Rx^4=-q$. This nontrivial relation can be regarded as a complementary relation of the giant graviton on IIA pp-wave and is shown to be connected to the spacetime uncertainty principle. The giant graviton is also investigated in a system of N D0-branes as a fuzzy sphere solution. It is observed that $x^4$ enters into the fuzzy algebra as a deformation parameter. Such a background dependent Myers effect guarantees that we again get the crucial relation of our giant graviton. In the paper, we also find a BIon configuration on the giant graviton in this background.
