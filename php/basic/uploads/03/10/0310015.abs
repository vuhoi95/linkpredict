Title: 4-point effective actions in open and closed superstring theory
Authors: Osvaldo Chandia and Ricardo Medina
Abstract: Recently the effective action for the 4-point functions in abelian open superstring theory has been derived, giving an explicit construction of the bosonic and fermionic terms of this infinite $\alpha'$ series. In the present work we generalize this result to the nonabelian case. We test our result, at ${\alpha'}^3$ and ${\alpha'}^4$ order, with several existing versions for these terms, finding agreement in most of the cases. We also apply these ideas to derive the effective action for the 4-point functions of the NS-NS sector of closed superstring theory, to all order in $\alpha'$.
