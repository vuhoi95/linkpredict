Title: More D-branes in plane wave spacetime
Authors: Rashmi R. Nayak and Kamal L. Panigrahi
Abstract: We present classical solutions of Dp-branes $(p \ge 5)$ in plane wave spacetime with nonconstant R-R 3-form flux. We also show the existence of a system of D3-branes in this background. We further analyze the supersymmetric properties of these branes by solving type II Killing spinor equations explicitly.
