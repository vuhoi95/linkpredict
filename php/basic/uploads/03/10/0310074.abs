Title: Strings on type IIB pp-wave backgrounds with interacting massive  theories on the worldsheet
Authors: Alin Tirziu and Paul Fendley
Abstract: We consider superstring theories on pp-wave backgrounds which result in an integrable ${\cal N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetric Landau-Ginzburg theory on the worldsheet. We obtain exact eigenvalues of the light-cone gauge superstring hamiltonian in the massive and interacting world-sheet theory with superpotential $Z^3-Z$. We find the modes of the supergravity part of the string spectrum, and their space-time interpretation. Because the system is effectively at strong coupling on the worldsheet, these modes are not in one-to-one correspondence with the usual type IIB supergravity modes in the $p_{-} \to 0$ limit. However, the above correspondence holds in the $\alpha'\to 0$ limit.
