Authors: Yves Brihaye and Betti Hartmann and Theodora Ioannidou and Wojtek J. Zakrzewski
Abstract: Spherically symmetric solutions of the SU(N) Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs system are constructed using the harmonic map ansatz. The problem reduces to solving a set of ordinary differential equations for the appropriate profile functions. In the SU(2) case, we recover the equations studied in great detail previously, while for the SU(N) (N > 2) case we find new solutions. In the SU(3) case we see that our expressions are the gravitating analogues of the solutions obtained through the SO(3) embedding into SU(2).
