Title: Exact Wall Solutions in 5-Dimensional SUSY QED at Finite Coupling
Authors: Youichi Isozumi and Keisuke Ohashi and Norisuke Sakai
Abstract: A series of exact BPS solutions are found for single and double domain walls in N=2 supersymmetric (SUSY) QED for finite gauge coupling constants. Vector fields are found to be massive, although it is localized on the wall. Massless modes can be assembled into a chiral scalar multiplet of the preserved N=1 SUSY, after an appropriate gauge choice. The low-energy effective Lagrangian for the massless fields is obtained for the finite gauge coupling. The inter-wall force is found to be much stronger than the known infinite coupling case. The previously proposed expansion in inverse powers of the gauge coupling has pathological oscillations, and does not converge to the correct finite coupling result.
