Title: On Tachyon kinks from the DBI action
Authors: Ph. Brax and J. Mourad and D. A. Steer
Abstract: We consider solitonic solutions of the DBI tachyon effective action for a non-BPS brane in the presence of an electric field. We find that for a constant electric field $\tilde E\le 1$, regular solitons compactified on a circle admit a singular and decompactified limit corresponding to Sen's proposal provided the tachyon potential satisfies some restrictions. On the other hand for the critical electric field $\tilde E=1$, regular and finite energy solitons are constructed without any restriction on the potential.
