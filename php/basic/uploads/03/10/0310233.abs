Title: Noncommutative Dipole Field Theories And Unitarity
Authors: Dah-Wei Chiou and Ori J. Ganor
Abstract: We extend the argument of Gomis and Mehen for violation of unitarity in field theories with space-time noncommutativity to dipole field theories. In dipole field theories with a timelike dipole vector, we present 1-loop amplitudes that violate the optical theorem. A quantum mechanical system with nonlocal potential of finite extent in time also shows violation of unitarity.
