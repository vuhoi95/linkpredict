Title: Dirichlet Branes of the Covariant Open Supermembrane in AdS_4 x S^7 and  AdS_7 x S^4
Authors: Makoto Sakaguchi and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We discuss an open supermembrane theory in the AdS_4 x S^7 and AdS_7 x S^4 backgrounds. The possible Dirichlet branes of an open supermembrane are classified by analyzing the covariant Wess-Zumino term. All of the allowed configurations are related to those on the pp-wave background via the Penrose limit.
