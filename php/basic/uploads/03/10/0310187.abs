Title: Potential and mass-matrix in gauged N=4 supergravity
Authors: M. de Roo and S. Panda and M. Trigiante and D. B. Westra
Abstract: We discuss the potential and mass-matrix of gauged N=4 matter coupled supergravity for the case of six matter multiplets, extending previous work by considering the dependence on all scalars. We consider all semi-simple gauge groups and analyse the potential and its first and second derivatives in the origin of the scalar manifold. Although we find in a number of cases an extremum with a positive cosmological constant, these are not stable under fluctuations of all scalar fields.
