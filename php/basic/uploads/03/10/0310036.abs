Title: Superlocalization formulas and supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories
Authors: Ugo Bruzzo and Francesco Fucito
Abstract: By using supermanifold techniques we prove a generalization of the localization formula in equivariant cohomology which is suitable for studying supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories in terms of ADHM data. With these techniques one can compute the reduced partition functions of topological super Yang-Mills theory with 4, 8 or 16 supercharges. More generally, the superlocalization formula can be applied to any topological field theory in any number of dimensions.
