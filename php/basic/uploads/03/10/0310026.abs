Title: Topology Change for Fuzzy Physics: Fuzzy Spaces as Hopf Algebras
Authors: A. P. Balachandran and S. Kurkcuoglu
Abstract: Fuzzy spaces are obtained by quantizing adjoint orbits of compact semi-simple Lie groups. Fuzzy spheres emerge from quantizing S^2 and are associated with the group SU(2) in this manner. They are useful for regularizing quantum field theories and modeling spacetimes by non-commutative manifolds. We show that fuzzy spaces are Hopf algebras and in fact have more structure than the latter. They are thus candidates for quantum symmetries. Using their generalized Hopf algebraic structures, we can also model processes where one fuzzy space splits into several fuzzy spaces. For example we can discuss the quantum transition where the fuzzy sphere for angular momentum J splits into fuzzy spheres for angular momenta K and L.
