Title: On the integrability conditions for some structures related to evolution  differential equations
Authors: Paul Kersten and Iosif Krasil'shchik and Alexander Verbovetsky
Abstract: Using the result by D.Gessler (Differential Geom. Appl. 7 (1997) 303-324, DIPS-9/98, http://diffiety.ac.ru/preprint/98/09_98abs.htm), we show that any invariant variational bivector (resp., variational 2-form) on an evolution equation with nondegenerate right-hand side is Hamiltonian (resp., symplectic).
