Title: Light-Cone String Field Theory in a Plane Wave Background
Authors: Marcus Spradlin and Anastasia Volovich
Abstract: These lecture notes present an elementary introduction to light-cone string field theory, with an emphasis on its application to the study of string interactions in the plane wave limit of AdS/CFT. We summarize recent results and conclude with a list of open questions.
