Title: Supersymmetric D-branes in Type IIB Plane Wave Background
Authors: Kyung-Seok Cha and Bum-Hoon Lee and Hyun Seok Yang
Abstract: We systematically analyze supersymmetric D-branes in the type IIB plane wave background using Green-Schwarz superstring theory. We find several new supersymmetric oblique and curved D-branes. The supersymmetries preserved by various configurations of these D-branes including their intersections are also identified. In particular, we show that $D_+$-branes of type (+,-,n,n) for n=1,2,3,4 preserve 4 dynamical supersymmetries by introducing gauge field excitations and newly discovered oblique D5- and D7-branes also preserve four or two dynamical supersymmetries with gauge field condensates. Furthermore we find new curved D-branes preserving four dynamical supersymmetries.
