Title: Determination of continuous variable entanglement by purity measurements
Authors: Gerardo Adesso and Alessio Serafini and Fabrizio Illuminati
Abstract: We classify the entanglement of two--mode Gaussian states according to their degree of total and partial mixedness. We derive exact bounds that determine maximally and minimally entangled states for fixed global and marginal purities. This characterization allows for an experimentally reliable estimate of continuous variable entanglement based on measurements of purity.
