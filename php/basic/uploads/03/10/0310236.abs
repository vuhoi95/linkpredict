Title: Complementarity between Gauge-Boson Compositeness and Asymptotic Freedom  -- with scalar matter
Authors: Keiichi Akama and Takashi Hattori
Abstract: We derive and solve the compositeness condition for the SU(N_c) gauge boson coupling with N_s scalar fields at the next-to-leading order in 1/N_s and the leading order in ln(\Lambda^2) (\Lambda is the compositeness scale). It turns out that the argument of gauge-boson compositeness (with a large \Lambda) is successful only when N_s/N_c>22, in which the asymptotic freedom fails, as is in the previously investigated case with fermionic matter.
