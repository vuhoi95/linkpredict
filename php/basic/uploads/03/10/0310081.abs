Title: Supersymmetric Godel-type Universe in four Dimensions
Authors: Marco M. Caldarelli and Dietmar Klemm
Abstract: We generalize the classification of all supersymmetric solutions of pure N=2, D=4 gauged supergravity to the case when external sources are included. It is shown that the source must be an electrically charged dust. We give a particular solution to the resulting equations, that describes a Goedel-type universe preserving one quarter of the supersymmetries.
