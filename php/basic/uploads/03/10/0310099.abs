Title: Time-dependent Orbifolds and String Cosmology
Authors: Lorenzo Cornalba and Miguel S. Costa
Abstract: In these lectures, we review the physics of time-dependent orbifolds of string theory, with particular attention to orbifolds of three-dimensional Minkowski space. We discuss the propagation of free particles in the orbifold geometries, together with their interactions. We address the issue of stability of these string vacua and the difficulties in defining a consistent perturbation theory, pointing to possible solutions. In particular, it is shown that resumming part of the perturbative expansion gives finite amplitudes. Finally we discuss the duality of some orbifold models with the physics of orientifold planes, and we describe cosmological models based on the dynamics of these orientifolds.
