Title: Dimensional Reduction over Fuzzy Coset Spaces
Authors: P. Aschieri and J. Madore and P. Manousselis and G. Zoupanos
Abstract: We examine gauge theories on Minkowski space-time times fuzzy coset spaces. This means that the extra space dimensions instead of being a continuous coset space S/R are a corresponding finite matrix approximation. The gauge theory defined on this non-commutative setup is reduced to four dimensions and the rules of the corresponding dimensional reduction are established. We investigate in particular the case of the fuzzy sphere including the dimensional reduction of fermion fields.
