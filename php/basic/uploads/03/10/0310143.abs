Authors: B. Geyer and D. M. Gitman and P. M. Lavrov and P. Yu. Moshin
Abstract: We propose a superfield formalism of Lagrangian BRST-antiBRST quantization of arbitrary gauge theories in general coordinates with the base manifold of fields and antifields desribed in terms of both bosonic and fermionic variables.
