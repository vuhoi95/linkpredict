Title: Conformal field theories with Z_N and Lie algebra symmetries
Authors: Vladimir S Dotsenko and Jesper Lykke Jacobsen and Raoul Santachiara
Abstract: We construct two-dimensional conformal field theories with a Z_N symmetry, based on the second solution of Fateev-Zamolodchikov for the parafermionic chiral algebra. Primary operators are classified according to their transformation properties under the dihedral group (Z_N x Z_2, where Z_2 stands for the Z_N charge conjugation), as singlets, [(N-1)/2] different doublets, and a disorder operator. In an assumed Coulomb gas scenario, the corresponding vertex operators are accommodated by the Kac table based on the weight lattice of the Lie algebra B_{(N-1)/2} when N is odd, and D_{N/2} when N is even. The unitary theories are representations of the coset SO_n(N) x SO_2(N) / SO_{n+2}(N), with n=1,2,.... We suggest that physically they realize the series of multicritical points in statistical systems having a Z_N symmetry.
