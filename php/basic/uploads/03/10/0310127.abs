Title: A regularization of field theory on non-commutative torus
Authors: Naofumi Kitsunezaki and Shozo Uehara
Abstract: Matrix model is used as a regularization of field theory on non-commutative torus. However, there exists an example that the product of the large-N limit of matrices does not coincide with that of the corresponding fields. We propose a new procedure for regularizing fields on a non-commutative torus by matrices with the help of the projection in the representation space, so that the products of the matrices coincide with those of the corresponding fields in the large-N limit.
