Title: Warped super-bigravity
Authors: Zygmunt Lalak and Radoslaw Matyszkiewicz
Abstract: Warped supergravities with lower-dimensional branes provide consistent field-theoretic framework for discussion of important aspects of modern string theory physics. In particular, it is possible to study reliably supersymmetry breakdown and its transmission between branes. In this talk we present two versions of locally supersymmetrized bigravity - one with unbroken N=1,d=4 supersymmetry, and the second one with all supersymmetries broken by boundary conditions.
