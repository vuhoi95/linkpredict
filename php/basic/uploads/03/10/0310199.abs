Title: Models of relativistic particle with curvature and torsion revisited
Authors: Josu Arroyo and Manuel Barros and Oscar J. Garay
Abstract: Models, describing relativistic particles, where Lagrangian densities depend linearly on both the curvature and the torsion of the trajectories, are revisited in D=3 space forms. The moduli spaces of trajectories are completely and explicitly determined using the Lancret program. The moduli subspaces of closed solitons in the three sphere are also determined.
