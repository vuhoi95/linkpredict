Title: Heterotic String Theory on non-Kaehler Manifolds with H-Flux and Gaugino  Condensate
Authors: G. L. Cardoso and G. Curio and G. Dall'Agata and D. Lust
Abstract: We discuss compactifications of heterotic string theory to four dimensions in the presence of H-fluxes, which deform the geometry of the internal manifold, and a gaugino condensate which breaks supersymmetry. We focus on the compensation of the two effects in order to obtain vacua with zero cosmological constant and we comment on the effective superpotential describing these vacua.
