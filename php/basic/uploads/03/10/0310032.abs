Title: CFTs of SLEs: the radial case
Authors: Michel Bauer and Denis Bernard
Abstract: We present a relation between conformal field theories (CFT) and radial stochastic Schramm-Loewner evolutions (SLE) similar to that we previously developed for the chordal SLEs. We construct an important local martingale using degenerate representations of the Virasoro algebra. We sketch how to compute derivative exponants and the restriction martingales in this framework. In its CFT formulation, the SLE dual Fokker-Planck operator acts as the two-particle Calogero hamiltonian on boundary primary fields and as the dilatation operator on bulk primary fields localized at the fixed point of the SLE map.
