Title: The Seiberg-Witten Map on the Fuzzy Sphere
Authors: Jesper M. Grimstrup and Thordur Jonsson and Larus Thorlacius
Abstract: We construct covariant coordinate transformations on the fuzzy sphere and utilize these to construct a covariant map from a gauge theory on the fuzzy sphere to a gauge theory on the ordinary sphere. We show that this construction coincides with the Seiberg-Witten map on the Moyal plane in the appropriate limit. The analysis takes place in the algebra and is independent of any star-product representation.
