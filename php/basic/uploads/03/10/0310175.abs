Title: Fluctuating Commutative Geometry
Authors: Luiz C. de Albuquerque and Jorge L. deLyra and Paulo Teotonio-Sobrinho
Abstract: We use the framework of noncommutative geometry to define a discrete model for fluctuating geometry. Instead of considering ordinary geometry and its metric fluctuations, we consider generalized geometries where topology and dimension can also fluctuate. The model describes the geometry of spaces with a countable number $n$ of points. The spectral principle of Connes and Chamseddine is used to define dynamics.We show that this simple model has two phases. The expectation value $<n>$, the average number of points in the universe, is finite in one phase and diverges in the other. Moreover, the dimension $\delta$ is a dynamical observable in our model, and plays the role of an order parameter. The computation of $<\delta>$ is discussed and an upper bound is found, $<\delta> < 2$. We also address another discrete model defined on a fixed $d=1$ dimension, where topology fluctuates. We comment on a possible spontaneous localization of topology.
