Title: Vacuum Stability in Heterotic M-Theory
Authors: Evgeny I. Buchbinder and Burt A. Ovrut
Abstract: The problem of the stabilization of moduli is discussed within the context of compactified strongly coupled heterotic string theory. It is shown that all geometric, vector bundle and five-brane moduli are completely fixed, within a phenomenologically acceptable range, by non-perturbative physics. This result requires, in addition to the full space of moduli, non-vanishing Neveu-Schwarz flux, gaugino condensation with threshold corrections and the explicit form of the Pfaffians in string instanton superpotentials. The stable vacuum presented here has a negative cosmological constant. The possibility of ``lifting'' this to a metastable vacuum with positive cosmological constant is briefly discussed.
