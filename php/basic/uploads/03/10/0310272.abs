Title: A Formula of Two-Partition Hodge Integrals
Authors: Chiu-Chu Melissa Liu and Kefeng Liu and Jian Zhou
Abstract: We prove a formula conjectured by the third author expressing certain Hodge integrals in terms of certain Chern-Simons link invariants. Such invariants also arise in the representation theory of Kac-Moody algebras.
