Title: Framework for finite alternative theories to a quantum field theory.  II-Unitarity
Authors: Marijan Ribaric and Luka Sustersic
Abstract: We generalized the 't Hooft-Veltman method of unitary regulators to put forward a path-integral framework for finite, alternative theories to a given quantum field theory. And we demonstrated that the proposed framework is feasible by providing a finite alternative to the quantum field theory of a single, self-interacting real scalar field. Here we give two properties of self-energy that make the corresponding scattering matrix unitary. We show that the perturbative self-energy has these two properties at least up to the second order in the coupling constant.
