Title: Quintessence and Inflation from Symmetry Breaking Transition of the  Internal Manifold
Authors: Tirthabir Biswas and Prashanth Jaikumar
Abstract: We show that even in the simple framework of pure Kaluza-Klein gravity the shape moduli can generate potentials supporting inflation and/or quintessence. Using the shape moduli as the inflaton or quintessence-field has the additional benefit of being able to explain symmetry breaking in a natural geometric way. A numerical analysis suggests that in these models it may be possible to obtain sufficient e-foldings during inflation as well as a small cosmological constant at the current epoch (without fine tuning), while preserving the constraint coming from the fine structure constant.
