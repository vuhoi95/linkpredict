Title: Yang-Mills Duals for Semiclassical Strings
Authors: J. Engquist and J. A. Minahan and K. Zarembo
Abstract: We consider a semiclassical multiwrapped circular string pulsating on S_5, whose center of mass has angular momentum J on an S_3 subspace. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence we argue that the one-loop anomalous dimension of the dual operator is a simple rational function of J/L, where J is the R-charge and L is the bare dimension of the operator. We then reproduce this result directly from a super Yang-Mills computation, where we make use of the integrability of the one-loop system to set up an integral equation that we solve. We then verify the results of Frolov and Tseytlin for circular rotating strings with R-charge assignment (J',J',J). In this case we solve for an integral equation found in the O(-1) matrix model when J'< J and the O(+1) matrix model if J'> J. The latter region starts at J'=L/2 and continues down, but an apparent critical point is reached at J'=4J. We argue that the critical point is just an artifact of the Bethe ansatz and that the conserved charges of the underlying integrable model are analytic for all J' and that the results from the O(-1) model continue onto the results of the O(+1) model.
