Title: Hamiltonian symplectic embedding of the massive noncommutative U(1)  Theory
Authors: C. Neves and W. Oliveira and D. C. Rodrigues and C. Wotzasek
Abstract: We show that the massive noncommutative U(1) theory is embedded in a gauge theory using an alternative systematic way, which is based on the symplectic framework. The embedded Hamiltonian density is obtained after a finite number of steps in the iterative symplectic process, oppositely to the result proposed using the BFFT formalism. This alternative formalism of embedding shows how to get a set of dynamically equivalent embedded Hamiltonian densities.
