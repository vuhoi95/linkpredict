Title: Light-Front Hadron Dynamics and AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: S. J. Brodsky and G. F. de Teramond
Abstract: A remarkable consequence of the AdS/CFT correspondence is the nonperturbative derivation of dimensional counting rules for hard scattering processes. Using string/gauge duality we derive the QCD power behavior of light-front Fock-state hadronic wavefunctions for hard scattering in the large-$r$ region of the AdS space from the conformal isometries which determine the scaling of string states as we approach the boundary from the interior of AdS space. The nonperturbative scaling results are obtained for spin-zero and spin-$\half$ hadrons and are extended to include the orbital angular momentum dependence of the constituents in the light-front Fock-expansion. The correspondence with string states is considered for hadronic states of arbitrary orbital angular momentum for a given hadron of spin $\leq 2$. We examine the implications of the color configuration of hadronic Fock-states for the QCD structure of scattering amplitudes at large $N_C$. Quark interchange amplitudes emerge as the dominant large $N_C$ scattering mechanisms for conformal QCD.
