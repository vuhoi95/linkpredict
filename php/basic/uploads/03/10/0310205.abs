Title: Coupled-cluster renormalization group
Authors: Amir H. Rezaeian and Niels R. Walet
Abstract: The coupled cluster method (CCM) is one of the most successful and universally applicable techniques in quantum many-body theory. The intrinsic nonlinear and non-perturbative nature of the method is considered to be one of its advantages. We present here a combination of CCM with the Wilsonian renormalization group which leads to a powerful framework for construction of effective Hamiltonian field theories. As a toy example we obtain the two-loop renormalized $\phi^{4}$ theory.
