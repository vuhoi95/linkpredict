Title: Tests and applications of Migdal's particle path-integral representation  for the Dirac Propagator
Authors: C. Fosco and J. Sanchez-Guillen and R. A. Vazquez
Abstract: We derive some non-perturbative results in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions within the context of the particle path-integral representation for a Dirac field propagator in the presence of an external field, in a formulation introduced by Migdal in 1986. We consider the specific properties of the path-integral expressions corresponding to the 1+1 and 2+1 dimensional cases, presenting a derivation of the chiral anomaly in the former and of the Chern-Simons current in the latter. We also discuss particle propagation in constant electromagnetic field backgrounds.
