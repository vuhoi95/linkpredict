Title: Maths-type q-deformed coherent states for q > 1
Authors: C. Quesne and K. A. Penson and V. M. Tkachuk
Abstract: Maths-type q-deformed coherent states with $q > 1$ allow a resolution of unity in the form of an ordinary integral. They are sub-Poissonian and squeezed. They may be associated with a harmonic oscillator with minimal uncertainties in both position and momentum and are intelligent coherent states for the corresponding deformed Heisenberg algebra.
