Title: On the existence of finite-energy lumps in classic field theories
Authors: Roman V. Buniy and Thomas W. Kephart
Abstract: We show how the existence of non-trivial finite-energy time-dependent classical lumps is restricted by a generalized virial theorem. For simple model Lagrangians, bounds on energies follow.
