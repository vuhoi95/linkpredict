Title: Lienard-Wiechert Potentials in Even Dimensions
Authors: Metin Gurses and Ozgur Sarioglu
Abstract: The motion of point charged particles is considered in an even dimensional Minkowski space-time. The potential functions corresponding to the massless scalar and the Maxwell fields are derived algorithmically. It is shown that in all even dimensions particles lose energy due to acceleration.
