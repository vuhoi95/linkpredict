Title: Anti-de Sitter black holes, perfect fluids, and holography
Authors: Saurya Das and Viqar Husain
Abstract: We consider asymptotically anti-de Sitter black holes in $d$-spacetime dimensions in the thermodynamically stable regime. We show that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and its leading order corrections due to thermal fluctuations can be reproduced by a weakly interacting fluid of bosons and fermions (`dual gas') in $\Delta=\alpha(d-2)+1$ spacetime dimensions, where the energy-momentum dispersion relation for the constituents of the fluid is assumed to be $\epsilon = \kappa p^\alpha$. We examine implications of this result for entropy bounds and the holographic hypothesis.
