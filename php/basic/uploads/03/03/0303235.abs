Title: Softer Hard Scattering and Noncommutative Gauge-String Duality
Authors: Soo-Jong Rey and Jung-Tay Yee
Abstract: We study exclusive scattering of `hadrons' at high energy and fixed angle in (nonconformal) noncommutative gauge theories. Via gauge-string duality, we show that the noncommutativity renders the scattering soft, leading to exponential suppression. The result fits with the picture that, in noncommutative gauge theory, fundamental partons consist of extremely soft constituents and `hadrons' are made out of open Wilson lines.
