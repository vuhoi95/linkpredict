Title: N=2 Supersymmetric Scalar-Tensor Couplings
Authors: Ulrich Theis and Stefan Vandoren
Abstract: We determine the general coupling of a system of scalars and antisymmetric tensors, with at most two derivatives and undeformed gauge transformations, for both rigid and local N=2 supersymmetry in four-dimensional spacetime. Our results cover interactions of hyper, tensor and double-tensor multiplets and apply among others to Calabi-Yau threefold compactifications of Type II supergravities. As an example, we give the complete Lagrangian and supersymmetry transformation rules of the double-tensor multiplet dual to the universal hypermultiplet.
