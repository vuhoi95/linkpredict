Title: Towards Exact Results in Nodal Antiferromagnetic Planar Liquids
Authors: J. Alexandre and N. E. Mavromatos and Sarben Sarkar
Abstract: It has been argued in previous works by the authors that nodal excitations in (2+1)-dimensional doped antiferromagnets might exhibit, in the spin-charge separation framework and at specific regions of the parameter space, a supersymmetry between spinons and holons. This supersymmetry has been elevated to a N=2 extended supersymmetry of composite operators of spinon and holons, corresponding to the effective "hadronic" degrees of freedom. In this work we elaborate further on this idea by describing in some detail the dynamics of a specific composite model corresponding to an Abelian Higgs model (SQED). The abelian nature of the gauge group seems to be necessitated both by the composite structure used, but also by electric charge considerations for the various composites. We demonstrate the passage from a pseudogap to an unconventional superconducting phase, which notably is an exact non-perturbative analytic result, due to the underlying N=2 supersymmetric Abelian gauge theory. We believe that these considerations may provide a first step towards a non-perturbative understanding of the phase diagrams of strongly-correlated electron systems.
