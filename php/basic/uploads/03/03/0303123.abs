Title: The confluent algorithm in second order supersymmetric quantum mechanics
Authors: David J. Fernandez C. and Encarnacion Salinas-Hernandez
Abstract: The confluent algorithm, a degenerate case of the second order supersymmetric quantum mechanics, is studied. It is shown that the transformation function must asymptotically vanish to induce non-singular final potentials. The technique can be used to create a single level above the initial ground state energy. The method is applied to the free particle, one-soliton well and harmonic oscillator.
