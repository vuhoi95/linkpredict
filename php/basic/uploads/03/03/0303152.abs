Title: Comments on Two-Loop Four-Particle Amplitude in Superstring Theory
Authors: Wu-Jun Bao and Chuan-Jie Zhu
Abstract: It is shown that the four-particle amplitude of superstring theory at two loops obtained in [1,2] is equivalent to the previously obtained results in [3,4,5]. Here the ${\bf Z}_2$ symmetry in hyperelliptic Riemann surface plays an important role in the proof.
