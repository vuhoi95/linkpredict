Title: Phantom Field with O(N) Symmetry in Exponential Potential
Authors: Xin-zhou Li and Jian-gang Hao
Abstract: In this paper, we study the phase space of phantom model with O(\emph{N}) symmetry in exponential potential. Different from the model without O(\emph{N}) symmetry, the introduction of the symmetry leads to a lower bound $w>-3$ on the equation of state for the existence of stable phantom dominated attractor phase. The reconstruction relation between the potential of O(\textit{N}) phantom system and red shift has been derived.
