Title: Fermion propagator for QED_3 in the IR domain
Authors: C. D. Fosco and A. Lopez
Abstract: We evaluate the fermion propagator in parity-conserving QED_3 with N flavours, in the context of an IR domain approximation. This provides results which are non-perturbative in the loopwise expansion sense. We include fermion-loop effects, and show that they are relevant to the chiral symmetry breaking phenomenon, that can be understood in this context.
