Title: A Microscopical Description of Giant Gravitons II: The AdS_5 x S^5  Background
Authors: Bert Janssen and Yolanda Lozano and Diego Rodriguez-Gomez
Abstract: In this article we continue with the microscopical investigation of giant graviton configurations in AdS_m x S^n spacetimes, initiated in hep-th/0207199. Using dualities and a Matrix theory derivation we propose an action that describes multiple Type IIB gravitons. This action contains multipole moment couplings to the Type IIB background potentials. Using these couplings, we study, from the microscopical point of view, the giant graviton and dual giant graviton configurations in the AdS_5 x S^5 background. In both cases the gravitons expand into a non-commutative 3-sphere, that is defined as an S^1-bundle over a fuzzy 2-sphere. When the number of gravitons is large we find perfect agreement with the Abelian, macroscopical description of giant gravitons in this spacetime, given in the literature.
