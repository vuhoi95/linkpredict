Title: Exact Solution of Noncommutative Field Theory in Background Magnetic  Fields
Authors: E. Langmann and R. J. Szabo and K. Zarembo
Abstract: We obtain the exact non-perturbative solution of a scalar field theory defined on a space with noncommuting position and momentum coordinates. The model describes non-locally interacting charged particles in a background magnetic field. It is an exactly solvable quantum field theory which has non-trivial interactions only when it is defined with a finite ultraviolet cutoff. We propose that small perturbations of this theory can produce solvable models with renormalizable interactions.
