Title: Constructing Gauge Theory Geometries from Matrix Models
Authors: A. Klemm and K. Landsteiner and C. I. Lazaroiu and I. Runkel
Abstract: We use the matrix model -- gauge theory correspondence of Dijkgraaf and Vafa in order to construct the geometry encoding the exact gaugino condensate superpotential for the N=1 U(N) gauge theory with adjoint and symmetric or anti-symmetric matter, broken by a tree level superpotential to a product subgroup involving U(N_i) and SO(N_i) or Sp(N_i/2) factors. The relevant geometry is encoded by a non-hyperelliptic Riemann surface, which we extract from the exact loop equations. We also show that O(1/N) corrections can be extracted from a logarithmic deformation of this surface. The loop equations contain explicitly subleading terms of order 1/N, which encode information of string theory on an orientifolded local quiver geometry.
