Title: Supersymmetric M-theory compactifications with fluxes on seven-manifolds  and G-structures
Authors: Peter Kaste and Ruben Minasian and Alessandro Tomasiello
Abstract: We consider Minkowski compactifications of M-theory on generic seven-dimensional manifolds. After analyzing the conditions on the four-form flux, we establish a set of relations between the components of the intrinsic torsion of the internal manifold and the components of the four-form flux needed for preserving supersymmetry. The existence of two nowhere vanishing vectors on any seven-manifold with G_2 structure plays a crucial role in our analysis, leading to the possibility of four-dimensional compactifications with N=1 and N=2 supersymmetry.
