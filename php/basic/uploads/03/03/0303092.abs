Title: Elliptic solutions of the Skyrme model
Authors: M. Hirayama and C. -G. Shi and J. Yamashita
Abstract: A class of exact solutions of the Skyrme model are obtained. They are described by the Weierstrass $\wp$-function or the Jacobi elliptic function. They are not solitonic but of wave character. They supply us with examples of the superposition of three plane waves in the Skyrme model.
