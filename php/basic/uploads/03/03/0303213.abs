Title: Chern-Simons vs. Yang-Mills gaugings in three dimensions
Authors: Hermann Nicolai and Henning Samtleben
Abstract: Recently, gauged supergravities in three dimensions with Yang-Mills and Chern-Simons type interactions have been constructed. In this article, we demonstrate that any gauging of Yang-Mills type with semisimple gauge group G_0, possibly including extra couplings to massive Chern-Simons vectors, is equivalent on-shell to a pure Chern-Simons type gauging with non-semisimple gauge group $G_0 \ltimes T \subset G$, where T is a certain translation group, and where G is the maximal global symmetry group of the ungauged theory. We discuss several examples.
