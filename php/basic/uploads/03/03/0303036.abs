Title: Geometric Second Order Field Equations for General Tensor Gauge Fields
Authors: P. de Medeiros and C. Hull
Abstract: Higher spin tensor gauge fields have natural gauge-invariant field equations written in terms of generalised curvatures, but these are typically of higher than second order in derivatives. We construct geometric second order field equations and actions for general higher spin boson fields, and first order ones for fermions, which are non-local but which become local on gauge-fixing, or on introducing auxiliary fields. This generalises the results of Francia and Sagnotti to all representations of the Lorentz group.
