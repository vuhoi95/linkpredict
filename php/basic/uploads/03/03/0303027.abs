Title: Nonstrange hybrid compact stars with color superconducting matter
Authors: Igor Shovkovy and Matthias Hanauske and Mei Huang
Abstract: Realistic nonstrange hybrid compact stars with color superconducting quark matter in their interior are constructed. It is shown that a positively charged two-flavor color superconducting phase could naturally appear in the core of a hybrid star as one of the components of a globally neutral mixed phase. The negatively charged normal quark phase is the other component of the mixed phase. The quark core of the star is surrounded by another mixed phase made of hadronic and normal quark matter. The two mixed phases are separated by a sharp interface. Finally, the lowest density regions of the star are made of pure hadronic matter and nuclear crust.
