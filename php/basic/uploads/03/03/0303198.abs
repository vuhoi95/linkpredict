Title: Infrared regularization with spin-3/2 fields
Authors: Véronique Bernard and Thomas R. Hemmert and Ulf-G. Meißner
Abstract: We present a Lorentz-invariant formulation of baryon chiral perturbation theory including spin-3/2 fields. Particular attention is paid to the projection on the spin-3/2 components of the delta fields. We also discuss the nucleon mass and the pion-nucleon sigma term.
