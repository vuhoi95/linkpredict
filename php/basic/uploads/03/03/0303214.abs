Title: Boundary States for D-branes with Traveling Waves
Authors: Yasuaki Hikida and Hiromitsu Takayanagi and Tadashi Takayanagi
Abstract: We construct boundary states for D-branes which carry traveling waves in the covariant formalism. We compute their vacuum amplitudes to investigate their interactions. In non-compact space, the vacuum amplitudes become trivial as is common in plane wave geometries. However, we found that if they are compactified in the traveling direction, then the amplitudes are affected by non-trivial time dependent effects. The interaction between D-branes with waves traveling in the opposite directions (`pulse-antipulse scattering') are also computed. Furthermore, we apply these ideas to open string tachyon condensation with traveling waves.
