Title: Algebraic Bethe ansatz for the elliptic quantum group  $E_{τ,η}(sl_n)$ and its applications
Authors: Bo-yu Hou and Ryu Sasaki and Wen-Li Yang
Abstract: We study the tensor product of the {\it higher spin representations} (see the definition in Sect. 2.2) of the elliptic quantum group $E_{\tau,\eta}(sl_n)$. The transfer matrices associated with the $E_{\tau,\eta}(sl_n)$-module are exactly diagonalized by the nested Bethe ansatz method. Some special cases of the construction give the exact solution for the $Z_n$ Belavin model and for the elliptic $A_{n-1}$ Ruijsenaars-Schneider model.
