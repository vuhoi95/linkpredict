Abstract: Motivated by the Randall-Sundrum brane-world scenario, we discuss the classical and quantum dynamics of a (d+1)-dimensional boundary wall between a pair of (d+2)-dimensional topological Schwarzschild-AdS black holes. We assume there are quite general -- but not completely arbitrary -- matter fields living on the boundary ``brane universe'' and its geometry is that of an Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) model. The effective action governing the model in the mini-superspace approximation is derived. We find that the presence of black hole horizons in the bulk gives rise to a complex action for certain classically allowed brane configurations, but that the imaginary contribution plays no role in the equations of motion. Classical and instanton brane trajectories are examined in general and for special cases, and we find a subset of configuration space that is not allowed at the classical or semi-classical level; these correspond to spacelike branes carrying tachyonic matter. The Hamiltonization and Dirac quantization of the model is then performed for the general case; the latter involves the manipulation of the Hamiltonian constraint before it is transformed into an operator that annihilates physical state vectors. The ensuing covariant Wheeler-DeWitt equation is examined at the semi-classical level, and we consider the possible localization of the brane universe's wavefunction away from the cosmological singularity. This is easier to achieve for branes with low density and/or spherical spatial sections.
