Title: Extended open inflationary universes
Authors: Sergio del Campo and Ramon Herrera
Abstract: In this paper we study a type of one-field model for open inflationary universe models in the context of the Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory. In the scenario of a one-bubble universe model we determine and characterize the existence of the Coleman-De Lucia instanton, together with the period of inflation after tunnelling has occurred. Our results are analogous to those found in the Einstein General Relativity models.
