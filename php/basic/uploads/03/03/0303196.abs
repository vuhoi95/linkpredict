Title: Quantum Energy of Fuzzy Sphere: Gaussian Variational Method
Authors: Yu-Jie Zhong and Wung-Hong Huang
Abstract: The matrix model with mass term has a nontrivially classical solution which is known to represent a noncommutative fuzzy sphere. The fuzzy sphere has a lower energy then that of the trivial solution. In this letter we investigate the quantum correction of the energy of the fuzzy sphere by using the Gaussian variational technique, in contrast to the other studying in which only the small fluctuation was considered. Our result, which only considering the boson part, shows that the quantum correction does not change the stability of the fuzzy sphere.
