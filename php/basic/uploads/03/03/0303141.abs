Title: In-medium Yang-Mills equations: a derivation and canonical quantization
Authors: M. K. Djongolov and S. Pisov and V. Rizov
Abstract: The equations for Yang-Mills field in a medium are derived in a linear approximation with respect to the gauge coupling parameter and the external field. The obtained equations closely resemble the macroscopic Maxwell equations. A canonical quantization is performed for a family of Fermi-like gauges in the case of constant and diagonal (in the group indices) tensors of electric permittivity and magnetic permeability. The physical subspace is defined and the gauge field propagator is evaluated for a particular choice of the gauge. The propagator is applied for evaluation of the cross-section of ellastic quark scattering in the Born approximation. Possible applications to Cherenkov-type gluon radiation are commented briefly.
