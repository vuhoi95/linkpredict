Title: D-branes in lens spaces
Authors: P. Bordalo and A. Wurtz
Abstract: We realize the CFT with target a lens space SU(2)/Z_l as a simple current construction. This allows us to compute the boundary states and the annuli coefficients, and in particular to study the B-type branes, in purely algebraic terms. Several issues, like the appearance of fractional branes and symmetry breaking boundary conditions, can be addressed more directly in this approach than in a more geometric treatment.
