Title: SL(2,Z) tensionless string backgrounds in IIB string theory
Authors: Andreas Bredthauer and Ulf Lindstrom and Jonas Persson
Abstract: We examine a tensionless limit of a SL(2,Z) set of background solutions to IIB supergravity theory, obtained by performing an infinite boost. This yields a solution that corresponds to taking the original string tension to zero. The limit reproduces ordinary Minkowski space except for a delta-like singularity along the string. We study the field content and the energy momentum tensor.
