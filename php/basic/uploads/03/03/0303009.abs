Title: Superintegrability, Lax matrices and separation of variables
Authors: J. Harnad and O. Yermolayeva
Abstract: We show how the superintegrability of certain systems can be deduced from the presence of multiple parameters in the rational Lax matrix representation. This is also related to the fact that such systems admit a separation of variables in parametric families of coordinate systems.
