Title: Quantizing Dirac and Nambu Brackets
Authors: Thomas Curtright and Cosmas Zachos
Abstract: We relate classical and quantum Dirac and Nambu brackets. At the classical level, we use the relations between the two brackets to gain some insight into the Jacobi identity for Dirac brackets, among other things. At the quantum level, we suggest that the Nambu bracket is the preferred method for introducing constraints, although at the expense of some unorthodox behavior, which we describe in detail.
