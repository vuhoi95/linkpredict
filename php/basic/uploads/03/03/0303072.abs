Title: Loop Quantum Cosmology, Boundary Proposals, and Inflation
Authors: Martin Bojowald and Kevin Vandersloot
Abstract: Loop quantum cosmology of the closed isotropic model is studied with a special emphasis on a comparison with traditional results obtained in the Wheeler-DeWitt approach. This includes the relation of the dynamical initial conditions with boundary conditions such as the no-boundary or the tunneling proposal and a discussion of inflation from quantum cosmology.
