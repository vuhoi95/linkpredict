Title: World-sheet Stability of (0,2) Linear Sigma Models
Authors: Anirban Basu and Savdeep Sethi
Abstract: We argue that two-dimensional (0,2) gauged linear sigma models are not destabilized by instanton generated world-sheet superpotentials. We construct several examples where we show this to be true. The general proof is based on the Konishi anomaly for (0,2) theories.
