Title: Counting minimal form factors of the restricted sine-Gordon model
Authors: M. Jimbo and T. Miwa and Y. Takeyama
Abstract: We revisit the issue of counting all local fields of the restricted sine-Gordon model, in the case corresponding to a perturbation of minimal unitary conformal field theory. The problem amounts to the study of a quotient of certain space of polynomials which enter the integral representation for form factors. This space may be viewed as a $q$-analog of the space of conformal coinvariants associated with U_q(sl_{2}^) with q=\sqrt{-1}. We prove that its character is given by the restricted Kostka polynomial multiplied by a simple factor. As a result, we obtain a formula for the truncated character of the total space of local fields in terms of the Virasoro characters.
