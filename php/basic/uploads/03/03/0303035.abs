Title: Trans-Planckian footprints in inflationary cosmology
Authors: G. L. Alberghi and R. Casadio and A. Tronconi
Abstract: We consider a minimum uncertainty vacuum choice at a fixed energy scale Lambda as an effective description of trans-Planckian physics, and discuss its implications for the linear perturbations of a massless scalar field in power-law inflationary models. We find possible effects with a magnitude of order H/\Lambda in the power spectrum, in analogy with previous results for de-Sitter space-time.
