Title: Phases of N=1 Supersymmetric Gauge Theories with Flavors
Authors: Vijay Balasubramanian and Bo Feng and Min-xin Huang and Asad Naqvi
Abstract: We explore the phases of N = 1 supersymmetric U(N) gauge theories with fundamental matter that arise as deformations of N = 2 SQCD by the addition of a superpotential for the adjoint chiral multiplet. As the parameters in the superpotential are varied, the vacua of this theory sweep out various branches, which in some cases have multiple semiclassical limits. In such limits, we recover the vacua of various product gauge group theories, with flavors charged under some group factors. We describe in detail the structure of the vacua in both classical and quantum regimes, and develop general techniques such as an addition and a multiplication map which relate vacua of different gauge theories. We also consider possible indices characterizing different branches and potential relationships with matrix models.
