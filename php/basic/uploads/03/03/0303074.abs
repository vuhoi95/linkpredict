Title: Irreducibility of the Ashtekar-Isham-Lewandowski representation
Authors: Hanno Sahlmann and Thomas Thiemann
Abstract: Much of the work in loop quantum gravity and quantum geometry rests on a mathematically rigorous integration theory on spaces of distributional connections. Most notably, a diffeomorphism invariant representation of the algebra of basic observables of the theory, the Ashtekar-Isham-Lewandowski representation, has been constructed. Recently, several uniqueness results for this representation have been worked out. In the present article, we contribute to these efforts by showing that the AIL-representation is irreducible, provided it is viewed as the representation of a certain C*-algebra which is very similar to the Weyl algebra used in the canonical quantization of free quantum field theories.
