Title: Quantum Extended Supersymmetries
Authors: Dan Radu Grigore and Gunter Scharf
Abstract: We analyse some quantum multiplets associated with extended supersymmetries. We study in detail the general form of the causal (anti)commutation relations. The condition of positivity of the scalar product imposes severe restrictions on the (quantum) model. It is problematic if one can find out quantum extensions of the standard model with extended supersymmetries.
