Title: D-branes in pp-wave spacetime with nonconstant NS-NS flux
Authors: Kamal L. Panigrahi and Sanjay
Abstract: We find classical solutions of D-branes in pp-wave spacetime with nonconstant NS-NS flux. We also present Dp-Dp' bound state solutions in this background. We further analyze the supersymmetric properties of these brane solutions by solving the type IIB killing spinor equations explicitly.
