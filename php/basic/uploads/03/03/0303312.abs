Title: A new class of solutions of the DMPK equation
Authors: M. Capello and M. Caselle
Abstract: We introduce and discuss a new class of solutions of the DMPK equation in which some of the eigenvalues are grouped into clusters which are conserved in the asymptotic large distance limit (i.e. as the length of the wire increases). We give an explicit expression for the asymptotic expansion of these solutions and suggest some possible applications. In particular these new solution could be useful to avoid the quasi one dimensional constraint in the DMPK equation and to study the crossover between the metallic and insulating phases.
