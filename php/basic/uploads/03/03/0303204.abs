Title: Recombination of Intersecting D-branes by Local Tachyon Condensation
Authors: Koji Hashimoto and Satoshi Nagaoka
Abstract: We provide a simple low energy description of recombination of intersecting D-branes using super Yang-Mills theory. The recombination is realized by condensation of an off-diagonal tachyonic fluctuation localized at the intersecting point. The recombination process is equivalent to brane-antibrane annihilation, thus our result confirms Sen's conjecture on tachyon condensation, although we work in the super Yang-Mills theory whose energy scale is much lower than alpha'. We also discuss the decay width of non-parallelly separated D-branes.
