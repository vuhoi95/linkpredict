Title: Anomaly in conformal quantum mechanics: From molecular physics to black  holes
Authors: Horacio E. Camblong and Carlos R. Ordonez
Abstract: A number of physical systems exhibit a particular form of asymptotic conformal invariance: within a particular range of distances, they are characterized by a long-range conformal interaction (inverse square potential), the absence of dimensional scales, and an SO(2,1) symmetry algebra. Examples from molecular physics to black holes are provided and discussed within a unified treatment. When such systems are physically realized in the appropriate strong-coupling regime,the occurrence of quantum symmetry breaking is possible. This anomaly is revealed by the failure of the symmetry generators to close the algebra in a manner shown to be independent of the renormalization procedure.
