Title: The Kepler problem and non commutativity
Authors: Juan M. Romero and J. David Vergara
Abstract: We investigate the Kepler problem using a symplectic structure consistent with the commutation rules of the noncommutative quantum mechanics. We show that a noncommutative parameter of the order of $10^{-58} \text m^2$ gives observable corrections to the movement of the solar system. In this way, modifications in the physics of smaller scales implies modifications at large scales, something similar to the UV/IR mixing.
