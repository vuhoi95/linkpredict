Title: Field Theoretical Approaches to the Superconducting Phase Transition
Authors: Flavio S. Nogueira and Hagen Kleinert
Abstract: Several field theoretical approaches to the superconducting phase transition are discussed. Emphasis is given to theories of scaling and renormalization group in the context of the Ginzburg-Landau theory and its variants. Also discussed is the duality approach, which allows to access the strong-coupling limit of the Ginzburg-Landau theory.
