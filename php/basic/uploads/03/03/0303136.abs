Title: Theta--instantons in SU(2) Higgs theory
Authors: F. Bezrukov and D. Levkov
Abstract: We consider topology changing processes in SU(2)--Higgs theory. In the Standard Model of particle physics they are accompanied by baryon--and lepton--number non--conservation. At fixed energy and multiplicity of initial state, these processes are described by classical Theta--instanton solutions. We describe these solutions and calculate the suppression exponents for the probabilities of the topology changing transitions at relatively low energies.
