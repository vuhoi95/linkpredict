Title: Fifth force from fifth dimension: a comparison between two different  approaches
Authors: F. Dahia and E. M. Monte and C. Romero
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of particles moving in a spacetime augmented by one extra dimension in the context of the induced matter theory of gravity. We examine the appearance of a fifth force as an effect caused by the extra dimension and discuss two different approaches to the fifth force formalism. We then give two examples of application of both approaches by considering the case of a Ricci-flat warped-product manifold and a generalized Randall-Sundrum space.
