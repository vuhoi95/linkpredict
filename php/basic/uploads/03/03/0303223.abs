Title: D-branes in PP-wave light cone string field theory
Authors: B. Chandrasekhar and Alok Kumar
Abstract: The cubic interaction vertex and the dynamical supercharges are constructed for open strings ending on D7-branes, in light-cone superstring field theory in PP-wave background. In this context, we write down the symmetry generators in terms of the relevant group structure: SU(2) x SU(2) x SO(2) x SO(2), originating from the eight transverse directions in the PP-wave background and use the expressions to explicitly construct the vertex at the level of stringy zero modes. The results are further generalized to include all the stringy excitations as well.
