Title: Scalar Field Corrections to AdS_4 Gravity from Higher Spin Gauge Theory
Authors: Fredric Kristiansson and Peter Rajan
Abstract: We compute the complete contribution to the stress-energy tensor in the minimal bosonic higher spin theory in D=4 that is quadratic in the scalar field. We find arbitrarily high derivative terms, and that the total sign of the stress-energy tensor depends on the parity of the scalar field.
