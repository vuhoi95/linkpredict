Title: Large N reduction in the continuum three dimensional Yang-Mills theory
Authors: R. Narayanan and H. Neuberger
Abstract: Numerical and theoretical evidence leads us to propose the following: Three dimensional Euclidean Yang-Mills theory in the planar limit undergoes a phase transition on a torus of side $l=l_c$. For $l>l_c$ the planar limit is $l$-independent, as expected of a non-interacting string theory. We expect the situation in four dimensions to be similar.
