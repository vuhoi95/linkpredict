Title: n=3 Differential calculus and gauge theory on a reduced quantum plane
Authors: M. El Baz and A. El Hassouni and Y. Hassouni and E. H. Zakkari
Abstract: We discuss the algebra of $N\times N$ matrices as a reduced quantum plane. A $3-$nilpotent deformed differential calculus involving a complex parameter $q$ is constructed. The two cases, $q$ $3^{rd}$ and $N^{th}$ root of unity are completely treated. As application, a gauge field theory for the particular cases $n=2$ and $n=3$ is established.
