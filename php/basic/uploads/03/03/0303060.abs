Title: The Dilatation Operator of Conformal N=4 Super Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: N. Beisert and C. Kristjansen and M. Staudacher
Abstract: We argue that existing methods for the perturbative computation of anomalous dimensions and the disentanglement of mixing in N = 4 gauge theory can be considerably simplified, systematized and extended by focusing on the theory's dilatation operator. The efficiency of the method is first illustrated at the one-loop level for general non-derivative scalar states. We then go on to derive, for pure scalar states, the two-loop structure of the dilatation operator. This allows us to obtain a host of new results. Among these are an infinite number of previously unknown two-loop anomalous dimensions, new subtleties concerning 't Hooft's large N expansion due to mixing effects of degenerate single and multiple trace states, two-loop tests of various protected operators, as well as two-loop non-planar results for two-impurity operators in BMN gauge theory. We also put to use the recently discovered integrable spin chain description of the planar one-loop dilatation operator and show that the associated Yang-Baxter equation explains the existence of a hitherto unknown planar ``axial'' symmetry between infinitely many gauge theory states. We present evidence that this integrability can be extended to all loops, with intriguing consequences for gauge theory, and that it leads to a novel integrable deformation of the XXX Heisenberg spin chain. Assuming that the integrability structure extends to more than two loops, we determine the planar three-loop contribution to the dilatation operator.
