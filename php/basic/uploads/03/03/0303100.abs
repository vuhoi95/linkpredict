Title: Vortices in the Landau--Ginzburg Model of the Quantized Hall Effect
Authors: M. Hassaïne and P. A. Horváthy and J. -C. Yera
Abstract: The `Landau--Ginzburg' theory of Girvin and MacDonald, modified by adding the natural magnetic term, is shown to admit stable topological as well as non-topological vortex solutions. The system is the commun $\lambda\to0$ limit of two slightly different non-relativistic Maxwell--Chern--Simons models of the type introduced recently by Manton. The equivalence with the model of Zhang, Hansson and Kivelson is demonstrated.
