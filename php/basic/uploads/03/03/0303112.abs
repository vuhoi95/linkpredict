Title: Wakes in Dilatonic Current-Carrying Cosmic Strings
Authors: A. L. N. Oliveira and M. E. X. Guimaraes
Abstract: In this work, we present the gravitational field generated by a cosmic string carrying a timelike current in the scalar-tensor gravities. The mechanism of formation and evolution of wakes is fully investigated in this framework. We show explicitly that the inclusion of electromagnetic properties for the string induces logarithmic divergences in the accretion problem.
