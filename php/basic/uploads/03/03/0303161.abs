Title: Mixed Correlation Functions of the Two-Matrix Model
Authors: M. Bertola and B. Eynard
Abstract: We compute the correlation functions mixing the powers of two non-commuting random matrices within the same trace. The angular part of the integration was partially known in the literature: we pursue the calculation and carry out the eigenvalue integration reducing the problem to the construction of the associated biorthogonal polynomials. The generating function of these correlations becomes then a determinant involving the recursion coefficients of the biorthogonal polynomials.
