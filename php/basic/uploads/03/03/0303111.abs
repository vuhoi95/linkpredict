Title: Complex Multiplication Symmetry of Black Hole Attractors
Authors: Monika Lynker and Vipul Periwal and Rolf Schimmrigk
Abstract: We show how Moore's observation, in the context of toroidal compactifications in type IIB string theory, concerning the complex multiplication structure of black hole attractor varieties, can be generalized to Calabi-Yau compactifications with finite fundamental groups. This generalization leads to an alternative general framework in terms of motives associated to a Calabi-Yau variety in which it is possible to address the arithmetic nature of the attractor varieties in a universal way via Deligne's period conjecture.
