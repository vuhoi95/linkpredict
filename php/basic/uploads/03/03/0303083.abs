Title: Conformal Field Theory Couplings for Intersecting D-branes on  Orientifolds
Authors: Mirjam Cvetic and Ioannis Papadimitriou
Abstract: We present a conformal field theory calculation of four-point and three-point correlation functions for the bosonic twist fields arising at the intersections of D-branes wrapping (supersymmetric) homology cycles of Type II orientifold compactifications. Both the quantum contribution from local excitations at the intersections and the world-sheet disk instanton corrections are computed. As a consequence we obtain the complete expression for the Yukawa couplings of chiral fermions with the Higgs fields. The four-point correlation functions in turn lead to the determination of the four-point couplings in the effective theory, and may be of phenomenological interest.
