Title: Bound-state gravity from higher derivatives
Authors: Kiyoung Lee and Warren Siegel
Abstract: In certain Lorentz-covariant higher-derivative field theories of spins < or =1, would-be ultraviolet divergences generate color-singlet poles as infrared divergences. Absence of higher-order poles implies ten-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills with bound-state supergravity, in close analogy with open string theory.
