Title: Newton's law in de Sitter brane
Authors: Kazuo Ghoroku and Akihiro Nakamura and Masanobu Yahiro
Abstract: Newton potential has been evaluated for the case of dS brane embedded in Minkowski, dS$_5$ and AdS$_5$ bulks. We point out that only the AdS$_5$ bulk might be consistent with the Newton's law from the brane-world viewpoint when we respect a small cosmological constant observed at present universe.
