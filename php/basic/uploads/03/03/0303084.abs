Authors: Jose Luiz Boldo and Clisthenis P. Constantinidis and Francois Gieres and Matthieu Lefrancois and Olivier Piguet
Abstract: Witten's observables of topological Yang-Mills theory, defined as classes of an equivariant cohomology, are reobtained as the BRST cohomology classes of a superspace version of the theory.
