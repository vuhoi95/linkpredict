Title: Shrinking D-Strings Expanding onto a Hypertube
Authors: S. Tamaryan and D. H. Tchrakian
Abstract: A solution to the BI action describing an expanded D3-brane is considered. The configuration is not supersymmetric but is supported against collapse by the Poynting vector. In the uniform magnetic field limit, the brane magnetic charge grows without limit while the energy and the radius of the brane remain finite. In this limit the brane consists of a large number of small D-strings forming a hypertube and kept in equilibrium by the electric flux along the hypertube.
