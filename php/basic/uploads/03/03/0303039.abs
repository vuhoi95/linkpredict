Title: Effective Gravitational Equations on Brane World with Induced Gravity
Authors: Kei-ichi Maeda and Shuntaro Mizuno and Takashi Torii
Abstract: We present the effective equations to describe the four-dimensional gravity of a brane world, assuming that a five-dimensional bulk spacetime satisfies the Einstein equations and gravity is confined on the $Z_2$ symmetric brane. Applying this formalism, we study the induced-gravity brane model first proposed by Dvali, Gabadadze and Porrati. In a generalization of their model, we show that an effective cosmological constant on the brane can be extremely reduced in contrast to the case of the Randall-Sundrum model even if a bulk cosmological constant and a brane tension are not fine-tuned.
