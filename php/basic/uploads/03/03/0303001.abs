Title: Comments on ``Improved limit on quantum-spacetime modifications of  Lorentz symmetry from observations of gamma-ray blazars"
Authors: T. Jacobson and S. Liberati and D. Mattingly
Abstract: We address several criticisms by Amelino-Camelia of our recent analyses of two observational constraints on Lorentz violation at order E/M_{Planck}. In particular, we emphasize the role of effective field theory in our analysis of synchrotron radiation, and we strengthen the justification for the constraint coming from photon annihilation.
