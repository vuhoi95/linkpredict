Title: Reflection-Transmission Algebras
Authors: M. Mintchev and E. Ragoucy and P. Sorba
Abstract: Inspired by factorized scattering from delta-type impurities in (1+1)-dimensional space-time, we propose and analyse a generalization of the Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra. Distinguished elements of the new algebra, called reflection and transmission generators, encode the particle-impurity interactions. We describe in detail the underlying algebraic structure. The relative Fock representations are explicitly constructed and a general factorized scattering theory is developed in this framework.
