Title: Type IIA Supergravity Excitations in Plane-Wave Background
Authors: O-Kab Kwon and Hyeonjoon Shin
Abstract: We study the low-lying excitations of Type IIA superstring theory in a plane wave background with 24 supersymmetries. In the light-cone gauge, the superstring action has ${\cal N}=(4,4)$ supersymmetry and is exactly solvable, since it is quadratic in superstring coordinates. We obtain explicitly the spectrum of the Type IIA supergravity fluctuation modes in the plane wave background and give its correspondence with the spectrum of string states from the zero-mode sector of the light-cone superstring Hamiltonian.
