Abstract: We discuss the importance of including baryons in analyses of unified dark matter scenarios, focusing on toy models involving a generalized Chaplygin gas. We determine observational constraints on this unified dark matter scenario coming from large scale structure, type Ia Supernovae and CMB data showing how this component can bring about a different behaviour from classical $\Lambda$CDM and thus motivate further studies of this type of models. We also speculate on interesting new features which are likely to be important on non-linear scales in this context.
