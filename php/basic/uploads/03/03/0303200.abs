Title: Comments on BPS Bound State Decay
Authors: Anatoly Dymarsky and Dmitry Melnikov
Abstract: In N=2 SYM theory with matter non-conservation of the S-charge of a BPS state under monodromies leads to so-called BPS state "decay". A mechanism for such a behavior on the semiclassical level could be established through consideration of soliton-fermion bound state. Solutions to classical equations of motion allow to observe the BPS state "decay" in vivo.
