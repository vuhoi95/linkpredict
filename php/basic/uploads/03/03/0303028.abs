Title: Spin zero particle propagator from a random walk in 3-D space
Authors: J. J. Dugne and V. A. Karmanov
Abstract: The propagator of a spin zero particle in coordinate space is derived supposing that the particle propagates rectilinearly always at the speed of light and changes its direction in some random points due to a scattering process.The average path between two scatterings is of the order of the Compton length.
