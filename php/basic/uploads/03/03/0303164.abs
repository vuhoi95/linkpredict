Title: The Dirichlet Obstruction in AdS/CFT
Authors: Enrique Alvarez and Jorge Conde and Lorenzo Hernandez
Abstract: The obstruction for a perturbative reconstruction of the five-dimensional bulk metric starting from the four-dimensional metric at the boundary,that is, the Dirichlet problem, is computed in dimensions $6\leq d\leq 10$ and some comments are made on its general structure and, in particular, on its relationship with the conformal anomaly, which we compute in dimension $d=8$.
