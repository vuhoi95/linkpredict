Title: Polyhedra in physics, chemistry and geometry
Authors: Michael Atiyah and Paul Sutcliffe
Abstract: In this article we review some problems in physics, chemistry and mathematics that lead naturally to a class of polyhedra which include the Platonic solids. Examples include the study of electrons on a sphere, cages of carbon atoms, central configurations of gravitating point particles, rare gas microclusters, soliton models of nuclei, magnetic monopole scattering and geometrical problems concerning point particles.
