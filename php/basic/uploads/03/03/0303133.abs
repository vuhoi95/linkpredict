Title: Rolling of Modulated Tachyon with Gauge Flux and Emergent Fundamental  String
Authors: Soo-Jong Rey and Shigeki Sugimoto
Abstract: We investigate real-time tachyon dynamics of unstable D-brane carrying fundamental string charge. We construct the boundary state relevant for rolling of modulated tachyon with gauge fields excited on the world-volume, and study spatial distribution of the fundamental string charge and current as the D-brane decays. We find that, in contrast to homogeneous tachyon rolling, spatial modulation of the tachyon field triggers density wave of strings when electric field is turned on, and of string anti-string pairs when magnetic field is turned on. We show that the energy density and the fundamental string charge density are locked together, and evolve into a localized delta-function array (instead of evolving into a string fluid) until a critical time set by initial condition of rolling tachyon. When the gauge fields approach the critical limit, the fundamental strings produced become BPS-like. We also study the dynamics via effective field theory, and find agreement.
