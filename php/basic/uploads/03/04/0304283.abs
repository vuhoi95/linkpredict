Title: New Derivation of Anomaly-Mediated Gaugino Mass in the Higher Derivative  Regularization Method
Authors: Koske Nishihara and Takahiro Kubota
Abstract: The technique of higher derivative regularization is applied to the Super-Weyl-Kahler anomaly in supergravity coupled with chiral matters and gauge multiplet. Our method makes it possible to derive directly and diagrammatically the formulae for the gaugino mass (in the Abelian case). Our procedure is applied to derivation of not only the mass formulae known in the anomaly mediation scenario, but also additional terms that depend on the Kahler potential.
