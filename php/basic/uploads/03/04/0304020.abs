Title: Higher Rank Conformal Fields in the $Sp(2M)$ Symmetric Generalized  Space-Time
Authors: O. A. Gelfond and M. A. Vasiliev
Abstract: We study various $Sp(2M)$ invariant field equations corresponding to rank $r$ tensor products of the Fock (singleton) representation of $Sp(2M)$. These equations are shown to describe localization on ``branes'' of different dimensions embedded into the generalized space-time $\M_M$ with matrix (i.e., ``central charge'') coordinates. The case of bilinear tensor product is considered in detail. The conserved currents built from bilinears of rank 1 fields in $\M_M$ are shown to satisfy the field equations of the rank 2 fields in $\M_M$. Also, the rank 2 fields in $\M_M$ are shown to be equivalent to the rank 1 fields in $\M_{2M}$.
