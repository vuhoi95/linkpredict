Title: All Poisson Structures in $R^3$
Authors: Metin Gurses and Konstantyn Zheltukhin
Abstract: Hamiltonian formulation of N=3 systems is considered in general. The most general solution of the Jacobi equation in ${\mathbb R}^3$ is proposed. Compatible Poisson structures and the corresponding bi-Hamiltonian N=3 systems are also discussed.
