Title: Plasma expansion in the geometry of a collapsing star
Authors: R. Ruffini and L. Vitagliano and S. -S. Xue
Abstract: We describe the evolution of an electron-positron-photon plasma created by Sauter--Heisenberg--Euler--Schwinger mechanism around a collapsing charged star core in the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m geometry external to the core, in view of the application in the framework of the EMBH theory for gamma ray bursts.
