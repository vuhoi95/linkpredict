Title: Spin-Charge gauge approach to "Pseudogap": theory versus experiments

Abstract: We propose an explanation of several experimental features related to the ``pseudogap'' in HTS cuprates in terms of a spin-charge gauge theory approach to the t-J model. The metal-insulator crossover as temperature decreases is explained from the competition between antiferromagnetism and dissipative charge dynamics. We show that gauge interactions bind spinon and holon into an electron resonance, whose recombination time shows up in the out-of-plane resistivity. The theoretical results are sistematically compared with experimental data, finding a very good agreement.
