Title: Quantum invariance group of bosons and fermions
Authors: M. Arik and U. Kayserilioglu
Abstract: The particle algebras generated by the creation/annihilation operators for bosons and for fermions are shown to possess quantum invariance groups. These structures and their sub(quantum)groups are investigated.
