Title: Consistent reductions of IIB*/M* theory and de Sitter supergravity
Authors: James T. Liu and W. A. Sabra and W. Y. Wen
Abstract: We construct consistent non-linear Kaluza Klein reduction ansatze for a subset of fields arising from the reduction of IIB* and M* theory on dS_5 x H^5 and dS_4 x AdS_7, respectively. These reductions yield four and five-dimensional de Sitter supergravities, albeit with wrong sign kinetic terms. We also demonstrate that the ansatze may be used to lift multi-centered de Sitter black hole solutions to ten and eleven dimensions. The lifted dS_5 black holes correspond to rotating E4-branes of IIB* theory.
