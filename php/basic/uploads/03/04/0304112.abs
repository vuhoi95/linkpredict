Title: An O(N) symmetric extension of the Sine-Gordon Equation
Authors: Fred Cooper and Pasquale Sodano and Andrea Trombettoni and Alan Chodos
Abstract: We discuss an O(N) exension of the Sine-Gordon (S-G)equation which allows us to perform an expansion around the leading order in large-N result using Path-Integral methods. In leading order we show our methods agree with the results of a variational calculation at large-N. We discuss the striking differences for a non-polynomial interaction between the form for the effective potential in the Gaussian approximation that one obtains at large-N when compared to the N=1 case. This is in contrast to the case when the classical potential is a polynomial in the field and no such drastic differences occur. We find for our large-N extension of the Sine-Gordon model that the unbroken ground state is unstable as one increases the coupling constant (as it is for the original S-G equation) and we determine the stability criteria.
