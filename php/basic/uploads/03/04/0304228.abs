Title: Model for Gravitational Interaction between Dark Matter and Baryons
Authors: Federico Piazza and Christian Marinoni
Abstract: We propose a phenomenological model where the gravitational interaction between dark matter and baryons is suppressed on small, subgalactic scales. We describe the gravitational force by adding a Yukawa contribution to the standard Newtonian potential and show that this interaction scheme is effectively suggested by the available observations of the inner rotation curves of small mass galaxies. Besides helping in interpreting the cuspy profile of dark matter halos observed in N-body simulations, this potential regulates the quantity of baryons within halos of different masses.
