Title: Braneworld holography in Gauss-Bonnet gravity
Authors: James P. Gregory and Antonio Padilla
Abstract: We investigate holography on an (n-1)-dimensional brane embedded in a background of AdS black holes, in n-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We demonstrate that for a critical brane near the AdS boundary, the Friedmann equation corresponds to that of the standard cosmology driven by a CFT dual to the AdS bulk. We show that there is no holographic description for non-critical branes, or when the brane is further away from the AdS boundary. We then derive a Cardy-Verlinde formula for the dual CFT on the critical brane near the boundary. This gives us insight into the remarkable correspondence between Cardy-Verlinde formulae and Friedmann equations in Einstein gravity.
