Title: Mass, Action and Entropy of Taub-Bolt-dS Spacetimes
Authors: R. Clarkson and A. M. Ghezelbash and R. B. Mann
Abstract: We apply a recent proposal for defining conserved mass in asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes to the class of Taub-Bolt-dS spacetimes. We compute the action, entropy and conserved mass of these spacetimes, and find that in certain instances the mass and entropy can exceed that of pure de Sitter spacetime, in violation of recent suggestive conjectures to the contrary.
