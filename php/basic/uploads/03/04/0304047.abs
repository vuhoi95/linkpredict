Title: Supersymmetric Extensions of the Harry Dym Hierarchy
Authors: J. C. Brunelli and Ashok Das and Ziemowit Popowicz
Abstract: We study the supersymmetric extensions of the Harry Dym hierarchy of equations. We obtain the susy-B extension, the doubly susy-B extension as well as the N=1 and the N=2 supersymmetric extensions for this system. The N=2 supersymmetric extension is particularly interesting, since it leads to new classical integrable systems in the bosonic limit. We prove the integrability of these systems through the bi-Hamiltonian formulation of integrable models and through the Lax description. We also discuss the supersymmetric extension of the Hunter-Zheng equation which belongs to the Harry Dym hierarchy of equations.
