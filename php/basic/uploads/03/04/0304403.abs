Title: Two Proofs of a Conjecture of Hori and Vafa
Authors: Aaron Bertram and Ionut Ciocan-Fontanine and Bumsig Kim
Abstract: We give two proofs of a conjecture of Hori and Vafa which expresses the J-function (i.e, the generating function for 1-point descendant Gromov-Witten invariants) of a Grassmannian in terms of the J-function of a product of projective spaces. Similar relations are obtained for two-point descendants, and three-point (primary) Gromov-Witten invariants. As an application we prove Givental's "R-Conjecture" - hence the Virasoro conjecture - for Grassmannians.
