Title: Large-N limit of the non-local 2D Yang-Mills and generalized Yang-Mills  theories on a cylinder
Authors: Khaled Saaidi and Mohammad Khorrami
Abstract: The large-group behavior of the nonlocal YM$_2$'s and gYM$_2$'s on a cylinder or a disk is investigated. It is shown that this behavior is similar to that of the corresponding local theory, but with the area of the cylinder replaced by an effective area depending on the dominant representation. The critical areas for nonlocal YM$_2$'s on a cylinder with some special bounary conditions are also obtained.
