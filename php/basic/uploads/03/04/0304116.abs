Title: Quantum Theory of Tensionless Noncommutative p-Branes
Authors: J. Gamboa and M. Loewe and F. Mendez
Abstract: The quantum theory involving noncommutative tensionless p-branes is studied following path integral methods. Our procedure allow a simple treatment for generally covariant noncommutative extended systems and it contains, as a particular case, the thermodynamics and the quantum tensionless string theory. The effect induced by noncommutativity in the field space is to produce a confinement among pairing of null p-branes.
