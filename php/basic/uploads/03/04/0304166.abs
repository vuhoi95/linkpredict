Abstract: Focusing on gauge degrees of freedom specified by a 1+3 dimensions model hosting a Maxwell term plus a Lorentz and CPT non-invariant Chern-Simons-like contribution, we obtain a minimal extension of such a system to a supersymmetric environment. We comment on resulting peculiar self-couplings for the gauge sector, as well as on background contribution for gaugino masses. Furthermore, a non-polynomial generalization is presented.
