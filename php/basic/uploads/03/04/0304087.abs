Title: Many-Body Superconformal Systems from Hamiltonian Reductions
Authors: Stefano Bellucci and Anton Galajinsky and Sergey Krivonos
Abstract: We propose a new reduction mechanism which allows one to construct n-particle (super)conformal theories with pairwise interaction starting from a composite system involving n(n-1)/2+1 copies of the ordinary (super)conformal mechanics. Applications of the scheme include an N=4 superconformal extension for a complexification of the Calogero model and a D(2,1|\alpha)-invariant n-particle system.
