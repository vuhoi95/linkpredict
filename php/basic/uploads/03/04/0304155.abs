Title: Exact String-like Solutions of the Gauged Nonlinear O(3) Model
Authors: H. R. Vanaie and N. Riazi
Abstract: We show that the least energy conditions in the gauged nonlinear sigma model with Chern-Simons term lead to exact soliton-like solutions which have the same features as domain walls. We will derive and discuss the corresponding solutions, and compute the total energy, charge, and spin of the resulting system.
