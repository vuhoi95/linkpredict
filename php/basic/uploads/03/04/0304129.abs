Title: A Dilatonic Deformation of AdS_5 and its Field Theory Dual
Authors: Dongsu Bak and Michael Gutperle and Shinji Hirano
Abstract: We find a nonsupersymmetric dilatonic deformation of $AdS_5$ geometry as an exact nonsingular solution of the type IIB supergravity. The dual gauge theory has a different Yang-Mills coupling in each of the two halves of the boundary spacetime divided by a codimension one defect. We discuss the geometry of our solution in detail, emphasizing the structure of the boundary, and also study the string configurations corresponding to Wilson loops. We also show that that the background is stable under small scalar perturbations.
