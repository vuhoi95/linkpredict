Title: Gibbons-Hawking Effect in the Sonic de Sitter Space-Time of an Expanding  Bose-Einstein-Condensed Gas
Authors: Petr O. Fedichev and Uwe R. Fischer
Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme to observe the Gibbons-Hawking effect in the acoustic analog of a 1+1-dimensional de Sitter universe, produced in an expanding, cigar-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate. It is shown that a two-level system created at the center of the trap, an atomic quantum dot interacting with phonons, observes a thermal Bose distribution at the de Sitter temperature.
