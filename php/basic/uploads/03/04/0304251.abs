Title: On the Geometry of Matrix Models for N=1*
Authors: M. Petrini and A. Tomasiello and A. Zaffaroni
Abstract: We investigate the geometry of the matrix model associated with an N=1 super Yang-Mills theory with three adjoint fields, which is a massive deformation of N=4. We study in particular the Riemann surface underlying solutions with arbitrary number of cuts. We show that an interesting geometrical structure emerges where the Riemann surface is related on-shell to the Donagi-Witten spectral curve. We explicitly identify the quantum field theory resolvents in terms of geometrical data on the surface.
