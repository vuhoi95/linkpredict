Title: Holography of the N=1 Higher-Spin Theory on AdS4
Authors: R. G. Leigh and A. C. Petkou
Abstract: We argue that the N=1 higher-spin theory on AdS4 is holographically dual to the N=1 supersymmetric critical O(N) vector model in three dimensions. This appears to be a special form of the AdS/CFT correspondence in which both regular and irregular bulk modes have similar roles and their interplay leads simultaneously to both the free and the interacting phases of the boundary theory. We study various boundary conditions that correspond to boundary deformations connecting, for large-N, the free and interacting boundary theories. We point out the importance of parity in this holography and elucidate the Higgs mechanism responsible for the breaking of higher-spin symmetry for subleading N.
