Title: Local correlations in a strongly interacting 1D Bose gas
Authors: D. M. Gangardt and G. V. Shlyapnikov
Abstract: We develop an analytical method for calculating local correlations in strongly interacting 1D Bose gases, based on the exactly solvable Lieb-Liniger model. The results are obtained at zero and finite temperatures. They describe the interaction-induced reduction of local many-body correlation functions and can be used for achieving and identifying the strong-coupling Tonks-Girardeau regime in experiments with cold Bose gases in the 1D regime.
