Abstract: We consider N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with fundamental matter in the large-N_c approximation in 1+1 dimensions. We add a Chern-Simons term to give the adjoint partons a mass and solve for the meson bound states. Here ``mesons'' are color-singlet states with two partons in the fundamental representation. The spectrum is exactly supersymmetric, and there is complete degeneracy between the fermion and boson bound states. We find that the mass spectrum is composed of two distinct bands. We analyze the properties of the bound states in each band and find a number of interesting properties of these states. In both bands, some of the states are nearly pure quark-gluon bound states while others are nearly pure squark-gluon bound states. The structure functions of many of the bound states found are very strongly peaked near x=0. The convergence of the numerical approximation appears to be very good in all cases.
