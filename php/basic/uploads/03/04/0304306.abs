Title: electron-positron-photon plasma around a collapsing star
Authors: R. Ruffini and L. Vitagliano and S. -S. Xue
Abstract: We describe electron-positron pairs creation around an electrically charged star core collapsing to an electromagnetic black hole (EMBH), as well as pairs annihilation into photons. We use the kinetic Vlasov equation formalism for the pairs and photons and show that a regime of plasma oscillations is established around the core. As a byproduct of our analysis we can provide an estimate for the thermalization time scale.
