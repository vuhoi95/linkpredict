Title: A Model with Propagating Spinons beyond One Dimension
Authors: F. A. Smirnov and A. M. Tsvelik
Abstract: For the model of frustrated spin-1/2 Heisenberg magnet described in A. A. Nersesyan and A. M. Tsvelik, (Phys. Rev. B{\bf 67}, 024422 (2003)) we calculate correlation functions of staggered magnetization and dimerization. The model is formulated as a collection of antiferromagnetic chains weakly coupled by a frustrated exchange interaction. The calculation done for the case of four chains demonstrates that these functions do not vanish. Since the correlation functions in question factorize into a product of correlation functions of spinon creation and annihilation operators, this constitutes a proof that spinons in this model propagate in the direction perpendicular to the chains.
