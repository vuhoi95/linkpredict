Title: Evidence that highly non-uniform black strings have a conical waist
Authors: Barak Kol and Toby Wiseman
Abstract: Numerical methods have allowed the construction of vacuum non-uniform strings. For sufficient non-uniformity, the local geometry about the minimal horizon sphere (the "waist") was conjectured to be a cone metric. We are able to test this conjecture explicitly giving strong evidence in favour of it. We also show how to extend the conjecture to weakly charged strings.
