Title: Inhomogeneous cosmologies with tachyonic dust as dark matter
Authors: A. Das and A. DeBenedictis
Abstract: A cosmology is considered driven by a stress-energy tensor consisting of a perfect fluid, an inhomogeneous pressure term (which we call a ``tachyonic dust'' for reasons which will become apparent) and a cosmological constant. The inflationary, radiation dominated and matter dominated eras are investigated in detail. In all three eras, the tachyonic pressure decreases with increasing radius of the universe and is thus minimal in the matter dominated era. The gravitational effects of the dust, however, may still strongly affect the universe at present time. In case the tachyonic pressure is positive, it enhances the overall matter {\em density} and is a candidate for dark matter. In the case where the tachyonic pressure is negative, the recent acceleration of the universe can be understood without the need for a cosmological constant. The ordinary matter, however, has positive energy density at all times. In a later section, the extension to a variable cosmological term is investigated and a specific model is put forward such that recent acceleration and future re-collapse is possible.
