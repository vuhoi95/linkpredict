Title: Twisted Moduli Stabilization in Type I String Models
Authors: Tetsutaro Higaki and Tatsuo Kobayashi
Abstract: We consider the model with the dilaton and twisted moduli fields, which is inspired by type I string models. Stabilization of their vacuum expectation values is studied. We find the stabilization of the twisted moduli field has different aspects from the dilaton stabilization.
