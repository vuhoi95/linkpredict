Title: Supertubes in reduced holonomy manifolds
Authors: Joaquim Gomis and Toni Mateos and Pedro J. Silva and Antoine Van Proeyen
Abstract: We show that the supertube configurations exist in all supersymmetric type IIA backgrounds which are purely geometrical and which have, at least, one flat direction. In other words, they exist in any spacetime of the form R^{1,1} x M_8, with M_8 any of the usual reduced holonomy manifolds. These generalised supertubes preserve 1/4 of the supersymmetries preserved by the choice of the manifold M_8. We also support this picture with the construction of their corresponding family of IIA supergravity backgrounds preserving from 1/4 to 1/32 of the total supercharges.
