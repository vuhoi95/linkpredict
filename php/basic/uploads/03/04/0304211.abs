Title: Three-dimensional black hole entropy
Authors: Jan Troost and Asato Tsuchiya
Abstract: We discuss in detail the properties of gravity with a negative cosmological constant as viewed in Cherns-Simons theory on a line times a disc. We reanalyze the problem of computing the BTZ entropy, and show how the demand of unitarity and modular invariance of the boundary conformal field theory severely constrain proposals in this framework.
