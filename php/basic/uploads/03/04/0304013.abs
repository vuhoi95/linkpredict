Title: Superconformal boundary conditions for the WZW model
Authors: Cecilia Albertsson and Ulf Lindstrom and Maxim Zabzine
Abstract: We review the most general, local, superconformal boundary conditions for the two-dimensional N=1 and N=2 non-linear sigma models, and analyse them for the N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric WZW models. We find that the gluing map between the left and right affine currents is generalised in a very specific way as compared to the constant Lie algebra automorphisms that are known.
