Title: A model displaying extremely inhomogeneous matter distribution in  General Relativity
Authors: Elcio Abdalla and Cecilia B. M. H. Chirenti
Abstract: We consider a toy metric in four dimensional space-time defined in terms of a recursive hierarchical prescription. The matter distribution turns out to be extremely inhomogeneous. Surprisingly, for very large samples the average mass density tends (very slowly) to a constant. There is no trace of fractal dimension left.
