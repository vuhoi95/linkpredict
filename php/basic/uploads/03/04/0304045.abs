Title: Tachyon Effective Actions In Open String Theory
Authors: David Kutasov and Vasilis Niarchos
Abstract: We argue that the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action coupled to a tachyon, that is known to reproduce some aspects of open string dynamics, can be obtained from open string theory in a certain limit, which generalizes the limit leading to the usual DBI action. This helps clarify which aspects of the full open string theory are captured by this action.
