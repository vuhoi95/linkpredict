Title: On Deriving Space-Time From Quantum Observables and States
Authors: S. J. Summers and R. K. White
Abstract: We prove that, under suitable assumptions, operationally motivated data completely determine a space-time in which the quantum systems can be interpreted as evolving. At the same time, the dynamics of the quantum system is also determined. To minimize technical complications, this is done in the example of three-dimensional Minkowski space.
