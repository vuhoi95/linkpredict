Title: Construction of bosonic string theory on infinitely curved Anti-de  Sitter space
Authors: Adam Clark and Andreas Karch and Pavel Kovtun and Daisuke Yamada
Abstract: Free scalar field theory in the sector with a large number of particles can be interpreted as bosonic string theory on anti-de Sitter space of vanishing radius. Different ways of writing the field theory Hamiltonian translate to different ways of reparametrizing the world-sheet sigma coordinate. Adding a mass term in the field theory corresponds to cutting off the warped AdS direction, with cut-off inversely proportional to the mass. The string theory has neither tachyon, nor critical dimension.
