Title: The 3-string vertex and the AdS/CFT duality in the PP-wave limit
Authors: Paolo Di Vecchia and Jens Lyng Petersen and Michela Petrini and Rodolfo Russo and Alessandro Tanzini
Abstract: We pursue the study of string interactions in the PP-wave background and show that the proposal of hep-th/0211188 can be extended to a full supersymmetric vertex. Then we compute some string amplitudes in both the bosonic and fermionic sector, finding agreement with the field theory results at leading order in lambda'.
