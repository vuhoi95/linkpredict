Title: Quasi-Supersymmetric $G^3$ Unification from Intersecting D6-Branes on  Type IIA Orientifolds
Authors: Tianjun Li and Tao Liu
Abstract: We construct three quasi-supersymmetric $G^3$ GUT models with $S_3$ symmetry and gauge coupling unification from intersecting D6-branes on Type IIA orientifolds. The Standard Model fermions and Higgs doublets can be embedded into the bifundamental representations in these models, and there is no any other unnecessary massless representation. Especially in Model I with gauge group $U(4)^3$, we just have three-family SM fermions and three pairs of Higgs particles. The $G^3$ gauge symmetry in these models can be broken down to the Standard Model gauge symmetry by introducing light open string states. And 1 TeV scale supersymmetry breaking soft masses imply the reasonable intermediate string scale.
