Title: Effective Superpotentials via Konishi Anomaly
Authors: L. F. Alday and M. Cirafici
Abstract: We use Ward identities derived from the generalized Konishi anomaly in order to compute effective superpotentials for SU(N), SO(N) and $Sp(N)$ supersymmetric gauge theories coupled to matter in various representations. In particular we focus on cubic and quartic tree level superpotentials. With this technique higher order corrections to the perturbative part of the effective superpotential can be easily evaluated.
