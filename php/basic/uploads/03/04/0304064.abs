Title: All supersymmetric solutions of minimal gauged supergravity in five  dimensions
Authors: Jerome P. Gauntlett and Jan B. Gutowski
Abstract: All purely bosonic supersymmetric solutions of minimal gauged supergravity in five dimensions are classified. The solutions fall into two classes depending on whether the Killing vector constructed from the Killing spinor is time-like or null. When it is timelike, the solutions are determined by a four-dimensional Kahler base-manifold, up to an anti-holomorphic function, and generically preserve 1/4 of the supersymmetry. When it is null we provide a precise prescription for constructing the solutions and we show that they generically preserve 1/4 of the supersymmetry. We show that $AdS_5$ is the unique maximally supersymmetric configuration. The formalism is used to construct some new solutions, including a non-singular deformation of $AdS_5$, which can be uplifted to obtain new solutions of type IIB supergravity
