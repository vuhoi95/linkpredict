Title: Difference between AdS and dS spaces: wave equation approach
Authors: Y. S. Myung and N. J. Kim
Abstract: We study the wave equation for a massive scalar field in three-dimensional AdS-black hole and dS (de Sitter) spaces to find what is the difference and similarity between two spaces. Here the AdS-black hole is provided by the J=0 BTZ black hole. To investigate its event (cosmological) horizons, we compute the absorption cross section, quasinormal modes, and study the AdS(dS)/CFT correspondences. Although there remains an unclear point in defining the ingoing flux near infinity of the BTZ black hole, quasinormal modes are obtained and the AdS/CFT correspondence is confirmed. However, we do not find quasinormal modes and thus do not confirm the assumed dS/CFT correspondence. This difference between AdS-black hole and dS spaces is very interesting, because their global structures are similar to each other.
