Title: On the relation between the propagators of dual theories
Authors: A. P. Baeta Scarpelli and M. Botta Cantcheff and J. A. Helayel-Neto
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the propagator of the dual of a general Proca-like theory, derived from the gauging iterative Noether Dualization Method, can be written by means of a simple relation between known propagators. This result is also a demonstration that the Lagrangian obtained by dualization describes the same physical particles as the ones present in the original theory at the expense of introducing new non-physical (ghosts) excitations.
