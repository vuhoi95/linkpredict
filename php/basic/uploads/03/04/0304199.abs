Title: Negative Energy Density in Calabi-Yau Compactifications
Authors: Thomas Hertog and Gary T. Horowitz and Kengo Maeda
Abstract: We show that a large class of supersymmetric compactifications, including all simply connected Calabi-Yau and G_2 manifolds, have classical configurations with negative energy density as seen from four dimensions. In fact, the energy density can be arbitrarily negative -- it is unbounded from below. Nevertheless, positive energy theorems show that the total ADM energy remains positive. Physical consequences of the negative energy density include new thermal instabilities, and possible violations of cosmic censorship.
