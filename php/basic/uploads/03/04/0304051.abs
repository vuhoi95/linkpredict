Title: Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry Generated by Loop Quantum Gravity
Authors: Gaetano Lambiase and Parampreet Singh
Abstract: We show that Loop Quantum Gravity provides new mechanisms through which observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe can naturally arise at temperatures less than GUT scale. This is enabled through the introduction of a new length scale ${\cal L}$, much greater than Planck length ($l_P$), to obtain semi-classical weave states in the theory. This scale which depends on the momentum of the particle modifies the dispersion relation for different helicities of fermions and leads to lepton asymmetry.
