Abstract: Segal proposed ultraquantum commutation relations with two ultraquantum constants hbar' and hbar'' besides Planck's quantum constant hbar with a variable i. The Heisenberg quantum algebra is a contraction - in a more general sense than that of Inonu and Wigner - of the Segal ultraquantum algebra. The usual constant i arises as a vacuum order-parameter in the quantum limit where hbar' and hbar'' approach zero. One physical consequence is a discrete spectrum for canonical variable and space-time coordinates. Another is an interconvention of time and energy accompnying space-time meltdown (disorder), with a fundamental conversion factor of some kilograms of energy per second.
