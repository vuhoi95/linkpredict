Title: A note on accelerating cosmologies from compactifications and S-branes
Authors: Roberto Emparan and Jaume Garriga
Abstract: We give a simple interpretation of the recent solutions for cosmologies with a transient accelerating phase obtained from compactification in hyperbolic manifolds, or from S-brane solutions of string/M-theory. In the four-dimensional picture, these solutions correspond to bouncing the radion field off its exponential potential. Acceleration occurs at the turning point, when the radion stops and the potential energy momentarily dominates. The virtues and limitations of these approaches become quite transparent in this interpretation.
