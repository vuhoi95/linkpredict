Title: Supereigenvalue Model and Dijkgraaf-Vafa Proposal
Authors: H. Itoyama and H. Kanno
Abstract: We present a variant of the supereigenvalue model proposed before by Alvarez-Gaume, Itoyama, Manes, and Zadra. This model derives a set of three planar loop equations which takes the same form as the set of three anomalous Ward-Takahashi identities on the gaugino condensates recently derived by Cachazo, Douglas, Seiberg and Witten. Another model which implements N=2 superVirasoro constraints is constructed for comparison.
