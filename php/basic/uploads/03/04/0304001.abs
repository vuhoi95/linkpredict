Title: Properties Of Heterotic Vacua From Superpotentials
Authors: Katrin Becker and Melanie Becker and Keshav Dasgupta and Sergey Prokushkin
Abstract: We study the superpotential for the heterotic string compactified on non-Kahler complex manifolds. We show that many of the geometrical properties of these manifolds can be understood from the proposed superpotential. In particular we give an estimate of the radial modulus of these manifolds. We also show, how the torsional constraints can be obtained from this superpotential.
