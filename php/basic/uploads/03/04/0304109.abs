Abstract: We study the massless scalar wave propagation in the time-dependent Schwarzschild black hole background. We find that the Kruskal coordinate is an appropriate framework to investigate the time-dependent spacetime. A time-dependent scattering potential is derived by considering dynamical black hole with parameters changing with time. It is shown that in the quasinormal ringing both the decay time-scale and oscillation are modified in the time-dependent background.
