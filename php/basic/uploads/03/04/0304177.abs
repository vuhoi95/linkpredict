Title: A Note on Acceleration from Product Space Compactification
Authors: Chiang-Mei Chen and Pei-Ming Ho and Ishwaree P. Neupane and John E. Wang
Abstract: We study compactifications of Einstein gravity on product spaces in vacuum and their acceleration phases. Scalar potentials for the dimensionally reduced effective theory are found to be of exponential form and exact solutions are obtained for a class of product spaces. The inflation in our solutions is not sufficient for the early universe. We comment on the possibility of obtaining sufficient inflation by compactification in general.
