Title: QFT holography near the horizon of Schwarzschild-like spacetimes
Authors: V. Moretti and N. Pinamonti
Abstract: It is argued that free QFT can be defined on the event horizon of a Schwarzschild-like spacetime and that this theory is unitarily and algebraically equivalent to QFT in the bulk (near the horizon). Under that unitary equivalence the bulk hidden SL(2,R) symmetry found in a previous work becomes manifest on the event horizon, it being induced by a group of horizon diffeomorphisms. The class of generators of that group can be enlarged to include a full Virasoro algebra of fields which are defined on the event horizon. These generators have a quantum representation in QFT on the event horizon and thus in the bulk.
