Title: Electrons on Hexagonal lattices and applications to nanotubes
Authors: Betti Hartmann and Wojtek J. Zakrzewski
Abstract: We consider a Froehlich-type Hamiltonian on a hexagonal lattice. Aiming to describe nanotubes, we choose this 2-dimensional lattice to be periodic and to have a large extension in one (x) direction and a small extension in the other (y) direction. We study the existence of solitons in this model using both analytical and numerical methods. We find exact solutions of our equations and discuss some of their properties.
