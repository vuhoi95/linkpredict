Title: Towards the entropy of gravity time-dependent models via the  Cardy-Verlinde formula
Authors: Octavio Obregon and Leonardo Patino and Hernando Quevedo
Abstract: For models with several time-dependent components generalized entropies can be defined. This is shown for the Bianchi type IX model. We first derive the Cardy-Verlinde formula under the assumption that the first law of thermodynamics is valid. This leads to an explicit expression of the total entropy associated with this type of universes. Assuming the validity of the Cardy entropy formula, we obtain expressions for the corresponding Bekenstein, Bekenstein-Hawking and Hubble entropies. We discuss the validity of the Cardy-Verlinde formula and possible extensions of the outlined procedure to other time-dependent models.
