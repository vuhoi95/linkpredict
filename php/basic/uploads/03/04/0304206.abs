Title: The Symmetry of M-Theories
Authors: F. Englert and L. Houart and A. Taormina and P. West
Abstract: We consider the Cartan subalgebra of any very extended algebra G+++ where G is a simple Lie algebra and let the parameters be space-time fields. These are identified with diagonal metrics and dilatons. Using the properties of the algebra, we find that for all very extensions G+++ of simple Lie algebras there are theories of gravity and matter, which admit classical solutions carrying representations of the Weyl group of G+++. We also identify the T and S-dualities of superstrings and of the bosonic string with Weyl reflections and outer automorphisms of well-chosen very extended algebras and we exhibit specific features of the very extensions. We take these results as indication that very extended algebras underlie symmetries of any consistent theory of gravity and matter, and might encode basic information for the construction of such theory.
