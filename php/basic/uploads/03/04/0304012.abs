Title: Holographic entropy bound in two-dimensional gravity
Authors: Masafumi Fukuma and Akitsugu Miwa and Kazuyoshi Takahashi
Abstract: Bousso's entropy bound for two-dimensional gravity is investigated in the lightcone gauge. It is shown that due to the Weyl anomaly, the null component of the energy-momentum tensor takes a nonvanishing value, and thus, combined with the conditions that were recently proposed by Bousso, Flanagan and Marolf, a holographic entropy bound similar to Bousso's is expected to hold in two dimensions. A connection of our result to that of Strominger and Thompson is also discussed.
