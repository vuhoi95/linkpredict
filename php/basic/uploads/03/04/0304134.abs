Title: Phenomenology and Theory of Possible Light Higgs Bosons
Authors: G. L. Kane and Brent D. Nelson and Lian-Tao Wang and Ting T. Wang
Abstract: We study the implications of the absence of a direct discovery of a Higgs boson at LEP. First we exhibit 15 physically different ways in which one or more Higgs bosons lighter than the LEP limit could still exist. In the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) all of these, as well as the cases where the Higgs mass equals or exceeds 115 GeV, seem fine-tuned. We examine some interpretations of the fine tuning in high scale theories. The least fine-tuned MSSM outcome will have a Higgs mass at 115 GeV, while approaches that extend the MSSM at the weak scale can naturally have larger Higgs masses.
