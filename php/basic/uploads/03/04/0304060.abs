Title: Cardy-Verlinde Formula and Achucarro-Ortiz Black Hole
Authors: Mohammad R. Setare and Elias C. Vagenas
Abstract: In this paper it is shown that the entropy of the black hole horizon in the Achucarro-Ortiz spacetime, which is the most general two-dimensional black hole derived from the three-dimensional rotating BTZ black hole, can be described by the Cardy-Verlinde formula. The latter is supposed to be an entropy formula of conformal field theory in any dimension.
