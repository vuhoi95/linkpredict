Title: Density perturbations in a brane-world universe with dark radiation
Authors: Burin Gumjudpai and Roy Maartens and Christopher Gordon
Abstract: We investigate the effects on cosmological density perturbations of dark radiation in a Randall-Sundrum 2 type brane-world. Dark radiation in the background is limited by observational constraints to be a small fraction of the radiation energy density, but it has an interesting qualitative effect in the radiation era. On large scales, it serves to slightly suppress the radiation density perturbations at late times, while boosting the perturbations in dark radiation. In a kinetic (stiff) era, the suppression is much stronger, and drives the density perturbations to zero.
