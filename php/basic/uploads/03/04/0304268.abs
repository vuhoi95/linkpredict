Title: Lectures on Two-Dimensional Noncommutative Gauge Theory 2: Quantization
Authors: L. D. Paniak and R. J. Szabo
Abstract: These notes comprise the second part of two articles devoted to the construction of exact solutions of noncommutative gauge theory in two spacetime dimensions. Here we shall deal with the quantum field theory. Topics covered include an investigation of the symmetries of quantum gauge theory on the noncommutative torus within the path integral formalism, the derivation of the exact expression for the vacuum amplitude, and the classification of instanton contributions. A section dealing with a new, exact combinatorial solution of gauge theory on a two-dimensional fuzzy torus is also included.
