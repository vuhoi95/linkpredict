Title: Current-Current Deformations of Conformal Field Theories, and WZW Models
Authors: Stefan Forste and Daniel Roggenkamp
Abstract: Moduli spaces of conformal field theories corresponding to current-current deformations are discussed. For WZW models, CFT and sigma model considerations are compared. It is shown that current-current deformed WZW models have WZW-like sigma model descriptions with non-bi-invariant metrics, additional B-fields and a non-trivial dilaton.
