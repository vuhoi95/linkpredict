Title: Classes of exact wavefunctions for general time-dependent Dirac  Hamiltonians in 1+1 dimensions
Authors: A. S. de Castro and A. de Souza Dutra
Abstract: In this work we construct two classes of exact solutions for the most general time-dependent Dirac Hamiltonian in 1+1 dimensions. Some problems regarding to some formal solutions in the literature are discussed. Finally the existence of a generalized Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant connected with such solutions is discussed.
