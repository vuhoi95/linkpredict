Title: Thermodynamic behavior of IIA string theory on a pp-wave
Authors: Seungjoon Hyun and Jong-Dae Park and Sang-Heon Yi
Abstract: We obtain the thermal one loop free energy and the Hagedorn temperature of IIA superstring theory on the pp-wave geometry which comes from the circle compactification of the maximally supersymmetric eleven dimensional one. We use both operator and path integral methods and find the complete agreement between them in the free energy expression. In particular, the free energy in the $\mu \to \infty$ limit is shown to be identical with that of IIB string theory on maximally supersymmetric pp-wave, which indicates the universal thermal behavior of strings in the large class of pp-wave backgrounds. We show that the zero point energy and the modular properties of the free energy are naturally incorporated into the path integral formalism.
