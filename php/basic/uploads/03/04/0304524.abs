Title: Gravitational Field of Static Thin Planar Walls in Weak-Field  Approximation
Authors: L. Campanelli and P. Cea and G. L. Fogli and L. Tedesco
Abstract: We investigate gravitational properties of thin planar wall solutions of the Einstein's equations in the weak field approximation. We find the general metric solutions and discuss the behavior of a particle placed initially at rest to one side of the plane. Moreover we study the case of non-reflection-symmetric solutions.
