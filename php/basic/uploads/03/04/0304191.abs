Title: The String Light Cone in the pp-wave Background
Authors: Chong-Sun Chu and Konstantinos Kyritsis
Abstract: In this letter, we determine the particle and the string light cone in the pp-wave background. The result is a deformed version of the flat one. We point out the light cone exhibits an intriguing periodicity in the light cone time direction x^+ with a period \sim 1/ \mu. Our results also suggest that a quantum theory in the pp-wave background can be formulated consistently only if the background is periodic in the light cone time x^+.
