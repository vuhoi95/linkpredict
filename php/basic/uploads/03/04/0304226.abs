Title: Inflation from Tachyon Condensation, Large N Effects
Authors: Mahbub Majumdar and Anne-Christine Davis
Abstract: Using only general properties of the tachyon potential we show that inflation may be generic when many branes and anti-branes become coincident. Inflation may occur because of: (1) the assistance of the many diagonal tachyon fields; (2) when the tachyons condense in a staggered fashion; or (3) when some of them condense very late. We point out that such inflation is in some sense a stringy implementation of chaotic inflation and may have important applications for ``regularizing'' a lopsided or singular cosmological compact surface.
