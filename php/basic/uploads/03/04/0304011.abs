Title: Modified triplectic quantization in general coordinates
Authors: B. Geyer and P. M. Lavrov
Abstract: We present an extension of previous results (hep-th/0105215)on the quantization of general gauge theories within the BRST-antBRST invatiant Lagrangian scheme in general coordinates, namely, we consider the case when the base manifold of fields and antifields is a supermanifold desribed in terms of both bosonic and fermionic variables.
