Title: CMB Power Spectrum from Noncommutative Spacetime
Authors: Qing Guo Huang and Miao Li
Abstract: Very recent CMB data of WMAP offers an opportunity to test inflation models, in particular, the running of spectral index is quite new and can be used to rule out some models. We show that an noncommutative spacetime inflation model gives a good explanation of these new results. In fitting the data, we also obtain a relationship between the noncommutative parameter (string scale) and the ending time of inflation.
