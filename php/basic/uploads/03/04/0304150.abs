Abstract: We present a classification of diagonal, antidiagonal and mixed reflection matrices related to Yangian and super-Yangian R matrices associated to the infinite series so(m), sp(n) and osp(m|n). We formulate the analytical Bethe Ansatz resolution for the so(m) and sp(n) open spin chains with boundary conditions described by the diagonal solutions.
