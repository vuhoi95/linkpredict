Title: Radion Assisted Gauge Inflation
Authors: M. Fairbairn and L. Lopez-Honorez and M. H. G. Tytgat
Abstract: We propose an extension to the recently proposed extranatural or gauge inflation scenario in which the radius modulus field around which the Wilson loop is wrapped assists inflation as it shrinks. We discuss how this might lead to more generic initial conditions for inflation.
