Authors: Masato Arai and Masashi Naganuma and Muneto Nitta and Norisuke Sakai
Abstract: BPS wall solutions are obtained for N=2 supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model with Eguchi-Hanson target manifold in a manifestly supersymmetric manner. The model is constructed by a massive hyper-Kahler quotient method both in the N=1 superfield and in the N=2 superfield (harmonic superspace). We describe the model in simple terms and give relations between various parameterizations which are useful to describe the model and the solution. Some more details can be found in our previous paper [hep-th/0211103]. This article is dedicated to Professor Hiroshi Ezawa on the occasion of his seventieth birthday.
