Title: Nucleation of $^{(4)}R$ Brane Universes
Authors: Ruben Cordero and Efrain Rojas
Abstract: The creation of brane universes induced by a totally antisymmetric tensor living in a fixed background spacetime is presented, where a term involving the intrinsic curvature of the brane is considered. A canonical quantum mechanical approach employing Wheeler-DeWitt equation is done. The probability nucleation for the brane is calculated taking into account both an instanton method and a WKB approximation. Some cosmological implications arose from the model are presented.
