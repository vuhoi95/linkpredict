Title: More on Superstrings in AdS(3) x N
Authors: Amit Giveon and Ari Pakman
Abstract: We study superstring theories on AdS(3) x N backgrounds yielding N=2,3,4 extended superconformal symmetries in the dual boundary CFT. In each case the necessary constraints on the internal worldsheet theory N are found.
