Title: Noncommutative Self-dual Gravity
Authors: H. Garcia-Compean and O. Obregon and C. Ramirez and M. Sabido
Abstract: Starting from a self-dual formulation of gravity, we obtain a noncommutative theory of pure Einstein theory in four dimensions. In order to do that, we use Seiberg-Witten map. It is shown that the noncommutative torsion constraint is solved by the vanishing of commutative torsion. Finally, the noncommutative corrections to the action are computed up to second order.
