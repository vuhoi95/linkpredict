Title: Trigonometric Solutions of the WDVV Equations from Root Systems
Authors: R. Martini and L. K. Hoevenaars
Abstract: By introduction of an additional variable and addition of a Weyl invariant correction term to the perturbative prepotential in five-dimensional Seiberg-Witten theory we construct solutions of the WDVV equations of trigonometric type for all crystallographic root systems.
