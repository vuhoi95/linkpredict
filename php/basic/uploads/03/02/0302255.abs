Title: Heat content, torsional rigidity and generalized Hardy inequalities for  complete Riemannian manifolds
Authors: Michiel van den Berg and Peter B. Gilkey
Abstract: We obtain upper bounds on the heat content and on the torsional rigidity of a complete Riemannian manifold M, assuming a generalized Hardy inequality for the Dirichlet Laplacian on M.
