Title: The C-Deformation of Gluino and Non-planar Diagrams
Authors: Hirosi Ooguri and Cumrun Vafa
Abstract: We consider a deformation of N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions, which we call the C-deformation, where the gluino field satisfies a Clifford-like algebra dictated by a self-dual two-form, instead of the standard Grassmannian algebra. The superpotential of the deformed gauge theory is computed by the full partition function of an associated matrix model (or more generally a bosonic gauge theory), including non-planar diagrams. In this identification, the strength of the two-form controls the genus expansion of the matrix model partition function. For the case of pure N=1 Yang-Mills this deformation leads to the identification of the all genus partition function of c=1 non-critical bosonic string at self-dual radius as the glueball superpotential. Though the C-deformation violates Lorentz invariance, the deformed F-terms are Lorentz invariant and the Lorentz violation is screened in the IR.
