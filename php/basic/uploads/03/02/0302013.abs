Title: Energy-Charge Dependence for Q-Balls
Authors: T. A. Ioannidou and V. B. Kopeliovich and N. D. Vlachos
Abstract: We show that many numerically established properties of Q-balls can be understood in terms of analytic approximations for a certain type of potential. In particular, we derive an explicit formula between the energy and the charge of the Q-ball valid for a wide range of the charge Q.
