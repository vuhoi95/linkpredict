Title: A note on alpha-vacua and interacting field theory in de Sitter space
Authors: Kevin Goldstein and David A. Lowe
Abstract: We set up a consistent renormalizable perturbation theory of a scalar field in a nontrivial alpha vacuum in de Sitter space. Although one representation of the effective action involves non-local interactions between anti-podal points, we show the theory leads to causal physics, and we prove a spectral theorem for the interacting two-point function. We construct the renormalized stress energy tensor and show this develops no imaginary part at leading order in the interactions, consistent with stability.
