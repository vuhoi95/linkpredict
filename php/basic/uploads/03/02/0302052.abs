Title: On singular Lagrangians affine in velocities
Authors: José F. Cariñena and José Fernández-Núñez and Manuel F. Rañada
Abstract: The properties of Lagrangians affine in velocities are analyzed in a geometric way. These systems are necessarily singular and exhibit, in general, gauge invariance. The analysis of constraint functions and gauge symmetry leads us to a complete classification of such Lagrangians.
