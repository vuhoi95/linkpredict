Title: Gapless two-flavor color superconductor
Authors: Igor Shovkovy and Mei Huang
Abstract: A new, gapless two-flavor color superconducting phase that appears under conditions of local charge neutrality and $\beta$-equilibrium is revealed. In this phase, the symmetry of the ground state is the same as in the conventional two-flavor color superconductor. In the low-energy spectrum of this phase, however, there are only two gapped fermionic quasiparticles, and the other four quasiparticles are gapless. The origin and the basic properties of the gapless two-flavor color superconductor are discussed. This phase is a natural candidate for quark matter in cores of compact stars.
