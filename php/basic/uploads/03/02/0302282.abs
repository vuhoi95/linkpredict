Title: Non-commutative field theory approach to two-dimensional vortex liquid  system
Authors: Kyungsun Moon and Vincent Pasquier and Chaiho Rim and Joonhyun Yeo
Abstract: We investigate the non-commutative (NC) field theory approach to the vortex liquid system restricted to the lowest Landau level (LLL) approximation. NC field theory effectively takes care of the phase space reduction of the LLL physics in a $\star$-product form and introduces a new gauge invariant form of a quartic potential of the order parameter in the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) free energy. This new quartic interaction coupling term has a non-trivial equivalence relation with that obtained by Br\'ezin, Nelson and Thiaville in the usual GL framework. The consequence of the equivalence is discussed.
