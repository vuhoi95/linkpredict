Abstract: A light-front Hamiltonian reproducing the results of two-dimensional quantum electrodynamics in the Lorentz coordinates is constructed using the bosonization procedure and an analysis of the bosonic perturbation theory in all orders in the fermion mass. The resulting Hamiltonian involves a supplementary counterterm in addition to the usual terms appearing in the naive light-front quantization. This term is proportional to a linear combination of zeroth fermion modes (which are multiplied by a factor compensating the charge and fermion number). The coefficient of the counterterm has no ultraviolet divergence, depends on the value of the fermion condensate in the \theta-vacuum, and is linear in this value for a small fermion mass.
