Title: Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz for the Spin-1/2 Staggered XXZ- Model
Authors: V. V. Mkhitaryan and A. G. Sedrakyan
Abstract: We develop the technique of Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz to investigate the ground state and the spectrum in the thermodynamic limit of the staggered $XXZ$ models proposed recently as an example of integrable ladder model. This model appeared due to staggered inhomogeneity of the anisotropy parameter $\Delta$ and the staggered shift of the spectral parameter. We give the structure of ground states and lowest lying excitations in two different phases which occur at zero temperature.
