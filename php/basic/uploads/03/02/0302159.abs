Title: Open strings in relativistic ion traps
Authors: B. Durin and B. Pioline
Abstract: Electromagnetic plane waves provide examples of time-dependent open string backgrounds free of $\alpha'$ corrections. The solvable case of open strings in a quadrupolar wave front, analogous to pp-waves for closed strings, is discussed. In light-cone gauge, it leads to non-conformal boundary conditions similar to those induced by tachyon condensates. A maximum electric gradient is found, at which macroscopic strings with vanishing tension are pair-produced -- a non-relativistic analogue of the Born-Infeld critical electric field. Kinetic instabilities of quadrupolar electric fields are cured by standard atomic physics techniques, and do not interfere with the former dynamic instability. A new example of non-conformal open-closed duality is found. Propagation of open strings in time-dependent wave fronts is discussed.
