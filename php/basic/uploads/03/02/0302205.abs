Title: On the Background Field Method Beyond One Loop: A manifestly covariant  derivative expansion in super Yang-Mills theories
Authors: S. M. Kuzenko and I. N. McArthur
Abstract: There are currently many string inspired conjectures about the structure of the low-energy effective action for super Yang-Mills theories which require explicit multi-loop calculations. In this paper, we develop a manifestly covariant derivative expansion of superspace heat kernels and present a scheme to evaluate multi-loop contributions to the effective action in the framework of the background field method. The crucial ingredient of the construction is a detailed analysis of the properties of the parallel displacement propagators associated with Yang-Mills supermultiples in N-extended superspace.
