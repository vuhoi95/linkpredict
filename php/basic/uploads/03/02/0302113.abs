Title: Quantum Scattering in Two Black Hole Moduli Space
Authors: Kenji Sakamoto and Kiyoshi Shiraishi
Abstract: We discuss the quantum scattering process in the moduli space consisting of two maximally charged dilaton black holes. The black hole moduli space geometry has different structures for arbitrary dimensions and various values of dilaton coupling. We study the quantum effects of the different moduli space geometries with scattering process. Then, it is found that there is a resonance state on certain moduli spaces.
