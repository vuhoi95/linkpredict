Title: Fermion Doubling and Berenstein--Maldacena--Nastase Correspondence
Authors: Stefano Bellucci and Corneliu Sochichiu
Abstract: We show that the string bit model suffers from doubling in the fermionic sector. The doubling leads to strong violation of supersymmetry in the limit $N\to\infty$. Since there is an exact correspondence between string bits and the algebra of BMN operators even at finite $N$, doubling is expected also on the side of super-Yang--Mills theory. We discuss the origin of the doubling in the BMN sector.
