Title: The Standard Model Partly Supersymmetric
Authors: Tony Gherghetta and Alex Pomarol
Abstract: We present a novel class of theories where supersymmetry is only preserved in a partial (non-isolated) sector. The supersymmetric sector consists of CFT bound-states that can coexist with fundamental states which do not respect supersymmetry. These theories arise from the 4D holographic interpretation of 5D theories in a slice of AdS where supersymmetry is broken on the UV boundary. In particular, we consider the Standard Model where only the Higgs sector (and possibly the top quark) is supersymmetric. The Higgs mass-parameter is then protected by supersymmetry, and consequently the electroweak scale is naturally smaller than the composite Higgs scale. This not only provides a solution to the hierarchy problem, but predicts a ``little'' hierarchy between the electroweak and new physics scale. Remarkably, the model only contains a single supersymmetric partner, the Higgsino (and possibly the stop), and as in the usual MSSM, predicts a light Higgs boson.
