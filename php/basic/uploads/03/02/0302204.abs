Title: The Phenomenon of Darboux Displacements
Authors: David J. Fernandez C. and Bogdan Mielnik and Oscar Rosas-Ortiz and Boris F. Samsonov
Abstract: For a class of Schrodinger Hamiltonians the supersymmetry transformations can degenerate to simple coordinate displacements. We examine this phenomenon and show that it distinguishes the Weierstrass potentials including the one-soliton wells and periodic Lame functions. A supersymmetric sense of the addition formula for the Weierstrass functions is elucidated.
