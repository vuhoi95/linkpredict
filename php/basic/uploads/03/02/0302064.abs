Title: Consistent discrete gravity solution of the problem of time: a model
Authors: Rodolfo Gambini and Rafael Porto and Jorge Pullin
Abstract: The recently introduced consistent discrete lattice formulation of canonical general relativity produces a discrete theory that is constraint-free. This immediately allows to overcome several of the traditional obstacles posed by the ``problem of time'' in totally constrained systems and quantum gravity and cosmology. In particular, one can implement the Page--Wootters relational quantization. This brief paper discusses this idea in the context of a simple model system --the parameterized particle-- that is usually considered one of the crucial tests for any proposal for solution to the problem of time in quantum gravity.
