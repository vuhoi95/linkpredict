Authors: M. S. Shikakhwa and N. K. Pak
Abstract: A partial wave analysis using the basis of the total angular momentum operator J_3 is carried out for the first order Born amplitude of a Dirac particle in an Aharonov-Bohm (AB)potential. It is demonstrated that the s-partial wave contributes to the scattering amplitude in contrast to the case with scalar non-relativistic particles.We suggest that this explains the fact that the first order Born amplitude of a Dirac particle coincides with the exact amplitude expanded to the same order, where it does not for a scalar particle. An interesting algebra involving the Dirac velocity operator and the angular observables is discovered and its consequences are exploited.
