Abstract: We consider N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with fundamental matter in the large-N_c approximation in 1+1 dimensions. We add a Chern-Simons term to give the adjoint partons a mass and solve for the meson bound states. Here mesons are color-singlet states with two partons in the fundamental representation but are not necessarily bosons. We find that this theory has anomalously light meson bound states at intermediate and strong coupling. We also examine the structure functions for these states and find that they prefer to have as many partons as possible at low longitudinal momentum fraction.
