Title: Gauge Threshold Corrections in Intersecting Brane World Models
Authors: D. Lust and S. Stieberger
Abstract: We calculate the one-loop corrections to gauge couplings in N=1 supersymmetric brane world models, which are realized in an type IIA orbifold/orientifold background with several stacks of D6 branes wrapped on 3-cycles with non-vanishing intersections. Contributions arise from both N=1 and N=2 open string subsectors. In contrast to what is known from ordinary orbifold theories, N=1 subsectors give rise to moduli-dependent one-loop corrections.
