Title: A Note on T-duality of Strings in Plane-Wave Backgrounds
Authors: Shun'ya Mizoguchi and Takeshi Mogami and Yuji Satoh
Abstract: We show, by direct computations of bosonic string spectra, the O(d,d;Z) (d=1,2) T-duality in the maximally supersymmetric IIB plane-wave background compactified on S^1 and T^2. Only half of the ordinary set of zero modes appear in the Hamiltonian. This "half" Narain lattice is proved to be stabilized by the T-duality group.
