Title: Time varying $Î±$ in N=8 extended Supergravity
Authors: Qing-Guo Huang and Miao Li
Abstract: There has been some evidence that the fine structure "constant" $\alpha$ may vary with time. We point out that this variation can be described by a scalar field in some supergravity theory in our toy model, for instance, the N=8 extended supergravity in four dimensions which can be accommodated in M-theory.
