Title: Two-dimensional SUSY-pseudo-Hermiticity without separation of variables
Authors: F. Cannata and M. V. Ioffe and D. N. Nishnianidze
Abstract: We study SUSY-intertwining for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with special emphasis to the two-dimensional generalized Morse potential, which does not allow for separation of variables. The complexified methods of SUSY-separation of variables and two-dimensional shape invariance are used to construct particular solutions - both for complex conjugated energy pairs and for non-paired complex energies.
