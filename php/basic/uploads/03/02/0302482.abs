Title: Local scale invariance as dynamical space-time symmetry in  phase-ordering kinetics
Authors: Malte Henkel and Michel Pleimling
Abstract: The scaling of the spatio-temporal response of coarsening systems is studied through simulations of the 2D and 3D Ising model with Glauber dynamics. The scaling functions agree with the prediction of local scale invariance, extending dynamical scaling to a space-time dynamical symmetry.
