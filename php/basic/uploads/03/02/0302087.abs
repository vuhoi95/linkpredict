Title: Gauge Quintessence
Authors: L. Pilo and D. A. J. Rayner and A. Riotto
Abstract: We discuss a new model of quintessence in which the quintessence field is identified with the extra-component of a gauge field in a compactified five-dimensional theory. We show that the extremely tiny energy scale $\sim (3\times 10^{-3} eV)^4$ needed to account for the present acceleration of the Universe can be naturally explained in terms of high energy scales such as the scale of Grand Unification.
