Title: Dependence of Variational Perturbation Expansions on Strong-Coupling  Behavior. Inapplicability of delta-Expansion to Field Theory
Authors: B. Hamprecht and H. Kleinert
Abstract: We show that in applications of variational theory to quantum field theory it is essential to account for the correct Wegner exponent omega governing the approach to the strong-coupling, or scaling limit. Otherwise the procedure either does not converge at all or to the wrong limit. This invalidates all papers applying the so-called delta-expansion to quantum field theory.
