Title: Hilbert schemes, integrable hierarchies, and Gromov-Witten theory
Authors: Wei-Ping Li and Zhenbo Qin and Weiqiang Wang
Abstract: Various equivariant intersection numbers on Hilbert schemes of points on the affine plane are computed, some of which are organized into tau-functions of 2-Toda hierarchies. A correspondence between the equivariant intersection on Hilbert schemes and stationary Gromov-Witten theory is established.
