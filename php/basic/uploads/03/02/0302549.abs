Title: On Plasma Oscillations in Strong Electric Fields
Authors: R. Ruffini and L. Vitagliano and S. -S. Xue
Abstract: We describe the creation and evolution of electron-positron pairs in a strong electric field as well as the pairs annihilation into photons. The formalism is based on generalized Vlasov equations, which are numerically integrated. We recover previous results about the oscillations of the charges, discuss the electric field screening and the relaxation of the system to a thermal equilibrium configuration. The timescale of the thermalization is estimated to be $\sim 10^{3}-10^{4} \hbar /m_{e}c^{2}$.
