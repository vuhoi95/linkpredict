Title: Evolution in Quantum Causal Histories
Authors: Eli Hawkins and Fotini Markopoulou and Hanno Sahlmann
Abstract: We provide a precise definition and analysis of quantum causal histories (QCH). A QCH consists of a discrete, locally finite, causal pre-spacetime with matrix algebras encoding the quantum structure at each event. The evolution of quantum states and observables is described by completely positive maps between the algebras at causally related events. We show that this local description of evolution is sufficient and that unitary evolution can be recovered wherever it should actually be expected. This formalism may describe a quantum cosmology without an assumption of global hyperbolicity; it is thus more general than the Wheeler-DeWitt approach. The structure of a QCH is also closely related to quantum information theory and algebraic quantum field theory on a causal set.
