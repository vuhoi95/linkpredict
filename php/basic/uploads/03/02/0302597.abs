Title: WMAP data and the curvature of space
Authors: Jean-Philippe Uzan and Ulrich Kirchner and George F. R. Ellis
Abstract: Inter alia, the high precision WMAP data on Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation marginally indicate that the universe has positively curved (and hence spherical) spatial sections. In this paper, we take this data seriously and consider some of the consequences for the background dynamics. In particular, we show that this implies a limit to the number of e-foldings that could have taken place in the inflationary epoch; however this limit is consistent with some inflationary models that solve all the usual cosmological problems and are consistent with standard structure formation theory.
