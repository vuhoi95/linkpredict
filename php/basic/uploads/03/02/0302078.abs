Title: Non-commutative superspace from string theory
Authors: J. de Boer and P. A. Grassi and P. van Nieuwenhuizen
Abstract: Turning on background fields in string theory sometimes has an alternative interpretation as a deformation of the target space geometry. A particularly well-known case is the NS-NS two form B, which gives rise to space-time non-commutativity. In this note we point out that this phenomenon extends to ten-dimensional superspace when employing a covariant quantization of the superstring, generalizing an observation by Ooguri and Vafa in four dimensions. In particular, we will find that RR field strengths give rise to a non-zero $\{\theta,\theta\}$ anti-commutator, just as in four dimensions, whereas the gravitino yields a non-zero value for $[x,\theta]$.
