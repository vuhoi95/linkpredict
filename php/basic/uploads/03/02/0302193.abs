Title: Search for a "Gravitoid" Theory
Authors: J. A. Nieto and M. C. Marin
Abstract: By combining the concepts of graviton and matroid, we outline a new gravitational theory which we call gravitoid theory. The idea of this theory emerged as an attempt to link the mathematical structure of matroid theory with M-theory. Our observations are essentially based on the formulation of matroid bundle due to MacPherson and Anderson-Davis. Also, by considering the oriented matroid theory, we add new observations about the link between the Fano matroid and D=11 supergravity which was discussed in some of our recent papers. In particular we find a connection between the affine matroid AG(3,2) and the $G_ {2}-$symmetry of D=11 supergravity.
