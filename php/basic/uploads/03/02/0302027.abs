Title: Rotation in string cosmology
Authors: Yuri N. Obukhov and Thoralf Chrobok and Mike Scherfner
Abstract: We describe exact cosmological solutions with rotation and expansion in the low-energy effective string theory. These models are spatially homogeneous (closed Bianchi type IX) and they belong to the family of shear-free metrics which are causal (no closed timelike curves are allowed), admit no parallax effects and do not disturb the isotropy of the background radiation. The dilaton and the axion fields are nontrivial, in general, and we consider both cases with and without the central charge (effective cosmological constant).
