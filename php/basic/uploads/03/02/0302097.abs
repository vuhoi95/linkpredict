Authors: Alberto A. Garcia and Friedrich W. Hehl and Christian Heinicke and Alfredo Macias
Abstract: In (1+2)-dimensional Poincar\'e gauge gravity, we start from a Lagrangian depending on torsion and curvature which includes additionally {\em translational} and {\em Lorentzian} Chern-Simons terms. Limiting ourselves to to a specific subcase, the Mielke-Baekler (MB) model, we derive the corresponding field equations (of Einstein-Cartan-Chern-Simons type) and find the general vacuum solution. We determine the properties of this solution, in particular its mass and its angular momentum. For vanishing torsion, we recover the BTZ-solution. We also derive the general conformally flat vacuum solution with torsion. In this framework, we discuss {\em Cartan's} (3-dimensional) {\em spiral staircase} and find that it is not only a special case of our new vacuum solution, but can alternatively be understood as a solution of the 3-dimensional Einstein-Cartan theory with matter of constant pressure and constant torque.
