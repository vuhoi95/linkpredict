Abstract: A detailed investigation is presented of the energy-momentum tensor approach to the evaluation of the force acting on a rigid Casimir cavity in a weak gravitational field. Such a force turns out to have opposite direction with respect to the gravitational acceleration. The order of magnitude for a multi-layer cavity configuration is derived and experimental feasibility is discussed, taking into account current technological resources.
