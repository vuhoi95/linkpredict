Abstract: The possibility of appearance of GUT precursors near the TeV scale (suggested by Dienes-Dudas-Gherghetta) is addressed within 5D GUTs compactified on an $S^{(1)}/Z_2\tm Z_2'$ orbifold. For a low compactification scale (large radius), there is a significant non universal logarithmic contribution in the relative running of gauge couplings. This within 5D SU(5), with the minimal field content, gives wrong prediction for $\al_3(M_Z)$ unless one goes beyond the minimal setting. The realization of the light precursors' idea thus requires some specific extensions. As a scenario alternative to SU(5) we also consider an SU(6) orbifold GUT, whose minimal non SUSY version gives natural unification. In all the presented unification scenarios with light precursors, various GUT scales are realized. This allows the model to be naturally embedded in either heterotic or Type ${\rm I}$ string theories.
