Title: A note on the dyonic D6-brane
Authors: Cesar Gomez and Juan Jose Manjarin
Abstract: We study the dyon electric charge of D6-branes as eleven dimensional KK-monopoles. We observe that the dyon charge is intimately related with the existence of gauge connections and antisymmetric fields on the brane world volume.
