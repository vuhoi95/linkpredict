Abstract: We present new supersymmetric domain wall and string solutions of five-dimensional N = 2 gauged supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of vector multiplets. Using the techniques of very special geometry allows to obtain the most general domain wall preserving half of the supersymmetries. This solution, which describes a renormalization group flow in the dual field theory, is given in terms of Weierstrass elliptic functions. The magnetically charged, one quarter supersymmetric string solutions are shown to be closely related to Liouville theory. We furthermore investigate general product space compactifications, and show that topological transitions from AdS_3 x S^2 to AdS_3 x H^2 can occur when one moves in moduli space.
