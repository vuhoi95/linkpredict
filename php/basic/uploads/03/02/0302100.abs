Title: Attractor Solution of Phantom Field
Authors: Jian-gang Hao and Xin-zhou Li
Abstract: In light of recent study on the dark energy models that manifest an equation of state $w<-1$, we investigate the cosmological evolution of phantom field in a specific potential, exponential potential in this paper. The phase plane analysis show that the there is a late time attractor solution in this model, which address the similar issues as that of fine tuning problems in conventional quintessence models. The equation of state $w$ is determined by the attractor solution which is dependent on the $\lambda$ parameter in the potential. We also show that this model is stable for our present observable universe.
