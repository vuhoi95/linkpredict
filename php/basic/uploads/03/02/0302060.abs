Title: Superstrings and D-branes in A Plane Wave
Authors: Jongwook Kim and Bum-Hoon Lee and Hyun Seok Yang
Abstract: We carefully analyze the supersymmetry algebra of closed strings and open strings in a type IIB plane wave background. We use eight component chiral spinors, SO(8) Majorana-Weyl spinors, in light-cone gauge to provide a useful basis of string field theory calculation in the plane wave. We consider the two classes of D-branes, $D_\pm$-branes, and give a worldsheet derivation of conserved supercurrents for all half BPS D-branes preserving 16 supersymmetries in the type IIB plane wave background. We exhaustively provide the supersymmetry algebra of the half BPS branes as well. We also point out that the supersymmetry algebra distinguishes the two SO(4) directions with relative sign which is consistent with the Z_2 symmetry of the string action.
