Title: On the Q-ball Profile Function
Authors: Theodora Ioannidou and N. D. Vlachos
Abstract: We use analytic and numerical methods to obtain the solution of the Q-ball equation of motion. In particular, we show that the profile function of the three-dimensional Q-ball can be accurately approximated by the symmetrized Woods-Saxon distribution.
