Title: Unification of Gauge, Higgs and Matter in Extra Dimensions
Authors: Ilia Gogoladze and Yukihiro Mimura and S. Nandi
Abstract: We consider the unification of gauge, Higgs as well as the matter fields in a 6D N=2 supersymmetric SU(8) gauge theory. The gauge symmetry SU(8) is broken down to SU(4) x SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x U(1)^2 in 4D through T^2/Z_6 orbifold compactification, and the theory is reduced to 4D N=1 supersymmetric Pati-Salam model. The electroweak Higgs fields as well as the third family of fermions are unified in the 6D N=2 gauge multiplet. The 6D bulk gauge interaction provides both gauge and Yukawa interactions for the third family predicting \alpha_1 = \alpha_2 = \alpha_3 = \alpha_t = \alpha_b = \alpha_tau at the unification scale, in good agreement with experiment. Incorporation of the first and second family as well as other orbifolds are also briefly discussed.
