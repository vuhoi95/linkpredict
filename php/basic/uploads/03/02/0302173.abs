Title: On the nature of mass-energy constituents of the universe
Authors: V. E. Kuzmichev and V. V. Kuzmichev
Abstract: On the basis of our quantum cosmological approach we show that there can be two previously unknown types of collective states in the universe. One of them relates to a gravitational field, another is connected with a matter (scalar) field which fills the universe on all stages of its evolution. The increase in number of the quanta of the collective excitations of the gravitational field manifests itself as an expansion of the universe. The collective excitations of the scalar field above its true vacuum reveal themselves mainly in the form of dark matter and energy. Under the action of the gravitational forces they decay and produce the non-baryonic dark matter, optically bright and dark baryons. We have calculated the corresponding energy densities which prove to be in good agreement with the data from the recent observations.
