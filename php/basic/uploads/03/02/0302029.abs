Title: Brane-Anti-Brane Solution and SUSY Effective Potential in Five  Dimensional Mirabelli-Peskin Model
Authors: Shoichi Ichinose and Akihiro Murayama
Abstract: A localized configuration is found in the 5D bulk-boundary theory on an $S_1/Z_2$ orbifold model of Mirabelli-Peskin. A bulk scalar and the extra (fifth) component of the bulk vector constitute the configuration. $\Ncal=1$ SUSY is preserved. The effective potential of the SUSY theory is obtained using the background field method. The vacuum is treated in a general way by allowing its dependence on the extra coordinate. Taking into account the {\it supersymmetric boundary condition}, the 1-loop full potential is obtained. The scalar-loop contribution to the Casimir energy is also obtained. Especially we find a {\it new} type which depends on the brane configuration parameters besides the $S_1$ periodicity parameter.
