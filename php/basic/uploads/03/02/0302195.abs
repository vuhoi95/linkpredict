Title: Lectures on Two-Dimensional Noncommutative Gauge Theory 1. Classical  Aspects
Authors: L. D. Paniak and R. J. Szabo
Abstract: These notes comprise the first of two articles devoted to the construction of exact solutions of noncommutative gauge theory in two spacetime dimensions. This first part deals solely with the classical theory on a noncommutative torus. Topics covered include a mathematical introduction to the geometry of the noncommutative torus, the definition, properties and symmetries of noncommutative Yang-Mills theory, and the complete solution of the classical field equations.
