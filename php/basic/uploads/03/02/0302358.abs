Title: On some properties of the manifolds with skew-symmetric torsion and  holonomy SU(n) and Sp(n)
Authors: Anna Fino and Gueo Grantcharov
Abstract: In this paper we provide examples of hypercomplex manifolds which do not carry HKT structure. We also prove that the existence of HKT structure is not stable under small deformations. Similarly we provide examples of compact complex manifolds with vanishing first Chern class which do not admit a Hermitian structure with restricted holonomy of its Bismut connection in SU(n). Again we prove that such property is not stable under small deformations.
