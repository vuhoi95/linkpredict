Authors: D. K. Park and S. Tamaryan and H. J. W. MÃ¼ller-Kirsten
Abstract: The supertube and BIon spike solutions are examined in a general curved target space. The criteria for the existence of these solutions are explicitly derived. Also the equation which the general BIon solution should satisfy is derived.
