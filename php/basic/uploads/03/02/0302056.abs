Title: Universal Ratios and Correlation Functions
Authors: G. Delfino and G. Mussardo
Abstract: We review some recent results concerning the quantitative analysis of the universality classes of two-dimensional statistical models near their critical point. We also discuss the exact calculation of the two--point correlation functions of disorder operators in a free theory of complex bosonic and fermionic field, correlators ruled by a Painleve differential equation.
