Authors: Shakir M. Nagiyev and Elchin I. Jafarov and Rizvan M. Imanov
Abstract: Exactly-solvable model of the linear singular oscillator in the relativistic configurational space is considered. We have found wavefunctions and energy spectrum for the model under study. It is shown that they have correct non-relativistic limits.
