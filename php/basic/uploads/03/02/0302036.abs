Title: Trace anomaly and black holes evaporation
Authors: F. Canfora and G. Vilasi
Abstract: A model is proposed to describe a transition from a Schwarzschild black hole of mass $M_{0}$ to a Schwarzschild black hole of mass $M_{1}$ $\leq M_{0}$. The basic equations are derived from the non-vacuum Einstein field equations taking a source representing a null scalar field with a nonvanishing trace anomaly. It is shown that the nonvanishing trace anomaly of the scalar field prevents a complete evaporation.
