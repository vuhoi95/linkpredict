Title: The N=2 Supersymmetric Heavenly Equation and Its Super-Hydrodynamical  Reduction
Authors: Z. Popowicz and F. Toppan
Abstract: Manifest N=2 supersymmetric Toda systems are constructed from the $sl(n,n+1)$ superalgebras by taking into account their complex structure. In the $n\to \infty$ continuum limit an N=2 extension of the $(2+1)$-dimensional heavenly equation is obtained. The integrability is guaranteed by the existence of a supersymmetric Lax pair. We further analyze the properties of the $(1+1)$-dimensionally reduced system. Its bosonic sector is of hydrodynamical type. This is not the case for the whole supersymmetric system which, however, is super-hydrodynamical when properly expressed in terms of a supergeometry involving superfields and fermionic derivatives.
