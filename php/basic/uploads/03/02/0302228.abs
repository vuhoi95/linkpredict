Title: Equivalence of Minkowski and Euclidean Field Theory Solutions
Authors: Khin Maung Maung and Charles A. Hill and Michael T. Hill and George DeRise
Abstract: We consider the correspondence between solutions of non-gravitational field theories formulated in Euclidean space-time and Minkowski space-time. Infinitely many "Euclidean" spaces can be obtained from M4 via a group of transformations in which the Wick rotation is a special case. We then discuss how the solutions of gauge field theories formulated in these "Euclidean" spaces have a one-to-one correspondence with the solutions of field theories formulated in Minkowski space-time, provided we avoid the one-point compactification into S4 = E4 U infinity.
