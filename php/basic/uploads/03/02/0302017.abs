Title: Supersymmetry on a Euclidean Spacetime Lattice I: A Target Theory with  Four Supercharges
Authors: Andrew G. Cohen and David B. Kaplan and Emanuel Katz and Mithat Unsal
Abstract: We formulate a Euclidean spacetime lattice whose continuum limit is (2,2) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in two dimensions, a theory which possesses four supercharges and an anomalous global chiral symmetry. The lattice action respects one exact supersymmetry, which allows the target theory to emerge in the continuum limit without fine-tuning. Our method exploits an orbifold construction described previously for spatial lattices in Minkowski space, and can be generalized to more complicated theories with additional supersymmetry and more spacetime dimensions.
