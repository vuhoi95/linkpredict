Title: Strings in de Sitter space
Authors: Eugenio R. Bezerra de Mello and Yves Brihaye and Betti Hartmann
Abstract: We study both global as well as local (Nielsen-Olesen) strings in de Sitter space. While these type of topological defects have been studied in the background of a de Sitter metric previously, we study here the full set of coupled equations. We find only ``closed'' solutions. The behaviour of the metric tensor of these solutions resembles that of ``supermassive'' strings with a curvature singularity at the cosmological horizon. For global strings (and the composite defect) we are able to construct solutions which are regular on the interval from the origin to the cosmological horizon if the global string core lies completely inside the horizon.
