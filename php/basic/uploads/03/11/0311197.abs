Title: Bulk inflaton shadows of vacuum gravity
Authors: Tsutomu Kobayashi and Takahiro Tanaka
Abstract: We introduce a $(5+m)$-dimensional vacuum description of five-dimensional bulk inflaton models with exponential potentials that makes analysis of cosmological perturbations simple and transparent. We show that various solutions, including the power-law inflation model recently discovered by Koyama and Takahashi, are generated from known $(5+m)$-dimensional vacuum solutions of pure gravity. We derive master equations for all types of perturbations, and each of them becomes a second order differential equation for one master variable supplemented by simple boundary conditions on the brane. One exception is the case for massive modes of scalar perturbations. In this case, there are two independent degrees of freedom, and in general it is difficult to disentangle them into two separate sectors.
