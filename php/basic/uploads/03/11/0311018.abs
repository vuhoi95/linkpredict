Title: Higher-Order Corrections to Non-Compact Calabi-Yau Manifolds in String  Theory
Authors: H. Lu and C. N. Pope and K. S. Stelle
Abstract: At the leading order, the low-energy effective field equations in string theory admit solutions of the form of products of Minkowski spacetime and a Ricci-flat Calabi-Yau space. The equations of motion receive corrections at higher orders in \alpha', which imply that the Ricci-flat Calabi-Yau space is modified. In an appropriate choice of scheme, the Calabi-Yau space remains Kahler, but is no longer Ricci-flat. We discuss the nature of these corrections at order {\alpha'}^3, and consider the deformations of all the known cohomogeneity one non-compact Kahler metrics in six and eight dimensions. We do this by deriving the first-order equations associated with the modified Killing-spinor conditions, and we thereby obtain the modified supersymmetric solutions. We also give a detailed discussion of the boundary terms for the Euler complex in six and eight dimensions, and apply the results to all the cohomogeneity one examples.
