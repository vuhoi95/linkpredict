Title: Born-Infeld strings in brane worlds
Authors: Yves Brihaye and Betti Hartmann
Abstract: We study Born-Infeld strings in a six dimensional brane world scenario recently suggested by Giovannini, Meyer and Shaposhnikov (GMS). In the limit of the Einstein-Abelian-Higgs model, we classify the solutions found by GMS. Especially, we point out that the warped solutions, which lead to localisation of gravity, are the - by the presence of the cosmological constant - deformed inverted string solutions. Further, we construct the Born-Infeld analogues of the anti-warped solutions and determine the domain of existence of these solutions, while a analytic argument leads us to a "no-go" hypothesis: solutions which localise gravity do NOT exist in a 6 dimensional Einstein-Born-Infeld-Abelian-Higgs (EBIAH) brane world scenario. This latter hypothesis is confirmed by our numerical results.
