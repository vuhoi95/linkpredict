Title: New nonrenormalization theorems for anomalous three point functions
Authors: Marc Knecht and Santiago Peris and Michel Perrottet and Eduardo de Rafael
Abstract: Nonrenormalization theorems involving the transverse, i.e. non anomalous, part of the <VVA> correlator in perturbative QCD are proven. Some of their consequences and questions they raise are discussed.
