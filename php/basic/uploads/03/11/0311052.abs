Title: Fourier analysis and holomorphic decomposition on the one-sheeted  hyperboloid
Authors: Jacques Bros and Ugo Moschella
Abstract: We prove a Cauchy-type integral representation for classes of functions holomorphic in four priviledged tuboid domains of the complexified one-sheeted two-dimensional hyperboloid. From a physical viewpoint, this hyperboloid can be used for describing both the two-dimensional de Sitter and anti-de Sitter universes. For two of these tuboids, called ``the Lorentz tuboids'' and relevant for de Sitter Quantum Field Theory, the boundary values onto the real hyperboloid of functions holomorphic in these domains admit continuous Fourier-Helgason-type transforms. For the other two tuboids, called the ``chiral tuboids'' and relevant for anti-de Sitter Quantum Field Theory, the boundary values on the reals of functions holomorphic in these domains admit discrete Fourier-Helgason-type transforms. In both cases, the inversion formulae for these transformations are derived by using the previous Cauchy representation for the respective classes of functions. The decomposition of functions on the real hyperboloid into sums of boundary values of holomorphic functions from the previous four tuboids gives a complete and explicit treatment of the Gelfand-Gindikin program for the one-sheeted hyperboloid.
