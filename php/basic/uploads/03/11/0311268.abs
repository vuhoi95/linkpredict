Title: Thermodynamics of Abelian Gauge Fields in Real Hyperbolic Spaces
Authors: A A Bytsenko and V S Mendes and A C Tort
Abstract: We work with $N-$dimensional compact real hyperbolic space $X_{\Gamma}$ with universal covering $M$ and fundamental group $\Gamma$. Therefore, $M$ is the symmetric space $G/K$, where $G=SO_1(N,1)$ and $K=SO(N)$ is a maximal compact subgroup of $G$. We regard $\Gamma$ as a discrete subgroup of $G$ acting isometrically on $M$, and we take $X_{\Gamma}$ to be the quotient space by that action: $X_{\Gamma}=\Gamma\backslash M = \Gamma\backslash G/K$. The natural Riemannian structure on $M$ (therefore on $X$) induced by the Killing form of $G$ gives rise to a connection $p-$form Laplacian ${\frak L}_p$ on the quotient vector bundle (associated with an irreducible representation of K). We study gauge theories based on abelian $p-$forms on the real compact hyperbolic manifold $X_{\Gamma}$. The spectral zeta function related to the operator ${\frak L}_p$, considering only the co-exact part of the $p-$forms and corresponding to the physical degrees of freedom, can be represented by the inverse Mellin transform of the heat kernel. The explicit thermodynamic fuctions related to skew-symmetric tensor fields are obtained by using the zeta-function regularization and the trace tensor kernel formula (which includes the identity and hyperbolic orbital integrals). Thermodynamic quantities in the high and low temperature expansions are calculated and new entropy/energy ratios established.
