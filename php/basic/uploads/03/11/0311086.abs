Title: A note on quasinormal modes: A tale of two treatments
Authors: A. J. M. Medved and Damien Martin
Abstract: There is an apparent discrepancy in the literature with regard to the quasinormal mode frequencies of Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes in the degenerate-horizon limit. On the one hand, a Poschl-Teller-inspired method predicts that the real part of the frequencies will depend strongly on the orbital angular momentum of the perturbation field whereas, on the other hand, the degenerate limit of a monodromy-based calculation suggests there should be no such dependence (at least, for the highly damped modes). In the current paper, we provide a possible resolution by critically re-assessing the limiting procedure used in the monodromy analysis.
