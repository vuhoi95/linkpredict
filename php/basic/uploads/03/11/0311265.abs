Title: Solitons in systems of coupled scalar fields
Authors: D. Bazeia and M. J. dos Santos and R. F. Ribeiro
Abstract: We present a method to obtain soliton solutions to relativistic system of coupled scalar fields. This is done by examining the energy associated to static field configurations. In this case we derive a set of first-order differential equations that solve the equations of motion when the energy saturates its lower bound. To illustrate the general results, we investigate some systems described by polynomial interactions in the coupled fields.
