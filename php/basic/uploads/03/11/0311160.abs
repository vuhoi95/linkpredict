Title: Confinement from new global defect structures
Authors: D. Bazeia and F. A. Brito and W. Freire and R. F. Ribeiro
Abstract: We investigate confinement from new global defect structures in three spatial dimensions. The global defects arise in models described by a single real scalar field, governed by special scalar potentials. They appear as electrically, magnetically or dyonically charged structures. We show that they induce confinement, when they are solutions of effective QCD-like field theories in which the vacua are regarded as color dielectric media with an anti-screening property. As expected, in three spatial dimensions the monopole-like global defects generate the Coulomb potential as part of several confining potentials.
