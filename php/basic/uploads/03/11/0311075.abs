Title: Explicitly symmetrical treatment of three-body phase space
Authors: A. I. Davydychev and R. Delbourgo
Abstract: We derive expressions for three-body phase space that are explicitly symmetrical in the masses of the three particles. We study geometrical properties of the variables involved in elliptic integrals and demonstrate that it is convenient to use the Jacobian zeta function to express the results in four and six dimensions.
