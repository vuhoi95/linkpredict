Title: Post Gaussian effective potential in the Ginzburg Landau theory of  superconductivity
Authors: Chul Koo Kim and A. Rakhimov and Jae Hyung Yee
Abstract: The post Gaussian effective potential in D=3 dimensions and the Gaussian effective potential in D=2+epsilon are evaluated for the Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity. It is shown that, the next order correction to the Gaussian approximation of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter (kappa) is significant, whereas contribution from the two dimensionality is rather small. This strongly indicates that strong correlation plays a more dominant role than the two dimensionality does in high T_c superconductivity.
