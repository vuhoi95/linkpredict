Title: Space-time non-commutativity tends to create bound states
Authors: D. V. Vassilevich and A. Yurov
Abstract: We study the spectrum of fluctuations about static solutions in 1+1 dimensional non-commutative scalar field models. In the case of soliton solutions non-commutativity leads to creation of new bound states. In the case of static singular solutions an infinite tower of bound states is produced whose spectrum has a striking similarity to the spectrum of confined quark states.
