Title: Quantum Limitations on the Storage and Transmission of Information
Authors: Jacob D. Bekenstein and Marcelo Schiffer
Abstract: Information must take up space, must weigh, and its flux must be limited. Quantum limits on communication and information storage leading to these conclusions are here described. Quantum channel capacity theory is reviewed for both steady state and burst communication. An analytic approximation is given for the maximum signal information possible with occupation number signal states as a function of mean signal energy. A theorem guaranteeing that these states are optimal for communication is proved. A heuristic "proof" of the linear bound on communication is given, followed by rigorous proofs for signals with specified mean energy, and for signals with given energy budget. And systems of many parallel quantum channels are shown to obey the linear bound for a natural channel architecture. The time--energy uncertainty principle is reformulated in information language by means of the linear bound. The quantum bound on information storage capacity of quantum mechanical and quantum field devices is reviewed. A simplified version of the analytic proof for the bound is given for the latter case. Solitons as information caches are discussed, as is information storage in one dimensional systems. The influence of signal self--gravitation on communication is considerd. Finally, it is shown that acceleration of a receiver acts to block information transfer.
