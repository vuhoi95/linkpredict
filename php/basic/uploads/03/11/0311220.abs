Title: Asymptotic Form of Gopakumar-Vafa Invariants from Instanton Counting
Authors: Yukiko Konishi and Kazuhiro Sakai
Abstract: We study the asymptotic form of the Gopakumar-Vafa invariants at all genera for Calabi-Yau toric threefolds which have the structure of fibration of the A_n singularity over P^1. We claim that the asymptotic form is the inverse Laplace transform of the corresponding instanton amplitude in the prepotential of N=2 SU(n+1) gauge theory coupled to external graviphoton fields, which is given by the logarithm of the Nekrasov's partition function.
