Abstract: In this work a generalization of the Bogoliubov transformation is developed to describe a space compactified fermionic field. The method is the fermion counterpart of the formalism introduced earlier for bosons (J. C. da Silva, A. Matos Neto, F.C. Khanna and A.E. Santana, Phys. Rev. A 66 (2002) 052101), and is based on the thermofield dynamics approach. We analyze the energy-momentum tensor for the Casimir effect of a free massless fermion system in a N-dimensional box in contact with a heat bath. As a particular situation we calculate the Casimir energy and pressure for the field in a 3-dimensional box. One interesting result is that the attractive or repulsive nature of the Casimir pressure can change depending on the rate among the sizes. This fact is analyzed with specific examples.
