Title: Relativistic Violation Invariance, Multiverses and Quantum Field Theory
Authors: J. Gamboa and M. Loewe and F. Mendez
Abstract: The possibility of interaction among multiverses is studied assuming that in the first instants of the big-bang, many disjoint regions were created producing many independent universes (multiverses). Many of these mini-universes were unstable and they decayed, but other remained as topological remnant (like domain walls or baby universes) or possibly as mini-black-holes. In this paper, we study the quantum statistical mechanics of multiverses assuming that in the first instants of the big-bang, the relativistic symmetry was only an approximate symmetry and the interaction among multiverses was produced by non-local communication. The breaking of the relativistic symmetry induces on each multiverse a tiny harmonic interaction. The oscillation frequency for each multiverse is proportional to 1/B, where B is the noncommutativity parameter. We argue that B can identified as the primordial magnetic field, {\it i.e.} $\sim 10^{-16} {GeV}^2$. This tiny frequency could suggest that the relativistics invariance --from the cosmological point of view-- is almost exact and the multiverses could be not detected using the presently astronomical observations.
