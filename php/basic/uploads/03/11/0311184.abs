Title: Physical Degrees of Freedom of Non-local Theories
Authors: Joaquim Gomis and Kiyoshi Kamimura and Toni Ramirez
Abstract: We analyze the physical (reduced) space of non-local theories, around the fixed points of these systems, by analyzing: i) the Hamiltonian constraints appearing in the 1+1 formulation of those theories, ii) the symplectic two form in the surface on constraints. P-adic string theory for spatially homogeneous configurations has two fixed points. The physical phase space around $q=0$ is trivial, instead around $q=\frac 1g$ is infinite dimensional. For the special case of the rolling tachyon solutions it is an infinite dimensional lagrangian submanifold. In the case of string field theory, at lowest truncation level, the physical phase space of spatially homogeneous configurations is two dimensional around $q=0$, which is the relevant case for the rolling tachyon solutions, and infinite dimensional around $q=\frac {M^2}g$.
