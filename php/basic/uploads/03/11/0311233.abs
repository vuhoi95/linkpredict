Title: The eccentric universe
Authors: Arjun Berera and Roman V. Buniy and Thomas W. Kephart
Abstract: For a universe containing cosmological constant together with uniform arrangements of magnetic fields, strings, or domain walls, exact solutions to the Einstein equations are shown to lead to a universe with ellipsoidal expansion. The magnetic field case is the easiest to motivate and has the highest possibility of finding application in observational cosmology.
