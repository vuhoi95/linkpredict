Title: Reply to "Comment on 'Light-Front Schwinger Model at Finite  Temperature'"
Authors: Ashok Das and Xingxiang Zhou
Abstract: In hep-th/0310278, Blankleider and Kvinikhidze propose an alternate thermal propagator for the fermions in the light-front Schwinger model. We show that such a propagator does not describe correctly the thermal behavior of fermions in this theory and, as a consequence, the claims made in their paper are not correct.
