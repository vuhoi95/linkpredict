Title: Einstein Metrics on Rational Homology Spheres
Authors: Charles P. Boyer and Krzysztof Galicki
Abstract: We prove the existence of Sasakian-Einstein metrics on infinitely many rational homology spheres in all odd dimensions greater than 3. In dimension 5 we obain somewhat sharper results. There are examples where the number of effective parameters in the Einstein metric grows exponentially with dimension.
