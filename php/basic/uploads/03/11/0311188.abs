Title: Probing Orientifold Behavior Near NS Branes
Authors: Dmitri Burshtyn and Shmuel Elitzur and Yaakov Mandelbaum
Abstract: The effect of NS 5 branes on an orientifold is studied. The orientifold is allowed to pass through a pile of k NS branes forming a regularized CHS geometry. Its effect on open strings in its vicinity is used to study the change in the orientifold charge induced by the NS branes.
