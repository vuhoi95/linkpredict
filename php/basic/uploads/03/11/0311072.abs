Title: 3D Lorentzian Quantum Gravity from the asymmetric ABAB matrix model
Authors: J. Ambjorn and J. Jurkiewicz and R. Loll and G. Vernizzi
Abstract: The asymmetric ABAB-matrix model describes the transfer matrix of three-dimensional Lorentzian quantum gravity. We study perturbatively the scaling of the ABAB-matrix model in the neighbourhood of its symmetric solution and deduce the associated renormalization of three-dimensional Lorentzian quantum gravity.
