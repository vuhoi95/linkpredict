Title: On the renormalization group for the interacting massive scalar field  theory in curved space
Authors: Guilherme de Berredo-Peixoto and Eduard V. Gorbar and Ilya L. Shapiro
Abstract: The effective action for the interacting massive scalar field in curved space-time is derived using the heat-kernel method. Starting from this effective action, we establish a smooth quadratic form of the low-energy decoupling for the four-scalar coupling constant and for the nonminimal interaction parameter. The evolution of this parameter from the conformal value 1/6 at high energies down to the IR regime is investigated within the two toy models with negative and positive four-scalar coupling constants.
