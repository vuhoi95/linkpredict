Title: Cosmic Optical Activity in a Randall-Sundrum Braneworld with Bulk  Kalb-Ramond field
Authors: Debaprasad Maity and Soumitra SenGupta
Abstract: Optical activity of electromagnetic waves in a string inspired Kalb-Ramond cosmological background is studied in presence of extra spacetime dimension. The Kalb-Ramond-electromagnetic coupling which originates from the gauge anomaly cancelling Chern-Simons term in a string inspired model, is explicitly calculated following Randall-Sundrum braneworld conjecture. It is shown that the Randall-Sundrum scenario leads to an enormous enhancement of the optical rotation of a plane polarized electromagnetic wave propagating on the visible brane.Absence of any experimental support in favour of such a large rotation in astrophysical experiments on distant galactic radio waves indicates an apparent conflict between Randall-Sundrum brane world scenario and the presence of Kalb-Ramond antisymmetric tensor field in the background spacetime.
