Title: Duality and Central Charges in Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Michael Faux and Donald Spector
Abstract: We identify a class of point-particle models that exhibit a target-space duality. This duality arises from a construction based on supersymmetric quantum mechanics with a non-vanishing central charge. Motivated by analogies to string theory, we are led to speculate regarding mechanisms for restricting the background geometry.
