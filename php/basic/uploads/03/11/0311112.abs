Title: The Geometry of D=11 Null Killing Spinors
Authors: Jerome P. Gauntlett and Jan B. Gutowski and Stathis Pakis
Abstract: We determine the necessary and sufficient conditions on the metric and the four-form for the most general bosonic supersymmetric configurations of D=11 supergravity which admit a null Killing spinor i.e. a Killing spinor which can be used to construct a null Killing vector. This class covers all supersymmetric time-dependent configurations and completes the classification of the most general supersymmetric configurations initiated in hep-th/0212008.
