Title: Topped MAC with extra dimensions?
Authors: Michio Hashimoto and Masaharu Tanabashi and Koichi Yamawaki
Abstract: We perform the most attractive channel (MAC) analysis in the top mode standard model with TeV-scale extra dimensions, where the standard model gauge bosons and the third generation of quarks and leptons are put in D(=6,8,10,...) dimensions. In such a model, bulk gauge couplings rapidly grow in the ultraviolet region. In order to make the scenario viable, only the attractive force of the top condensate should exceed the critical coupling, while other channels such as the bottom and tau condensates should not. We then find that the top condensate can be the MAC for D=8, whereas the tau condensation is favored for D=6. The analysis for D=10 strongly depends on the regularization scheme. We predict masses of the top (m_t) and the Higgs (m_H), m_t=172-175 GeV and m_H=176-188 GeV for D=8, based on the renormalization group for the top Yukawa and Higgs quartic couplings with the compositeness conditions at the scale where the bulk top condenses. The Higgs boson in such a characteristic mass range will be immediately discovered in H -> WW^(*)/ZZ^(*) once the LHC starts.
