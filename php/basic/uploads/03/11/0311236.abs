Title: Field of homogeneous Plane in Quantum Electrodynamics
Authors: I. V. Fialkovsky and V. N. Markov and Yu. M. Pis'mak
Abstract: We study quantum electrodynamics coupled to the matter field on singular background, which we call defect. For defect on the infinite plane we calculated the fermion propagator and mean electromagnetic field. We show that at large distances from the defect plane, the electromagnetic field is constant what is in agreement with the classical results. The quantum corrections determining the field near the plane are calculated in the leading order of perturbation theory.
