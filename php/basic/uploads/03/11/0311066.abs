Title: An Introduction to Supersymmetric Gauge Theories and Matrix Models
Authors: Riccardo Argurio and Gabriele Ferretti and Rainer Heise
Abstract: We give an introduction to the recently established connection between supersymmetric gauge theories and matrix models. We begin by reviewing previous material that is required in order to follow the latest developments. This includes the superfield formulation of gauge theories, holomorphy, the chiral ring, the Konishi anomaly and the large N limit. We then present both the diagrammatic proof of the connection and the one based on the anomaly. Our discussion is entirely field theoretical and self contained.
