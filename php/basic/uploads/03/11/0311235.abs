Title: A logarithmic generalization of tensor product theory for modules for a  vertex operator algebra
Authors: Yi-Zhi Huang and James Lepowsky and Lin Zhang
Abstract: We describe a logarithmic tensor product theory for certain module categories for a ``conformal vertex algebra.'' In this theory, which is a natural, although intricate, generalization of earlier work of Huang and Lepowsky, we do not require the module categories to be semisimple, and we accommodate modules with generalized weight spaces. The corresponding intertwining operators contain logarithms of the variables.
