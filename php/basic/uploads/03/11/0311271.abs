Title: Enhancon Solutions: Pushing Supergravity to its Limits
Authors: Apostolos Dimitriadis and Amanda W. Peet and Geoff Potvin and Simon F. Ross
Abstract: We extend the investigation of nonextremal enhancons, finding the most general solutions with the correct symmetry and charges. There are two families of solutions. One of these contains a solution with a regular horizon found previously; this previous example is shown to be the unique solution with a regular horizon. The other family generalises a previous nonextreme extension of the enhancon, producing solutions with shells which satisfy the weak energy condition. We argue that identifying a unique solution with a shell requires input beyond supergravity.
