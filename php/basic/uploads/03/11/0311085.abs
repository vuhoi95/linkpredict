Title: The modified XXZ Heisenberg chain, conformal invariance, surface  exponents of c<1 systems, and hidden symmetries of the finite chains
Authors: Uwe Grimm and Vladimir Rittenberg
Abstract: The spin-1/2 XXZ Heisenberg chain with two types of boundary terms is considered. For the first type, the Hamiltonian is hermitian but not for the second type which includes the U_{q}[SU(2)] symmetric case. It is shown that for a certain `tuning' between the anisotropy angle and the boundary terms the spectra present unexpected degeneracies. These degeneracies are related to the structure of the irreducible representations of the Virasoro algebras for c<1.
