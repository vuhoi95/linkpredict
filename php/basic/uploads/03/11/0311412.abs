Title: Forecasting Cosmic Doomsday from CMB/LSS Cross-Correlations
Authors: Jaume Garriga and Levon Pogosian and Tanmay Vachaspati
Abstract: A broad class of dark energy models, which have been proposed in attempts at solving the cosmological constant problems, predict a late time variation of the equation of state with redshift. The variation occurs as a scalar field picks up speed on its way to negative values of the potential. The negative potential energy eventually turns the expansion into contraction and the local universe undergoes a big crunch. In this paper we show that cross-correlations of the CMB anisotropy and matter distribution, in combination with other cosmological data, can be used to forecast the imminence of such cosmic doomsday.
