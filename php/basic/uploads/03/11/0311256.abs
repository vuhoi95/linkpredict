Title: Lattice measurement of the rescaling of the scalar condensate
Authors: P. Cea and M. Consoli and L. Cosmai
Abstract: We have determined the rescaling of the scalar condensate $Z\equiv Z_\phi$ near the critical line of a 4D Ising model. Our lattice data, supporting previous numerical indications, confirm the behaviour $Z_\phi\sim \ln ({\rm cutoff})$. This result is predicted in an alternative description of symmetry breaking where there are no upper bounds on the Higgs boson mass from `triviality'.
