Title: The tetrahedron graph in Liouville theory on the pseudosphere
Authors: Pietro Menotti and Erik Tonni
Abstract: We compute analytically the tetrahedron graph in Liouville theory on the pseudosphere. The result allows to extend the check of the bootstrap formula of Zamolodchikov and Zamolodchikov to third order perturbation theory of the coefficient G3. We obtain complete agreement.
