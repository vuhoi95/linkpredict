Title: On the Casimir energy of a massive scalar field in positive curvature  space
Authors: E Elizalde and A C Tort
Abstract: We re-evaluate the zero point Casimir energy for the case of a massive scalar field in $\mathbf{R}^{1}\times\mathbf{S}^{3}$ space, allowing also for deviations from the standard conformal value $\xi =1/6$, by means of zero temperature zeta function techniques. We show that for the problem at hand this approach is equivalent to the high temperature regularisation of the vacuum energy.
