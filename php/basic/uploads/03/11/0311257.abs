Title: On higher spins and the tensionless limit of String Theory
Authors: A. Sagnotti and M. Tsulaia
Abstract: We discuss string spectra in the low-tension limit using the BRST formalism, with emphasis on the role of triplets of totally symmetric tensors and spinor-tensors and their generalizations to cases with mixed symmetry and to (A)dS backgrounds. We also present simple compensator forms of the field equations for individual higher-spin gauge fields that display the {unconstrained} gauge symmetry of a previous non-local construction and reduce upon partial gauge fixing to the (Fang-)Fronsdal equations. For Bose fields we also show how a local Lagrangian formulation with {unconstrained} gauge symmetry is determined by a previous BRST construction.
