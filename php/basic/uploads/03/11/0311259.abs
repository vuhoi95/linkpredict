Title: Hamiltonian treatment of Collapsing Thin Shells in Lanczos-Lovelock's  theories
Authors: J. Crisostomo and S. del Campo and J. Saavedra
Abstract: The Hamiltonian treatment for the collapse of thin shells for a family of Lanczos-Lovelock theories is studied. This formalism allows us to carry out a concise analysis of these theories. It is found that the black holes solution can be created by collapsing a thin shell. Naked singularities cannot be formed by this mechanism. Among the different Lanczos-Lovelock's theories, the Chern-Simons' theory corresponds to an exceptional case, because naked singularities can emerge from the collapse of a thin shell. This kind of theory does not possess a gravitational self-interaction analogous to the Newtonian case.
