Title: Supersymmetry and the AdS Higgs Phenomenon
Authors: Benjamin A. Burrington and James T. Liu
Abstract: We examine the AdS Higgs phenomenon for spin-1 fields, and demonstrate that graviphotons pick up a dynamically generated mass in AdS_4, once matter boundary conditions are relaxed. We perform an explicit one-loop calculation of the graviphoton mass, and compare this result with the mass generated for the graviton in AdS. In this manner, we obtain a condition for unbroken supersymmetry. With this condition, we examine both N=2 and N=4 gauged supergravities coupled to matter multiplets, and find that for both cases the ratio between dynamically generated graviton and graviphoton masses is consistent with unbroken supersymmetry.
