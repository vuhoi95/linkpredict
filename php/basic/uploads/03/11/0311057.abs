Title: Degenerate BPS Domain Walls: Classical and Quantum Dynamics
Authors: A. Alonso Izquierdo and M. A. Gonzalez Leon and W. Garcia Fuertes and M. de la Torre Mayado and J. Mateos Guilarte
Abstract: We discuss classical and quantum aspects of the dynamics of a family of domain walls arising in a generalized Wess-Zumino model. These domain walls can be embedded in ${\cal N}=1$ supergravity as exact solutions and are composed of two basic lumps.
