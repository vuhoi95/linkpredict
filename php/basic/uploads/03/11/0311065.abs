Title: Propagation in a thermal graviton background
Authors: Daniel Arteaga and Renaud Parentani and Enric Verdaguer
Abstract: It is well known that radiative corrections evaluated in nontrivial backgrounds lead to effective dispersion relations which are not Lorentz invariant. Since gravitational interactions increase with energy, gravity-induced radiative corrections could be relevant for the trans-Planckian problem. As a first step to explore this possibility, we compute the one-loop radiative corrections to the self-energy of a scalar particle propagating in a thermal bath of gravitons in Minkowski spacetime. We obtain terms which originate from the thermal bath and which indeed break the Lorentz invariance that possessed the propagator in the vacuum. Rather unexpectedly, however, the terms which break Lorentz invariance vanish in the high three-momentum limit. We also found that the imaginary part, which gives the rate of approach to thermal equilibrium, vanishes at one loop.
