Authors: H. E. Boos and V. E. Korepin and F. A. Smirnov
Abstract: We consider the quantum group invariant XXZ-model. In infrared limit it describes Conformal Field Theory with modified energy-momentum tensor. The correlation functions are related to solutions of level -4 of qKZ equations. We describe these solutions relating them to level 0 solutions. We further consider general matrix elements (form factors) containing local operators and asymptotic states. We explain that the formulae for solutions of qKZ equations suggest a decomposition of these matrix elements with respect to states of corresponding Conformal Field Theory .
