Title: U(N) Instantons on N=1/2 superspace -- exact solution & geometry of  moduli space
Authors: Ruth Britto and Bo Feng and Oleg Lunin and Soo-Jong Rey
Abstract: We construct the exact solution of one (anti)instanton in N=1/2 super Yang-Mills theory defined on non(anti)commutative superspace. We first identify N = 1/2 superconformal invariance as maximal spacetime symmetry. For gauge group U(2), SU(2) part of the solution is given by the standard (anti)instanton, but U(1) field strength also turns out nonzero. The solution is SO(4) rotationally symmetric. For gauge group U(N), in contrast to the U(2) case, we show that the entire U(N) part of the solution is deformed by non(anti)commutativity and fermion zero-modes. The solution is no longer rotationally symmetric; it is polarized into an axially symmetric configuration because of the underlying non(anti)commutativity. We compute the `information metric' of one (anti) instanton. We find that moduli space geometry is deformed from hyperbolic space (Euclidean anti-de Sitter space) in a way anticipated from reduced spacetime symmetry. Remarkably, the volume measure of the moduli space turns out to be independent of the non(anti)commutativity. Implications to D-branes in Ramond- Ramond flux background and Maldacena's gauge-gravity correspondence are discussed.
