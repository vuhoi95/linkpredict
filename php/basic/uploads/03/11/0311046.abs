Title: k-string tensions in the 3-d SU(N) Georgi-Glashow model
Authors: Dmitri Antonov and Luigi Del Debbio
Abstract: The classic argument by Polyakov showing that monopoles produce confinement in the Higgs phase of the Georgi-Glashow model is generalized to study the spectrum of k-strings. We find that the leading-order low-density approximation yields Casimir scaling in the weakly-coupled 3-d SU(N) Georgi-Glashow model. Corrections to the Casimir formula are considered. When k is of the order of N, the non-diluteness effect is of the same order as the leading term, indicating that non-diluteness can significantly change the Casimir-scaling behavior. The correction produced by the propagating Higgs field is also studied and found to increase, together with the non-diluteness effect, the Casimir-scaling ratio. Furthermore, a correction due to closed k-strings is also computed and is shown to yield the same k-dependence as the one due to non-diluteness, but with the opposite sign and a nontrivial N-dependence. Finally, we consider the possible implications of our analysis for the SU(N) analogue of compact QED in four dimensions.
