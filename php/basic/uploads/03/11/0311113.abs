Title: An alternative calculation of the Casimir energy for kappa-deformed  electrodynamics
Authors: D Pinheiro and F C Santos and A. C. Tort
Abstract: A simple, but effcient way of calculating regularized Casimir energies suitable for non-trivial frequency spectra is briefly described and applied to the case of a kappa-deformed scalar field theory. The results are consistent with the ones obtained by other means.
