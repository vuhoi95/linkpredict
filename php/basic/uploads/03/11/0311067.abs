Title: Statefinder parameters for interacting dark energy
Authors: Winfried Zimdahl and Diego Pavon
Abstract: We argue that the recently introduced "statefinder parameters" (Sahni et al., JETP Lett. 77, 201 (2003)), that include the third derivative of the cosmic scale factor, are useful tools to characterize interacting quitessence models. We specify the statefinder parameters for two classes of models that solve, or at least alleviate, the coincidence problem.
