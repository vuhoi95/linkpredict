Title: Supersymmetry and discrete transformations on S^1 with point  singularities
Authors: Tomoaki Nagasawa and Makoto Sakamoto and Kazunori Takenaga
Abstract: We investigate N-extended supersymmetry in one-dimensional quantum mechanics on a circle with point singularities. For any integer n, N=2n supercharges are explicitly constructed and a class of point singularities compatible with supersymmetry is clarified. Key ingredients in our construction are n sets of discrete transformations, each of which forms an su(2) algebra of spin 1/2. The degeneracy of the spectrum and spontaneous supersymmetry breaking are briefly discussed.
