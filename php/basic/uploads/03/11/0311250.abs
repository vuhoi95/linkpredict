Title: Chiral 4d String Vacua with D-branes and Moduli Stabilization
Authors: Juan F. G. Cascales and Angel M. Uranga
Abstract: We discuss type IIB orientifolds with D-branes, and NSNS and RR field strength fluxes, with D-brane sectors leading to open string spectra with non-abelian gauge symmetry and charged chiral fermions. The closed string field strengths generate a scalar potential stabilizing most moduli. Hence the models combine the advantages of leading to phenomenologically interesting (and even semirealistic) chiral open string spectra, and of stabilizing the dilaton and most geometric moduli. We describe the explicit construction of two classes of non-supersymmetric models on $\IT^6$ and orbifolds/orientifolds thereof, with chiral gauge sector arising from configurations of D3-branes at singularities, and from D9-branes with non-trivial world-volume magnetic fields. The latter examples yield the chiral spectrum of just the Standard Model.
