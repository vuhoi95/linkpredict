Title: High order correlation functions for self interacting scalar field in de  Sitter space
Authors: Francis Bernardeau and Tristan Brunier and Jean-Philippe Uzan
Abstract: We present the expressions of the three- and four-point correlation functions of a self interacting light scalar field in a de Sitter spacetime at tree order respectively for a cubic and a quartic potential. Exact expressions are derived and their limiting behaviour on super-horizon scales are presented. Their essential features are shown to be similar to those obtained in a classical approach.
