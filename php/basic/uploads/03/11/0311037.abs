Title: An example of Kaluza-Klein-like theories leading after compactification  to massless spinors coupled to a gauge field
Authors: N. S. Mankoc Borstnik and H. B. Nielsen
Abstract: The genuine Kaluza-Klein-like theories (with no fields in addition to gravity with torsion) have difficulties with the existence of massless spinors after the compactification of some of dimensions of space\cite{witten}. We demonstrate in this letter on an example of a flat torus - as a compactified part of an (1+5)-dimensional space - that for constant fields and appropriate boundary conditions there exists in the 1+3 dimensional space a massless solution, which is mass protected and chirally coupled with a Kaluza-Klein charge to the corresponding gauge field.
