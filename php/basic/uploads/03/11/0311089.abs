Title: Note on Self-Duality and the Kodama State
Authors: Alejandro Corichi and Jeronimo Cortez
Abstract: An interesting interplay between self-duality, the Kodama (Chern-Simons) state and knot invariants is shown to emerge in the quantum theory of an Abelian gauge theory. More precisely, when a self-dual representation of the CCR is chosen, the corresponding vacuum in the Schroedinger representation is precisely given by the Kodama state. Several consequences of this construction are explored.
