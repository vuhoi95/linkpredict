Title: The Boundary Weyl Anomaly in the ${\cal N}=4$ SYM/Type IIB Supergravity  Correspondence
Authors: Paul Mansfield and David Nolland and Tatsuya Ueno
Abstract: We give a complete account of the Schr\"odinger representation approach to the calculation of the Weyl anomaly of ${\cal N}=4$ SYM from the AdS/CFT correspondence. On the AdS side, the $1/N^2$ correction to the leading order result receives contributions from all the fields of Type IIB Supergravity, the contribution of each field being given by a universal formula. The correct matching with the CFT result is thus a highly non-trivial test of the correspondence.
