Title: One-Point Functions of N=2 Super-Liouville Theory with Boundary
Authors: Changrim Ahn and Marian Stanishkov and Masayoshi Yamamoto
Abstract: We derive one-point functions of the N=2 super-Liouville theory on a half line using the modular transformations of the characters in terms of the bulk and boundary cosmological constants. We also show that these results are consistent with conformal bootstrap equations which are based on the bulk and boundary actions. We provide various independent checks for our results.
