Title: Absorption Cross Section for S-wave massive Scalar
Authors: Eylee Jung and Sung-Hoon Kim and D. K. Park
Abstract: We examine the absorption cross section of the massive scalar field for the higher-dimensional extended object. Adopting the usual quantum mechanical matching conditions between the asymptotic and near-horizon solutions in radial equation, we check whether or not the universal property of the absorption cross section, which is that the low-energy cross section is proportional to the surface area of horizon, is maintained when the mass effect is involved. It is found that the mass effect in general does not break the universal property of the cross section if particular conditions are required to the spacetime geometry. However, the mass-dependence of the cross section is very sensitive to the spacetime property in the near-horizon regime.
