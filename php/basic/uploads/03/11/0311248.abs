Title: Low-energy effective action in extended supersymmetric gauge theories
Authors: A. T. Banin and I. L. Buchbinder and N. G. Pletnev
Abstract: We briefly review a recent progress in constructing the low-energy effective action in ${\cal N}=2,4$ super Yang-Mills theories. Using superfield methods we study the one- and two-loop contributions to the effective action in the Coulomb and non-Abelian phases. General structure of low-energy corrections to the effective action is discussed.
