Abstract: We reconstruct the equation of state $w(z)$ of dark energy (DE) using a recently released data set containing 172 type Ia supernovae without assuming the prior $w(z) \geq -1$ (in contrast to previous studies). We find that dark energy evolves rapidly and metamorphoses from dust-like behaviour at high $z$ ($w \simeq 0$ at $z \sim 1$) to a strongly negative equation of state at present ($w \lleq -1$ at $z \simeq 0$). Dark energy metamorphosis appears to be a robust phenomenon which manifests for a large variety of SNe data samples provided one does not invoke the weak energy prior $\rho + p \geq 0$. Invoking this prior considerably weakens the rate of growth of $w(z)$. These results demonstrate that dark energy with an evolving equation of state provides a compelling alternative to a cosmological constant if data are analysed in a prior-free manner and the weak energy condition is not imposed by hand.
