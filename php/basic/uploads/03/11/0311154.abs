Title: Inflation in warped geometries
Authors: Alex Buchel and Radu Roiban
Abstract: We argue that brane anti-brane inflation in string theory de-Sitter vacua of Kachru-Kallosh-Linde-Trivedi (KKLT) is captured by the dynamics of a D3-brane probe in the local KKLT model constructed in hep-th/0203041. This provides a framework to study in a controllable way corrections to the inflationary slow roll parameter \eta due to conformal symmetry breaking in a warped geometry throat. We compute the leading correction to \eta for the inflation in the Klebanov-Tseytlin throat geometry. We find that in certain regime this correction tends to decrease \eta. Computations in a different regime suggest however that it is unlikely that \eta << 1 can be achieved with the D3-brane throat inflation.
