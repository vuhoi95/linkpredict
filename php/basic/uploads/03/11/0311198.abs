Title: The Universal Connection and Metrics on Moduli Spaces
Authors: Fortune Massamba and George Thompson
Abstract: We introduce a class of metrics on gauge theoretic moduli spaces. These metrics are made out of the universal matrix that appears in the universal connection construction of M. S. Narasimhan and S. Ramanan. As an example we construct metrics on the c_{2}=1 SU(2) moduli space of instantons on R^4 for various universal matrices.
