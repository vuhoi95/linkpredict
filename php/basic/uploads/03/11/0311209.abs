Title: Embedding Commutative and Noncommutative Theories in the Symplectic  Framework
Authors: Clifford Neves and Wilson Oliveira and Davi C. Rodrigues and Clovis Wotzasek
Abstract: This paper is devoted to study gauge embedding of either commutative and noncommutative theories in the framework of the symplectic formalism. We illustrate our ideas in the Proca model, the irrotational fluid model and the noncommutative self-dual model. In the process of this new path of embedding, the infinitesimal gauge generators of the gauge embedded theory are easily and directly chosen. Among other advantages, this enables a greater control over the final Lagrangian and puts some light on the so called ''arbitrariness problem".
