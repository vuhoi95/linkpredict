Title: Toric self-dual Einstein metrics as quotients
Authors: Charles P. Boyer and David M. J. Calderbank and Krzysztof Galicki and Paolo Piccinni
Abstract: We use the quaternion Kahler reduction technique to study old and new self-dual Einstein metrics of negative scalar curvature with at least a two-dimensional isometry group, and relate the quotient construction to the hyperbolic eigenfunction Ansatz. We focus in particular on the (semi-)quaternion Kahler quotients of (semi-)quaternion Kahler hyperboloids, analysing the completeness and topology, and relating them to the self-dual Einstein Hermitian metrics of Apostolov-Gauduchon and Bryant.
