Title: On PT-symmetric extensions of the Calogero and Sutherland models
Authors: Y. Brihaye and Ancilla Nininahazwe
Abstract: The original Calogero and Sutherland models describe N quantum particles on the line interacting pairwise through an inverse square and an inverse sinus-square potential. They are well known to be integrable and solvable. Here we extend the Calogero and Sutherland Hamiltonians by means of new interactions which are PT-symmetric but not self adjoint. Some of these new interactions lead to integrable PT-symmetric Hamiltonians; the algebraic properties further reveal that they are solvable as well. We also consider PT-symmetric interactions which lead to a new quasi-exactly solvable deformation of the Calogero and Sutherland Hamiltonians.
