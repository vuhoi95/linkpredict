Title: Inter-brane Interactions in Compact Spaces and Brane Inflation
Authors: Sarah Shandera and Benjamin Shlaer and Horace Stoica and S. -H. Henry Tye
Abstract: It was pointed out that brane-anti-brane inflation without warped geometry is not viable due to compactification effects (in the simplified scenario where the inflaton is decoupled from the compactification moduli). We show that the inflationary scenario with branes at a small angle in this simplified scenario remains viable. We also point out that brane-anti-brane inflation may still be viable under some special conditions. We also discuss a way to treat potentials in compact spaces that should be useful in the analysis of more realistic brane inflationary scenarios.
