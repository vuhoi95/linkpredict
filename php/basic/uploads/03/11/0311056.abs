Title: Nonlocal Quantum Gravity and the Size of the Universe
Authors: M. Reuter and F. Saueressig
Abstract: Motivated by the conjecture that the cosmological constant problem is solved by strong quantum effects in the infrared we use the exact flow equation of Quantum Einstein Gravity to determine the renormalization group behavior of a class of nonlocal effective actions. They consist of the Einstein-Hilbert term and a general nonlinear function $F_k(V)$ of the Euclidean spacetime volume $V$. For the $V + V \ln V$-invariant the renormalization group running enormously suppresses the value of the renormalized curvature which results from Planck-size parameters specified at the Planck scale. One obtains very large, i.e., almost flat universes without finetuning the cosmological constant. A critical infrared fixed point is found where gravity is scale invariant.
