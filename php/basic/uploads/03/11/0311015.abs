Title: 5-Dimensional Kaluza-Klein Theory with a Source
Authors: Yongge Ma and Jun Wu
Abstract: A free test particle in 5-dimensional Kaluza-Klein spacetime will show its electricity in the reduced 4-dimensional spacetime when it moves along the fifth dimension. In the light of this observation, we study the coupling of a 5-dimensional dust field with the Kaluza-Klein gravity. It turns out that the dust field can curve the 5-dimensional spacetime in such a way that it provides exactly the source of the electromagnetic field in the 4-dimensional spacetime after the dimensional reduction.
