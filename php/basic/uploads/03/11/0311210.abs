Title: An exact BPS wall solution in Five Dimensional Supergravity
Authors: Masato Arai and Shigeo Fujita and Masashi Naganuma and Norisuke Sakai
Abstract: In five-dimensional supergravity, an exact solution of BPS wall is found for a gravitational deformation of the massive Eguchi-Hanson nonlinear sigma model. The warp factor decreases for both infinities of the extra dimension. Thin wall limit gives the Randall-Sundrum model without fine-tuning of input parameters. We also obtain wall solutions with warp factors which are flat or increasing in one side, by varying a deformation parameter of the potential.
