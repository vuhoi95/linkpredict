Title: Sneutrino condensate source for density perturbations, leptogenesis and  low reheat temperature
Authors: Anupam Mazumdar and A. PÃ©rez-Lorenzana
Abstract: We bring together some known ingredients beyond the Standard Model physics which can explain the hot Big Bang model with the observed baryon asymmetry and also the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation with a minimal set of assumptions. We propose an interesting scenario where the inflaton energy density is dumped into an infinitely large extra dimension. Instead of the inflaton it is the right handed sneutrino condensate, which is acquiring non-zero vacuum expectation value during inflation, whose fluctuations are responsible for the density perturbations seen in the cosmic microwave background radiation with a spectral index $n_s\approx 1$. The decay of the condensate is explaining the reheating of the Universe with a temperature, $T_{rh}\leq 10^{9}$ GeV, and the baryon asymmetry of order one part in $10^{10}$ with no baryon-isocurvature fluctuations.
