Title: A First-Quantized Formalism for Cosmological Particle Production
Authors: Alex J. Hamilton and Daniel Kabat and Maulik K. Parikh
Abstract: We show that the amount of particle production in an arbitrary cosmological background can be determined using only the late-time positive-frequency modes. We don't refer to modes at early times, so there is no need for a Bogolubov transformation. We also show that particle production can be extracted from the Feynman propagator in an auxiliary spacetime. This provides a first-quantized formalism for computing particle production which, unlike conventional Bogolubov transformations, may be amenable to a string-theoretic generalization.
