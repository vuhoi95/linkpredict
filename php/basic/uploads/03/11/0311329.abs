Title: Nonforward anomalous dimensions of Wilson operators in N=4  super-Yang-Mills theory
Authors: A. I. Onishchenko and V. N. Velizhanin
Abstract: We present the next-to-leading order results for universal non-forward anomalous dimensions of Wilson twist-2 operators in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The whole calculation was performed using supersymmetric Ward identities derived in this paper together with already known QCD results and does not involve any additional calculation of diagrams. We also considered one particular limit of our result, which could potentially be interesting in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence.
