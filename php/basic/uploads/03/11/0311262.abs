Abstract: Recently the study of braneworld on the self-gravitating D-brane has been initiated and derived the gravitational equation on the brane by holographic and geometrical projection methods. Surprisingly, in common with these two methods, the matter on the brane cannot be the source of the gravity on the brane at leading order. In this paper we will propose the low energy effective action on the D-brane coupled with gravity which derives the same results.
