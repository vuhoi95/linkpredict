Title: Rotating Black String and Effective Teukolsky Equation in Braneworld
Authors: Sugumi Kanno and Jiro Soda
Abstract: In the Randall-Sundrum two-brane model (RS1), a Kerr black hole on the brane can be naturally identified with a section of rotating black string. To estimate Kaluza-Klein (KK) corrections on gravitational waves emitted by perturbed rotating black strings, we give the effective Teukolsky equation on the brane which is separable equation and hence numerically manageable. In this process, we derive the master equation for the electric part of the Weyl tensor $E_{\mu\nu}$ which would be also useful to discuss the transition from black strings to localized black holes triggered by Gregory-Laflamme instability.
