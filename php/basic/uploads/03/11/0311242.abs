Title: The charges of a twisted brane
Authors: Matthias R Gaberdiel and Terry Gannon
Abstract: The charges of the twisted D-branes of certain WZW models are determined. The twisted D-branes are labelled by twisted representations of the affine algebra, and their charge is simply the ground state multiplicity of the twisted representation. It is shown that the resulting charge group is isomorphic to the charge group of the untwisted branes, as had been anticipated from a K-theory calculation. Our arguments rely on a number of non-trivial Lie theoretic identities.
