Title: The Problem of Monopoles in the Standard and Family Replicated Models
Authors: L. Laperashvili and H. B. Nielsen
Abstract: The aim of the present talk is to show that monopoles cannot play any role in the Standard Model (SM) and in its usual extensions up to the Planck scale: $M_{Pl}=1.22\cdot 10^{19}$ GeV, because they have a huge charge and are completely confined or screened. The possibility of the extension of the SM with Family Replicated Gauge Group (FRGG) symmetry of the type $(SMG)^N=[SU(3)_c]^N\times [SU(2)_L]^N\times [U(1)_Y]^N$ is briefly discussed. It was shown that the Abelian monopoles (existing also in non-Abelian theories) in FRGG model have $N^*$ times smaller magnetic charge than in the SM, where $N^*=N(N+1)/2$. These monopoles can appear at the high energies in the FRGG-model and give additional contributions to the beta-functions of the renormalisation group equations for the running constants $\alpha_i(\mu)$, where i=1,2,3 correspond to the U(1), SU(2) and SU(3) gauge groups of the SM.
