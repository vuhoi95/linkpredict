Title: Comments on Noncommutative Field Theories
Authors: L. Alvarez-Gaume and M. A. Vazquez-Mozo
Abstract: We discuss some aspects of noncommutative quantum field theories obtained from the Seiberg-Witten limit of string theories in the presence of an external B-field. General properties of these theories are studied as well as the phenomenological potential of noncommutative QED.
