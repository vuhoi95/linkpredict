Title: Higher order loop equations for A_r and D_r quiver matrix models
Authors: Stefano Chiantese and Albrecht Klemm and Ingo Runkel
Abstract: We use free boson techniques to investigate A-D-E-quiver matrix models. Certain higher spin fields in the free boson formulation give rise to higher order loop equations valid at finite N. These fields form a special kind of W-algebra, called Casimir algebra. We compute explicitly the loop equations for A_r and D_r quiver models and check that at large N they are related to a deformation of the corresponding singular Calabi-Yau geometry.
