Authors: V. V. Gribanov and V. G. Kadyshevsky and A. S. Sorin
Abstract: Bi-Hamiltonian structure and Lax pair formulation with the spectral parameter of the generalized fermionic Toda lattice hierarchy as well as its bosonic and fermionic symmetries for different (including periodic) boundary conditions are described. Its two reductions --N=4 and N=2 supersymmetric Toda lattice hierarchies-- in different (including canonical) bases are investigated. Its r-matrix description, monodromy matrix, and spectral curves are discussed.
