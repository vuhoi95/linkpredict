Title: Fuzzy CP(n|m) as a quantum superspace
Authors: Evgeny Ivanov and Luca Mezincescu and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: The `Chern-Simons Quantum Mechanics' of a particle on CP(n|m) is shown to yield the fuzzy descriptions of these superspaces, for which we construct the non-(anti)commuting position operators. For a particle on the supersphere CP(1|1) = SU(2|1)/U(1|1), the particle's wave-function at fuzziness level 2s is shown to be a degenerate irrep of SU(2|1) describing a supermultiplet of SU(2) spins (s-1\2, s).
