Title: Anti-de-Sitter vacua require fermionic brane charges
Authors: Kasper Peeters and Marija Zamaklar
Abstract: We argue that a modification of the super-AdS algebras which accounts for the presence of D-branes requires not only the inclusion of bosonic brane charges, but also the inclusion of new fermionic ones. We show that such fermionic brane charges are indeed present in the matrix model and the supermembrane in the pp-wave limit of the corresponding backgrounds. We briefly comment on an AdS version of Sezgin's M-algebra inspired by this observation.
