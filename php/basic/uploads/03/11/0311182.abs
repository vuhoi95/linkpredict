Title: Tachyon Condensation for Intersecting Branes at Small and Large Angles
Authors: F. Epple and D. Lust
Abstract: We review the worldsheet analysis for intersecting branes with focus on small and large angles. For small angles, we review the Yang-Mills fluctuation analysis in hep-th/0303204 and find an additional family of massless modes. They are the components of a Goldstone scalar corresponding to the spontaneously broken U(2)-gauge symmetry. For branes at large angles, we derive an effective tachyon field theory from BSFT results. We show how the gauge symmetry of this system implies a mass spectrum which is consistent with the worldsheet analysis.
