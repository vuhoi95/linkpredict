Title: Fluxes in M-theory on 7-manifolds: G-structures and Superpotential
Authors: Klaus Behrndt and Claus Jeschek
Abstract: We consider compactifications of M-theory on 7-manifolds in the presence of 4-form fluxes, which leave at least four supercharges unbroken. We focus especially on the case, where the 7-manifold supports two spinors which are SU(3) singlets and the fluxes appear as specific SU(3) structures. We derive the constraints on the fluxes imposed by supersymmetry and calculate the resulting 4-dimensional superpotential.
