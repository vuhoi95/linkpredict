Title: MSSM Higgses as the source of reheating and all matter
Authors: Kari Enqvist and Shinta Kasuya and Anupam Mazumdar
Abstract: We consider the possibility that the dark energy responsible for inflation is deposited into extra dimensions outside of our observable universe. Reheating and all matter can then be obtained from the MSSM flat direction condensate involving the Higgses $H_u$ and $H_d$, which acquires large amplitude by virtue of quantum fluctuations during inflation. The reheat temperature is $T_{RH} \lesssim 10^9$ GeV so that there is no gravitino problem. We find a spectral index $n_s\approx 1$ with a very weak dependence on the Higgs potential.
