Title: Non-perturbative Kahler Potential, Dilaton Stabilization and  Fayet-Iliopoulos Term
Authors: Tetsutaro Higaki and Yoshiharu Kawamura and Tatsuo Kobayashi and Hiroaki Nakano
Abstract: We study the dilaton stabilization in models with anomalous U(1) symmetry by adding specific string-motivated, non-perturbative corrections to the tree-level dilaton K\"{a}hler potential. We find that the non-perturbative effects can stabilize the dilaton at a desirably large value. We also observe that the size of Fayet-Iliopoulos term is reduced at the stabilized point.
