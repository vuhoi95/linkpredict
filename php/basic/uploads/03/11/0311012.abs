Abstract: We present simulation results employing overlap fermions for the axial correlation functions in the epsilon-regime of chiral perturbation theory. In this regime, finite size effects and topology play a dominant role. Their description by quenched chiral perturbation theory is compared to our numerical results in quenched QCD. We show that lattices with a linear extent L > 1.1 fm are necessary to interpret the numerical data obtained in distinct topological sectors in terms of the epsilon-expansion. Such lattices are, however, still substantially smaller than the ones needed in standard chiral perturbation theory. However, we also observe severe difficulties at very low values of the quark mass, in particular in the topologically trivial sector.
