Abstract: We investigate five dimensional Einstein spaces in warped geometries from the point of view of the four dimensional physically relevant Robertson-Walker-Friedman cosmological metric and the Schwarzschild metric. We show that a four-dimensional cosmology with a closed spacelike section and a cosmological constant can be imbedded into five-dimensional flat space-time.
