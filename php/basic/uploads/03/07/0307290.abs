Title: The effect of nonlocal confining kernels on magnetic chiral condensates
Authors: R. Gonzalez Felipe and G. M. Marques and J. E. Ribeiro
Abstract: The physics of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the case of the simultaneous presence of a magnetic field and a fermionic quartic interaction is discussed for both local and nonlocal kernels in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions. The approach is based on the use of Valatin-Bogoliubov canonical transformations, which allow, in the absence of fermionic quartic terms, to completely diagonalize the Hamiltonian and construct the vacuum state.
