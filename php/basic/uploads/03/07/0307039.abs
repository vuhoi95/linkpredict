Title: Supersymmetry in noncommutative superspaces
Authors: S. Ferrara and M. A. Lledo and O. Macia
Abstract: Non commutative superspaces can be introduced as the Moyal-Weyl quantization of a Poisson bracket for classical superfields. Different deformations are studied corresponding to constant background fields in string theory. Supersymmetric and non supersymmetric deformations can be defined, depending on the differential operators used to define the Poisson bracket. Some examples of deformed, 4 dimensional lagrangians are given. For extended superspace (N>1), some new deformations can be defined, with no analogue in the N=1 case.
