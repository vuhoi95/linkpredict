Title: Two-loop Renormalization for Nonanticommutative N=1/2 Supersymmetric WZ  Model
Authors: Marcus T. Grisaru and Silvia Penati and Alberto Romagnoni
Abstract: We study systematically, through two loops, the divergence structure of the supersymmetric WZ model defined on the N=1/2 nonanticommutative superspace. By introducing a spurion field to represent the supersymmetry breaking term F^3 we are able to perform our calculations using conventional supergraph techniques. Divergent terms proportional to F, F^2 and F^3 are produced (the first two are to be expected on general grounds) but no higher-point divergences are found. By adding ab initio F and F^2 terms to the original lagrangian we render the model renormalizable. We determine the renormalization constants and beta functions through two loops, thus making it possible to study the renormalization group flow of the nonanticommutation parameter.
