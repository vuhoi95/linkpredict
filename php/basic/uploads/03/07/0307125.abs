Title: Finite-Volume Form Factors in Semiclassical Approximation
Authors: G. Mussardo and V. Riva and G. Sotkov
Abstract: A semiclassical approach is used to obtain Lorentz covariant expressions for the form factors between the kink states of a quantum field theory with degenerate vacua. Implemented on a cylinder geometry it provides an estimate of the spectral representation of correlation functions in a finite volume. Illustrative examples of the applicability of the method are provided by the Sine-Gordon and the broken \phi^4 theories in 1+1 dimensions.
