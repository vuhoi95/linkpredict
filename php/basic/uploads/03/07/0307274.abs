Title: Vacua of Massive Hyper-Kahler Sigma Models with Non-Abelian Quotient
Authors: Masato Arai and Muneto Nitta and Norisuke Sakai
Abstract: The Higgs branch of N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories with non-Abelian gauge groups are described by hyper-Kahler (HK) nonlinear sigma models with potential terms. With the non-Abelian HK quotient by U(M) and SU(M) gauge groups, we give the massive HK sigma models that are not toric in the N=1 superfield formalism and the harmonic superspace formalism. The U(M) quotient gives N!/[M! (N-M)!] discrete vacua that may allow various types of domain walls, whereas the SU(M) quotient gives no discrete vacua.
