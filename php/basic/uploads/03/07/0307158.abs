Title: Towards black hole scattering
Authors: Jan Troost and Asato Tsuchiya
Abstract: We study black holes in three-dimensional Chern-Simons gravity with a negative cosmological constant. In particular, we identify how the Chern-Simons interactions between a scattering particle and a black hole project the particle wavefunction onto a wavefunction in the black hole background. We also analyze the set of space-times that should be allowed in the theory and the way in which boundary conditions affect the spectrum of space-times.
