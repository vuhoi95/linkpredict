Authors: A. Lima-Santos and R. Malara
Abstract: We investigate the possible regular solutions of the boundary Yang-Baxter equation for the vertex models associated with the $C_{n}^{(1)}$, $D_{n}^{(1)}$ and $A_{2n-1}^{(2)}$ affine Lie algebras. We find three types of solutions with $n$, $n-1$ and 1 free parameters,respectively. Special cases and all diagonal solutions are presented separately.
