Title: Non-equivalence between Heisenberg XXZ spin chain and Thirring model
Authors: T. Fujita and T. Kobayashi and M. Hiramoto and H. Takahashi
Abstract: The Bethe ansatz equations for the spin 1/2 Heisenberg XXZ spin chain are numerically solved, and the energy eigenvalues are determined for the anti-ferromagnetic case. We examine the relation between the XXZ spin chain and the Thirring model, and show that the spectrum of the XXZ spin chain is different from that of the regularized Thirring model.
