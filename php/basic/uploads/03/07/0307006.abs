Title: Gauged locally supersymmetric D=3 nonlinear sigma models
Authors: Bernard de Wit and Ivan Herger and Henning Samtleben
Abstract: We construct supersymmetric deformations of general, locally supersymmetric, nonlinear sigma models in three spacetime dimensions, by extending the pure supergravity theory with a Chern-Simons term and gauging a subgroup of the sigma model isometries, possibly augmented with R-symmetry transformations. This class of models is shown to include theories with standard Yang-Mills Lagrangians, with optional moment interactions and topological mass terms. The results constitute a general classification of three-dimensional gauged supergravities.
