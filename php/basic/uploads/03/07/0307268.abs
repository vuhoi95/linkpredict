Title: String loop corrections to the universal hypermultiplet
Authors: Ignatios Antoniadis and Ruben Minasian and Stefan Theisen and Pierre Vanhove
Abstract: We study loop corrections to the universal dilaton supermultiplet for type IIA strings compactified on Calabi-Yau threefolds. We show that the corresponding quaternionic kinetic terms receive non-trivial one-loop contributions proportional to the Euler number of the Calabi-Yau manifold, while the higher-loop corrections can be absorbed by field redefinitions. The corrected metric is no longer Kahler. Our analysis implies in particular that the Calabi-Yau volume is renormalized by loop effects which are present even in higher orders, while there are also one-loop corrections to the Bianchi identities for the NS and RR field strengths.
