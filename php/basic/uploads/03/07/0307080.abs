Title: Dyons in N=4 Gauged Supergravity
Authors: D. H. Correa and A. D. Medina and E. F. Moreno and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We study monopole and dyon solutions to the equations of motion of the bosonic sector of N = 4 gauged supergravity in four dimensional space-time. A static, spherically symmetric ansatz for the metric, gauge fields, dilaton and axion leads to soliton solutions which, in the electrically charged case, have compact spatial sections. Both analytical and numerical results for the solutions are presented.
