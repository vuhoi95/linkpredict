Title: New D=6, N=(1,1) Gauged Supergravity with Supersymmetric (Minkowski)_4 X  S^2 Vacuum
Authors: J. Kerimo and H. Lu
Abstract: We obtain a new gauged D=6, N=(1,1) pure supergravity by a generalised consistent Kaluza-Klein reduction of M-theory on K3 \times R. The reduction requires a conspiratory gauging of both the Cremmer-Julia type global (rigid) symmetry and the homogeneous rescaling symmetry of the supergravity equations of motion. The gauged supergravity is different from the Romans D=6 gauged supergravity in that the four vector fields in our new theory are all abelian. We show that it admits a supersymmetric (Minkowski)_4\times S^2 vacuum, which can be lifted to D=11 where it becomes the near-horizon geometry of two intersecting M5-branes wrapping on a supersymmetric two-cycle of K3.
