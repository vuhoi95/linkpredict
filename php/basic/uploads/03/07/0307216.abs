Title: Properties of non-extremal enhancons
Authors: Apostolos Dimitriadis and Simon F. Ross
Abstract: We study the supergravity solutions describing non-extremal enhancons. There are two branches of solutions: a `shell branch' connected to the extremal solution, and a `horizon branch' which connects to the Schwarzschild black hole at large mass. We show that the shell branch solutions violate the weak energy condition, and are hence unphysical. We investigate linearized perturbations of the horizon branch and the extremal solution numerically, completing an investigation initiated in a previous paper. We show that these solutions are stable against the perturbations we consider. This provides further evidence that these latter supergravity solutions are capturing some of the true physics of the enhancon.
