Title: Explicit Analysis of Kahler Deformations in 4D N=1 Supersymmetric Quiver  Theories
Authors: Malika Ait Benhaddou and El Hassan Saidi
Abstract: Starting from the $\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM$_{4}$ quiver theory living on wrapped $% N_{i}D5$ branes around $S_{i}^{2}$ spheres of deformed ADE fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds (CY3) and considering deformations using \textit{% massive} vector multiplets, we explicitly build a new class of $\mathcal{N}% =1 $ quiver gauge theories. In these models, the quiver gauge group $% \prod_{i}U(N_{i}) $ is spontaneously broken down to $% \prod_{i}SU(N_{i}) $ and Kahler deformations are shown to be given by the real part of the integral $(2,1) $ form of CY3. We also give the superfield correspondence between the $\mathcal{N}=1$ quiver gauge models derived here and those constructed in hep-th/0108120 using complex deformations. Others aspects of these two dual $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric field theories are discussed.
