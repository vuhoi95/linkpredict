Title: Radionic Non-uniform Black Strings
Authors: Takashi Tamaki and Sugumi Kanno and Jiro Soda
Abstract: Non-uniform black strings in the two-brane system are investigated using the effective action approach. It is shown that the radion acts as a non-trivial hair of the black strings. From the brane point of view, the black string appears as the deformed dilatonic black hole which becomes dilatonic black hole in the single brane limit and reduces to the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in the close limit of two-branes. The stability of solutions is demonstrated using the catastrophe theory. From the bulk point of view, the black strings are proved to be non-uniform. Nevertheless, the zeroth law of black hole thermodynamics still holds.
