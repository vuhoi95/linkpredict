Abstract: A general formalism is developed that allows the construction of a field theory on quantum spaces which are deformations of ordinary spacetime. The symmetry group of spacetime (Poincar\' e group) is replaced by a quantum group. This formalism is demonstrated for the kappa-deformed Poincar\'e algebra and its quantum space. The algebraic setting is mapped to the algebra of functions of commuting variables with a suitable star-product. Fields are elements of this function algebra. The Dirac and Klein-Gordon equation are defined and an action is found from which they can be derived.
