Title: Delocalised Spinors
Authors: N. S. Manton and A. F. Schunck
Abstract: Solutions to the four-dimensional Euclidean Weyl equation in the background of a general JNR N-instanton are known to be normalisable and regular throughout four-space. We show that these solutions are asymptotically given by a linear combination of simple singular solutions to the free Weyl equation, which can be interpreted as localised spinors. The `spinorial' data parameterising the asymptotics of the delocalised solutions to the Weyl equation in the presence of the instanton almost determines the background instanton, yet not completely. However, it captures the geometry and symmetry of the underlying instanton configuration.
