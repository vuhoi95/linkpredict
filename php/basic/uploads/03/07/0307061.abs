Title: Killing Reduction of 5-Dimensional Spacetimes
Authors: Xuejun Yang and Yongge Ma and Jianbing Shao and Wei Zhou
Abstract: In a 5-dimensional spacetime ($M,g_{ab}$) with a Killing vector field $\xi ^a$ which is either everywhere timelike or everywhere spacelike, the collection of all trajectories of $\xi ^a$ gives a 4-dimensional space $S$. The reduction of ($M,g_{ab}$) is studied in the geometric language, which is a generalization of Geroch's method for the reduction of 4-dimensional spacetime. A 4-dimensional gravity coupled to a vector field and a scalar field on $S$ is obtained by the reduction of vacuum Einstein's equations on $M$, which gives also an alternative description of the 5-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory. Besides the symmetry-reduced action from the Hilbert action on $M$, an alternative action of the fields on $S$ is also obtained, the variations of which lead to the same fields equations as those reduced from the vacuum Einstein equation on $M$.
