Title: Intersecting D-branes in Type IIB Plane Wave Background
Authors: Kyung-Seok Cha and Bum-Hoon Lee and Hyun Seok Yang
Abstract: We study intersecting D-branes in a type IIB plane wave background using Green-Schwarz worldsheet formulation. We consider all possible $D_\pm$-branes intersecting at angles in the plane wave background and identify their residual supersymmetries. We find, in particular, that $D_\mp - D_\pm$ brane intersections preserve no supersymmetry. We also present the explicit worldsheet expressions of conserved supercharges and their supersymmetry algebras.
