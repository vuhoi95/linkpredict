Title: 3D gravity with torsion as a Chern-Simons gauge theory
Authors: M. Blagojevic and M. Vasilic
Abstract: We show that topological 3D gravity with torsion can be formulated as a Chern-Simons gauge theory, provided a specific parameter, known as the effective cosmological constant, is negative. In that case, the boundary dynamics of the theory corresponding to anti-de Sitter boundary conditions is described by a conformal field theory with two different central charges.
