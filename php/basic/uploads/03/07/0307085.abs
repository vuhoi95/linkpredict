Title: 2+1 gravity and Doubly Special Relativity
Authors: Laurent Freidel and Jerzy Kowalski-Glikman and Lee Smolin
Abstract: It is shown that gravity in 2+1 dimensions coupled to point particles provides a nontrivial example of Doubly Special Relativity (DSR). This result is obtained by interpretation of previous results in the field and by exhibiting an explicit transformation between the phase space algebra for one particle in 2+1 gravity found by Matschull and Welling and the corresponding DSR algebra. The identification of 2+1 gravity as a $DSR$ system answers a number of questions concerning the latter, and resolves the ambiguity of the basis of the algebra of observables. Based on this observation a heuristic argument is made that the algebra of symmetries of ultra high energy particle kinematics in 3+1 dimensions is described by some DSR theory.
