Title: Can modified gravity explain accelerated cosmic expansion?
Authors: A. D. Dolgov and M. Kawasaki
Abstract: We show that the recently suggested explanations of cosmic acceleration by the modification of gravity at small curvature suffer violent instabilities and strongly disagree with the known properties of gravitational interactions.
