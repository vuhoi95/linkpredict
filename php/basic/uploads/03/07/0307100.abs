Title: CMB anisotropies from vector perturbations in the bulk
Authors: Christophe Ringeval and Timon Boehm and Ruth Durrer
Abstract: The vector perturbations induced on the brane by gravitational waves propagating in the bulk are studied in a cosmological framework. Cosmic expansion arises from the brane motion in a non-compact five-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime. By solving the vector perturbation equations in the bulk, for generic initial conditions, we find that they give rise to growing modes on the brane in the Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre era. Among these modes, we exhibit a class of normalizable perturbations, which are exponentially growing with respect to conformal time on the brane. The presence of these modes is, at least, strongly constrained by the current observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We estimate the anisotropies they induce in the CMB, and derive quantitative constraints on the allowed amplitude of their primordial spectrum. Our results provide stringent constraints for all braneworld models with bulk inflation.
