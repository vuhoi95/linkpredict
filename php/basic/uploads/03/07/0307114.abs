Title: (2+1)D Noncommutative CP$^{N-1}$ Model

Abstract: We investigate possible extensions of the (2+1) dimensional $CP^{N-1}$ model to the noncommutative space. Up to the leading nontrivial order of 1/N, we prove that the model restricted to the left fundamental representation of the gauge group is renormalizable and does not have dangerous infrared divergences. In contrast, if the basic field $\phi$ transforms in accord with the adjoint representation, infrared singularities are present in the two point function of the auxiliary gauge field and also in the leading correction to the self-energy of the $\phi$ field. These infrared divergences may produce nonintegrable singularities leading at higher orders to a breakdown of the 1/N expansion. Gauge invariance of the renormalization procedure is also discussed.
