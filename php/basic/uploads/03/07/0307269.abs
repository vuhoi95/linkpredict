Title: Integrable Low Dimensional Theories Describing High Dimensional Branes,  Black Holes and Cosmologies
Authors: V. de Alfaro and A. T. Filippov
Abstract: The reduction of higher dimensional supergravities to low dimensional dilaton gravity theories is outlined. Then a recently proposed new class of integrable theories of 0+1 and 1+1 dimensional dilaton gravity coupled to any number of scalar fields is described in more detail. These models are reducible to systems of independent Liouville equations whose solutions are not independent because they must satisfy the energy and momentum constraints. The constraints are solved, thus giving the explicit analytic solution of the theory in terms of arbitrary chiral fields. In particular, these integrable theories describe spherically symmetric black holes and branes of higher dimensional supergravity theories as well as superstring motivated cosmological models.
