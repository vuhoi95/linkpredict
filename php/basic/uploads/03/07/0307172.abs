Title: A Four Dimensional Superstring from the Bosonic String with Some  Applications
Authors: B. B. Deo and L. Maharana
Abstract: A string in four dimensions is constructed by supplementing it with forty four Majorana fermions. The later are represented by eleven vectors in the bosonic representation $SO(D-1,1)$. The central charge is 26. The fermions are grouped in such a way that the resulting action is world sheet supersymmetric. The energy momentum and current generators satisfy the super-Virasoro algebra. GSO projections are necessary for proving modular invariance. Space-time supersymmetry algebra is deduced and is substantiated for specific modes of zero mass. The symmetry group of the model can descend to the low energy standard model group $SU (3) \times SU_L (2) \times U_Y (1)$ through the Pati-Salam group.
