Title: Gravitational Wave detection through microlensing?
Authors: R. Ragazzoni and G. Valente and E. Marchetti
Abstract: It is shown that accurate photometric observations of a relatively high--magnification microlensing event ($A\gg 1$), occurring close to the line of sight of a gravitational wave (GW) source, represented by a binary star, can allow the detection of subtle gravitational effects. After reviewing the physical nature of such effects, it is discussed to what extent these phenomena can actually be due to GWs. Expressions for the amplitude of the phenomena and the detection probability are supplied.
