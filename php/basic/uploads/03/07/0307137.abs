Title: Comments on Dualities on Group Manifolds and Supersymmetry
Authors: Svend E. Hjelmeland and Ulf Lindstrom
Abstract: We review some facts about various T-dualities and sigma models on group manifolds, with particular emphasis on supersymmetry. We point out some of the problems in reconciling Poisson-Lie duality with the bi-hermitean geometry of N=2 supersymmetric sigma models. A couple of examples of supersymmetric models admitting Poisson-Lie duality are included.
