Title: Quark confinement without a confining force
Authors: P. S. Isaac and W. P. Joyce and J. Links
Abstract: We show that a non-associative structure applied to the algebra of Fermi operators with su(3) colour degrees of freedom leads to a consistent Fermi statistic for the tensor operators of the colour algebra. A consequence of this construction is that leads to quark confinement, without the need to resort to a confining force. Confinement arises as a symmetry constraint in much the same manner as the Pauli exclusion principle.
