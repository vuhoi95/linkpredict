Title: Generalized Uncertainty Principle, Extra-dimensions and Holography
Authors: F. Scardigli and R. Casadio
Abstract: We consider Uncertainty Principles which take into account the role of gravity and the possible existence of extra spatial dimensions. Explicit expressions for such Generalized Uncertainty Principles in 4+n dimensions are given and their holographic properties investigated. In particular, we show that the predicted number of degrees of freedom enclosed in a given spatial volume matches the holographic counting only for one of the available generalizations and without extra dimensions.
