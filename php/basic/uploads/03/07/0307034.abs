Title: Traversable Wormholes Construction in 2+1 Dimensions
Authors: Won Tae Kim and John J. Oh and Myung Seok Yoon
Abstract: We study traversable Lorentzian wormholes in the three-dimensional low energy string theory by adding some matter source involving a dilaton field. It will be shown that there are two-different types of wormhole solutions such as BTZ and black string wormholes depending on the dilaton backgrounds, respectively. We finally obtain the desirable solutions which confine exotic matter near the throat of wormhole by adjusting NS charge.
