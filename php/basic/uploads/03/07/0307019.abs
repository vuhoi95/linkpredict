Title: Yang-Mills Action from Open Superstring Field Theory
Authors: Nathan Berkovits and Martin Schnabl
Abstract: We calculate the effective action for nonabelian gauge bosons up to quartic order using WZW-like open superstring field theory. After including level zero and level one contributions, we obtain with 75% accuracy the Yang-Mills quartic term. We then prove that the complete effective action reproduces the exact Yang-Mills quartic term by analytically performing a summation over the intermediate massive states.
