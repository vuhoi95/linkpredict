Abstract: We derive a duality-symmetric action for type IIA D=10 supergravity by the Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction of the duality-symmetric action for D=11 supergravity with the 3-form and 6-form gauge field. We then double the bosonic fields arising as a result of the Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction and add mass terms to embrace the Romans's version, so that in its final form the bosonic part of the action contains the dilaton, NS-NS and RR potentials of the standard type IIA supergravity as well as their duals, the corresponding duality relations are deduced directly from the action. We discuss the relation of our approach to the doubled field formalism by Cremmer, Julia, Lu and Pope, complete the extension of this construction to the supersymmetric case and lift it onto the level of the proper duality-symmetric action. We also find a new dual formulation of type IIA D=10 supergravity in which the NS-NS two-form potential is replaced with its six-form counterpart. A truncation of this dual model produces the Chamseddine's version of N=1, D=10 supergravity.
