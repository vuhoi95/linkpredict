Title: Non-Abelian generalization of Born-Infeld theory inspired by  non-commutative geometry
Authors: Emmanuel Serie and Thierry Masson and Richard Kerner
Abstract: We present a new non-abelian generalization of the Born-Infeld Lagrangian. It is based on the observation that the basic quantity defining it is the generalized volume element, computed as the determinant of a linear combination of metric and Maxwell tensors. We propose to extend the notion of determinant to the tensor product of space-time and a matrix representation of the gauge group. We compute such a Lagrangian explicitly in the case of the SU(2) gauge group and then explore the properties of static, spherically symmetric solutions in this model. We have found a one-parameter family of finite energy solutions. In the last section, the main properties of these solutions are displayed and discussed.
