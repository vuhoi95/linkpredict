Title: Scaling algebras for charged fields and short-distance analysis for  localizable and topological charges
Authors: Claudio D'Antoni and Gerardo Morsella and Rainer Verch
Abstract: The method of scaling algebras, which has been introduced earlier as a means for analyzing the short-distance behaviour of quantum field theories in the setting of the model-independent, operator-algebraic approach, is extended to the case of fields carrying superselection charges. In doing so, consideration will be given to strictly localizable charges ("DHR-type" superselection charges) as well as to charges which can only be localized in regions extending to spacelike infinity ("BF-type" superselection charges). A criterion for the preservance of superselection charges in the short-distance scaling limit is proposed. Consequences of this preservance of superselection charges are studied. The conjugate charge of a preserved charge is also preserved, and for charges of DHR-type, the preservance of all charges of a quantum field theory in the scaling limit leads to equivalence of local and global intertwiners between superselection sectors.
