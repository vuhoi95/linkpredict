Title: Born-Infeld Quantum Condensate as Dark Energy in the Universe
Authors: Emilio Elizalde and James E. Lidsey and Shinichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: Some cosmological implications of ultraviolet quantum effects leading to a condensation of Born-Infeld matter are considered. It is shown that under very general conditions the quantum condensate can not act as phantom matter if its energy density is positive. On the other hand, it behaves as an effective cosmological constant in the limit where quantum induced contributions to the energy-momentum tensor dominate over the classical effects.
