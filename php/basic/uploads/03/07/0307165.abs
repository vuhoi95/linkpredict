Title: N=1/2 Wess-Zumino model is renormalizable
Authors: Ruth Britto and Bo Feng
Abstract: The Wess-Zumino model on N=1/2 nonanticommutative superspace, which contains the dimension-6 term F^3, is shown to be renormalizable to all orders in perturbation theory, upon adding F and F^2 terms to the original Lagrangian. The renormalizability is possible, even with this higher-dimension operator, because the Lagrangian is not hermitian. Such deformed field theories arise naturally in string theory with a graviphoton background.
