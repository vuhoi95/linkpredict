Title: Supersymmetric Gauge Theories on Noncommutative Superspace
Authors: Takeo Araki and Katsushi Ito and Akihisa Ohtsuka
Abstract: We study four dimensional supersymmetric gauge theory on the noncommutative superspace, recently proposed by Seiberg. We construct the gauge-invariant action of N=1 super Yang-Mills theory with chiral and antichiral superfields, which has N=1/2 supersymmetry on the noncommutative superspace. We also construct the action of N=2 super Yang-Mills theory. It is shown that this theory has only N=1/2 supersymmetry.
