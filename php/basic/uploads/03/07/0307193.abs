Title: Spectrum of Eleven-dimensional Supergravity on a PP-wave Background
Authors: Tetsuji Kimura and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We calculate the spectrum of the linearized supergravity around the maximally supersymmetric pp-wave background in eleven dimensions. The resulting spectrum agrees with that of zero-mode Hamiltonian of a supermembrane theory on the pp-wave background. We also discuss the connection with the Kaluza-Klein zero modes of AdS_4 x S^7 background.
