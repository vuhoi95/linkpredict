Title: On observability of Renyi's entropy
Authors: Petr Jizba and Toshihico Arimitsu
Abstract: Despite recent claims we argue that Renyi's entropy is an observable quantity. It is shown that, contrary to popular belief, the reported domain of instability for Renyi entropies has zero measure (Bhattacharyya measure). In addition, we show the instabilities can be easily emended by introducing a coarse graining into an actual measurement. We also clear up doubts regarding the observability of Renyi's entropy in (multi--)fractal systems and in systems with absolutely continuous PDF's.
