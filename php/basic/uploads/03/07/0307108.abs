Title: Radiation from accelerated black holes in an anti-de Sitter universe
Authors: Jiri Podolsky and Marcello Ortaggio and Pavel Krtous
Abstract: We study gravitational and electromagnetic radiation generated by uniformly accelerated charged black holes in anti-de Sitter spacetime. This is described by the C-metric exact solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations with a negative cosmological constant Lambda. We explicitly find and interpret the pattern of radiation that characterizes the dependence of the fields on a null direction from which the (timelike) conformal infinity is approached. This directional pattern exhibits specific properties which are more complicated if compared with recent analogous results obtained for asymptotic behavior of fields near a de Sitter-like infinity. In particular, for large acceleration the anti-de Sitter-like infinity is divided by Killing horizons into several distinct domains with a different structure of principal null directions, in which the patterns of radiation differ.
