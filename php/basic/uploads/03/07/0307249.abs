Title: Mass Generation and Symmetry Breaking in Chern-Simons Supergravity
Authors: Jorge Alfaro and Maximo Banados
Abstract: We argue that the quartic fermionic potential of five-dimensional Chern-Simons supergravity induces spontaneous symmetry breaking, in a phenomenon bearing a close connection with the Nambu and Jona-Lasinio model.
