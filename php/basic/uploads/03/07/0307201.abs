Title: Quest for Localized 4-D Black Holes in Brane Worlds. II : Removing the  bulk singularities
Authors: P. Kanti and I. Olasagasti and K. Tamvakis
Abstract: We analyze further the possibility of obtaining localized black hole solutions in the framework of Randall-Sundrum-type brane-world models. We consider black hole line-elements analytic at the horizon, namely, generalizations of the Painleve and Vaidya metrics, which are taken to have a decaying dependence of the horizon on the extra dimension. These backgrounds have no other singularities apart from the standard black hole singularity which is localized in the direction of the fifth dimension. Both line-elements can be sustained by a regular, shell-like distribution of bulk matter of a non-standard form. Of the two, the Vaidya line-element is shown to provide the most attractive, natural choice: despite the scaling of the horizon, the 5D spacetime has the same topological structure as the one of a RS-Schwarzschild spacetime and demands a minimal bulk energy-momentum tensor.
