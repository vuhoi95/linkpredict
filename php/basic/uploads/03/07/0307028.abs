Title: Super Heavy Dark Matter Anisotropies from D-particles in the Early  Universe
Authors: N. E. Mavromatos and J. Papavassiliou
Abstract: We discuss a way of producing anisotropies in the spectrum of superheavy Dark matter, which are due to the distortion of the inflationary space time induced by the recoil of D-particles upon their scattering with ordinary string matter in the Early Universe. We calculate such distortions by world-sheet Liouville string theory (perturbative) methods. The resulting anisotropies are found to be proportional to the average recoil velocity and density of the D-particles. In our analysis we employ a regulated version of de Sitter space, allowing for graceful exit from inflation. This guarantees the asymptotic flatness of the space time, as required for a consistent interpretation, within an effective field theory context, of the associated Bogolubov coefficients as particle number densities. The latter are computed by standard WKB methods.
