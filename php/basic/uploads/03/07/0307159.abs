Abstract: A new exactly solvable relativistic periodic potential is obtained by the periodic extension of a well-known transparent scalar potential. It is found that the energy band edges are determined by a transcendental equation which is very similar to the corresponding equation for the Dirac Kronig-Penney model. The solutions of the Dirac equation are expressed in terms of elementary functions.
