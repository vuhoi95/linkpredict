Title: Towards the deconstruction of M-theory
Authors: Ingo Kirsch and Dan Oprisa
Abstract: We argue that there is an equivalence of M-theory on T^3 \times A_{N-1} with a four-dimensional non-supersymmetric quiver gauge theory on the Higgs branch. The quiver theory in question has gauge group SU(N)^{N_4N_6N_8} and is considered in a strong coupling and large N_{4,6,8} limit. We provide field- and string-theoretical evidence for the equivalence making use of the deconstruction technique. In particular, we find wrapped M2-branes in the mass spectrum of the quiver theory at low energies.
