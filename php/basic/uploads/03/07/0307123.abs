Abstract: Supersymmetric extensions of Hamilton-Jacobi separable Liouville mechanical systems with two degrees of freedom are defined. It is shown that supersymmetry can be implemented in this type of systems in two independent ways. The structure of the constants of motion is unveiled and the entanglement between integrability and supersymmetry is explored.
