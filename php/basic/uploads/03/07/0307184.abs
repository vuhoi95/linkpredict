Title: Tachyon Tube and Supertube
Authors: Chanju Kim and Yoonbai Kim and O-Kab Kwon and Piljin Yi
Abstract: We search for tubular solutions in unstable D3-brane. With critical electric field E=1, solutions representing supertubes, which are supersymmetric bound states of fundamental strings, D0-branes, and a cylindrical D2-brane, are found and shown to exhibit BPS-like property. We also point out that boosting such a {\it tachyon tube} solution generates string flux winding around the tube, resulting in helical electric fluxes on the D2-brane. We also discuss issues related to fundamental string, absence of magnetic monopole, and finally more tachyon tubes with noncritical electric field.
