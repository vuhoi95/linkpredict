Title: Stability and Fluctuations on Walls in N=1 Supergravity
Authors: Minoru Eto and Nobuhito Maru and Norisuke Sakai
Abstract: The recently found non-BPS multi-wall configurations in the N=1 supergravity in four dimensions is shown to have no tachyonic scalar fluctuations without additional stabilization mechanisms. Mass of radion (lightest massive fluctuation) is found to be proportional to $Lambda {\rm e}^{-\pi\Lambda R/2}$, where $\Lambda $ is the inverse width of the wall and $ R$ is the radius of compactified dimension. We obtain localized massless graviton and gravitino forming a supermultiplet with respect to the Killing spinor. The relation between the bulk energy density and the boundary energy density (cosmological constants) is an automatic consequence of the field equation and Einstein equation. In the limit of vanishing gravitational coupling, the Nambu-Goldstone modes are reproduced.
