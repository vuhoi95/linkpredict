Title: The cosmic gravitational wave background in a cyclic universe
Authors: Latham A. Boyle and Paul J. Steinhardt and Neil Turok
Abstract: Inflation predicts a primordial gravitational wave spectrum that is slightly ``red,'' i.e., nearly scale-invariant with slowly increasing power at longer wavelengths. In this paper, we compute both the amplitude and spectral form of the primordial tensor spectrum predicted by cyclic/ekpyrotic models. The spectrum is blue and exponentially suppressed compared to inflation on long wavelengths. The strongest observational constraint emerges from the requirement that the energy density in gravitational waves should not exceed around 10 per cent of the energy density at the time of nucleosynthesis.
