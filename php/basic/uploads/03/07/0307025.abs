Title: Chern-Simons vortices
Authors: C. Duval and P. A. Horvathy
Abstract: In (2+1) dimensions, the Maxwell term $-(1/4) F_{\alpha\beta}F^{\alpha\beta}$ can be replaced by the Chern-Simons three-form $(\kappa/4)\epsilon^{\alpha\beta\gamma}A_\alpha F_{\beta\gamma}$, yielding a novel type of `electromagnetism'. This has been proposed for studying the Quantum Hall Effect as well as High-Temperature Superconductivity. The gauge field can be coupled to a scalar field either relativistically or non-relativistically. In both cases, one admits finite-energy, vortex solutions.
