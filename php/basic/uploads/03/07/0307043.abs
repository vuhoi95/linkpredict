Title: Deformed Harry Dym and Hunter-Zheng Equations
Authors: J. C. Brunelli and Ashok Das and Ziemowit Popowicz
Abstract: We study the deformed Harry Dym and Hunter-Zheng equations with two arbitrary deformation parameters. These reduce to various other known models in appropriate limits. We show that both these systems are bi-Hamiltonian with the same Hamiltonian structures. They are integrable and belong to the same hierarchy corresponding to positive and negative flows. We present the Lax pair description for both the systems and construct the conserved charges of negative order from the Lax operator. For the deformed Harry Dym equation, we construct the non-standard Lax representation for two special classes of values of the deformation parameters. In general, we argue that a non-standard description will involve a pseudo-differential operator of infinite order.
