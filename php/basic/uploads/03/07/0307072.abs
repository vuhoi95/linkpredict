Title: The deformed M2-brane
Authors: P. S. Howe and S. F. Kerstan and U. Lindstrom and D. Tsimpis
Abstract: The superembedding formalism is used to study correction terms to the dynamics of the M2 brane in a flat background. This is done by deforming the standard embedding constraint. It is shown rigorously that the first such correction occurs at dimension four. Cohomological techniques are used to determine this correction explicitly. The action is derived to quadratic order in fermions, and the modified $\k$-symmetry transformations are given.
