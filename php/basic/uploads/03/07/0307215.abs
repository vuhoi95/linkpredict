Title: Monopoles, Antimonopoles and Vortex Rings
Authors: B. Kleihaus and J. Kunz and Ya. Shnir
Abstract: We present a new class of static axially symmetric solutions of SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs theory, where the Higgs field vanishes on rings centered around the symmetry axis. Associating a magnetic dipole moment with each Higgs vortex ring, the dipole moments add for solutions in the trivial topological sector, whereas they cancel for magnetically charged solutions.
