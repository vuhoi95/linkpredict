Title: Modular Matrix Models
Authors: Yang-Hui He and Vishnu Jejjala
Abstract: Inspired by a formal resemblance of certain q-expansions of modular forms and the master field formalism of matrix models in terms of Cuntz operators, we construct a Hermitian one-matrix model, which we dub the ``modular matrix model.'' Together with an N=1 gauge theory and a special Calabi-Yau geometry, we find a modular matrix model that naturally encodes the Klein elliptic j-invariant, and hence, by Moonshine, the irreducible representations of the Fischer-Griess Monster group.
