Title: Entropic N-bound and Maximal Mass Conjecture Violations in Four  Dimensional Taub-Bolt(NUT)-dS Spacetimes
Authors: R. Clarkson and A. M. Ghezelbash and R. B. Mann
Abstract: We show that the class of four-dimensional Taub-Bolt(NUT) spacetimes with positive cosmological constant for some values of NUT charges are stable and have entropies that are greater than that of de Sitter spacetime, in violation of the entropic N-bound conjecture. We also show that the maximal mass conjecture, which states "any asymptotically dS spacetime with mass greater than dS has a cosmological singularity", can be violated as well. Our calculation of conserved mass and entropy is based on an extension of the path integral formulation to asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes.
