Title: Charged configurations in (A)dS spaces
Authors: James T. Liu and W. A. Sabra
Abstract: We construct new backgrounds of d-dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant coupled to a m-form field strength. We find a class of magnetically charged anti-de Sitter black holes with m-dimensional Einstein horizon of positive, zero or negative curvature. We also construct a new magnetic co-dimension four brane for the case of m=3. This brane obeys a charge quantization condition of the form q \sim L^2 where q is the magnetic 3-form charge and L is the AdS radius. In addition, we work out some time-dependent solutions.
