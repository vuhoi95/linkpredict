Title: Geometric Engineering of N=2 CFT_{4}s based on Indefinite Singularities:  Hyperbolic Case
Authors: M. Ait Ben Haddou and A. Belhaj and E. H. Saidi
Abstract: Using Katz, Klemm and Vafa geometric engineering method of $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric QFT$_{4}$s and results on the classification of generalized Cartan matrices of Kac-Moody (KM) algebras, we study the un-explored class of $\mathcal{N}=2$ CFT$_{4}$s based on \textit{indefinite} singularities. We show that the vanishing condition for the general expression of holomorphic beta function of $\mathcal{N}=2$ quiver gauge QFT$_{4}$s coincides exactly with the fundamental classification theorem of KM algebras. Explicit solutions are derived for mirror geometries of CY threefolds with \textit{% hyperbolic} singularities.
