Title: 3-Branes and Uniqueness of the Salam-Sezgin Vacuum
Authors: G. W. Gibbons and R. Guven and C. N. Pope
Abstract: We prove the uniqueness of the supersymmetric Salam-Sezgin (Minkowski)_4\times S^2 ground state among all nonsingular solutions with a four-dimensional Poincare, de Sitter or anti-de Sitter symmetry. We construct the most general solutions with an axial symmetry in the two-dimensional internal space, and show that included amongst these is a family that is non-singular away from a conical defect at one pole of a distorted 2-sphere. These solutions admit the interpretation of 3-branes with negative tension.
