Title: A Note on effective N=1 Super Yang-Mills Theories versus Lattice Results
Authors: David G. Cerdeno and Anke Knauf and Jan Louis
Abstract: We compare the glueball mass spectrum of an effective N=1 pure super Yang-Mills theory formulated in terms of a three-form supermultiplet with the available lattice data. These confirm the presence of four scalars and two Majorana fermions but the detailed mass spectrum is difficult to reconcile with the effective supersymmetric theory. By imposing supersymmetry and using two of four bosonic masses we get a prediction for the remaining masses as well as the mixing angles. We find that the mass of the three-form dominates over the contribution of the Veneziano-Yankielowicz-Dijkgraaf-Vafa term. As a byproduct we introduce a Fayet-Iliopoulos term for the three-form multiplet and show that it generates a glueball condensate.
