Title: Hall effect in Noncommutative spaces
Authors: Akira Kokado and Takashi Okamura and Takesi Saito
Abstract: In order to investigate whether space coordinates are intrinsically noncommutative, we make use of the Hall effect on the two-dimensional plane. We calculate the Hall conductivity in such a way that the noncommutative U(1) gauge invariance is manifest. We find that the noncommutativity parameter theta does not appear in the Hall conductivity itself, but the particle number density of electron depends on theta. We point out that the peak of particle number density differs from that of the charge density.
