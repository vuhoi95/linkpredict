Title: Dark Energy and Neutrino Mass Limits from Baryogenesis
Authors: Peihong Gu and Xiulian Wang and Xinmin Zhang
Abstract: In this brief report we consider couplings of the dark energy scalar, such as Quintessence to the neutrinos and discuss its implications in studies on the neutrino mass limits from Baryogenesis. During the evolution of the dark energy scalar, the neutrino masses vary, consequently the bounds on the neutrino masses we have here differ from those obtained before.
