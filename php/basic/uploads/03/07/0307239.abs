Title: Born-Infeld-type phantom on the brane world
Authors: Dao-jun Liu and Xin-zhou Li
Abstract: We study the evolution of Born-Infeld-type phantom in the second Randall-Sundrum brane scenario, and find that there exists attractor solution for the potential with a maximum, which implies a cosmological constant at the late time. Especially, we discuss the BI model of constant potential without and with dust matter. In the weak tension limit of the brane, we obtain an exact solution for the BI phantom and scale factor and show that there is no big rip during the evolution of the brane.
