Title: Closed String Amplitudes in Open String Field Theory
Authors: Tomohiko Takahashi and Syoji Zeze
Abstract: We investigate gauge invariant operators corresponding to on-shell closed string states in open string field theory. Using both oscillator representation and conformal mapping techniques, we calculate a two closed string tachyon amplitude that connects two gauge invariant operators by an open string propagator.We find that this amplitude is in a complete agreement with the usual disc amplitude.
