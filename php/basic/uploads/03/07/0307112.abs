Title: A Hopf algebra deformation approach to renormalization
Authors: Lucian M. Ionescu and Michael Marsalli
Abstract: We investigate the relation between Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra approach to renomalization and deformation quantization. Both approaches rely on factorization, the correspondence being established at the level of Wiener-Hopf algebras, and double Lie algebras/Lie bialgebras, via r-matrices. It is suggested that the QFTs obtained via deformation quantization and renormalization correspond to each other in the sense of Kontsevich/Cattaneo-Felder.
