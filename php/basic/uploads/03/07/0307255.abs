Title: SU(5) Unified Theories from Intersecting Branes
Authors: Minos Axenides and Emmanuel Floratos and Christos Kokorelis
Abstract: We discuss the first string theory examples of three generation non-supersymmetric SU(5) and {\em flipped} SU(5) GUTS, which break to the Standard model at low energy, without extra matter and/or gauge group factors. Our GUT examples are based on IIA $Z_3$ orientifolds with D6-branes intersecting at non-trivial angles. These theories necessarily satisfy RR tadpoles and are free of NSNS tadpoles as the complex structure moduli are frozen (even though a dilaton tadpole remains) to discrete values. We identify appropriately the bifundamental Higgses responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking. In this way, the neutrino see-saw mechanism get nicely realized in these constructions. Moreover, as baryon number is not a gauged symmetry gauge mediated dimension six operators do contribute to proton decay; however proton lifetime may be safely enhanced by appropriately choosing a high GUT scale. An accompanying natural doublet-triplet splitting guarantees the suppression of scalar mediated proton decay modes and the stability of triplet scalar masses against higher dimensional non-renormalizable operators.
