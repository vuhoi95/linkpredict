Title: Invariant length scale in relativistic kinematics - Lessons from  Dirichlet branes
Authors: Frederic P Schuller and Hendryk Pfeiffer
Abstract: We show that Dirac-Born-Infeld theory possesses a hidden invariance that enhances the local O(1,p) Lorentz symmetry on a Dirichlet p-brane to an O(1,p) x O(1,p) gauge group, encoding both an invariant velocity and acceleration (or length) scale. This enlarged gauge group predicts consequences for the kinematics of observers on Dirichlet branes, with admissible accelerations being bounded from above. An important lesson beyond string theory is that a fundamental length scale can be implemented into the kinematics of general relativity, whilst preserving both space-time as a smooth manifold and local Lorentz symmetry, contrary to common belief. We point out consequences for string phenomenology, classical gravity and atomic physics.
