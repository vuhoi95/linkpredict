Title: Phantom cosmologies
Authors: Mariusz P. Dabrowski and Tomasz Stachowiak and Marek Szydlowski
Abstract: We discuss a class of phantom ($p < - \varrho$) cosmological models. Except for phantom we admit various forms of standard types of matter and discuss the problem of singularities for these cosmologies. The singularities are different from those of standard matter cosmology since they appear for infinite values of the scale factor. We also find an interesting relation between the phantom models and standard matter models which is like the duality symmetry of string cosmology.
