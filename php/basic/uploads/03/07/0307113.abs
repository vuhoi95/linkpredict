Title: On the Classical String Solutions and String/Field Theory Duality
Authors: D. Aleksandrova and P. Bozhilov
Abstract: We classify almost all classical string configurations, considered in the framework of the semi-classical limit of the string/gauge theory duality. Then, we describe a procedure for obtaining the conserved quantities and the exact classical string solutions in general string theory backgrounds, when the string embedding coordinates depend non-linearly on the worldsheet time parameter.
