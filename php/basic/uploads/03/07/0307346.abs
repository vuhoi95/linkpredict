Abstract: By combining the recent WMAP measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies and the results of the recent luminosity distance measurements to type-Ia supernovae, we find that the normalization of the matter power spectrum on cluster scales, sigma_8, can be used to discriminate between dynamical models of dark energy (quintessence models) and a conventional cosmological constant model (LCDM).
