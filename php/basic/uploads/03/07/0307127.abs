Title: The holonomy of IIB supercovariant connection
Authors: G. Papadopoulos and D. Tsimpis
Abstract: We show that the holonomy of the supercovariant connection of IIB supergravity is contained in $SL(32, \bR)$. We also find that the holonomy reduces to a subgroup of $SL(32-N)\st (\oplus^N \bR^{32-N})$ for IIB supergravity backgrounds with $N$ Killing spinors. We give the necessary and sufficient conditions for a IIB background to admit $N$ Killing spinors. A IIB supersymmetric probe configuration can involve up to 31 linearly independent planar branes and preserves one supersymmetry.
