Title: Probing the Holography of Near-Horizon AdS(5)xS(5) Geometry
Authors: E. Papantonopoulos and V. Zamarias
Abstract: Using the AdS/CFT correspondence we study the holographic principle and the CFT/FRW relations in the near-horizon AdS(5)xS(5) geometry with a probe D3-brane playing the role of the boundary to this space. The motion of the probe D3-brane in the bulk, induces a cosmological evolution on the brane. As the brane crosses the horizon of the bulk black hole, it probes the holography of the dual CFT. We test the holographic principle and we find corrections to CFT/FRW relations in various physical cases: for radially moving, spinning and electrically charged D3-brane and for a NS/NS B-field in the bulk.
