Title: Can string bits be supersymmetric?
Authors: Stefano Bellucci and Corneliu Sochichiu
Abstract: We search for the possibility to have supersymmetric string bits at finite discretization $J$. From a general setup we find that the string bits can be made supersymmetric modulo a single defect mode which is not expected to have any sensible effect in the continuum limit.
