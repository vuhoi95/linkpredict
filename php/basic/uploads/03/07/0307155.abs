Title: Planar and Nonplanar Konishi Anomalies and Effective Superpotential for  Noncommutative N=1 Supersymmetric U(1)
Authors: Farhad Ardalan and Neda Sadooghi
Abstract: The Konishi anomalies for noncommutative N=1 supersymmetric U(1) gauge theory arising from planar and nonplanar diagrams are calculated. Whereas planar Konishi anomaly is the expected \star-deformation of the commutative anomaly, nonplanar anomaly reflects the important features of nonplanar diagrams of noncommutative gauge theories, such as UV/IR mixing and the appearance of nonlocal open Wilson lines. We use the planar and nonplanar Konishi anomalies to calculate the effective superpotential of the theory. In the limit of vanishing |\Theta p|, with \Theta the noncommutativity parameter, the noncommutative effective superpotential depends on a gauge invariant superfield, which includes supersymmetric Wilson lines, and has nontrivial dependence on the gauge field supermultiplet.
