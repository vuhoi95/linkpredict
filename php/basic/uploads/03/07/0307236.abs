Title: Note on a fermionic solution of the matrix model and noncommutative  superspace
Authors: Yuuichirou Shibusa and Tsukasa Tada
Abstract: We present a new fermionic solution of the supersymmetric matrix model. The solution satisfies the commutation and anticommutation relations for noncommutative superspace. Therefore the solution can be considered as an implementation of noncommutative superspace on the matrix model.
