Abstract: We describe the generalized kappa-deformations of D=4 relativistic symmetries with finite masslike deformation parameter kappa and an arbitrary direction in kappa-deformed Minkowski space being noncommutative. The corresponding bicovariant differential calculi on kappa-deformed Minkowski spaces are considered. Two distinguished cases are discussed: 5D noncommutative differential calculus (kappa-deformation in time-like or space-like direction), and 4D noncommutative differential calculus having the classical dimension (noncommutative kappa-deformation in light-like direction). We introduce also left and right vector fields acting on functions of noncommutative Minkowski coordinates, and describe the noncommutative differential realizations of kappa-deformed Poincare algebra. The kappa-deformed Klein-Gordon field on noncommutative Minkowski space with noncommutative time (standard kappa-deformation) as well as noncommutative null line (light-like kappa-deformation) are discussed. Following our earlier proposal (see {1,2]) we introduce an equivalent framework replacing the local noncommutative field theory by the nonlocal commutative description with suitable nonlocal star product multiplication rules. The modification of Pauli--Jordan commutator function is described and the kappa-dependence of its light-cone behaviour in coordinate space is explicitly given. The problem with the kappa-deformed energy- momentum conservation law is recalled.
