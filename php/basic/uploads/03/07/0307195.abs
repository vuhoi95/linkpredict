Abstract: We consider two dimensional supergravity coupled to $\hat c=1$ matter. This system can also be interpreted as noncritical type 0 string theory in a two dimensional target space. After reviewing and extending the traditional descriptions of this class of theories, we provide a matrix model description. The 0B theory is similar to the realization of two dimensional bosonic string theory via matrix quantum mechanics in an inverted harmonic oscillator potential; the difference is that we expand around a non-perturbatively stable vacuum, where the matrix eigenvalues are equally distributed on both sides of the potential. The 0A theory is described by a quiver matrix model.
