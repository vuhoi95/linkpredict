Title: Two-loop world-sheet effective action
Authors: A. R. Fazio and G. K. Savvidy
Abstract: We are studying quantum corrections in the earlier proposed string theory based on world-sheet action which measures the linear sizes of the surfaces. At classical level the string tension is equal to zero and as it was demonstrated in the previous studies one loop correction to the classical world-sheet action generates Nambu-Goto area term, that is nonzero string tension. We extend this analysis computing the world-sheet effective action in the second order of the loop expansion.
