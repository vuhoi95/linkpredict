Title: Fluxes, supersymmetry breaking and gauged supergravity
Authors: Laura Andrianopoli and Sergio Ferrara and Mario Trigiante
Abstract: We report on the gauged supergravity interpretation of certain compactifications of superstring theories with p-form fluxes turned on. We discuss in particular the interplay of duality symmetries in type IIB orientifolds and gauged isometries in the corresponding supergravity models. Turning on fluxes is generally described by the gauging of some nilpotent Lie group whose generators correspond to axion symmetries of R-R and N-S scalars.
