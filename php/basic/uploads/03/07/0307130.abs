Title: On the Chiral Ring of N=1 Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
Authors: Marco Matone and Luca Mazzucato
Abstract: We consider the chiral ring of the pure N=1 supersymmetric gauge theory with SU(N) gauge group and show that the classical relation S^{N^2}=0 is modified to the exact quantum relation (S^N-\Lambda^{3N})^N=0.
