Title: Running coupling constants of the Luttinger liquid
Authors: D. Boose and J. L. Jacquot and J. Polonyi
Abstract: Two running coupling constants of the Luttinger liquid are computed in the fermion-fermion and fermion-antifermion channels. Nontrivial scaling laws are found together with Landau poles. The apparent contradiction with the expected vanishing of the beta functions is explained.
