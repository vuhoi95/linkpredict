Title: Improved Renormalization Group analysis for Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Shoichi Kawamoto and Toshihiro Matsuo
Abstract: We apply an improved renormalization group analysis for pure Yang-Mills theory at one loop order and obtained the result that a non-perturbatively generated pole mass of gluon emerges as $M_P^2/\Lambda^2 \simeq 0.66$, where $\Lambda$ is the $MS$-bar scale.
