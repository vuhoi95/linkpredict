Title: Brane World of Warp Geometry: An Introductory Review
Authors: Yoonbai Kim and Chong Oh Lee and Ilbong Lee and JungJai Lee
Abstract: Basic idea of Randall-Sundrum brane world model I and II is reviewed with detailed calculation. After introducing the brane world metric with exponential warp factor, metrics of Randall-Sundrum models are constructed. We explain how Randall-Sundrum model I with two branes makes the gauge hierarchy problem much milder, and then derive Newtonian gravity in Randall-Sundrum model II with a single brane by considering small fluctuations.
