Title: Intersecting branes and adding flavors to the Maldacena-Nunez background
Authors: Xiao-Jun Wang and Sen Hu
Abstract: We study adding flavors into the Maldacena-N\u{u}nez background. It is achieved by introducing spacetime filling D9-branes or intersecting D5$'$-branes into the background with a wrapping D5-brane. Both D9-branes and D5$'$-branes can be spacetime filling from the 5D bulk point of view. At the probe limit it corresponds to introducing non-chiral fundamental flavors into the dual N=1 SYM. We propose a method to twist the fundamental flavor which has to involve open string charge. It reflects the fact that coupling fundamental matter to SYM in the dual string theory corresponds to adding an open string sector
