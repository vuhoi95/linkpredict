Title: Charged Domain Walls
Authors: L. Campanelli and P. Cea and G. L. Fogli and L. Tedesco
Abstract: In this paper we investigate Charged Domain Walls (CDW's), topological defects that acquire surface charge density $Q$ induced by fermion states localized on the walls. The presence of an electric and magnetic field on the walls is also discussed. We find a relation in which the value of the surface charge density $Q$ is connected with the existence of such topological defects.
