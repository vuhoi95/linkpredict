Title: String bit models of two-dimensional quantum gravity coupled with matter
Authors: C. -W. H. Lee and R. B. Mann
Abstract: We extend the formalism of Hamiltonian string bit models of quantum gravity type in two spacetime dimensions to include couplings to particles. We find that the single-particle closed and open universe models respectively behave like empty open and closed universes, and that a system of two distinguishable particles in a closed universe behaves like an empty closed universe. We then construct a metamodel that contains all such models, and find that its transition amplitude is exactly the same as the sl(2) gravity model.
