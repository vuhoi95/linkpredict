Title: Two Loop Effective Kaehler Potential
Authors: Tino S. Nyawelo and Stefan Groot Nibbelink
Abstract: In this talk we study the renormalization of the effective Kaehler potential at one and two loops for general four dimensional (non--renormalizable) N=1 supersymmetric theories described by arbitrary Kaehler potential, superpotential and gauge kinetic function. We consider the Wess-Zumino model as an example.
