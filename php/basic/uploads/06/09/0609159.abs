Title: The Story of \cal O: Positivity constraints in effective field theories
Authors: Alejandro Jenkins and Donal O'Connell
Abstract: We propose a simple method for identifying operators in effective field theories whose coefficients must be positive by causality. We also attempt to clarify the relationship between diverse positivity arguments that have appeared in the literature. We conjecture that the superluminal perturbations identified in non-positive effective theories are generally connected to instabilities that develop near the cutoff scale. We discuss implications for the ghost condensate, the chiral Lagrangian, and the Goldstone bosons of theories with spontaneous Lorentz violation.
