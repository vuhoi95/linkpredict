Title: Dyon Spectrum in Generic N=4 Supersymmetric Z_N Orbifolds
Authors: Justin R. David and Dileep P. Jatkar and Ashoke Sen
Abstract: We find the exact spectrum of a class of quarter BPS dyons in a generic N=4 supersymmetric Z_N orbifold of type IIA string theory on K3\times T^2 or T^6. We also find the asymptotic expansion of the statistical entropy to first non-leading order in inverse power of charges and show that it agrees with the entropy of a black hole carrying same set of charges after taking into account the effect of the four derivative Gauss-Bonnet term in the effective action of the theory.
