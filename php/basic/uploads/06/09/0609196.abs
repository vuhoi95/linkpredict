Title: Collective quantization of axially symmetric gravitating B=2 skyrmion
Authors: Hisayuki Sato and Nobuyuki Sawado and Noriko Shiiki
Abstract: In this paper we perform collective quantization of an axially symmetric skyrmion with baryon number two.The rotational and isorotational modes are quantized to obtain the static properties of a deuteron and other dibaryonic objects such as masses, charge densities, magnetic moments. We discuss how the gravity affects to those observables.
