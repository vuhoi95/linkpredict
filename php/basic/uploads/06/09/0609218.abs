Title: On Quantization of Time-Dependent Systems with Constraints
Authors: S. A. Gadjiev and R. G. Jafarov
Abstract: The Dirac method of canonical quantization of theories with second class constraints has to be modified if the constraints depend on time explicitly. A solution of the problem was given by Gitman and Tyutin. In the present work we propose an independent way to derive the rules of quantization for these systems, starting from physical equivalent theory with trivial non-stationarity.
