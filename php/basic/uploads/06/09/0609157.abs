Abstract: We analyze the psu(2,2|4) supersymmetry algebra of a superstring propagating in the AdS_5 x S^5 background in the uniform light-cone gauge. We consider the off-shell theory by relaxing the level-matching condition and take the limit of infinite light-cone momentum, which decompactifies the string world-sheet. We focus on the psu(2|2)+psu(2|2) subalgebra which leaves the light-cone Hamiltonian invariant and show that it undergoes extension by a central element which is expressed in terms of the level-matching operator. This result is in agreement with the conjectured symmetry algebra of the dynamic S-matrix in the dual N=4 gauge theory.
