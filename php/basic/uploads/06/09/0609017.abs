Title: Topology, chiral and screening transitions at finite density in two  colour QCD
Authors: B. Alles and M. D'Elia and M. P. Lombardo
Abstract: The behaviour of the topological susceptibility in QCD with two colours and 8 flavours of quarks is studied at nonzero temperature on the lattice across the finite density transition. It is shown that its signal drops at a (pseudo-)critical chemical potential mu_c. The Polyakov loop and the chiral condensate undergo their transitions at the same value. Pauli blocking supervenes at a value of the chemical potential larger than mu_c.
