Title: Comment on the choice of time in a two-component formulation of the  Wheeler--DeWitt equation
Authors: Marc Thibeault and Claudio Simeone
Abstract: The two-component formalism in quantum cosmology is revisited with a particular emphasis on the identification of time. Its relation with the appearance of imaginary eigenvalues is established. It is explicitly shown how a good choice of the global time prevents this peculiarity.
