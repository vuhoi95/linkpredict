Abstract: We argue that screening of higher-representation color charges by gluons implies a domain structure in the vacuum state of non-abelian gauge theories, with the color magnetic flux in each domain quantized in units corresponding to the gauge group center. Casimir scaling of string tensions at intermediate distances results from random spatial variations in the color magnetic flux within each domain. The exceptional G(2) gauge group is an example rather than an exception to this picture, although for G(2) there is only one type of vacuum domain, corresponding to the single element of the gauge group center. We present some numerical results for G(2) intermediate string tensions and Polyakov lines, as well as results for certain gauge-dependent projected quantities. In this context, we discuss critically the idea of projecting link variables to a subgroup of the gauge group. It is argued that such projections are useful only when the representation-dependence of the string tension, at some distance scale, is given by the representation of the subgroup.
