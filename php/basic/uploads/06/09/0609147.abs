Title: De Sitter Quantum Mechanics and Inflationary Matrix Cosmology of  Self-tuned Universe
Authors: Satabhisa Dasgupta and Tathagata Dasgupta
Abstract: We observe that the large $N$ world sheet RG in $c=1$ matrix model, formulated in hep-th/0310106, hep-th/0311177, with $N^2$ quantum mechanical degrees of freedom at small compactification radius is capable of capturing dimensional mutation. This manifests in deforming the familiar $AdS_2$ quantum mechanics in the minisuperspace Wheeler-de Witt (WdW) cosmology of the 2D quantum gravity, obtained by the large $N$ RG with $N$ quantum mechanical degrees of freedom only, to a modified WdW cosmology describing tunneling to an inflationary de Sitter vacuum and its evolution. The scale fluctuation plays an important role in providing an ansatz for uniquely choosing the initial wave function. We observe that the nonperturbative effects due to the $N^2$ quantum mechanical degrees of freedom introduce explicit open string moduli dependence in the wave function via the Hubble scale, which determines the geometry of the true vacuum one tunnels to. The modified WdW equation also captures controlled formation of baby universes of vanishing size that self-tunes the de Sitter cosmological constant to be small positive.
