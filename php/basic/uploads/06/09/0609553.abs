Title: On 1+1 Dimensional Galilean Supersymmetry in Ultracold Quantum Gases
Authors: G. S. Lozano and O. Piguet and F. A. Schaposnik and L. Sourrouille
Abstract: We discuss a 1+1 dimensional Galilean invariant model recently introduced in connection with ultracold quantum gases. After showing its relation to a nonrelativistic 2+1 Chern-Simons matter system, we identify the generators of the supersymmetry and its relation with the existence of self-dual equations
