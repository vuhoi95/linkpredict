Title: The one-loop renormalization of the gauge sector in the noncommutative  standard model
Authors: Maja Buric and Voja Radovanovic and Josip Trampetic
Abstract: In this paper we construct a version of the standard model gauge sector on noncommutative space-time which is one-loop renormalizable to first order in the expansion in the noncommutativity parameter $\theta$. The one-loop renormalizability is obtained by the Seiberg-Witten redefinition of the noncommutative gauge potential for the model containing the usual six representations of matter fields of the first generation.
