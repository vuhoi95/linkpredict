Title: Integrable Models From Twisted Half Loop Algebras
Authors: Nicolas Crampe and Charles A. S. Young
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the construction of new integrable quantum mechanical models based on certain subalgebras of the half loop algebra of gl(N). Various results about these subalgebras are proven by presenting them in the notation of the St Petersburg school. These results are then used to demonstrate the integrability, and find the symmetries, of two types of physical system: twisted Gaudin magnets, and Calogero-type models of particles on several half-lines meeting at a point.
