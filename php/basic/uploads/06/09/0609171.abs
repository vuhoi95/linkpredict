Title: The role of higher derivative bulk scalar in stabilizing a warped  spacetime
Authors: Debaprasad Maity and Soumitra SenGupta and Sourav Sur
Abstract: The backreaction on the Randall-Sundrum warped spacetime is determined in presence of scalar field in the bulk. A general analysis shows that the stability of such a model can be achieved only if the scalar field action has non-canonical higher derivative terms. It is further shown that the gauge hierarchy problem can be resolved in such a stabilized scenario by appropriate choice of various parameters of the theory. The effective cosmological constant on the brane is shown to vanish.
