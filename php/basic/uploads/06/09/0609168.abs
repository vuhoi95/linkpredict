Title: Non-Commutative (Softly Broken) Supersymmetric Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons
Authors: Nicola Caporaso and Sara Pasquetti
Abstract: We study d=2+1 non-commutative U(1) YMCS, concentrating on the one-loop corrections to the propagator and to the dispersion relations. Unlike its commutative counterpart, this model presents divergences and hence an IR/UV mechanism, which we regularize by adding a Majorana gaugino of mass m_f, that provides (softly broken) supersymmetry. The perturbative vacuum becomes stable for a wide range of coupling and mass values, and tachyonic modes are generated only in two regions of the parameters space. One such region corresponds to removing the supersymmetric regulator (m_f >> m_g), restoring the well-known IR/UV mixing phenomenon. The other one (for m_f ~ m_g/2 and large \theta) is novel and peculiar of this model. The two tachyonic regions turn out to be very different in nature. We conclude with some remarks on the theory's off-shell unitarity.
