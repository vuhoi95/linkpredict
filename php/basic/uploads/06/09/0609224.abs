Title: A T-duality interpretation of the relationship between massive and  massless magnonic TBA systems
Authors: Patrick Dorey and J. Luis Miramontes
Abstract: We propose an alternative understanding of the relationship between massive and massless magnonic TBA systems, using the T-duality symmetries of the Homogeneous sine-Gordon models. This is shown to be in agreement with a previous treatment by Dorey, Dunning and Tateo, based on the properties of Y-systems.
