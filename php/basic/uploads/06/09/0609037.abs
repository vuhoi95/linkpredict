Title: Semi-classical States in Homogeneous Loop Quantum Cosmology
Authors: Huahai Tan and Yongge Ma
Abstract: Semi-classical states in homogeneous loop quantum cosmology (LQC) are constructed by two different ways. In the first approach, we firstly construct an exponentiated annihilation operator. Then a kind of semi-classical (coherent) state is obtained by solving the eigen-equation of that operator. Moreover, we use these coherent states to analyze the semi-classical limit of the quantum dynamics. It turns out that the Hamiltonian constraint operator employed currently in homogeneous LQC has correct classical limit with respect to the coherent states. In the second approach, the other kind of semi-classical state is derived from the mathematical construction of coherent states for compact Lie groups due to Hall.
