Title: A class of Calogero type reductions of free motion on a simple Lie group
Authors: L. Feher and B. G. Pusztai
Abstract: The reductions of the free geodesic motion on a non-compact simple Lie group G based on the $G_+ \times G_+$ symmetry given by left- and right multiplications for a maximal compact subgroup $G_+ \subset G$ are investigated. At generic values of the momentum map this leads to (new) spin Calogero type models. At some special values the `spin' degrees of freedom are absent and we obtain the standard $BC_n$ Sutherland model with three independent coupling constants from SU(n+1,n) and from SU(n,n). This generalization of the Olshanetsky-Perelomov derivation of the $BC_n$ model with two independent coupling constants from the geodesics on $G/G_+$ with G=SU(n+1,n) relies on fixing the right-handed momentum to a non-zero character of $G_+$. The reductions considered permit further generalizations and work at the quantized level, too, for non-compact as well as for compact G.
