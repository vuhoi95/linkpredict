Title: On the velocity and chemical-potential dependence of the heavy-quark  interaction in N=4 SYM plasmas
Authors: Spyros D. Avramis and Konstadinos Sfetsos and Dimitrios Zoakos
Abstract: We consider the interaction of a heavy quark-antiquark pair moving in N=4 SYM plasma in the presence of non-vanishing chemical potentials. Of particular importance is the maximal length beyond which the interaction is practically turned off. We propose a simple phenomenological law that takes into account the velocity dependence of this screening length beyond the leading order and in addition its dependence on the R-charge. Our proposal is based on studies using rotating D3-branes.
