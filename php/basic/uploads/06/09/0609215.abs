Title: The Dual of the Carroll-Field-Jackiw Model
Authors: M. S. Guimar√£es and L. Grigorio and C. Wotzasek
Abstract: In this work we apply different duality techniques, both the dual projection, based on the soldering formalism and the master action, in order to obtain and study the dual description of the Carroll-Field-Jackiw model \cite{cfj}, a theory with a Chern-Simons-like explicitly Lorentz and CPT violating term, including the interaction with external charges. This Maxwell-Chern-Simons-like model may be rewritten in terms of the interacting modes of a massless scalar model and a topologically massive model \cite{mcs}, that are mapped, through duality, into interacting massless Maxwell and massive self-dual modes \cite{sd}. It is also shown that these dual modes might be represented into an unified rank-two self-dual model that represents the direct dual of the vector Maxwell-Chern-Simons-like model.
