Abstract: This paper deals with black holes, bubbles and orbifolds in Gauss-Bonnet theory in five dimensional anti de Sitter space. In particular, we study stable, unstable and metastable phases of black holes from thermodynamical perspective. By comparing bubble and orbifold geometries, we analyse associated instabilities. Assuming AdS/CFT correspondence, we discuss the effects of this higher derivative bulk coupling on a specific matrix model near the critical points of the boundary gauge theory at finite temperature. Finally, we propose another phenomenological model on the boundary which mimics various phases of the bulk space-time.
