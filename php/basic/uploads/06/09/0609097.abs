Title: Quantization of Black Holes in the Shielded Strong Gravity Scenario (I.  Neutral Scalar States)
Authors: D. G. Coyne and D. C. Cheng
Abstract: A previously used quantization mechanism is applied to the continuous states of the shielded strong gravity scenario (hep-th/0602183), yielding two types of spectra for uncharged black hole scalars. Each yields the general morphology for states expected in this scenario at LHC and at arbitrarily higher energies, once the parameters are determined by the two lowest-lying scalar states. A particularized example for the preferred type of quantization is numerically evaluated.
