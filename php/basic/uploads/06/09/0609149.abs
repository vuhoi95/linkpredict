Title: Proof of all-order finiteness for planar beta-deformed Yang-Mills
Authors: Sudarshan Ananth and Stefano Kovacs and Hidehiko Shimada
Abstract: We study a marginal deformation of N=4 Yang-Mills, with a real deformation parameter beta. This beta-deformed model has only N=1 supersymmetry and a U(1)xU(1) flavor symmetry. The introduction of a new superspace star-product allows us to formulate the theory in N=4 light-cone superspace, despite the fact that it has only N=1 supersymmetry. We show that this deformed theory is conformally invariant, in the planar approximation, by proving that its Green functions are ultra-violet finite to all orders in perturbation theory.
