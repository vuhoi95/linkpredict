Title: Entanglement and Nonunitary Evolution
Authors: Ram Brustein and Martin B. Einhorn and Amos Yarom
Abstract: We consider a collapsing relativistic spherical shell for a free quantum field. Once the center of the wavefunction of the shell passes a certain radius R, the degrees of freedom inside R are traced over. We show that an observer outside this region will determine that the evolution of the system is nonunitary. We argue that this phenomenon is generic to entangled systems, and discuss a possible relation to black hole physics.
