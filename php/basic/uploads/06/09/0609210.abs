Title: A supersymmetric matrix model: III. Hidden SUSY in statistical systems
Authors: G. Veneziano and J. Wosiek
Abstract: The Hamiltonian of a recently proposed supersymmetric matrix model has been shown to become block-diagonal in the large-N, infinite 't Hooft coupling limit. We show that (most of) these blocks can be mapped into seemingly non-supersymmetric $(1+1)$-dimensional statistical systems, thus implying non-trivial (and apparently yet-unknown) relations within their spectra. Furthermore, the ground states of XXZ-chains with an odd number of sites and asymmetry parameter $\Delta = - 1/2$, objects of the much-discussed Razumov--Stroganov conjectures, turn out to be just the strong-coupling supersymmetric vacua of our matrix model.
