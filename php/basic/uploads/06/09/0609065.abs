Title: Closed-form weak-field expansion of two-loop Euler-Heisenberg  Lagrangians
Authors: G. V. Dunne and A. Huet and D. Rivera and C. Schubert
Abstract: We obtain closed-form expressions, in terms of the Faulhaber numbers, for the weak-field expansion coefficients of the two-loop Euler-Heisenberg effective Lagrangians in a magnetic or electric field. This follows from the observation that the magnetic worldline Green's function has a natural expansion in terms of the Faulhaber numbers.
