Title: The Minkowski and conformal superspaces
Authors: R. Fioresi and M. A. Lledo and V. S. Varadarajan
Abstract: We define complex Minkowski superspace in 4 dimensions as the big cell inside a complex flag supermanifold. The complex conformal supergroup acts naturally on this super flag, allowing us to interpret it as the conformal compactification of complex Minkowski superspace. We then consider real Minkowski superspace as a suitable real form of the complex version. Our methods are group theoretic, based on the real conformal supergroup and its Lie superalgebra.
