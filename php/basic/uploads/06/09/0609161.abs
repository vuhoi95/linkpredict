Title: One-loop Conformal Invariance of the Type II Pure Spinor Superstring in  a Curved Background
Authors: Oscar A. Bedoya and Osvaldo Chandia
Abstract: We compute the one-loop beta function for the Type II superstring using the pure spinor formalism in a generic supergravity background. It is known that the classical pure spinor BRST symmetry puts the background fields on-shell. In this paper we show that the one-loop beta functions vanish as a consequence of the classical BRST symmetry of the action.
