Title: LXCDM cosmologies: solving the cosmological coincidence problem?
Authors: Javier Grande and Joan Sola and Hrvoje Stefancic
Abstract: We explore the possibility of having a composite (self-conserved) dark energy (DE) whose dynamics is controlled by the quantum running of the cosmological parameters. We find that within this scenario it is feasible to find an explanation for the cosmological coincidence problem and at the same time a good qualitative description of the present data.
