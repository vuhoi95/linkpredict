Title: A non-linear Schrodinger type formulation of FLRW scalar field cosmology
Authors: Jennie D'Ambroise and Floyd L. Williams
Abstract: We show that the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker equations with scalar field and perfect fluid matter source are equivalent to a suitable non-linear Schrodinger type equation. This provides for an alternate method of obtaining exact solutions of the Einstein field equations for a homogeneous, isotropic universe.
