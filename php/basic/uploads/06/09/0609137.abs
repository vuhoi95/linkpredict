Title: Stability of strings binding heavy-quark mesons
Authors: Joshua J. Friess and Steven S. Gubser and Georgios Michalogiorgakis and Silviu S. Pufu
Abstract: We investigate the stability against small deformations of strings dangling into AdS_5-Schwarzschild from a moving heavy quark-anti-quark pair. We speculate that emission of massive string states may be an important part of the evolution of certain unstable configurations.
