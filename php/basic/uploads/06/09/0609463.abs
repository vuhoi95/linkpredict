Title: Cosmological neutrino mass limit and the dynamics of dark energy
Authors: Jun-Qing Xia and Gong-Bo Zhao and Xinmin Zhang
Abstract: We investigate the correlation between the neutrino mass limit and dark energy with time evolving equation of state. Parameterizing dark energy as w=w_0+w_1*z/(1+z), we make a global fit using Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique to determine w_0, w_1, neutrino mass as well as other cosmological parameters simultaneously. We pay particular attention to the correlation between neutrino mass \Sigma m_{\nu} and w_1 using current cosmological observations as well as the future simulated datasets such as PLANCK, SNAP and LAMOST.
