Title: Brane Cosmology in an Arbitrary Number of Dimensions
Authors: N. Chatillon and C. Macesanu and M. Trodden
Abstract: We derive the effective cosmological equations for a non-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetric codimension one brane embedded in an arbitrary D-dimensional bulk spacetime, generalizing the $D=5,6$ cases much studied previously. As a particular case, this may be considered as a regularized codimension (D-4) brane avoiding the problem of curvature divergence on the brane. We apply our results to the case of spherical symmetry around the brane and to partly compactified AdS-Schwarzschild bulks.
