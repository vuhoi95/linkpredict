Title: Para-Grassmann Variables and Coherent States
Authors: Daniel C. Cabra and Enrique F. Moreno and Adrian Tanasa
Abstract: The definitions of para-Grassmann variables and q-oscillator algebras are recalled. Some new properties are given. We then introduce appropriate coherent states as well as their dual states. This allows us to obtain a formula for the trace of a operator expressed as a function of the creation and annihilation operators.
