Title: Hidden symmetry of hyperbolic monopole motion
Authors: G. W. Gibbons and C. M. Warnick
Abstract: Hyperbolic monopole motion is studied for well separated monopoles. It is shown that the motion of a hyperbolic monopole in the presence of one or more fixed monopoles is equivalent to geodesic motion on a particular submanifold of the full moduli space. The metric on this submanifold is found to be a generalisation of the multi-centre Taub-NUT metric introduced by LeBrun. The one centre case is analysed in detail as a special case of a class of systems admitting a conserved Runge-Lenz vector. The two centre problem is also considered. An integrable classical string motion is exhibited.
