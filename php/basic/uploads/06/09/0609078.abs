Title: Ultrahyperfunctional Approach to Non-Commutative Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Daniel H. T. Franco and José A. Lourenço and Luiz H. Renoldi
Abstract: In the present paper, we intent to enlarge the axiomatic framework of non-commutative quantum field theories (QFT). We consider QFT on non-commutative spacetimes in terms of the tempered ultrahyperfunctions of Sebasti\~ao e Silva corresponding to a convex cone, within the framework formulated by Wightman. Tempered ultrahyperfunctions are representable by means of holomorphic functions. As is well known there are certain advantages to be gained from the representation of distributions in terms of holomorphic functions. In particular, for non-commutative theories the Wightman functions involving the $\star$-product, ${\mathfrak W}^\star_m$, have the same form as the standard form ${\mathfrak W}_m$. We conjecture that the functions ${\mathfrak W}^\star_m$ satisfy a set of properties which actually will characterize a non-commutative QFT in terms of tempered ultrahyperfunctions. In order to support this conjecture, we prove for this setting the validity of some important theorems, of which the CPT theorem and the theorem on the Spin-Statistics connection are the best known. We assume the validity of these theorems for non-commutative QFT in the case of spatial non-commutativity only.
