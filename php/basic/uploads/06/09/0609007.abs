Title: Holography of Wilson-Loop Expectation Values with Local Operator  Insertions
Authors: Akitsugu Miwa and Tamiaki Yoneya
Abstract: We study the expectation values of Wilson-loop operators with the insertionsof local operators Z^J and Zbar^J with large R-charge J from the bulk viewpoint of AdS/CFT correspondence. Classical solutions of strings attached to such deformed Wilson loops at the conformal boundary are constructed and are applied to the computation of Wilson-loop expectation values. We argue that in order to have such solutions for general insertions at finite positions in the base spacetime of the gauge theory, it is crucial to interpret the holographic correspondence in the semi-classical picture as a tunneling phenomenon, as has been previously established for holographic computations of correlators of BMN operators. This also requires to use the Euclideanized AdS background and Euclidean super Yang-Mills theory.
