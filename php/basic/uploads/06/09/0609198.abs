Title: A Noncommutative Version of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
Authors: Masato Arai and Sami Saxell and Anca Tureanu
Abstract: A minimal supersymmetric standard model on noncommutative space-time (NC MSSM) is proposed. The model fulfils the requirements of noncommutative gauge invariance and absence of anomaly. The existence of supersymmetry with a scale of its breaking lower than the noncommutative scale is crucial in order to achieve a consistent gauge symmetry breaking.
