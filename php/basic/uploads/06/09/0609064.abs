Title: From modular invariants to graphs: the modular splitting method
Authors: E. Isasi and Gil Schieber
Abstract: We start with a given modular invariant M of a two dimensional su(n)_k conformal field theory (CFT) and present a general method for solving the Ocneanu modular splitting equation and then determine, in a step-by-step explicit construction, 1) the generalized partition functions corresponding to the introduction of boundary conditions and defect lines; 2) the quantum symmetries of the higher ADE graph G associated to the initial modular invariant M. Notice that one does not suppose here that the graph G is already known, since it appears as a by-product of the calculations. We analyze several su(3)_k exceptional cases at levels 5 and 9.
