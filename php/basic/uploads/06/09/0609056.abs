Title: On Malliavin measures, SLE and CFT
Authors: Maxim Kontsevich and Yuri Suhov
Abstract: We describe relations between SLE processes, certain replacements of the Haar measure on the Virasoro group (which we call Malliavin measures), and domain walls in small massive perturbations of a CFT (like in Ising model).
