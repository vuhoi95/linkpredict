Title: Cosmology and Fermion Confinement in a Scalar-Field-Generated Domain  Wall Brane in Five Dimensions
Authors: Tracy R. Slatyer and Raymond R. Volkas
Abstract: We consider a brane generated by a scalar field domain wall configuration in 4+1 dimensions, interpolating, in most cases, between two vacua of the field. We study the cosmology of such a system in the cases where the effective four-dimensional brane metric is de Sitter or anti de Sitter, including a discussion of the bulk coordinate singularities present in the de-Sitter case. We demonstrate that a scalar field kink configuration can support a brane with dS$_4$ cosmology, despite the presence of coordinate singularities in the metric. We examine the trapping of fermion fields on the domain wall for nontrivial brane cosmology.
