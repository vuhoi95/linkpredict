Title: A (p,q)-deformed Landau problem in a spherical harmonic well: spectrum  and noncommuting coordinates
Authors: Joseph Ben Geloun and Jan Govaerts and M. Norbert Hounkonnou
Abstract: A (p,q)-deformation of the Landau problem in a spherically symmetric harmonic potential is considered. The quantum spectrum as well as space noncommutativity are established, whether for the full Landau problem or its quantum Hall projections. The well known noncommutative geometry in each Landau level is recovered in the appropriate limit p,q=1. However, a novel noncommutative algebra for space coordinates is obtained in the (p,q)-deformed case, which could also be of interest to collective phenomena in condensed matter systems.
