Title: Remarks on Lorentz and CPT violation in field theory
Authors: T. Mariz and J. R. Nascimento and E. Passos
Abstract: In this brief review we explicitly calculate the radiative corrections to the Chern-Simons-like term in the cases of zero and finite temperature, and in the gravity theory. Our results are obtained under the general guidance of dimensional regularization.
