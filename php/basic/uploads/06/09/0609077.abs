Title: Integrable Field Theories with Defects
Authors: J. F. Gomes and L. H. Ymai and A. H. Zimerman
Abstract: The structure of integrable field theories in the presence of defects is discussed in terms of boundary functions under the Lagrangian formalism. Explicit examples of bosonic and fermionic theories are considered. In particular, the boundary functions for the super sinh-Gordon model is constructed and shown to generate the Backlund transformations for its soliton solutions.
