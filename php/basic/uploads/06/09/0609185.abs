Title: Reparametrising the Skyrme Model using the Lithium-6 Nucleus
Authors: Nicholas S. Manton and Stephen W. Wood
Abstract: The minimal energy B=6 solution of the Skyrme model is a static soliton with $D_{4d}$ symmetry. The symmetries of the solution imply that the quantum numbers of the ground state are the same as those of the Lithium-6 nucleus. This identification is considered further by obtaining expressions for the mean charge radius and quadrupole moment, dependent only on the Skyrme model parameters $e$ (a dimensionless constant) and $F_\pi$ (the pion decay constant). The optimal values of these parameters have often been deliberated upon, and we propose, for $B>2$, changing them from those which are most commonly accepted. We obtain specific values for these parameters for B=6, by matching with properties of the Lithium-6 nucleus. We find further support for the new values by reconsidering the $\alpha$-particle and deuteron as quantized B=4 and B=2 Skyrmions.
