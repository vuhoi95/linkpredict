Title: Thermodynamics second law and $Ï‰=-1$ crossing(s) in interacting  holographic dark energy model
Authors: H. Mohseni Sadjadi and M. Honardoost
Abstract: By the assumption that the thermodynamics second law is valid, we study the possibility of $\omega=-1$ crossing in interacting holographic dark energy model. Depending on the choice of the horizon and the interaction, the transition from quintessence to phantom regime and subsequently from phantom to quintessence phase may be possible. The second transition avoids the big rip singularity. We compute the dark energy density at transition time and show that by choosing appropriate parameters we can alleviate the coincidence problem.
