Title: Kaluza-Klein reduction of conformally flat spaces
Authors: D. Grumiller and R. Jackiw
Abstract: Kaluza-Klein reduction of conformally flat spaces is considered for arbitrary dimensions. The corresponding equations are particularly elegant for the reduction from four to three dimensions. Assuming circular symmetry leads to explicit solutions which also arise from specific two-dimensional dilaton gravity actions.
