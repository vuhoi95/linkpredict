Title: Consistent couplings between spin-2 and spin-3 massless fields
Authors: Nicolas Boulanger and Serge Leclercq
Abstract: We solve the problem of constructing consistent first-order cross-interactions between spin-2 and spin-3 massless fields in flat spacetime of arbitrary dimension n > 3 and in such a way that the deformed gauge algebra is non-Abelian. No assumptions are made on the number of derivatives involved in the Lagrangian, except that it should be finite. Together with locality, we also impose manifest Poincare invariance, parity invariance and analyticity of the deformations in the coupling constants.
