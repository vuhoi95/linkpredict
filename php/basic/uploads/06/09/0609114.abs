Abstract: We generalize the previously studied cosmological solutions in D-dimensional gravity with an antisymmetric (p+2)-form to the case when the spatial part of the metric is Ricci-flat rather than flat. These generalized solutions are characterized by a parallel self-dual or anti-self-dual charge density form Q of rank 2m and satisfy the condition Q^2 >0. As with the previous flat-space case, these electric, S-brane solutions only exist when D=4m+1 = 5, 9, 13, ... and p= 2m -1 = 1, 3, 5, .... We further generalize these solutions by adding Ricci-flat factor-spaces which are not covered by branes.
