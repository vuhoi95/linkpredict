Title: Supersymmetric renormalization prescription in N = 4 super-Yang--Mills  theory
Authors: Laurent Baulieu and Guillaume Bossard
Abstract: Using the shadow dependent decoupled Slavnov-Taylor identities associated to gauge invariance and supersymmetry, we discuss the renormalization of the N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory and of its coupling to gauge-invariant operators. We specify the method for the determination of non-supersymmetric counterterms that are needed to maintain supersymmetry.
