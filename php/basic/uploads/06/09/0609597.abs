Title: Observational $H(z)$ Data and Cosmological Models
Authors: Hao Wei and Shuang Nan Zhang
Abstract: In this work, we confront ten cosmological models with observational $H(z)$ data. The possible interaction between dark energy and dust matter is allowed in some of these models. Also, we consider the possibility of (effective) equation-of-state parameter (EoS) crossing -1. We find that the best models have an oscillating feature for both $H(z)$ and EoS, with the EoS crossing -1 around redshift $z\sim 1.5$.
