Title: Large Gauge Hierarchy in Gauge-Higgs Unification
Authors: Makoto Sakamoto and Kazunori Takenaga
Abstract: We study a five dimensional SU(3) nonsupersymmetric gauge theory compactified on $M^4\times S^1/Z_2$ and discuss the gauge hierarchy in the scenario of the gauge-Higgs unification. Making use of calculability of the Higgs potential and a curious feature that coefficients in the potential are given by discrete values, we find two models, in which the large gauge hierarchy is realized, that is, the weak scale is naturally obtained from an unique large scale such as a grand unified theory scale or the Planck scale. The size of the Higgs mass is also discussed in each model. One of the models we find realizes both large gauge hierarchy and consistent Higgs mass, and shows that the Higgs mass becomes heavier as the compactified scale becomes smaller.
