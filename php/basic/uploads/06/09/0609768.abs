Abstract: We consider the dipole transitions and the linear and quadratic Stark effect in the MICZ-Kepler system interpreting as a charge-dyon system. We show, that while the linear Stark effect in the ground state is proportional to azimuth quantum number(and to the sign of monopole number), the quadratic Stark effect in the ground state is independent on the signs of azimuth and monopole numbers.
