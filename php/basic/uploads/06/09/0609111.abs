Title: Conformal Properties of Charges in Scalar-Tensor Gravities
Authors: S. Deser and Bayram Tekin
Abstract: We study the behavior under conformal transformations of energy and other charges in generic scalar-tensor models. This enables us to conclude that the ADM/AD masses are invariant under field redefinitions mixing metric and scalar despite the permitted slow asymptotic falloff of massless scalars.
