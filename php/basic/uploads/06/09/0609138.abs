Title: Renormalization Ambiguities and Conformal Anomaly in Metric-Scalar  Backgrounds
Authors: M. Asorey and G. de Berredo-Peixoto and I. L. Shapiro
Abstract: We analyze the problem of the existing ambiguities in the conformal anomaly in theories with external scalar field in curved backgrounds. In particular, we consider the anomaly of self-interacting massive scalar field theory and of Yukawa model in the massless conformal limit. In all cases the ambiguities are related to finite renormalizations of a local non-minimal terms in the effective action. We point out the generic nature of this phenomenon and provide a general method to identify the theories where such an ambiguity can arise.
