Title: Height variables in the Abelian sandpile model: scaling fields and  correlations
Authors: Monwhea Jeng and Geoffroy Piroux and Philippe Ruelle
Abstract: We compute the lattice 1-site probabilities, on the upper half-plane, of the four height variables in the two-dimensional Abelian sandpile model. We find their exact scaling form when the insertion point is far from the boundary, and when the boundary is either open or closed. Comparing with the predictions of a logarithmic conformal theory with central charge c=-2, we find a full compatibility with the following field assignments: the heights 2, 3 and 4 behave like (an unusual realization of) the logarithmic partner of a primary field with scaling dimension 2, the primary field itself being associated with the height 1 variable. Finite size corrections are also computed and successfully compared with numerical simulations. Relying on these field assignments, we formulate a conjecture for the scaling form of the lattice 2-point correlations of the height variables on the plane, which remain as yet unknown. The way conformal invariance is realized in this system points to a local field theory with c=-2 which is different from the triplet theory.
