Abstract: In our earlier paper [JHEP 0310 (2003) 058], we considered higher dimensional cosmological models with hyperbolic spaces. In particular the eternal accelerating expansion was obtained by studying small perturbation around the critical non-accelerated solution for $D > 10$. In this addendum, we show that there is also such a solution in the critical case $D = 10$.
