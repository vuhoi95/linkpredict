Abstract: A Dirac electron field is quantized in the background of a Dirac magnetic monopole, and the phenomenon of induced quantum numbers in this system is analyzed. We show that, in addition to electric charge, also squares of orbital angular momentum, spin, and total angular momentum are induced. The functional dependence of these quantities on the temperature and the CP-violating vacuum angle is determined. Thermal quadratic fluctuations of charge and squared total angular momentum, as well as the correlation between them and their correlations with squared orbital angular momentum and squared spin, are examined. We find the conditions when charge and squared total angular momentum at zero temperature are sharp quantum observables rather than mere quantum averages.
