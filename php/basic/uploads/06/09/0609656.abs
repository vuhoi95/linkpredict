Title: An equivalence of two constructions of permutation-twisted modules for  lattice vertex operator algebras
Authors: Katrina Barron and Yi-Zhi Huang and James Lepowsky
Abstract: The problem of constructing twisted modules for a vertex operator algebra and an automorphism has been solved in particular in two contexts. One of these two constructions is that initiated by the third author in the case of a lattice vertex operator algebra and an automorphism arising from an arbitrary lattice isometry. This construction, from a physical point of view, is related to the space-time geometry associated with the lattice in the sense of string theory. The other construction is due to the first author, jointly with C. Dong and G. Mason, in the case of a multi-fold tensor product of a given vertex operator algebra with itself and a permutation automorphism of the tensor factors. The latter construction is based on a certain change of variables in the worldsheet geometry in the sense of string theory. In the case of a lattice that is the orthogonal direct sum of copies of a given lattice, these two very different constructions can both be carried out, and must produce isomorphic twisted modules, by a theorem of the first author jointly with Dong and Mason. In this paper, we explicitly construct an isomorphism, thereby providing, from both mathematical and physical points of view, a direct link between space-time geometry and worldsheet geometry in this setting.
