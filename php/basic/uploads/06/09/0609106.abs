Title: Scalar-graviton interaction in the noncommutative space
Authors: F. T. Brandt and M. R. Elias-Filho
Abstract: We obtain the leading order interaction between the graviton and the neutral scalar boson in the context of noncommutative field theory. Our approach makes use of the Ward identity associated with the invariance under a subgroup of symplectic diffeomorphisms.
