Title: Complementary strategy of New Physics searches in B-sector
Authors: A. Golutvin and V. Shevchenko
Abstract: We discuss a possible strategy for studies of a particular next-to-minimal flavor violation New Physics (NP) scenario at LHC. Our analysis is based on comparison of particular CKM matrix elements, which can be obtained from the processes dominated by diagrams of different topology (tree, penguin and box). We argue that the standard formalism of the overall unitarity triangle fit is not suitable for searches of the chosen NP. We also stress the importance of lattice computations of some relevant hadronic inputs.
