Title: Particle-like solutions to the Yang--Mills-dilaton system in d=4+1  dimensions
Authors: Eugen Radu and Ya. Shnir and D. H. Tchrakian
Abstract: We construct static solutions to a SU(2) Yang--Mills (YM) dilaton model in 4+1 dimensions subject to bi-azimuthal symmetry. The YM sector of the model consists of the usual YM term and the next higher order term of the YM hierarchy, which is required by the scaling condition for the existence of finite energy solutions. The basic features of two different types of configurations are studied, corresponding to (multi)solitons with topological charge $n^2$, and soliton--antisoliton pairs with zero topological charge.
