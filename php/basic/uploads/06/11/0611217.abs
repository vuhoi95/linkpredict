Title: Jet quenching parameters of Sakai-Sugimoto Model
Authors: Yi-hong Gao and Wei-shui Xu and Ding-fang Zeng
Abstract: Using gauge theory/string duality, we calculated the jet quenching parameter $\hat{q}$ of the Sakai-Sugimoto model in various phases. Being different from the $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory where $\hat{q}\propto T^3$, we find that $\hat{q}\propto T^4/T_d$, where $T_d$ is the critical temperature of the confined/deconfined phase transition. By analyzing the $\hat{q}$ in different phases of this theory, we get better understanding about some statements in previous works, such as the non-universality and the explanation of discrepancies between the theory predictions and experiments.
