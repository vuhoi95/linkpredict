Title: Equivariant and fractional index of projective elliptic operators
Authors: V. Mathai and R. B. Melrose and I. M. Singer
Abstract: In this note the fractional analytic index, for a projective elliptic operator associated to an Azumaya bundle, of DG/0402329 is related to the equivariant index of Atiyah and Singer for an associated transversally elliptic operator.
