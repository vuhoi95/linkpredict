Title: Zero Dimensional Field Theory of Tachyon Matter
Authors: D. D. Dimitrijevic and G. S. Djordjevic
Abstract: The first issue about the object (now) called tachyons was published almost one century ago. Even though there is no experimental evidence of tachyons there are several reasons why tachyons are still of interest today, in fact interest in tachyons is increasing. Many string theories have tachyons occurring as some of the particles in the theory. In this paper we consider the zero dimensional version of the field theory of tachyon matter proposed by A. Sen. Using perturbation theory and ideas of S. Kar, we demonstrate how this tachyon field theory can be connected with a classical mechanical system, such as a massive particle moving in a constant field with quadratic friction. The corresponding Feynman path integral form is proposed using a perturbative method. A few promising lines for further applications and investigations are noted.
