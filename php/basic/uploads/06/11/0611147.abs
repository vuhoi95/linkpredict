Title: On the SU(2|1) WZW model and its statistical mechanics applications
Authors: Hubert Saleur and Volker Schomerus
Abstract: Motivated by a careful analysis of the Laplacian on the supergroup $SU(2|1)$ we formulate a proposal for the state space of the $SU(2|1)$ WZNW model. We then use properties of $\hat{sl}(2|1)$ characters to compute the partition function of the theory. In the special case of level $k=1$ the latter is found to agree with the properly regularized partition function for the continuum limit of the integrable $sl(2|1) 3-\bar{3}$ super-spin chain. Some general conclusions applicable to other WZNW models (in particular the case $k=-1/2$) are also drawn.
