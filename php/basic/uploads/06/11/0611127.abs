Title: f(R) actions, cosmic acceleration and local tests of gravity
Authors: I. Navarro and K. Van Acoleyen
Abstract: We study spherically symmetric solutions in f(R) theories and its compatibility with local tests of gravity. We start by clarifying the range of validity of the weak field expansion and show that for many models proposed to address the Dark Energy problem this expansion breaks down in realistic situations. This invalidates the conclusions of several papers that make inappropriate use of this expansion. For the stable models that modify gravity only at small curvatures we find that when the asymptotic background curvature is large we approximately recover the solutions of Einstein gravity through the so-called Chameleon mechanism, as a result of the non-linear dynamics of the extra scalar degree of freedom contained in the metric. In these models one would observe a transition from Einstein to scalar-tensor gravity as the Universe expands and the background curvature diminishes. Assuming an adiabatic evolution we estimate the redshift at which this transition would take place for a source with given mass and radius. We also show that models of dynamical Dark Energy claimed to be compatible with tests of gravity because the mass of the scalar is large in vacuum (e.g. those that also include R^2 corrections in the action), are not viable.
