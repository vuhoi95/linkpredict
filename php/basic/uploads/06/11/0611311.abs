Abstract: We study the regularization of the codimension-2 singularities in six-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell axisymmetric models with warping. These singularities are replaced by codimension-1 branes of a ring form, situated around the axis of symmetry. We assume that there is a brane scalar field with Goldstone dynamics, which is known to generate a brane energy momentum tensor of a particular structure necessary for the above regularization to be successful. We study these compactifications in both a non-supersymmetric and a supersymmetric setting. We see that in the non-supersymmetric case, there is a restriction to the admissible warpings and furthermore to the quantum numbers of the bulk gauge field and the brane scalar field. On the contrary, in the supersymmetric case, the warping can be arbitrary.
