Title: Moduli Stabilization in Non-Geometric Backgrounds
Authors: Katrin Becker and Melanie Becker and Cumrun Vafa and Johannes Walcher
Abstract: Type II orientifolds based on Landau-Ginzburg models are used to describe moduli stabilization for flux compactifications of type II theories from the world-sheet CFT point of view. We show that for certain types of type IIB orientifolds which have no Kahler moduli and are therefore intrinsically non-geometric, all moduli can be explicitly stabilized in terms of fluxes. The resulting four-dimensional theories can describe Minkowski as well as Anti-de-Sitter vacua. This construction provides the first string vacuum with all moduli frozen and leading to a 4D Minkowski background.
