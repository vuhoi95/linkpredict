Title: Yang-Mills Localization in Warped Space
Authors: Brian Batell and Tony Gherghetta
Abstract: We present a mechanism to localize zero mode non-Abelian gauge fields in a slice of AdS_5. As in the U(1) case, bulk and boundary mass terms allow for a massless mode with an exponential profile that can be localized anywhere in the bulk. However in the non-Abelian extension, the cubic and quartic zero mode gauge couplings do not match, implying a loss of 4D gauge invariance. We show that the symmetry can be restored at the nonlinear level by considering brane-localized interactions, which are added in a gauge invariant way using boundary kinetic terms. Possible issues related to the scalar sector of the theory, such as strong coupling and ghosts, are also discussed. Our approach is then compared with other localization mechanisms motivated by dilaton gravity and deconstruction. Finally, we show how to localize the scalar component A_5 zero mode anywhere in the bulk which could be relevant in gauge-Higgs unification models.
