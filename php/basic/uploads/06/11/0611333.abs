Title: Gauge systems with noncommutative phase space
Authors: Vladimir Cuesta and Merced Montesinos and Jose David Vergara
Abstract: Some very simple models of gauge systems with noncanonical symplectic structures having $sl(2,r)$ as the gauge algebra are given. The models can be interpreted as noncommutative versions of the usual $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ model of Montesinos-Rovelli-Thiemann. The symplectic structures of the noncommutative models, the first-class constraints, and the equations of motion are those of the usual $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ plus additional terms that involve the parameters $\theta^{\mu\nu}$ which encode the noncommutativity among the coordinates plus terms that involve the parameters $\Theta_{\mu\nu}$ associated with the noncommutativity among the momenta. Particularly interesting is the fact that the new first-class constraints get corrections linear and quadratic in the parameters $\theta^{\mu\nu}$ and $\Theta_{\mu\nu}$. The current constructions show that noncommutativity of coordinates and momenta can coexist with a gauge theory by explicitly building models that encode these properties. This is the first time models of this kind are reported which might be significant and interesting to the noncommutative community.
