Abstract: We explicitly calculate the Riemannian curvature of D-dimensional metrics recently discussed by Chen, Lu and Pope. We find that they can be concisely written by using a single function. The Einstein condition which corresponds to the Kerr-NUT-de Sitter metric is clarified for all dimensions. It is shown that the metrics are of type D.
