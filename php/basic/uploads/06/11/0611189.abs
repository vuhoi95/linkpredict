Title: New Covariant Gauges in String Field Theory
Authors: Masako Asano and Mitsuhiro Kato
Abstract: A single-parameter family of covariant gauge fixing conditions in bosonic string field theory is proposed. It is a natural string field counterpart of the covariant gauge in the conventional gauge theory, which includes the Landau gauge as well as the Feynman (Siegel) gauge as special cases. The action in the Landau gauge is largely simplified in such a way that numerous component fields have no derivatives in their kinetic terms and appear in at most quadratic in the vertex.
