Title: The 4-spinon dynamical structure factor of the Heisenberg chain
Authors: J. -S. Caux and R. Hagemans
Abstract: We compute the exact 4-spinon contribution to the zero-temperature dynamical structure factor of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg isotropic antiferromagnet in zero magnetic field, directly in the thermodynamic limit. We make use of the expressions for matrix elements of local spin operators obtained by Jimbo and Miwa using the quantum affine symmetry of the model, and of their adaptation to the isotropic case by Abada, Bougourzi and Si-Lakhal (correcting some overall factors). The 4-spinon contribution to the first frequency moment sum rule at fixed momentum is calculated. This shows, as expected, that most of the remaining correlation weight above the known 2-spinon part is carried by 4-spinon states. Our results therefore provide an extremely accurate description of the exact structure factor.
