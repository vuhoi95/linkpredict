Title: Multi-center MICZ-Kepler system, supersymmetry and integrability
Authors: Sergey Krivonos and Armen Nersessian and Vadim Ohanyan
Abstract: We propose the general scheme of incorporation of the Dirac monopoles into mechanical systems on the three-dimensional conformal flat space. We found that any system (without monopoles) admitting the separation of variables in the elliptic or parabolic coordinates can be extended to the integrable system with the Dirac monopoles located at the foci of the corresponding coordinate systems. Particular cases of this class of system are the two-center MICZ-Kepler system in the Euclidean space, the limiting case when one of the background dyons is located at the infinity as well as the model of particle in parabolic quantum dot in the presence of parallel constant uniform electric and magnetic fields.
