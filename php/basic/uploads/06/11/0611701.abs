Title: Large-scale magnetic fields in the inflationary universe
Authors: Kazuharu Bamba and Misao Sasaki
Abstract: The generation of large-scale magnetic fields is studied in inflationary cosmology. We consider the violation of the conformal invariance of the Maxwell field by dilatonic as well as non-minimal gravitational couplings. We derive a general formula for the spectrum of large-scale magnetic fields for a general form of the coupling term and the formula for the spectral index. The result tells us clearly the (necessary) condition for the generation of magnetic fields with sufficiently large amplitude.
