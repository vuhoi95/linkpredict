Title: Correlators, Probabilities and Topologies in N=4 SYM
Authors: T. Brown and R. de Mello Koch and S. Ramgoolam and N. Toumbas
Abstract: We calculate transition probabilities for various processes involving giant gravitons and small gravitons in AdS space, using the dual N=4 SYM theory. The normalization factors for these probabilities involve, in general, correlators for manifolds of non-trivial topology which are obtained by gluing simpler four-manifolds. This follows from the factorization properties which relate CFT correlators for different topologies. These points are illustrated, in the first instance, in the simpler example of a two dimensional Matrix CFT. We give the bulk five dimensional interpretation, involving neighborhoods of Witten graphs, of these gluing properties of the four dimensional boundary CFT. As a corollary we give a simple description, based on Witten graphs, of a multiplicity of bulk topologies corresponding to a fixed boundary topology. We also propose to interpret the correlators as topology-changing transition amplitudes between LLM geometries.
