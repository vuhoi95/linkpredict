Title: Counting BPS Baryonic Operators in CFTs with Sasaki-Einstein duals
Authors: Agostino Butti and Davide Forcella and Alberto Zaffaroni
Abstract: We study supersymmetric D3 brane configurations wrapping internal cycles of type II backgrounds AdS(5) x H for a generic Sasaki-Einstein manifold H. These configurations correspond to BPS baryonic operators in the dual quiver gauge theory. In each sector with given baryonic charge, we write explicit partition functions counting all the BPS operators according to their flavor and R-charge. We also show how to extract geometrical information about H from the partition functions; in particular, we give general formulae for computing volumes of three cycles in H.
