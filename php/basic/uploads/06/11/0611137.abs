Title: Radiation and Potential Barriers of a 5D Black String Solution
Authors: Molin Liu and Hongya Liu and Lixin Xu and Paul S. Wesson
Abstract: By using a massless scalar field we examine the effect of an extra dimension on black hole radiation. Because the equations are coupled, we find that the structure of the fifth dimension (as for membrane and induced-matter theory) affects the nature of the radiation observed in four-dimensional spacetime. In the case of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter solution embedded in a Randall-Sundrum brane model, the extension of the black hole along the fifth dimension looks like a black string. Then it is shown that, on the brane, the potential barrier surrounding the black hole has a quantized as well as a continuous spectrum. In principle, Hawking radiation may thus provide a probe for higher dimensions.
