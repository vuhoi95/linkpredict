Abstract: We introduce a new model of background independent physics in which the degrees of freedom live on a complete graph and the physics is invariant under the permutations of all the points. We argue that the model has a low energy phase in which physics on a low dimensional lattice emerges and the permutation symmetry is broken to the translation group of that lattice. In the high temperature, or disordered, phase the permutation symmetry is respected and the average distance between degrees of freedom is small. This may serve as a tractable model for the emergence of classical geometry in background independent models of spacetime. We use this model to argue for a cosmological scenario in which the universe underwent a transition from the high to the low temperature phase, thus avoiding the horizon problem.
