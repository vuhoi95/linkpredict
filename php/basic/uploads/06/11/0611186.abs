Abstract: As the Hubbard energy at half filling is believed to reproduce at strong coupling (part of) the all loop expansion of the dimensions in the SU(2) sector of the planar $ {\cal N}=4$ SYM, we compute an exact non-perturbative expression for it. For this aim, we use the effective and well-known idea in 2D statistical field theory to convert the Bethe Ansatz equations into two coupled non-linear integral equations (NLIEs). We focus our attention on the highest anomalous dimension for fixed bare dimension or length, $L$, analysing the many advantages of this method for extracting exact behaviours varying the length and the 't Hooft coupling, $\lambda$. For instance, we will show that the large $L$ (asymptotic) expansion is exactly reproduced by its analogue in the BDS Bethe Ansatz, though the exact expression clearly differs from the BDS one (by non-analytic terms). Performing the limits on $L$ and $\lambda$ in different orders is also under strict control. Eventually, the precision of numerical integration of the NLIEs is as much impressive as in other easier-looking theories.
