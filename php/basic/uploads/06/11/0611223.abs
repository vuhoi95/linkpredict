Title: Cosmological Avatars of the Landscape I: Bracketing the SUSY Breaking  Scale
Authors: R. Holman and L. Mersini-Houghton and Tomo Takahashi
Abstract: We investigate the effects of quantum entanglement between our horizon patch and others due to the tracing out of long wavelength modes in the wavefunction of the Universe as defined on a particular model of the landscape. In this, the first of two papers devoted to this topic, we find that the SUSY breaking scale is bounded both above {\em and} below: $10^{-10} M_{\rm P}\leq M_{\rm SUSY}\leq 10^{-8} M_{\rm P}$ for $GUT$ scale inflation. The lower bound is at least five orders of magnitude larger than the expected value of this parameter and can be tested by LHC physics.
