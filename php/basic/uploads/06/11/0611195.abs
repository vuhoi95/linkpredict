Title: Black strings and solitons in five dimensional space-time with positive  cosmological constant
Authors: Y. Brihaye and T. Delsate
Abstract: We consider the classical equations of the Einstein-Yang-Mills model in five space-time dimensions and in the presence of a cosmological constant. We assume that the fields do not depend on the extra dimension and that they are spherically symmetric with respect to the three standard space dimensions. The equations are then transformed into a set of ordinary differential equations that we solve numerically. We construct new types of regular (resp. black holes) solutions which, close to the origin (resp. the event horizon) resemble the 4-dimensional gravitating monopole (resp. non abelian black hole) but exhibit an unexpected asymptotic behaviour.
