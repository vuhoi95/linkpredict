Title: Dynamics of semiclassical Bloch wave - packets
Authors: P. A. Horvathy and L. Martina
Abstract: The semiclassical approximation for electron wave-packets in crystals leads to equations which can be derived from a Lagrangian or, under suitable regularity conditions, in a Hamiltonian framework. In the plane, these issues are studied %in presence of external fields using the method of the coadjoint orbit applied to the ``enlarged'' Galilei group.
