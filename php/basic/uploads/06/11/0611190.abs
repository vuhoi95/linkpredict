Title: Level Truncated Tachyon Potential in Various Gauges
Authors: Masako Asano and Mitsuhiro Kato
Abstract: New gauge fixing condition with single gauge parameter proposed by the authors is applied to the level truncated analysis of tachyon condensation in cubic open string field theory. It is found that the only one real non-trivial extremum persists to appear in the well-defined region of the gauge parameter, while the other solutions are turned out to be gauge-artifacts. Contrary to the previously known pathology in the Feynman-Siegel gauge, tachyon potential is remarkably smooth enough around Landau-type gauge.
