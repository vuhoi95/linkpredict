Title: The integral form of APS boundary conditions in the Bag Model
Authors: Alexey A. Abrikosov jr. and Andreas Wipf
Abstract: We propose an integral form of Atiah-Patodi-Singer spectral boundary conditions (SBC) and find explicitly the integral projector onto SBC for the 3-dimensional spherical cavity. After discussion of a simple example we argue that the relation between the projector and fermion propagator is universal and stays valid independently of the bag form and space dimension.
