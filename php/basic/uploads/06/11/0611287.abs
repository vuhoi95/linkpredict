Title: Relativistic vector bosons and PT-symmetry
Authors: Jaroslav Smejkal and Vit Jakubsky and Miloslav Znojil
Abstract: Relativistic massive bosons with spin one are considered in several quantization schemes. In all of them the system is shown described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and helicity operator. Constructively we show that in all of the contemplated schemes both these operators prove simultaneously PT-symmetric, i.e., pseudo-Hermitian with respect to a certain not too complicated indefinite pseudo-metric operator.
