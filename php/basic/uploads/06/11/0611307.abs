Title: Yang-Mills Gauge Conditions from Witten's Open String Field Theory
Authors: Haidong Feng and Warren Siegel
Abstract: We construct the Zinn-Justin-Batalin-Vilkovisky action for tachyons and gauge bosons from Witten's 3-string vertex of the bosonic open string without gauge fixing. Through canonical transformations, we find the off-shell, local, gauge-covariant action up to 3-point terms, satisfying the usual field theory gauge transformations. Perturbatively, it can be extended to higher-point terms. It also gives a new gauge condition in field theory which corresponds to the Feynman-Siegel gauge on the world-sheet.
