Title: Stable bundle extensions on elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds
Authors: Bjorn Andreas and Gottfried Curio
Abstract: We construct stable bundle extensions on elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds. We show that these bundles can solve the topological anomaly constraint in heterotic string theory without the need of invoking background fivebranes.
