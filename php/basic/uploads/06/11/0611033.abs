Title: Dressing the Giant Magnon II
Authors: Chrysostomos Kalousios and Marcus Spradlin and Anastasia Volovich
Abstract: We extend our earlier work by demonstrating how to construct classical string solutions describing arbitrary superpositions of scattering and bound states of dyonic giant magnons on S^5 using the dressing method for the SU(4)/Sp(2) coset model. We present a particular scattering solution which generalizes solutions found in hep-th/0607009 and hep-th/0607044 to the case of arbitrary magnon momenta. We compute the classical time delay for the scattering of two dyonic magnons carrying angular momenta with arbitrary relative orientation on the S^5.
