Title: Extremal Black Holes in Supergravity
Authors: Laura Andrianopoli and Riccardo D'Auria and Sergio Ferrara and Mario Trigiante
Abstract: We present the main features of the physics of extremal black holes embedded in supersymmetric theories of gravitation, with a detailed analysis of the attractor mechanism for BPS and non-BPS black-hole solutions in four dimensions.
