Title: Complex magnetic monopoles and geometric phases around diabolic and  exceptional points
Authors: A. I. Nesterov and F. Aceves de la Cruz
Abstract: We study the geometric phase (GP)in presence of diabolic (DP) and exceptional (EP) points. While the GP associated with the DP is the flux of the Dirac monopole, the GP related to the EP, being complex one, is described by the flux of complex magnetic monopole. For open systems, in week-coupling limit, the leading environment-induced contribution to the real part of complex GP is given by a quadrupole term, and to its imaginary part by a dipolelike field. We find that the GP has a finite gap at the DP and infinite one at the EP.
