Abstract: We consider scalar-Gauss-Bonnet and modified Gauss-Bonnet gravities and reconstruct these theories from the universe expansion history. In particular, we are able to construct versions of those theories (with and without ordinary matter), in which the matter dominated era makes a transition to the cosmic acceleration epoch. It is remarkable that, in several of the cases under consideration, matter dominance and the deceleration-acceleration transition occur in the presence of matter only. The late-time acceleration epoch is described asymptotically by de Sitter space but may also correspond to an exact $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, having in both cases an effective equation of state parameter $w$ close to -1. The one-loop effective action of modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity on the de Sitter background is evaluated and it is used to derive stability criteria for the ensuing de Sitter universe.
