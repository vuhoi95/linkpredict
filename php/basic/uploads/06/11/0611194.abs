Title: Bopp operators and phase-space spin dynamics: Application to rotational  quantum brownian motion
Authors: D. Zueco and Ivan Calvo
Abstract: As already known for nonrelativistic spinless particles, Bopp operators give an elegant and simple way to compute the dynamics of quasiprobability distributions in the phase space formulation of Quantum Mechanics. In this work, we present a generalization of Bopp operators for spins and apply our results to the case of open spin systems. This approach allows to take the classical limit in a transparent way, recovering the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation.
