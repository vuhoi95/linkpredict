Title: Spontaneous Non-thermal Leptogenesis in High-scale Inflation Models
Authors: Motoi Endo and Fuminobu Takahashi and T. T. Yanagida
Abstract: We argue that a non-thermal leptogenesis occurs spontaneously, without direct couplings of the inflaton with right-handed neutrinos, in a wide class of high-scale inflation models such as the chaotic and hybrid inflation. It is only a finite vacuum expectation value of the inflaton, or more precisely, a linear term in the Kahler potential, that is a prerequisite for the spontaneous non-thermal leptogenesis. To exemplify how it works, we show that a chaotic inflation model in supergravity naturally produces a right amount of baryon asymmetry via the spontaneous non-thermal leptogenesis. We also discuss the gravitino production from the inflaton.
