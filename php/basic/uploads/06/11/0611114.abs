Abstract: We give a short overview of our work concerning the dimension two operator A^2 in the Landau gauge and its generalizations to other gauges. We conclude by discussing recent work that leads to a renormalizable gauge invariant action containing a mass parameter, based on the operator F 1/D^2 F.
