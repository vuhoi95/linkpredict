Title: On Heavy-Quark Free Energies, Entropies, Polyakov Loop, and AdS/QCD
Authors: Oleg Andreev and Valentin I. Zakharov
Abstract: In this paper we explore some of the features of a heavy quark-antiquark pair at finite temperature using a five-dimensional framework nowadays known as AdS/QCD. We shall show that the resulting behavior is consistent with our qualitative expectations of thermal gauge theory. Some of the results are in good agreement with the lattice data that provides additional evidence for the validity of the proposed model.
