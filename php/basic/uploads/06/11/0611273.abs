Title: Ultraviolet properties of Maximal Supergravity
Authors: Michael B. Green and Jorge G. Russo and Pierre Vanhove
Abstract: We argue that recent results in string perturbation theory indicate that the four-graviton amplitude of four-dimensional N=8 supergravity might be ultraviolet finite up to eight loops. We similarly argue that the h-loop M-graviton amplitude might be finite for h<7+M/2.
