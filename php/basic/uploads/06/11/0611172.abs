Title: Quantum corrections to the effective neutrino mass operator in 5D MSSM
Authors: Aldo Deandrea and Pierre Hosteins and Micaela Oertel and Julien Welzel
Abstract: We discuss in detail a five-dimensional Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model compactified on $S^1/Z_2$ extended by the effective Majorana neutrino mass operator. We study the evolution of neutrino masses and mixings. Masses and angles, in particular the atmospheric mixing angle $\theta_{23}$, can be significantly lowered at high energies with respect to their value at low energy.
