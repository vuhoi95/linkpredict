Title: Supersymmetric Completion of an R^2 Term in Five-Dimensional  Supergravity
Authors: Kentaro Hanaki and Keisuke Ohashi and Yuji Tachikawa
Abstract: We analyze the structure of a particular higher derivative correction of five-dimensional ungauged and gauged supergravity with eight supercharges. Specifically, we determine all the purely bosonic terms which are connected by the supersymmetry transformation to the mixed gauge-gravitational Chern-Simons term, W wedge tr R wedge R. Our construction utilizes the superconformal formulation of supergravity. As an application, we determine the condition for the supersymmetric anti-de Sitter vacuum with this term. We check that it gives precisely the same condition as the a-maximization in four-dimensional superconformal field theory on the boundary, as predicted by the AdS/CFT correspondence.
