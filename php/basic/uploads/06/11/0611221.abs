Title: Hurdles for Recent Measures in Eternal Inflation
Authors: Anthony Aguirre and Steven Gratton and Matthew C Johnson
Abstract: In recent literature on eternal inflation, a number of measures have been introduced which attempt to assign probabilities to different pocket universes by counting the number of each type of pocket according to a specific procedure. We give an overview of the existing measures, pointing out some interesting connections and generic predictions. For example, pairs of vacua that undergo fast transitions between themselves will be strongly favored. The resultant implications for making predictions in a generic potential landscape are discussed. We also raise a number of issues concerning the types of transitions that observers in eternal inflation are able to experience.
