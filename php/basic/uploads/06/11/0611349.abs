Title: Higher N-point Amplitudes in Open Superstring Theory
Authors: L. A. Barreiro and R. Medina
Abstract: In this work we report on recent progress in the calculation of open superstring scattering amplitudes, at tree level, with more than four external massless states. We also report on the corresponding terms in the low energy effective lagrangian.
