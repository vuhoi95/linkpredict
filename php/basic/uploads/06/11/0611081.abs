Abstract: In this work we study representations of the Poincare group defined over symplectic manifolds, deriving the Klein-Gordon and the Dirac equation in phase space. The formalism is associated with relativistic Wigner functions; the Noether theorem is derived in phase space and an interacting field, including a gauge field, approach is discussed.
