Title: Fundamental spatiotemporal decoherence: a key to solving the conceptual  problems of black holes, cosmology and quantum mechanics
Authors: Rodolfo Gambini and Rafael Porto and Jorge Pullin
Abstract: Unitarity is a pillar of quantum theory. Nevertheless, it is also a source of several of its conceptual problems. We note that in a world where measurements are relational, as is the case in gravitation, quantum mechanics exhibits a fundamental level of loss of coherence. This can be the key to solving, among others, the puzzles posed by the black hole information paradox, the formation of inhomogeneities in cosmology and the measurement problem in quantum mechanics.
