Title: Composite boson dominance in relativistic field theories
Authors: Sergio Caracciolo and Victor Laliena and Fabrizio Palumbo
Abstract: We apply a new bosonization technique to relativistic field theories of fermions whose partition function is dominated by bosonic composites, and derive the effective action for these bosons. The derivation respects all symmetries, including gauge invariance, with the exception of Euclidean invariance which must be checked a posteriori. We use a lattice regularization which should make applications to gauge theories easier. We test the method on a fermion field theory with quartic interaction in the limit when the number of flavours N_f is large, and show that it reproduces the exact results in the bosonic sector, namely condensation of a compositeboson with the right mass which breaks the discrete chiral invariance of the model. Moreover we determine the structure function of the condensed composite, whose spatial part turns out to be identical to that of the Cooper pairs of the BCS model of superconductivity.
