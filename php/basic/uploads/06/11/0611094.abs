Title: Dark energy from bulk matter
Authors: C. Bogdanos and A. Dimitriadis and K. Tamvakis
Abstract: We consider the possibility of getting accelerated expansion and w=-1 crossing in the context of a braneworld cosmological setup, endowed with a bulk energy-momentum tensor. For a given ansatz of the bulk content, we demonstrate that the bulk pressures dominate the dynamics at late times and can lead to accelerated expansion. We also analyze the constraints under which we can get a realistic profile for the effective equation of state and conclude that matter in the bulk has the effect of dark energy on the brane. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to simulate the behavior of a Chaplygin gas using non-exotic bulk matter.
