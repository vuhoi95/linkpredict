Title: High spin particles with spin-mass coupling II
Authors: Marcin Daszkiewicz and Zbigniew Hasiewicz and Tomasz Nikiciuk and Cezary J. Walczyk
Abstract: The classical and quantum model of high spin particles with spin-mass coupling is presented in this paper. The mass spectrum of the model is symmetric with respect to particle-antiparticle exchange. The quantum model contains elementary particles and the cluster states generating infinite degeneracy of the mass spectrum.
