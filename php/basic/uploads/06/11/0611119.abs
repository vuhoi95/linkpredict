Title: Ruppeiner theory of black hole thermodynamics
Authors: Jan E Aman and James Bedford and Daniel Grumiller and Narit Pidokrajt and John Ward
Abstract: The Ruppeiner metric as determined by the Hessian of the Gibbs surface provides a geometric description of thermodynamic systems in equilibrium. An interesting example is a black hole in equilibrium with its own Hawking radiation. In this article, we present results from the Ruppeiner study of various black hole families from different gravity theories e.g. 2D dilaton gravity, BTZ, general relativity and higher-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell gravity.
