Abstract: In this series of lectures a method is developed to compute one-loop shifts to classical masses of kinks, multi-component kinks, and self-dual vortices. Canonical quantization is used to show that the mass shift induced by one-loop quantum fluctuations is the trace of the square root of the differential operator governing these fluctuations. Standard mathematical techniques are used to deal with some powers of pseudo-differential operators. Ultraviolet divergences are tamed by using generalized zeta function regularization methods and, then performing zero-point energy and mass renormalizations.
