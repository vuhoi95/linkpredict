Title: Do supersymmetric anti-de Sitter black rings exist?
Authors: Hari K. Kunduri and James Lucietti and Harvey S. Reall
Abstract: We determine the most general near-horizon geometry of a supersymmetric, asymptotically anti-de Sitter, black hole solution of five-dimensional minimal gauged supergravity that admits two rotational symmetries. The near-horizon geometry is that of the supersymmetric, topologically spherical, black hole solution of Chong et al. This proves that regular supersymmetric anti-de Sitter black rings with two rotational symmetries do not exist in minimal supergravity. However, we do find a solution corresponding to the near-horizon geometry of a supersymmetric black ring held in equilibrium by a conical singularity, which suggests that nonsupersymmetric anti-de Sitter black rings may exist but cannot be "balanced" in the supersymmetric limit.
