Title: Entropy of BTZ black strings in the brick wall approach
Authors: H. K. Jassal and L. Sriramkumar
Abstract: During the last few years, exact solutions that describe black holes that are bound to a two-brane in a four dimensional anti-de Sitter bulk have been constructed. In situations wherein there is a negative cosmological constant on the brane, for large masses, these solutions are exactly the rotating BTZ black holes on the brane and, in fact, describe rotating BTZ black strings in the bulk. We evaluate the canonical entropy of a free and massless scalar field (at the Hawking temperature) around the rotating BTZ black string using the brick wall model. We explicitly show that the Bekenstein-Hawking `area' law is satisfied both on the brane as well as in the bulk.
