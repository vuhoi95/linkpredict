Title: Renormalization Group Approach towards the QCD Phase Diagram
Authors: Bernd-Jochen Schaefer and Jochen Wambach
Abstract: The idea of the functional renormalization group and one-loop improved renormalization group flows are reviewed. The associated flow equations and nonperturbative approximations schemes for its solutions are discussed. These techniques are then applied to the strong interaction in the framework of an effective quark meson model which is introduced in great detail. The renormalization group analysis of the two flavor quark meson model is extended to finite temperature and quark chemical potential which allows for an analysis of the chiral phase diagram beyond the mean field approximation.
