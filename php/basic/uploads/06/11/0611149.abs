Title: Equilibrium hydrostatic equation and Newtonian limit of the singular  f(R) gravity
Authors: A. J. Bustelo and D. E. Barraco
Abstract: We derive the equilibrium hydrostatic equation of a spherical star for any gravitational Lagrangian density of the form $L=\sqrt{-g}f(R)$. The Palatini variational principle for the Helmholtz Lagrangian in the Einstein gauge is used to obtain the field equations in this gauge. The equilibrium hydrostatic equation is obtained and is used to study the Newtonian limit for $f(R)=R-\frac{a^{2}}{3R}$. The same procedure is carried out for the more generally case $f(R)=R-\frac{1}{n+2}\frac{a^{n+1}}{R^{n}}$ giving a good Newtonian limit.
