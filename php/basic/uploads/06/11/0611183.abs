Title: O'KKLT
Authors: Renata Kallosh and Andrei Linde
Abstract: We propose to combine the quantum corrected O'Raifeartaigh model, which has a dS minimum near the origin of the moduli space, with the KKLT model with an AdS minimum. The combined effective N=1 supergravity model, which we call O'KKLT, has a dS minimum with all moduli stabilized. Gravitino in the O'KKLT model tends to be light in the regime of validity of our approximations. We show how one can construct models with a light gravitino and a high barrier protecting vacuum stability during the cosmological evolution.
