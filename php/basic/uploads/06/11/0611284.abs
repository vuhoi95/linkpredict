Title: Spontaneous Partial Breaking of N=2 Supersymmetry and the U(N) Gauge  Model
Authors: Kazuhito Fujiwara and Hiroshi Itoyama and Makoto Sakaguchi
Abstract: We briefly review the properties of the N=2 U(N) gauge model with/without matters. On the vacua, N=2 supersymmetry and the gauge symmetry are spontaneously broken to N=1 and a product gauge group, respectively. The masses of the supermultiplets appearing on the N=1 vacua are given. We also discuss the relation to the matrix model.
