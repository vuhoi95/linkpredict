Title: AdS/CFT correspondence in the Euclidean context
Authors: H. Gottschalk and H. Thaler
Abstract: We study two possible prescriptions for AdS/CFT correspondence by means of functional integrals. The considerations are non-perturbative and reveal certain divergencies which turn out to be harmless, in the sense that reflection-positivity and conformal invariance are not destroyed.
