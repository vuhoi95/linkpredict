Title: Statistical entropy of three-dimensional q-deformed Kerr-de Sitter space
Authors: Michael C. Abbott and David A. Lowe
Abstract: A quantum deformation of three-dimensional de Sitter space was proposed in hep-th/0407188. We use this to calculate the entropy of Kerr-de Sitter space, using a canonical ensemble, and find agreement with the semiclassical result.
