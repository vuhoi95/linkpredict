Title: Gravastars supported by nonlinear electrodynamics
Authors: Francisco S. N. Lobo and Aaron V. B. Arellano
Abstract: Gravastar models have recently been proposed as an alternative to black holes, mainly to avoid the problematic issues associated with event horizons and singularities. In this work, a wide variety of gravastar models within the context of nonlinear electrodynamics are constructed. Using the $F$ representation, specific forms of Lagrangians are considered describing magnetic gravastars, which may be interpreted as self-gravitating magnetic monopoles with charge $g$. Using the dual $P$ formulation of nonlinear electrodynamics, electric gravastar models are constructed by considering specific structural functions, and the characteristics and physical properties of the solutions are further explored. These interior nonlinear electrodynamic geometries are matched to an exterior Schwarzschild spacetime at a junction interface.
