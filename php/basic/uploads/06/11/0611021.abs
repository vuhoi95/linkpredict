Title: Deformation procedure for scalar fields in cosmology
Authors: Dionisio Bazeia and Laercio Losano and Alan B. Pavan
Abstract: This work offers an extension of the deformation procedure introduced in field theory to the case of standard cosmology in the presence of real scalar field in flat space-time. The procedure is shown to work for many models, which give rise to several different cosmic scenarios, evolving under the presence of first-order differential equations which solve the corresponding equations of motion very appropriately.
