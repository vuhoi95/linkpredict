Title: One-particle dynamical correlations in the one-dimensional Bose gas
Authors: Jean-Sebastien Caux and Pasquale Calabrese and Nikita A. Slavnov
Abstract: The momentum- and frequency-dependent one-body correlation function of the one-dimensional interacting Bose gas (Lieb-Liniger model) in the repulsive regime is studied using the Algebraic Bethe Ansatz and numerics. We first provide a determinant representation for the field form factor which is well-adapted to numerical evaluation. The correlation function is then reconstructed to high accuracy for systems with finite but large numbers of particles, for a wide range of values of the interaction parameter. Our results are extensively discussed, in particular their specialization to the static case.
