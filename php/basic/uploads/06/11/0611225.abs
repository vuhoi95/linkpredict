Title: Black-Body Radiation Of Noncommutative Gauge Fields
Authors: A. H. Fatollahi and M. Hajirahimi
Abstract: The black-body radiation is considered in a theory with noncommutative electromagnetic fields; that is noncommutativity is introduced in field space, rather than in real space. A direct implication of the result on Cosmic Microwave Background map is argued.
