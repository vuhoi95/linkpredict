Title: Brane Cosmology with a Non-Minimally Coupled Bulk-Scalar Field
Authors: C. Bogdanos and A. Dimitriadis and K. Tamvakis
Abstract: We consider the cosmological evolution of a brane in the presence of a bulk scalar field coupled to the Ricci scalar through a term f(\phi)R. We derive the generalized Friedmann equation on the brane in the presence of arbitrary brane and bulk-matter, as well as the scalar field equation, allowing for a general scalar potential V(phi). We focus on a quadratic form of the above non-minimal coupling and obtain a class of late-time solutions for the scale factor and the scalar field on the brane that exhibit accelerated expansion for a range of the non-minimal coupling parameter.
