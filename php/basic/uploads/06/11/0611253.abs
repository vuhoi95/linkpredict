Title: Meson decays from string splitting
Authors: F. Bigazzi and A. L. Cotrone and L. Martucci and W. Troost
Abstract: We discuss exclusive decays of large spin mesons into mesons in models of large N_c quenched QCD at strong coupling using string theory. The rate of the processes are calculated by studying the splitting of a macroscopic string on the relevant dual gravity backgrounds. We study analytic formulas for the decay rates of mesons made up of very heavy or very light quarks.
