Title: Metastable Vacua, Geometrical Engineering and MQCD Transitions
Authors: Radu Tatar and Ben Wetenhall
Abstract: We consider the geometrical engineering of the non-supersymmetric metastable vacua of N = 1 super Yang-Mills proposed in hep-th/0602239 and hep-th/0610249. By T-duality they become N = 1 brane configurations. The identifications between gluino condensation and the geometry sizes for the configurations of hep-th/0610249 are studied by proceeding through the usual MQCD transitions. The geometrical description of the Seiberg dualities for the theories of hep-th/0602239 involves new types of modifications of the complex structure for the resolutions of N = 2 singularities.
