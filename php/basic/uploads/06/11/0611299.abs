Title: Improved Z -> gamma gamma decay in the renormalizable gauge sector of  the noncommutative standard model
Authors: M. Buric and D. Latas and V. Radovanovic and J. Trampetic
Abstract: In this work we propose the Z -> gamma gamma decay as a process strictly forbidden in the standard model, suitable for the search of noncommutativity of coordinates at very short distances. We computed the Z -> gamma gamma partial width in the framework of the recently proposed one-loop renormalizable gauge sector of the noncommutative standard model. New experimental possibilities at LHC are analyzed and a firm bound to the scale of noncommutativity parameter is set around 1 TeV.
