Abstract: The vector bosons models including Standard Model (SM) are investigated in the framework of the Dirac Hamiltonian method with explicit resolving the Gauss constraints in order to eliminate variables with zero momenta and negative energy contributions in accordance with the operator quantization principles. The Hamiltonian formulation admits the dynamic version of the Higgs potential, where its constant parameter is replaced by the dynamic zero Fourier harmonic of the very Higgs field. In this case, the zero mode equation is a new sum-rule that predicts mass of Higgs field $m_h=\sqrt{6m^2_t-4[2M_W^2+M_Z^2]}=311.6\pm 8.9 {\rm GeV}$. The Hamiltonian formulation leads to static interactions playing the crucial role in the off-mass-shell phenomena of the type of bound state and a kaon - pion transition in the weak nonleptonic decays.
