Title: On Yukawa and mass terms in nonlinear supersymmetry equivalent  renormarizable theory
Authors: Kazunari Shima and Motomu Tsuda
Abstract: We show explicitly in D = 2 that N = 2 nonlinear supersymmetric (SUSY) Volkov-Akulov model is equivalent to a spontaneously broken N = 2 linear SUSY interacting theory containing the ordinary Yukawa interactions and mass terms, which is renormalizable, by using SUSY invariant relations.
