Title: Conformal coupling of the scalar field with gravity in higher dimensions  and invariant powers of the Laplacian
Authors: Ruben Manvelyan and D. H. Tchrakian
Abstract: The hierarchy of conformally coupled scalars with the increasing scaling dimensions $\Delta_{k}=k-d/2$, $k=1,2,3,... $ connected with the $k$-th Euler density in the corresponding space-time dimensions $d\geq 2k$ is proposed. The corresponding conformal invariant Lagrangian with the $k$-th power of Laplacian for the already known cases $k=1,2$ is reviewed, and the subsequent case of $k=3$ is completely constructed and analyzed.
