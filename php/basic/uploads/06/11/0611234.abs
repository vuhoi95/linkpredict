Title: Dirac Quantization of Restricted QCD
Authors: Y. M. Cho and Soon-Tae Hong and J. H. Kim and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: We discuss the quantization of the restricted gauge theory of SU(2) QCD regarding it as a second-class constraint system, and construct the BRST symmetry of the constrained system in the framework of the improved Dirac quantization scheme. Our analysis tells that one could quantize the restricted QCD as if it is a first-class constraint system.
