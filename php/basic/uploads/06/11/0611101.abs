Title: A Cyclic Cosmological Model in the Landscape Scenario
Authors: Cheng-Yi Sun and De-Hai Zhang
Abstract: In [1], KKLT give a mechanism to generate de Sitter vacua in string theory. And the scenario, \emph{Landscape}, is suggested to explain the problem of the cosmological constant. In this paper, adopting a simple potential describing the \emph{landscape}, we investigate the decay of the vacuum and the evolution of the universe after the decay. We find that the big crunch of the universe is inevitable. But, according to the modified Friedmann equation in [11], the singularity of the big crunch is avoided. Furthermore, we find that this gives a cyclic cosmological model.
