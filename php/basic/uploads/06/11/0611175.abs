Abstract: We twist the Hopf algebra of igl(n,R) to obtain the kappa-deformed spacetime coordinates. Coproducts of the twisted Hopf algebras are explicitly given. The kappa-deformed spacetime obtained this way satisfies the same commutation relation as that of the conventional kappa-Minkowski spacetime, but its Hopf algebra structure is different from the well known kappa-deformed Poincare algebra in that it has larger symmetry algebra than the kappa-Minkowski case. There are some physical models which consider this symmetry. Incidentally, we obtain the canonical (theta-deformed) non-commutative spacetime from canonically twisted igl(n,R) Hopf algebra.
