Title: On the question of deconfinement in noncommutative Schwinger Model
Authors: Anirban Saha and Pradip Mukherjee and Anisur Rahaman
Abstract: The 1+1 dimensional bosonised Schwinger model with a generalized gauge invariant regularisation has been studied in a noncommutative scenario to investigate the fate of the transition from confinement to deconfinement observed in the commutative setting. We show that though the fuzziness of space time introduces new features in the confinement scenario, it does not affect the deconfining limit.
