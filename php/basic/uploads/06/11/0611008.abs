Title: Quasi-Exactly Solvable N-Body Spin Hamiltonians with Short-Range  Interaction Potentials
Authors: A. Enciso and F. Finkel and A. Gonzalez-Lopez and M. A. Rodriguez
Abstract: We review some recent results on quasi-exactly solvable spin models presenting near-neighbors interactions. These systems can be understood as cyclic generalizations of the usual Calogero-Sutherland models. A nontrivial modification of the exchange operator formalism is used to obtain several infinite families of eigenfunctions of these models in closed form.
