Authors: S. Bellucci and S. Krivonos and A. Shcherbakov
Abstract: We analyse the geometry of four-dimensional bosonic manifolds arising within the context of $N=4, D=1$ supersymmetry. We demonstrate that both cases of general hyper-K\"ahler manifolds, i.e. those with translation or rotational isometries, may be supersymmetrized in the same way. We start from a generic N=4 supersymmetric three-dimensional action and perform dualization of the coupling constant, initially present in the action. As a result, we end up with explicit component actions for $N=4, D=1$ nonlinear sigma-models with hyper-K\"ahler geometry (with both types of isometries) in the target space. In the case of hyper-K\"ahler geometry with translational isometry we find that the action possesses an additional hidden N=4 supersymmetry, and therefore it is N=8 supersymmetric one.
