Title: Generalized universality in the massive sine-Gordon model
Authors: S. Nagy and I. Nandori and J. Polonyi and K. Sailer
Abstract: A non-trivial interplay of the UV and IR scaling laws, a generalization of the universality is demonstrated in the framework of the massive sine-Gordon model, as a result of a detailed study of the global behaviour of the renormalization group flow and the phase structure.
