Title: Parametrization of semi-dynamical quantum reflection algebra
Authors: Jean Avan and Genevi√®ve Rollet
Abstract: We construct sets of structure matrices for the semi-dynamical reflection algebra, solving the Yang-Baxter type consistency equations extended by the action of an automorphism of the auxiliary space. These solutions are parametrized by dynamical conjugation matrices, Drinfel'd twist representations and quantum non-dynamical $R$-matrices. They yield factorized forms for the monodromy matrices.
