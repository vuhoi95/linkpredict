Title: Fundamental Strings and Black Holes
Authors: Amit Giveon and David Kutasov
Abstract: We propose a black hole thermodynamic description of highly excited charged and uncharged perturbative string states in 3+1 dimensional type II and 4+1 dimensional heterotic string theory. We also discuss the generalization to extremal and non-extremal black holes carrying magnetic charges.
