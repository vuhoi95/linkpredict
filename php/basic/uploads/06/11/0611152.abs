Title: Black Hole evaporation in a thermalized final-state projection model
Authors: A. Fabbri and A. Perez
Abstract: We propose a modified version of the Horowitz-Maldacena final-state boundary condition based upon a matter-radiation thermalization hypothesis on the Black Hole interior, which translates into a particular entangled state with thermal Schmidt coefficients. We investigate the consequences of this proposal for matter entering the horizon, as described by a Canonical density matrix characterized by the matter temperature $T$. The emitted radiation is explicitly calculated and is shown to follow a thermal spectrum with an effective temperature $T_{eff}$. We analyse the evaporation process in the quasi-static approximation, highlighting important differences in the late stages with respect to the usual semiclassical evolution, and calculate the fidelity of the emitted Hawking radiation relative to the infalling matter.
