Title: Canonical Quantization, Space-Time Noncommutativity and Deformed  Symmetries in Field Theory
Authors: Marcos Rosenbaum and J. David Vergara and L. Roman Juarez
Abstract: Within the spirit of Dirac's canonical quantization, noncommutative spacetime field theories are introduced by making use of the reparametrization invariance of the action and of an arbitrary non-canonical symplectic structure. This construction implies that the constraints need to be deformed, resulting in an automatic Drinfeld twisting of the generators of the symmetries associated with the reparametrized theory. We illustrate our procedure for the case of a scalar field in 1+1- spacetime dimensions, but it can be readily generalized to arbitrary dimensions and arbitrary types of fields.
