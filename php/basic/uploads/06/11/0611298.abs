Abstract: The tensor self energy is computed at one loop order in a model in which a vector and tensor interact in a way that eliminates all tensor degrees of freedom. Divergencies arise which cannot be eliminated without introducing a kinetic term for the tensor field which does not appear in the classical action. We comment on a possible resolution of this puzzle.
