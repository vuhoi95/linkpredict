Title: Noncommutative vector bundles over fuzzy CP^N and their covariant  derivatives
Authors: Brian P. Dolan and Idrish Huet and Sean Murray and Denjoe O'Connor
Abstract: We generalise the construction of fuzzy CP^N in a manner that allows us to access all noncommutative equivariant complex vector bundles over this space. We give a simplified construction of polarization tensors on S^2 that generalizes to complex projective space, identify Laplacians and natural noncommutative covariant derivative operators that map between the modules that describe noncommuative sections. In the process we find a natural generalization of the Schwinger-Jordan construction to su(n) and identify composite oscillators that obey a Heisenberg algebra on an appropriate Fock space.
