Title: Computing Amplitudes in topological M-theory
Authors: Giulio Bonelli and Alessandro Tanzini and Maxim Zabzine
Abstract: We define a topological quantum membrane theory on a seven dimensional manifold of $G_2$ holonomy. We describe in detail the path integral evaluation for membrane geometries given by circle bundles over Riemann surfaces. We show that when the target space is $CY_3\times S^1$ quantum amplitudes of non-local observables of membranes wrapping the circle reduce to the A-model amplitudes. In particular for genus zero we show that our model computes the Gopakumar-Vafa invariants. Moreover, for membranes wrapping calibrated homology spheres in the $CY_3$, we find that the amplitudes of our model are related to Joyce invariants.
