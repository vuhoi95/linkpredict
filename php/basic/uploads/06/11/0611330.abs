Title: Fractional Brane State in the Early Universe
Authors: Borun D. Chowdhury and Samir D. Mathur
Abstract: In the early Universe matter was crushed to high densities, in a manner similar to that encountered in gravitational collapse to black holes. String theory suggests that the large entropy of black holes can be understood in terms of fractional branes and antibranes. We assume a similar physics for the matter in the early Universe, taking a toroidal compactification and letting branes wrap around the cycles of the torus. We find an equation of state p_i=w_i rho, for which the dynamics can be solved analytically. For black holes, fractionation can lead to non-local quantum gravity effects across length scales of order the horizon radius; similar effects in the early Universe might change our understanding of Cosmology in basic ways.
