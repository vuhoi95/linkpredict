Title: Recursion representation of the Neveu-Schwarz superconformal block
Authors: Leszek Hadasz and Zbigniew Jaskolski and Paulina Suchanek
Abstract: Four-point super-conformal blocks for the N = 1 Neveu-Schwarz algebra are defined in terms of power series of the even super-projective invariant. Coefficients of these expansions are represented both as sums over poles in the "intermediate" conformal weight and as sums over poles in the central charge of the algebra. The residua of these poles are calculated in both cases. Closed recurrence relations for the block coefficients are derived.
