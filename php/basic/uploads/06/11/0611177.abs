Title: Towards Noncommutative Fuzzy QED
Authors: Rodrigo Delgadillo-Blando and Badis Ydri
Abstract: We study in one-loop perturbation theory noncommutative fuzzy quenched QED_4. We write down the effective action on fuzzy S**2 x S**2 and show the existence of a gauge-invariant UV-IR mixing in the model in the large N planar limit. We also give a derivation of the beta function and comment on the limit of large mass of the normal scalar fields. We also discuss topology change in this 4 fuzzy dimensions arising from the interaction of fields (matrices) with spacetime through its noncommutativity.
