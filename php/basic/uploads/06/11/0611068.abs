Title: Exact bound states in volcano potentials
Authors: Ratna Koley and Sayan Kar
Abstract: Quantum mechanics in a one--parameter family of volcano potentials is investigated. After a discussion on their construction and classical mechanics, we obtain exact, normalisable bound states for specific values of the energy. The nature of the wave functions and probability densities, as well as some curious features of the solutions are highlighted.
