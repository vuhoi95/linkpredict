Title: On LCSFT/MST Correspondence
Authors: Isao Kishimoto and Sanefumi Moriyama
Abstract: It was suggested that light-cone superstring field theory (LCSFT) and matrix string theory (MST) are closely related. Especially the bosonic twist fields and the fermionic spin fields in MST correspond to the string interaction vertices in LCSFT. Since CFT operators are characterized by their OPEs, in our previous work we realized the most important OPE of the twist fields by computing contractions of the interaction vertices using the bosonic cousin of LCSFT. Here using the full LCSFT we generalize our previous work into the realization of OPEs for a vast class of operators.
