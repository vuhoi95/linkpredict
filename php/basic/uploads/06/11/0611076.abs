Title: Making a Universe
Authors: Shinichi Horata and Tetsuyuki Yukawa
Abstract: For understanding the origin of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background, rules to construct a quantized universe is proposed based on the dynamical triangulation method of the simplicial quantum gravity. A $d$-dimensional universe having the topology $ D^d $ is created numerically in terms of a simplicial manifold with $d$-simplices as the building blocks. The space coordinates of a universe are identified on the boundary surface $ S^{d-1} $, and the time coordinate is defined along the direction perpendicular to $ S^{d-1} $. Numerical simulations are made mainly for 2-dimensional universes, and analyzed to examine appropriateness of the construction rules by comparing to analytic results of the matrix model and the Liouville theory. Furthermore, a simulation in 4-dimension is made, and the result suggests an ability to analyze the observations on anisotropies by comparing to the scalar curvature correlation of a $ S^2 $-surface formed as the last scattering surface in the $ S^3 $ universe.
