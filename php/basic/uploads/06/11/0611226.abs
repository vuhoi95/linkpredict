Title: Gravitational spectrum of black holes in the Einstein-Aether theory
Authors: R. A. Konoplya and A. Zhidenko
Abstract: Evolution of gravitational perturbations, both in time and frequency domains, is considered for a spherically symmetric black hole in the non-reduced Einstein-Aether theory. It is shown that real oscillation frequency and damping rate are larger for the Einstein-Aether black hole than for the Schwarzschild black hole. This may provide an opportunity to observe aether in the forthcoming experiments with new generation of gravitational antennas.
