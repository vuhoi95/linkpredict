Abstract: We investigate the renormalized vacuum expectation values of the field square and the energy-momentum tensor for the electromagnetic field inside and outside of a conducting cylindrical shell in the cosmic string spacetime. By using the generalized Abel-Plana formula, the vacuum expectation values are presented in the form of the sum of boundary-free and boundary-induced parts. The asymptotic behavior of the vacuum expectation values of the field square, energy density and stresses are investigated in various limiting cases.
