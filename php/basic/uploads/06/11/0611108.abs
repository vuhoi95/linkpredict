Title: Modeling Multiple M2's
Authors: Jonathan Bagger and Neil Lambert
Abstract: We investigate the worldvolume theory that describes N coincident M2-branes ending on an M5 brane. We argue that the fields that describe the transverse spacetime coordinates take values in a non-associative algebra. We postulate a set of supersymmetry transformations and find that they close into a novel gauge symmetry. We propose a three-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric action to describe the truncation of the full theory to the scalar and spinor fields, and show how a Basu-Harvey fuzzy funnel arises as the BPS solution to this theory.
