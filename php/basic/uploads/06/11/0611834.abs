Title: Crossing $w=-1$ by a single scalar on a Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati brane
Authors: Hongsheng Zhang and Zong-Hong Zhu
Abstract: Recent type Ia supernovae data seem to favor a dark energy model whose equation of state $w(z)$ crosses -1, which is a much more amazing problem than the acceleration of the universe. Either the case that $w(z)$ evolves from above -1 to below -1 or the case that $w(z)$ runs from below -1 to above -1, is consistent with present data. In this paper we show that it is possible to realize the crossing behaviours of both of the two cases by only a single scalar field in frame of Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati braneworld. At the same time we prove that there does not exist scaling solution in a universe with dust.
