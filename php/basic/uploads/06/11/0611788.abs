Title: Relaxation dark energy in non-critical string cosmologies and  astrophysical data
Authors: Nikolaos E. Mavromatos and Vasiliki A. Mitsou
Abstract: In this talk we review briefly the basic features of non-critical (dissipative) String Cosmologies, and we confront some of these models with supernova data. We pay particular attention to the off-shell and dilaton contributions to the dynamical evolution equations of the non-critical string Universe, as well as the Boltzmann equation for species abundances. The latter could have important consequences for the modification of astrophysical constraints on physically appealing particle physics models, such as supersymmetry. The data fits show that non-critical string cosmologies may be viable alternatives to LambdaCDM model.
