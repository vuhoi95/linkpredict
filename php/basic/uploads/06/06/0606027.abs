Abstract: We study the holographic representation of the entanglement entropy, recently proposed by Ryu and Takayanagi, in a braneworld context. The holographic entanglement entropy of a de Sitter brane embedded in an anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime is evaluated using geometric quantities, and it is compared with two kinds of de Sitter entropy: a quarter of the area of the cosmological horizon on the brane and entropy calculated from the Euclidean path integral. We show that the three entropies coincide with each other in a certain limit. Remarkably, the entropy obtained from the Euclidean path integral is in precise agreement with the holographic entanglement entropy in all dimensions. We also comment on the case of a five-dimensional braneworld model with the Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulk.
