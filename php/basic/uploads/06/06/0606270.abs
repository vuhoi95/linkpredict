Title: On the symmetries of special holonomy sigma models
Authors: P. S. Howe and V. Stojevic
Abstract: In addition to superconformal symmetry, (1,1) supersymmetric two-dimensional sigma models on special holonomy manifolds have extra symmetries that are in one-to-one correspondence with the covariantly constant forms on these manifolds. The superconformal algebras extended by these symmetries close as W-algebras, i.e. they have field-dependent structure functions. It is shown that it is not possible to write down cohomological equations for potential quantum anomalies when the structure functions are field-dependent. In order to do this it is necessary to linearise the algebras by treating composite currents as generators of additional symmetries. It is shown that all cases can be linearised in a finite number of steps, except for G_2 and SU(3). Additional problems in the quantisation procedure are briefly discussed.
