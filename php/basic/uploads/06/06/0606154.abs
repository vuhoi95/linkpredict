Title: Fractional two-branes, toric orbifolds and the quantum McKay  correspondence
Authors: Bobby Ezhuthachan and Suresh Govindarajan and T. Jayaraman
Abstract: We systematically study and obtain the large-volume analogues of fractional two-branes on resolutions of orbifolds C^3/Z_n. We study a generalisation of the McKay correspondence proposed in hep-th/0504164 called the quantum McKay correspondence by constructing duals to the fractional two-branes. Details are explicitly worked out for two examples -- the crepant resolutions of C^3/Z_3 and C^3/Z_5.
