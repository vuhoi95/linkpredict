Abstract: We study the perturbative behaviour of topological black holes with scalar hair. We calculate both analytically and numerically the quasi-normal modes of the electromagnetic perturbations. In the case of small black holes we find evidence of a second-order phase transition of a topological black hole to a hairy configuration.
