Title: S-Track Stabilization of Heterotic de Sitter Vacua
Authors: Gottfried Curio and Axel Krause
Abstract: We present a new mechanism, the S-Track, to stabilize the volume modulus S in heterotic M-theory flux compactifications along with the orbifold-size T besides complex structure and vector bundle moduli stabilization. The key dynamical ingredient which makes the volume modulus stabilization possible, is M5-instantons arising from M5-branes wrapping the whole Calabi-Yau slice. These are natural in heterotic M-theory where the warping shrinks the Calabi-Yau volume along S^1/Z_2. Combined with H-flux, open M2-instantons and hidden sector gaugino condensation it leads to a superpotential W which stabilizes S similar like a racetrack but without the need for multi gaugino condensation. Moreover, W contains two competing non-perturbative effects which stabilize T. We analyze the potential and superpotentials to show that it leads to heterotic de Sitter vacua with broken supersymmetry through non-vanishing F-terms.
