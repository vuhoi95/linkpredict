Title: Gravity and Large Extra Dimensions
Authors: V H Satheesh Kumar and P K Suresh
Abstract: The idea that quantum gravity can be realized at the TeV scale is extremely attractive to theorists and experimentalists alike. This proposal leads to extra spacial dimensions large compared to the electroweak scale. Here we give a very systematic view of the foundations of the theories with large extra dimensions and their physical consequences.
