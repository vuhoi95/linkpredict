Title: Drinfel'd Twisted Superconformal Algebra and Structure of Unbroken  Symmetries
Authors: Manabu Irisawa and Yoshishige Kobayashi and Shin Sasaki
Abstract: We investigate deformed superconformal symmetries on non(anti)commutative (super)spaces from the point of view of the Drinfel'd twisted symmetries. We classify all possible twist elements derived from an abelian subsector of the superconformal algebra. The symmetry breaking caused by the non(anti)commutativity of the (super)spaces is naturally interpreted as the modification of their coproduct emerging from the corresponding twist element. The remaining unbroken symmetries are determined by the commutative properties of those symmetry generators possessing the twist element. We also comment on non-canonically deformed non(anti)commutative superspaces, particularly those derived from the superconformal twist element (\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{SS}}).
