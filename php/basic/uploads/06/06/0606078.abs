Title: Cosmology and Astrophysical Constraints of Gauss-Bonnet Dark Energy
Authors: Tomi Koivisto and David F. Mota
Abstract: Cosmological consequences of a string-motivated dark energy scenario featuring a scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant are investigated. We study the evolution of the universe in such a model, identifying its key properties. The evolution of the homogeneous background and cosmological perturbations, both at large and small scales, are calculated. The impact of the coupling on galaxy distributions and the cosmic microwave background is examined. We find the coupling provides a mechanism to viably onset the late acceleration, to alleviate the coincidence problem, and furthermore to effectively cross the phantom divide at the present while avoiding a Big Rip in the future. We show the model could explain the present cosmological observations, and discuss how various astrophysical and cosmological data, from the Solar system, supernovae Ia, cosmic microwave background radiation and large scale structure constrain it.
