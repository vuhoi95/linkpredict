Title: Black hole entropy from the boundary conformal structure in 3D gravity  with torsion
Authors: M. Blagojevic and B. Cvetkovic
Abstract: Asymptotic symmetry of the Euclidean 3D gravity with torsion is described by two independent Virasoro algebras with different central charges. Elements of this boundary conformal structure are combined with Cardy's formula to calculate the black hole entropy.
