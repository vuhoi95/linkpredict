Title: Reply to "Holographic principle in spacetimes with extra spatial  dimensions" and "About quantum fluctuations and holographic principle in  (4+n)-dimensional spacetime"
Authors: Fabio Scardigli and Roberto Casadio
Abstract: We reply to the comments by P.Midodashvili about our previous paper [1]. We argue that, contrary to the conclusions in Refs. [2,3], the Generalized Uncertainty Principle proposed by Ng and van Dam in Ref. [4] is compatible with the Holographic Principle in spacetimes with extra dimensions only for a very special (and somehow unrealistic) choice of the relation between the size and mass of the clock.
