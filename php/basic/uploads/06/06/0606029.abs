Title: Against Supersymmetry
Authors: Dan Radu Grigore and Gunter Scharf
Abstract: We consider the massless supersymmetric vector multiplet in a purely quantum framework and propose a power counting formula. Then we prove that the interaction Lagrangian for a massless supersymmetric non-Abelian gauge theory (SUSY-QCD) is uniquely determined by some natural assumptions, as in the case of Yang-Mills models, however we do have anomalies in the second order of perturbation theory. The result can be easily generalized to the case when massive multiplets are present, but one finds out that the massive and the massless Bosons must be decoupled, in contradiction with the standard model. Going to the second order of perturbation theory produces an anomaly which cannot be eliminated. We make a thorough analysis of the model working only with the component fields.
