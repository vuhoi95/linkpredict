Title: A Weak Gravity Conjecture for Scalar Field Theories
Authors: Miao Li and Wei Song and Yushu Song and Tower Wang
Abstract: We show that the recently proposed weak gravity conjecture\cite{AMNV0601} can be extended to a class of scalar field theories. Taking gravity into account, we find an upper bound on the gravity interaction strength, expressed in terms of scalar coupling parameters. This conjecture is supported by some two-dimensional models and noncommutative field theories.
