Title: Logarithmic extensions of minimal models: characters and modular  transformations
Authors: BL Feigin and AM Gainutdinov and AM Semikhatov and IYu Tipunin
Abstract: We study logarithmic conformal field models that extend the (p,q) Virasoro minimal models. For coprime positive integers $p$ and $q$, the model is defined as the kernel of the two minimal-model screening operators. We identify the field content, construct the W-algebra W(p,q) that is the model symmetry (the maximal local algebra in the kernel), describe its irreducible modules, and find their characters. We then derive the SL(2,Z) representation on the space of torus amplitudes and study its properties. From the action of the screenings, we also identify the quantum group that is Kazhdan--Lusztig-dual to the logarithmic model.
