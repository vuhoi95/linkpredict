Title: Transport properties in bilayer Quantum Hall systems in the presence of  a topological defect
Authors: Gerardo Cristofano and Vincenzo Marotta and Adele Naddeo and Giuliano Niccoli
Abstract: Following a suggestion given in Phys. Lett. B 571(2003) 621, we show how a bilayer Quantum Hall system at fillings nu =1/p+1 can exhibit a point-like topological defect in its edge state structure. Indeed our CFT theory for such a system, the Twisted Model (TM), gives rise in a natural way to such a feature in the twisted sector. Our results are in agreement with recent experimental findings (Phys. Rev. B 72 (2005) 041305) which evidence the presence of a topological defect in the transport properties of the bilayer system.
