Title: Black hole formation from collisions of cosmic fundamental strings
Authors: R. Iengo and J. Russo
Abstract: We develop the general formalism for joining, splitting and interconnection of closed and open strings. As an application, we study examples of fundamental cosmic string collisions leading to gravitational collapse. We find that the interconnection of two strings of equal and opposite maximal angular momentum and arbitrarily large mass generically leads to the formation of black holes, provided their relative velocity is small enough.
