Abstract: The duality between the Sine-Liouville conformal field theory and the two dimensional black hole is revisited by considering the two possible Sine-Liouville dressings together. We show that this choice is consistent with the structure of correlation functions, and that the OPE of the two dressings yields the black hole deformation operator. As an application of this approach, we investigate the role of higher winding perturbations in the context of c=1 strings, where we argue that they are related to higher-spin discrete states that generalize the 2d black hole operator.
