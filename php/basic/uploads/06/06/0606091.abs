Title: Probing the cosmological singularity with a particle
Authors: Przemyslaw Malkiewicz and Wlodzimierz Piechocki
Abstract: We examine the transition of a particle across the singularity of the compactified Milne (CM) space. Quantization of the phase space of a particle and testing the quantum stability of its dynamics are consistent to one another. One type of transition of a quantum particle is described by a quantum state that is continuous at the singularity. It indicates the existence of a deterministic link between the propagation of a particle before and after crossing the singularity. Regularization of the CM space leads to the dynamics similar to the dynamics in the de Sitter space. The CM space is a promising model to describe the cosmological singularity deserving further investigation by making use of strings and membranes.
