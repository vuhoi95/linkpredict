Abstract: We embed the flipped SU(5) models into the SO(10) models. After the SO(10) gauge symmetry is broken down to the flipped SU(5) \times U(1)_X gauge symmetry, we can split the five/one-plets and ten-plets in the spinor \mathbf{16} and \mathbf{\bar{16}} Higgs fields via the stable sliding singlet mechanism. As in the flipped SU(5) models, these ten-plet Higgs fields can break the flipped SU(5) gauge symmetry down to the Standard Model gauge symmetry. The doublet-triplet splitting problem can be solved naturally by the missing partner mechanism, and the Higgsino-exchange mediated proton decay can be suppressed elegantly. Moreover, we show that there exists one pair of the light Higgs doublets for the electroweak gauge symmetry breaking. Because there exist two pairs of additional vector-like particles with similar intermediate-scale masses, the SU(5) and U(1)_X gauge couplings can be unified at the GUT scale which is reasonably (about one or two orders) higher than the SU(2)_L \times SU(3)_C unification scale. Furthermore, we briefly discuss the simplest SO(10) model with flipped SU(5) embedding, and point out that it can not work without fine-tuning.
