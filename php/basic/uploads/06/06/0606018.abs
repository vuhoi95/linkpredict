Title: Anomalies, Hawking Radiations and Regularity in Rotating Black Holes
Authors: Satoshi Iso and Hiroshi Umetsu and Frank Wilczek
Abstract: This is an extended version of our previous letter hep-th/0602146. In this paper we consider rotating black holes and show that the flux of Hawking radiation can be determined by anomaly cancellation conditions and regularity requirement at the horizon. By using a dimensional reduction technique, each partial wave of quantum fields in a d=4 rotating black hole background can be interpreted as a (1+1)-dimensional charged field with a charge proportional to the azimuthal angular momentum m. From this and the analysis gr-qc/0502074, hep-th/0602146 on Hawking radiation from charged black holes, we show that the total flux of Hawking radiation from rotating black holes can be universally determined in terms of the values of anomalies at the horizon by demanding gauge invariance and general coordinate covariance at the quantum level. We also clarify our choice of boundary conditions and show that our results are consistent with the effective action approach where regularity at the future horizon and vanishing of ingoing modes at r=\infty are imposed (i.e. Unruh vacuum).
