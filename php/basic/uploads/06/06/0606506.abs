Abstract: We derive and study a quantum group g(p,q) that is Kazhdan--Lusztig-dual to the W-algebra W(p,q) of the logarithmic (p,q) conformal field theory model. The algebra W(p,q) is generated by two currents $W^+(z)$ and $W^-(z)$ of dimension (2p-1)(2q-1), and the energy--momentum tensor T(z). The two currents generate a vertex-operator ideal $R$ with the property that the quotient W(p,q)/R is the vertex-operator algebra of the (p,q) Virasoro minimal model. The number (2 p q) of irreducible g(p,q)-representations is the same as the number of irreducible W(p,q)-representations on which $R$ acts nontrivially. We find the center of g(p,q) and show that the modular group representation on it is equivalent to the modular group representation on the W(p,q) characters and ``pseudocharacters.'' The factorization of the g(p,q) ribbon element leads to a factorization of the modular group representation on the center. We also find the g(p,q) Grothendieck ring, which is presumably the ``logarithmic'' fusion of the (p,q) model.
