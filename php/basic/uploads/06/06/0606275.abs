Title: Graviton production from D-string recombination and annihilation
Authors: J. L. Cornou and E. Pajer and R. Sturani
Abstract: Fundamental superstrings (F-strings) and D-strings may be produced at high temperature in the early Universe. Assuming that, we investigate if any of the instabilities present in systems of strings and branes can give rise to a phenomenologically interesting production of gravitons. We focus on D-strings and find that D-string recombination is a far too weak process for both astrophysical and cosmological sources. On the other hand if D-strings annihilate they mostly produce massive closed string remnants and a characteristic spectrum of gravitational modes is produced by the remnant decay, which may be phenomenologically interesting in the case these gravitational modes are massive and stable.
