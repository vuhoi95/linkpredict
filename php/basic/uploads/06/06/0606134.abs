Title: The Distinction Between Dirac and Majorana Neutrino Wave Packets Due to  Gravity and Its Impact on Neutrino Oscillations
Authors: Dinesh Singh and Nader Mobed and Giorgio Papini
Abstract: We present the possibility that Dirac and Majorana neutrino wave packets can be distinguished when subject to spin-gravity interaction while propagating through vacuum described by the Lense-Thirring metric. By adopting the techniques of gravitational phase and time-independent perturbation theory following the Brillouin-Wigner method, we generate spin-gravity matrix elements from a perturbation Hamiltonian and show that this distinction is easily reflected in well-defined gravitational corrections to the neutrino oscillation length for a two-flavour system. Explicit examples are presented using the Sun and SN1987A as the gravitational sources for the Lense-Thirring metric. This approach offers the possibility to determine the absolute neutrino masses by this method and identify a theoretical upper bound for the absolute neutrino mass difference, where the distinctions between the Dirac and Majorana cases are evident. We discuss the relevance of this analysis to the upcoming attempts to measure the properties of low-energy neutrinos by SNO and other solar neutrino observatories.
