Abstract: For every positively curved Kahler-Einstein manifold in four dimensions we construct an infinite family of supersymmetric solutions of type IIB supergravity. The solutions are warped products of AdS_3 with a compact seven-dimensional manifold and have non-vanishing five-form flux. Via the AdS/CFT correspondence, the solutions are dual to two-dimensional conformal field theories with (2,0) supersymmetry. The corresponding central charges are rational numbers.
