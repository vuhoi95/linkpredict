Title: Magnons, Classical Strings and beta-Deformations
Authors: Chong-Sun Chu and George Georgiou and Valentin V. Khoze
Abstract: Motivated by the recent work of Hofman and Maldacena we construct a classical string solution on the beta-deformed AdS_5 \times \tilde{S}^5 background. This string solution is identified with a magnon state of the integrable spin chain description of the N=1 supersymmetric beta-deformed gauge theory. The string solution carries two angular momenta, an infinite J_1 and a finite J_2 which classically can take arbitrary values. It corresponds to the magnon of charge J_2 propagating on an infinite spin chain. We derive an exact dispersion relation for this magnon from string theory.
