Title: Orbits and Attractors for N=2 Maxwell-Einstein Supergravity Theories in  Five Dimensions
Authors: Sergio Ferrara and Murat Gunaydin
Abstract: BPS and non-BPS orbits for extremal black-holes in N=2 Maxwell-Einstein supergravity theories (MESGT) in five dimensions were classified long ago by the present authors for the case of symmetric scalar manifolds. Motivated by these results and some recent work on non-supersymmetric attractors we show that attractor equations in N=2 MESGTs in d=5 do indeed possess the distinct families of solutions with finite Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. The new non-BPS solutions have non-vanishing central charge and matter charge which is invariant under the maximal compact subgroup of the stabilizer of the non-BPS orbit. Our analysis covers all symmetric space theories G/H such that G is a symmetry of the action. These theories are in one-to-one correspondence with (Euclidean) Jordan algebras of degree three. In the particular case of N=2 MESGT with scalar manifold SU*(6)/USp(6) a duality of the two solutions with regard to N=2 and N=6 supergravity is also considered.
