Title: Proof of vanishing cohomology at the tachyon vacuum
Authors: Ian Ellwood and Martin Schnabl
Abstract: We prove Sen's third conjecture that there are no on-shell perturbative excitations of the tachyon vacuum in open bosonic string field theory. The proof relies on the existence of a special state A, which, when acted on by the BRST operator at the tachyon vacuum, gives the identity. While this state was found numerically in Feynman-Siegel gauge, here we give a simple analytic expression.
