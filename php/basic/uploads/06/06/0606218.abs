Title: Two-charge small black hole entropy: String-loops and multi-strings
Authors: Aninda Sinha and Nemani V. Suryanarayana
Abstract: We investigate the inclusion of 10-dimensional string loop corrections to the entropy function of two-charge extremal small black holes of the heterotic string theory compactified on S^1 x T^5 and show that the entropy is given by \pi\sqrt{a q_1 q_2+b q_1} where q_1 and q_2 are the charges with q_1 >> q_2 >> 1 and a and b are constants. Incorporating certain multi-string states into the microstate counting, we show that the new statistical entropy is consistent with the macroscopic scaling for one and two units of momentum (winding) and large winding (momentum). We discuss our scaling from the point of view of related AdS_3 central charge and counting of chiral primaries in superconformal quantum mechanics as well.
