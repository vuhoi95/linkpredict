Title: A Lattice Gauge Model of Singular Marsden-Weinstein Reduction. Part I.  Kinematics
Authors: E. Fischer and G. Rudolph and M. Schmidt
Abstract: The simplest nontrivial toy model of a classical SU(3) lattice gauge theory is studied in the Hamiltonian approach. By means of singular symplectic reduction, the reduced phase space is constructed. Two equivalent descriptions of this space in terms of a symplectic covering as well as in terms of invariants are derived.
