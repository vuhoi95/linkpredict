Title: Effective Potential and Thermodynamics for a Coupled Two-Field Bose Gas  Model
Authors: Marcus Benghi Pinto and Rudnei O. Ramos and Frederico F. de Souza Cruz
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of a two-species homogeneous and dilute Bose gas that is self-interacting and quadratically coupled to each other. We make use of field theoretical functional integral techniques and evaluate the one-loop finite temperature effective potential for this system considering the resummation of the leading order temperature dependent as well as infrared contributions. The symmetry breaking pattern associated to the model is then studied by considering different values of self and inter-species couplings. We pay special attention to the eventual appearance of reentrant phases and/or shifts in the observed critical temperatures as compared to the monoatomic (one-field Bose) case.
