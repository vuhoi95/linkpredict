Title: Remark on integrating out heavy moduli in flux compactification
Authors: Hiroyuki Abe and Tetsutaro Higaki and Tatsuo Kobayashi
Abstract: We study two steps of moduli stabilization in type IIB flux compactification with gaugino condensations. We consider the condition that one can integrate out heavy moduli first with light moduli remaining. We give appendix, where detail study is carried out for potential minima of the model with a six dimensional compact space with $h_{1,1}=h_{2,1}=1$, including the model, whose respective moduli with $h_{1,1}, h_{2,1} \neq 1$ are identified.
