Title: Frobenius transformation, mirror map and instanton numbers
Authors: Albert Schwarz and Vadim Vologodsky
Abstract: We show that one can express Frobenius transformation on middle-dimensional p-adic cohomology of Calabi-Yau threefold in terms of mirror map and instanton numbers. We express the mirror map in terms of Frobenius transformation on p-adic cohomology . We discuss a $p$-adic interpretation of the conjecture about integrality of Gopakumar-Vafa invariants.
