Title: An M theory Solution to the Hierarchy Problem
Authors: Bobby Acharya and Konstantin Bobkov and Gordon Kane and Piyush Kumar and Diana Vaman
Abstract: An old idea for explaining the hierarchy is strong gauge dynamics. We show that such dynamics {\it also} stabilises the moduli in $M$ theory compactifications on manifolds of $G_2$-holonomy {\it without} fluxes. This gives stable vacua with softly broken susy, grand unification and a distinctive spectrum of TeV and sub-TeV sparticle masses.
