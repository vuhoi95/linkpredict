Title: New Casimir Energy Calculations
Authors: H. Ahmedov and I. H. Duru
Abstract: New Casimir energy results for massless scalar field in some 3 -dimensional cavities are presented. We attempted to discuss the correlation between the sign and the magnitude of the energy and the shape of the cavities.
