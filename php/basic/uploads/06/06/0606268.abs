Title: Perturbative Gravity and Twistor Space
Authors: N. E. J. Bjerrum-Bohr and David C. Dunbar and Harald Ita
Abstract: The recent progress in computing gauge theory amplitudes can be extended, in many cases, to theories incorporating gravity. This has improved our understanding of the perturbative expansion of N=8 supergravity supporting the ``no-triangle hypothesis'' that N=8 one-loop amplitudes may be expressed in terms of scalar box integral functions.
