Title: Fixed points of quantum gravity in higher dimensions
Authors: Peter Fischer and Daniel F. Litim
Abstract: We study quantum gravity in more than four dimensions by means of an exact functional flow. A non-trivial ultraviolet fixed point is found in the Einstein-Hilbert theory. It is shown that our results for the fixed point and universal scaling exponents are stable. If the fixed point persists in extended truncations, quantum gravity in the metric field is asymptotically safe. We indicate physical consequences of this scenario in phenomenological models with low-scale quantum gravity and large extra dimensions.
