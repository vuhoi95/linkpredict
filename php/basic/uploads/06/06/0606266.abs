Title: Ellipsoidal Universe Can Solve The CMB Quadrupole Problem
Authors: L. Campanelli and P. Cea and L. Tedesco
Abstract: The recent three-year WMAP data have confirmed the anomaly concerning the low quadrupole amplitude compared to the best-fit \Lambda CDM prediction. We show that, allowing the large-scale spatial geometry of our universe to be plane-symmetric with eccentricity at decoupling or order 10^{-2}, the quadrupole amplitude can be drastically reduced without affecting higher multipoles of the angular power spectrum of the temperature anisotropy.
