Title: On matrix differential equations in the Hopf algebra of renormalization
Authors: Kurusch Ebrahimi-Fard and Dominique Manchon
Abstract: We establish Sakakibara's differential equations in a matrix setting for the counter term (respectively renormalized character) in Connes-Kreimer's Birkhoff decomposition in any connected graded Hopf algebra, thus including Feynman rules in perturbative renormalization as a key example.
