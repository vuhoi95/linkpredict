Title: Jet quenching at finite `t Hooft coupling and chemical potential from  AdS/CFT
Authors: Nestor Armesto and Jose D. Edelstein and Javier Mas
Abstract: Following the nonperturbative prescription for the jet quenching parameter recently proposed by Liu, Rajagopal and Wiedemann, we compute the first correction in the inverse `t Hooft coupling corresponding to string alpha' corrections in the dual background. We also consider the introduction of a chemical potential for the U(1)^3 gauged R-symmetry. While the former mildly diminishes the jet quenching parameter -this suggesting a smooth interpolation between the strong coupling and perturbative results-, the latter generically increases its value. We comment on the extension of this setup to quarks of finite mass.
