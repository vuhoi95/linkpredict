Authors: M. Ali-Akbari and M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari and M. Torabian
Abstract: In this paper we continue analysis of the Matrix theory describing the DLCQ of type IIB string theory on AdS_5 x S^5 (and/or the plane-wave) background, i.e. the Tiny Graviton Matrix Theory (TGMT)[hep-th/0406214]. We study and classify 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 BPS solutions of the TGMT which are generically of the form of rotating three brane giants. These are branes whose shape are deformed three spheres and hyperboloids. In lack of a classification of such ten dimensional type IIb supergravity configurations, we focus on the dual N=4 four dimensional 1/2, 1/4 and one 1/8 BPS operators and show that they are in one-to-one correspondence with the states of the same set of quantum numbers in TGMT. This provides further evidence in support of the Matrix theory.
