Title: Ampere's Law and Energy Loss in AdS/CFT Duality
Authors: Sang-Jin Sin and Ismail Zahed
Abstract: We note that the energy loss in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM measures directly the spatial string tension $\sigma_S=\pi\sqrt{\lambda}T^2/2$ which is at the origin of the area law for large spatial Wilson loops. We show that the latter reflects on the nonperturbative nature of Ampere's law in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM both in vacuum and at finite temperature.
