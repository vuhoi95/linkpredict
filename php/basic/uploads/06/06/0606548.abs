Title: Dimer models for parallelograms
Authors: Kazushi Ueda and Masahito Yamazaki
Abstract: We discuss the relation between dimer models and coamoebas associated with lattice parallelograms. We also discuss homological mirror symmetry for the product of two projective lines, emphasizing the role of a non-isoradial dimer model.
