Title: A possible experimental test of quantized gravity
Authors: P. J. Salzman and S. Carlip
Abstract: While it is widely believed that gravity should ultimately be treated as a quantum theory, there remains a possibility that general relativity should not be quantized. If this is the case, the coupling of classical gravity to the expectation value of the quantum stress-energy tensor will naturally lead to nonlinearities in the Schrodinger equation. By numerically investigating time evolution in the nonrelativistic "Schrodinger-Newton" approximation, we show that such nonlinearities may be observable in the next generation of molecular interferometry experiments.
