Title: BPS String Webs in the 6-dim (2,0) Theories
Authors: Ki-Myeong Lee and Ho-Ung Yee
Abstract: In the Coulomb phase of the 6-dim (2,0) superconformal theories, the 1/4, 1/8, 1/16 BPS selfdual string webs are argued to exist such that the spatial SO(5) and internal SO(5) rotations are correlated. The basic constituents are 1/2 BPS strings and 1/4 BPS string junctions. One support comes from the existence of the similar BPS dyonic monostring webs in 5-dim maximally supersymmetric gauge theories. Another comes from the study of the supersymmetry of the intersecting M2 brane stripes terminating on M5 branes. We also discuss the related BPS webs in little string theories and other theories.
