Title: Volume stabilization in a warped flux compactification model
Authors: Masato Minamitsuji and Wade Naylor and Misao Sasaki
Abstract: We investigate the stability of the extra dimensions in a warped, codimension two braneworld that is based upon an Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory with a non-vanishing scalar field potential. The braneworld solution has two 3-branes, which are located at the positions of the conical singularities. For this type of brane solution the relative positions of the branes (the shape modulus) is determined via the tension-deficit relations, if the brane tensions are fixed. However, the volume of the extra dimensions (the volume modulus) is not fixed in the context of the classical theory, implying we should take quantum corrections into account. Hence, we discuss the one-loop effective potential of the volume modulus for a massless, minimally coupled scalar field.
