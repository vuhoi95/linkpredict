Title: Harmonic oscillators coupled by springs: discrete solutions as a Wigner  Quantum System
Authors: S. Lievens and N. I. Stoilova and J. Van der Jeugt
Abstract: We consider a quantum system consisting of a one-dimensional chain of M identical harmonic oscillators with natural frequency $\omega$, coupled by means of springs. Such systems have been studied before, and appear in various models. In this paper, we approach the system as a Wigner Quantum System, not imposing the canonical commutation relations, but using instead weaker relations following from the compatibility of Hamilton's equations and the Heisenberg equations. In such a setting, the quantum system allows solutions in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, with a discrete spectrum for all physical operators. We show that a class of solutions can be obtained using generators of the Lie superalgebra gl(1|M). Then we study the properties and spectra of the physical operators in a class of unitary representations of gl(1|M). These properties are both interesting and intriguing. In particular, we can give a complete analysis of the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian and of the position and momentum operators (including multiplicities). We also study probability distributions of position operators when the quantum system is in a stationary state, and the effect of the position of one oscillator on the positions of the remaining oscillators in the chain.
