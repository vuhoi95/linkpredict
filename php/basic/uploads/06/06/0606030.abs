Title: Parametric Representation of Noncommutative Field Theory
Authors: Razvan Gurau and Vincent Rivasseau
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the Schwinger parametric representation for the Feynman amplitudes of the recently discovered renormalizable $\phi^4_4$ quantum field theory on the Moyal non commutative ${\mathbb R^4}$ space. This representation involves new {\it hyperbolic} polynomials which are the non-commutative analogs of the usual "Kirchoff" or "Symanzik" polynomials of commutative field theory, but contain richer topological information.
