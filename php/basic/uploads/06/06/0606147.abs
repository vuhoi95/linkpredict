Title: Twisted D-branes of the SU(N)_K WZW model and level-rank duality
Authors: Stephen G. Naculich and Howard J. Schnitzer
Abstract: We analyze the level-rank duality of omega_c-twisted D-branes of SU(N)_K (when N and K>2). When N or K is even, the duality map involves Z_2-cominimal equivalence classes of twisted D-branes. We prove the duality of the spectrum of an open string stretched between omega_c-twisted D-branes, and ascertain the relation between the charges of level-rank-dual omega_c-twisted D-branes.
