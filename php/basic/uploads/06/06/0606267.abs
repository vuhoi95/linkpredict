Title: Renormalized masses of heavy Kaluza-Klein states
Authors: Enrique Álvarez and Antón F. Faedo
Abstract: Several ways of computing the radiative corrections to the heavy boson masses in Kaluza-Klein theory are discussed. It is argued that only an intrinsically higher dimensional approach embodies all the desired physical properties.
