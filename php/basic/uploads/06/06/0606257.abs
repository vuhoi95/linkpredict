Title: Gravity duals to deformed SYM theories and Generalized Complex Geometry
Authors: Ruben Minasian and Michela Petrini and Alberto Zaffaroni
Abstract: We analyze the supersymmetry conditions for a class of SU(2) structure backgrounds of Type IIB supergravity, corresponding to a specific ansatz for the supersymmetry parameters. These backgrounds are relevant for the AdS/CFT correspondence since they are suitable to describe mass deformations or beta-deformations of four-dimensional superconformal gauge theories. Using Generalized Complex Geometry we show that these geometries are characterized by a closed nowhere-vanishing vector field and a modified fundamental form which is also closed. The vector field encodes the information about the superpotential and the type of deformation - mass or beta respectively. We also show that the Pilch-Warner solution dual to a mass-deformation of N =4 Super Yang-Mills and the Lunin-Maldacena beta-deformation of the same background fall in our class of solutions.
