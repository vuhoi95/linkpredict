Title: High spin particles with spin-mass coupling
Authors: Marcin Daszkiewicz and Zbigniew Hasiewicz and Cezary J. Walczyk
Abstract: The classical and quantum model of high spin particles is proposed and analyzed in this paper. The covariant quantization leads to the spectrum of the particles with the masses correlated with their spins. The particles (and anti-particles) appear to be orphaned as their potential anti-particle partners are of different mass.
