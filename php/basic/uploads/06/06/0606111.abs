Title: Instanton test of non-supersymmetric deformations of the AdS_5 x S^5
Authors: Callum Durnford and George Georgiou and Valentin V. Khoze
Abstract: We consider instanton effects in a non-supersymmetric gauge theory obtained by marginal deformations of the N=4 SYM. This gauge theory is expected to be dual to type IIB string theory on the AdS_5 times deformed-S^5 background. From an instanton calculation in the deformed gauge theory we extract the prediction for the dilaton-axion field \tau in dual string theory. In the limit of small deformations where the supergravity regime is valid, our instanton result reproduces the expression for \tau of the supergravity solution found by Frolov.
