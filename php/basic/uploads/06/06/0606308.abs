Title: Spin 3/2 Beyond the Rarita-Schwinger Framework
Authors: Mauro Napsuciale and Mariana Kirchbach and Simon Rodriguez
Abstract: We employ the two independent Casimir operators of the Poincare group, the squared four--momentum, P^2, and the squared Pauli-Lubanski vector, W^2, in the construction of a covariant mass-m, and spin-3/2 projector in the four-vector-spinor, \psi_{\mu}. This projector provides the basis for the construction of an interacting Lagrangian that describes a causally propagating spin-3/2} particle coupled to the electromagnetic field by a gyromagnetic ratio of g_{3/2}=2.
