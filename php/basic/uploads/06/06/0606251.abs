Title: Vortices in U(1) Noncommutative Gauge Fields
Authors: H. Falomir and J. Gamboa and J. Lopez-Sarrion and F. Mendez and A. J. da Silva
Abstract: Charged vortex solutions for noncommutative Maxwell-Higgs model in 3+1 dimensions are found. We show that the stability of these vortex solutions is spoiled out for some, large enough, noncommutativity parameter. A non topological charge, however, is induced by noncommutative effects.
