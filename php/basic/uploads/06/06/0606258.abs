Title: Maxwell-Chern-Simons Q-balls
Authors: M. Deshaies-Jacques and R. MacKenzie
Abstract: We examine the energetics of $Q$-balls in Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory in two space dimensions. Whereas gauged $Q$-balls are unallowed in this dimension in the absence of a Chern-Simons term due to a divergent electromagnetic energy, the addition of a Chern-Simons term introduces a gauge field mass and renders finite the otherwise-divergent electromagnetic energy of the $Q$-ball. Similar to the case of gauged $Q$-balls, Maxwell-Chern-Simons $Q$-balls have a maximal charge. The properties of these solitons are studied as a function of the parameters of the model considered, using a numerical technique known as relaxation. The results are compared to expectations based on qualitative arguments.
