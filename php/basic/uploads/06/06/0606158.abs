Title: Random lattice superstrings
Authors: Haidong Feng and Warren Siegel
Abstract: We propose some new simplifying ingredients for Feynman diagrams that seem necessary for random lattice formulations of superstrings. In particular, half the fermionic variables appear only in particle loops (similarly to loop momenta), reducing the supersymmetry of the constituents of the Type IIB superstring to N=1, as expected from their interpretation in the 1/N expansion as super Yang-Mills.
