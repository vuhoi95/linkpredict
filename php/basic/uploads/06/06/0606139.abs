Title: Bulk Mass Effects in Gauge-Higgs Unification at Finite Temperature
Authors: Nobuhito Maru and Kazunori Takenaga
Abstract: We study the bulk mass effects on the electroweak phase transition at finite temperature in a five dimensional SU(3) gauge-Higgs unification model on an orbifold. We investigate whether the Higgs mass satisfying the experimental lower bound can be compatible with the strong first order phase transition necessary for a successful electroweak baryogenesis. Our numerical results show that the above statement can be realized by matter with bulk mass yielding a viable Higgs mass. We also find an interesting case where the heavier Higgs gives the stronger first order phase transition.
