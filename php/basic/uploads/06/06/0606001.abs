Title: Proton decay via dimension-six operators in intersecting D6-brane models
Authors: Mirjam Cvetic and Robert Richter
Abstract: We analyze the proton decay via dimension six operators in supersymmetric SU(5)-Grand Unified models based on intersecting D6-brane constructions in Type IIA string theory orientifolds. We include in addition to 10* 10 10* 10 interactions also the operators arising from 5-bar* 5-bar 10* 10 interactions. We provide a detailed construction of vertex operators for any massless string excitation arising for arbitrary intersecting D-brane configurations in Type IIA toroidal orientifolds. In particular, we provide explicit string vertex operators for the 10 and 5-bar chiral superfields and calculate explicitly the string theory correlation functions for above operators. In the analysis we chose the most symmetric configurations in order to maximize proton decay rates for the above dimension six operators and we obtain a small enhancement relative to the field theory result. After relating the string proton decay rate to field theory computations the string contribution to the proton lifetime is tau^{ST}_p =(0.5-2.1) x 10^{36} years, which could be up to a factor of three shorter than that predicted in field theory.
