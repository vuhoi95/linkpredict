Title: General Solution Of Linear Vector Supersymmetry
Authors: Alberto Blasi and Nicola Maggiore
Abstract: We give the general solution of the Ward identity for the linear vector supersymmetry which characterizes all topological models. Such solution, whose expression is quite compact and simple, greatly simplifies the study of theories displaying a supersymmetric algebraic structure, reducing to a few lines the proof of their possible finiteness. In particular, the cohomology technology usually involved for the quantum extension of these theories, is completely bypassed. The case of Chern-Simons theory is taken as an example.
