Title: On the modified KKLT procedure: a case study for the P_{11169}[18] model
Authors: Gottfried Curio and Vera Spillner
Abstract: We probe the existence of supersymmetric vacua of the type IIB orientifold of the elliptic Calabi-Yau space P_{11169}[18] where generically two complex structure moduli z_i, the dilaton tau and the two K\"ahler moduli T_i are stabilized by fluxes and gaugino condensates. The usual KKLT procedure, which integrates out the complex structure moduli and the dilaton, actually has to be modified, such that one keeps the dependence on tau. We derive explicitely the resulting effective superpotential W_{eff}(tau) for the dilaton for various flux combinations. As this is actually a non-holomorphic quantity one must properly work with the G-function. The remaining SUSY equations for tau and the T_i can be resolved explicitely.
