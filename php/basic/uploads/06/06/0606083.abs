Title: A class of non-supersymmetric orientifolds
Authors: Anamaria Font and Jose Antonio Lopez
Abstract: We study type IIB orientifolds on T^{2d}/Z_N with supersymmetry broken by the compactification. We determine tadpole cancellation conditions including anti-branes and considering different actions for the parity Omega. Using these conditions we then obtain the spectrum of tachyons and massless states. Various examples with N even correspond to type 0B orientifolds.
