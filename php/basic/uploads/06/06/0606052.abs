Abstract: We construct a new off-shell $\mathcal{N}{=}4$, $d{=}3$ nonlinear vector supermultiplet. The irreducibility constraints for the superfields leave in this supermultiplet the same component content as in the ordinary linear vector supermultiplet. We present the most general sigma-model type action for the $\mathcal{N}{=}4$, $d{=}3$ electrodynamics with the nonlinear vector supermultiplet, which despite the nonlinearity of the supermultiplet may be written as an integral over a chiral superspace. This action share the most important properties with its linear counterpart. We also perform the dualization of the vector component into a scalar one and find the corresponding $\mathcal{N}{=}4$, $d{=}3$ supersymmetric action which describes new hyper-K\"ahler sigma-model in the bosonic sector.
