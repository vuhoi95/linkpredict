Title: Eleven-Dimensional Gauge Theory for the M Algebra as an Abelian  Semigroup Expansion of osp(32|1)
Authors: Fernando Izaurieta and Eduardo Rodr√≠guez and Patricio Salgado
Abstract: A new Lagrangian realizing the symmetry of the M Algebra in eleven-dimensional space-time is presented. By means of the novel technique of Abelian Semigroup Expansion, a link between the M Algebra and the orthosymplectic algebra osp(32|1) is established, and an M Algebra-invariant symmetric tensor of rank six is computed. This symmetric invariant tensor is a key ingredient in the construction of the new Lagrangian. The gauge-invariant Lagrangian is displayed in an explicitly Lorentz-invariant way by means of a subspace separation method based on the extended Cartan homotopy formula.
