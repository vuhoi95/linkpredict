Authors: Soon-Tae Hong and Joohan Lee and Tae Hoon Lee and Phillial Oh
Abstract: We study the supersymmetric quantum mechanics of an isospin particle in the background of spherically symmetric Yang-Mills gauge field. We show that on $S^{2}$ the number of supersymmetries can be made arbitrarily large for a specific choice of the spherically symmetric SU(2) gauge field. However, the symmetry algebra containing the supercharges becomes nonlinear if the number of fermions is greater than two. We present the exact energy spectra and eigenfunctions, which can be written as the product of monopole harmonics and a certain isospin state. We also find that the supersymmetry is spontaneously broken if the number of supersymmetries is even.
