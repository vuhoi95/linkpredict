Title: Mickelsson algebras and Zhelobenko operators
Authors: S. Khoroshkin and O. Ogievetsky
Abstract: We construct a family of automorphisms of Mickelsson algebra, satisfying braid group relations. The construction uses 'Zhelobenko cocycle' and includes the dynamical Weyl group action as a particular case.
