Title: On Stable Non-Supersymmetric Vacua at the Bottom of Cascading Theories
Authors: Riccardo Argurio and Matteo Bertolini and Cyril Closset and Stefano Cremonesi
Abstract: We consider a wide class of cascading gauge theories which usually lead to runaway behaviour in the IR, and discuss possible deformations of the superpotential at the bottom of the cascade which stabilize the runaway direction and provide stable non-supersymmetric vacua. The models we find may allow for a weakly coupled supergravity analysis of dynamical supersymmetric breaking in the context of the gauge/string correspondence.
