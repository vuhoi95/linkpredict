Authors: S. Fedoruk and E. Ivanov and J. Lukierski
Abstract: We show that the massless higher spin four-dimensional particle model with bosonic counterpart of N=1 supersymmetry respects SU(3,2) invariance. We extend this particle model to a superparticle possessing $SU(3,2|1)$ supersymmetry which is a closure of standard four-dimensional N=1 superconformal symmetry $SU(2,2|1)$ and its bosonic SU(3,2) counterpart. The new massless higher spin D=4 superparticle model describes trajectories in Minkowski superspace $(x^\mu, \theta^\alpha, \bar\theta^{\dot\alpha})$ extended by the commuting Weyl spinor $\zeta^\alpha$, $\bar\zeta^{\dot\alpha}=(\zeta^\alpha)^\ast$. We find the relevant phase space constraints and quantize the model. As a result of quantization we obtain the superwave function which describes an infinite sequence of four-dimensional massless chiral superfields with arbitrary external helicity indices.
