Title: Gauging CSO groups in N=4 Supergravity
Authors: Mees de Roo and Dennis B. Westra and Sudhakar Panda
Abstract: We investigate a class of CSO-gaugings of N=4 supergravity coupled to six vector multiplets. Using the CSO-gaugings we do not find a vacuum that is stable against all scalar perturbations at the point where the matter fields are turned off. However, at this point we do find a stable cosmological scaling solution.
