Title: Current Algebra of the Pure Spinor Superstring in AdS(5) x S(5)
Authors: M. Bianchi and J. Kluson
Abstract: We perform a Hamiltonian analysis of the classical type IIB superstring on AdS(5) x S(5) in the pure spinor approach. Taking the spatial components of the left-invariant (super)currents and the pure spinor ghosts as canonical variables, we compute the classical graded Poisson brackets of the currents and ghosts and identify the first class constraints associated to the local SO(4,1) x SO(5) symmetry and the pure spinor condition. We then study the properties of the BRST generators and the Hamiltonian along the constraints. For a natural choice of the the Lagrange multipliers, we show equivalence of the canonical equations of motion with the covariant ones. Finally we briefly discuss the (non) local currents, including the ghost contribution, that generate the global PSU(2,2|4) symmetry and its Yangian extension in the present framework.
