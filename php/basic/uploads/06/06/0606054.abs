Title: Formally exact quantization condition for nonrelativistic quantum  systems
Authors: Yong-Cheng Ou and Zhuang-Qi Cao and Qi-Shun Shen
Abstract: Based on the standard transfer matrix, a formally exact quantization condition for arbitrary potentials, which outflanks and unifies the historical approaches, is derived. It can be used to find the exact bound-state energy eigenvalues of the quantum system without solving an equation of motion for the system wave functions.
