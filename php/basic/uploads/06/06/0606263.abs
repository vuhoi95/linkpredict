Title: Exact Attractive Non-BPS STU Black Holes
Authors: Renata Kallosh and Navin Sivanandam and Masoud Soroush
Abstract: We develop some properties of the non-BPS attractive STU black hole. Our principle result is the construction of exact solutions for the moduli, the metric and the vectors in terms of appropriate harmonic functions. In addition, we find a spherically-symmetric attractor carrying $p^0$ ($D6$ brane) and $q_a$ ($D2$ brane) charges by solving the non-BPS attractor equation (which we present in a particularly compact form) and by minimizing an effective black hole potential. Finally, we make an argument for the existence of multi-center attractors and conjecture that if such solutions exist they may provide a resolution to the existence of apparently unstable non-BPS ``attractors.''
