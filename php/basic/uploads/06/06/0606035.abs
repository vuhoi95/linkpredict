Title: WDVV equations for 6d Seiberg-Witten theory and bi-elliptic curves
Authors: H. W. Braden and A. Marshakov and A. Mironov and A. Morozov
Abstract: We present a generic derivation of the WDVV equations for 6d Seiberg-Witten theory, and extend it to the families of bi-elliptic spectral curves. We find that the elliptization of the naive perturbative and nonperturbative 6d systems roughly "doubles" the number of moduli describing the system.
