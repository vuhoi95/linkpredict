Title: Kaluza-Klein black holes with squashed horizons and $d=4$ superposed  monopoles
Authors: Y. Brihaye and E. Radu
Abstract: We present new solutions of the $d=5$ Einstein-Yang-Mills theory describing black holes with squashed horizons. These configurations are asymptotically locally flat and have a boundary topology of a fibre bundle $R\times S^1 \hookrightarrow S^{2}$. In a $d=4$ picture, they describe black hole solutions with both nonabelian and U(1) magnetic charges.
