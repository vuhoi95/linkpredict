Title: Noncommutative Geometry: Fuzzy Spaces, the Groenewold-Moyal Plane
Authors: Aiyalam P. Balachandran and Babar Ahmed Qureshi
Abstract: In this talk, we review the basics concepts of fuzzy physics and quantum field theory on the Groenwald-Moyal Plane as examples of noncommutative spaces in physics. We introduce the basic ideas, and discuss some important results in these fields. In the end we outline some recent developments in the field.
