Title: Strongly Coupled Chameleon Fields: New Horizons in Scalar Field Theory
Authors: David F. Mota and Douglas J. Shaw
Abstract: We show that as a result of non-linear self-interactions, scalar field theories that couple to matter much more strongly than gravity are not only viable but could well be detected by a number of future experiments, provided these are properly designed to do so.
