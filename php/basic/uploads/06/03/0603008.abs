Title: Poincar√© and sl(2) algebras of order 3
Authors: M. Goze and M. Rausch de Traubenberg and A. Tanasa
Abstract: In this paper we initiate a general classification for Lie algebras of order 3 and we give all Lie algebras of order 3 based on $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb C)$ and $\mathfrak{iso}(1,3)$ the Poincar\'e algebra in four-dimensions. We then set the basis of the theory of the deformations (in the Gerstenhaber sense) and contractions for Lie algebras of order 3.
