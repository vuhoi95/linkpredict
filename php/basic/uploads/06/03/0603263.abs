Title: Dimension-two gluon condensate from large-Nc Regge models
Authors: Enrique Ruiz Arriola and Wojciech Broniowski
Abstract: It is shown that in the large-N_c limit radial Regge trajectories give rise in a natural way to the presence of the dimension-2 gluon condensate, <A^2>, in meson correlators. We match these models to QCD and provide estimates for <A^2> in terms of other physical quantities. In particular, in the simplest strictly linear radial Regge model with equal residues <A^2> is proportional to the pion decay constant squared. However, the linear model fails a consistency condition based on matching the short- and long-distance string tensions, nor reproduces the phenomenological values of the gluon condensates. On the contrary, in Regge models departing from strict linearity one may reproduce both the consistency condition and the signs of condensates. We demonstrate this in a simple explicit model.
