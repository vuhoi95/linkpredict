Title: Shear dynamics in Bianchi I cosmologies with R^n-gravity
Authors: Jannie A Leach and Sante Carloni and Peter K S Dunsby
Abstract: We give the equations governing the shear evolution in Bianchi spacetimes for general f(R)-theories of gravity. We consider the case of R^n-gravity and perform a detailed analysis of the dynamics in Bianchi I cosmologies which exhibit local rotational symmetry. We find exact solutions and study their behaviour and stability in terms of the values of the parameter n. In particular, we found a set of cosmic histories in which the universe is initially isotropic, then develops shear anisotropies which approaches a constant value.
