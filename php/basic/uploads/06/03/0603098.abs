Title: Baryon Asymmetry, Inflation and Squeezed States
Authors: Bindu A. Bambah and K. V. S. Shiv Chaitanya and C. Mukku
Abstract: We use the general formalism of squeezed rotated states to calculate baryon asymmetry in the wake of inflation through parametric amplification. We base our analysis on a B and CP violating Lagrangian in an isotropically expanding universe. The B and CP violating terms originate from the coupling of complex fields with non-zero baryon number to a complex background inflaton field. We show that a differential amplification of particle and anti-particle modes gives rise to baryon asymmetry.
