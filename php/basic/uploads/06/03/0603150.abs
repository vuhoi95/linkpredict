Title: Higgs-Inflaton Symbiosis, Cosmological Constant Problem and  Superacceleration Phase of the Universe in Two Measures Field Theory with  Spontaneously Broken Scale Invariance
Authors: E. I. Guendelman and A. B. Kaganovich
Abstract: We study the scalar sector of the Two Measures Field Theory (TMT) model in the context of cosmological dynamics. The scalar sector includes the inflaton \phi and the Higgs \upsilon fields. The model possesses gauge and scale invariance. The latter is spontaneously broken due to intrinsic features of the TMT dynamics. In the model with the inflaton \phi alone, in different regions of the parameter space the following different effects can take place without fine tuning of the parameters and initial conditions: a) Possibility of resolution of the old cosmological constant problem: this is done in a consistent way hinted by S. Weinberg in his comment concerning the question of how one can avoid his no-go theorem. b) The power law inflation without any fine tuning may end with damped oscillations of $\phi$ around the state with zero cosmological constant. c) There are regions of the parameters where the equation-of-state w=p/\rho in the late time universe is w<-1 and w asymptotically (as t\to\infty) approaches -1 from below. This effect is achieved without any exotic term in the action. In a model with both \phi and \upsilon fields, a scenario which resembles the hybrid inflation is realized but there are essential differences, for example: the Higgs field undergos transition to a gauge symmetry broken phase <\upsilon>\neq 0 soon after the end of a power law inflation; there are two oscillatory regimes of \upsilon, one around \upsilon =0 at 50 e-folding before the end of inflation, another - during transition to a gauge symmetry broken phase where the scalar dark energy density approaches zero without fine tuning; the gauge symmetry breakdown is achieved without tachyonic mass term in the action.
