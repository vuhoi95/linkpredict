Title: New nonuniform black string solutions
Authors: Burkhard Kleihaus and Jutta Kunz and Eugen Radu
Abstract: We present nonuniform vacuum black strings in five and six spacetime dimensions. The conserved charges and the action of these solutions are computed by employing a quasilocal formalism. We find qualitative agreement of the physical properties of nonuniform black strings in five and six dimensions. Our results offer further evidence that the black hole and the black string branches merge at a topology changing transition. We generate black string solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory by using a Harrison transformation. We argue that the basic features of these solutions can be derived from those of the vacuum black string configurations.
