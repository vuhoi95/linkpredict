Title: Cosmo-dynamics and dark energy with a quadratic EoS: anisotropic models,  large-scale perturbations and cosmological singularities
Authors: Kishore N. Ananda and Marco Bruni
Abstract: In general relativity, for fluids with a linear equation of state (EoS) or scalar fields, the high isotropy of the universe requires special initial conditions, and singularities are anisotropic in general. In the brane world scenario anisotropy at the singularity is suppressed by an effective quadratic equation of state. There is no reason why the effective EoS of matter should be linear at the highest energies, and a non-linear EoS may describe dark energy or unified dark matter (Paper I, astro-ph/0512224). In view of this, here we study the effects of a quadratic EoS in homogenous and inhomogeneous cosmological models in general relativity, in order to understand if in this context the quadratic EoS can isotropize the universe at early times. With respect to Paper I, here we use the simplified EoS P=alpha rho + rho^2/rho_c, which still allows for an effective cosmological constant and phantom behavior, and is general enough to analyze the dynamics at high energies. We first study anisotropic Bianchi I and V models, focusing on singularities. Using dynamical systems methods, we find the fixed points of the system and study their stability. We find that models with standard non-phantom behavior are in general asymptotic in the past to an isotropic fixed point IS, i.e. in these models even an arbitrarily large anisotropy is suppressed in the past: the singularity is matter dominated. Using covariant and gauge invariant variables, we then study linear perturbations about the homogenous and isotropic spatially flat models with a quadratic EoS. We find that, in the large scale limit, all perturbations decay asymptotically in the past, indicating that the isotropic fixed point IS is the general asymptotic past attractor for non phantom inhomogeneous models with a quadratic EoS.
