Title: Recovering the Inflationary Potential and Primordial Power Spectrum With  a Slow Roll Prior: Methodology and Application to WMAP 3 Year Data
Authors: Hiranya Peiris and Richard Easther
Abstract: We introduce a new method for applying an inflationary prior to a cosmological dataset that includes relations between observables at arbitrary order in the slow roll expansion. The process is based on the inflationary flow equations, and the slow roll parameters appear explicitly in the cosmological parameter set. We contrast our method to other ways of imposing an inflationary prior on a cosmological dataset, and argue that this method is ideal for use with heterogeneous datasets. In particular, it would be well suited to exploiting any direct detection of fundamental tensor modes by a BBO-style mission. To demonstrate the practical use of this method we apply it to the WMAPI+All dataset, and the newly released WMAPII dataset on its own and together with the SDSS data. We find that all basic classes of single field inflationary models are still allowed at the 1-2sigma level, but the overall parameter space is sharply constrained. In particular, we find evidence that the combination of WMAPII+SDSS is sensitive to effects arising from terms that are quadratic in the two leading-order slow roll parameters.
