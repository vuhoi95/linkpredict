Title: Twist Field as Three String Interaction Vertex in Light Cone String  Field Theory
Authors: Isao Kishimoto and Sanefumi Moriyama and Shunsuke Teraguchi
Abstract: It has been suggested that matrix string theory and light-cone string field theory are closely related. In this paper, we investigate the relation between the twist field, which represents string interactions in matrix string theory, and the three-string interaction vertex in light-cone string field theory carefully. We find that the three-string interaction vertex can reproduce some of the most important OPEs satisfied by the twist field.
