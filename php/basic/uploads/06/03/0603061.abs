Title: The Extended Cartan Homotopy Formula and a Subspace Separation Method  for Chern--Simons Theory
Authors: Fernando Izaurieta and Eduardo Rodr√≠guez and Patricio Salgado
Abstract: In the context of Chern--Simons (CS) Theory, a subspace separation method for the Lagrangian is proposed. The method is based on the iterative use of the Extended Cartan Homotopy Formula, and allows one to (1) separate the action in bulk and boundary contributions, and (2) systematically split the Lagrangian in appropriate reflection of the the subspace structure of the gauge algebra. In order to apply the method, one must regard CS forms as a particular case of more general objects known as transgression forms. Five-dimensional CS Supergravity is used as an example to illustrate the method.
