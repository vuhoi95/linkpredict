Title: Higher Derivative Corrections to Non-supersymmetric Extremal Black Holes  in N=2 Supergravity
Authors: Bindusar Sahoo and Ashoke Sen
Abstract: Using the entropy function formalism we compute the entropy of extremal supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric black holes in N=2 supergravity theories in four dimensions with higher derivative corrections. For supersymmetric black holes our results agree with all previous analysis. However in some examples where the four dimensional theory is expected to arise from the dimensional reduction of a five dimensional theory, there is an apparent disagreement between our results for non-supersymmetric black holes and those obtained by using the five dimensional description. This indicates that for these theories supersymmetrization of the curvature squared term in four dimension does not produce all the terms which would come from the dimensional reduction of a five dimensional action with curvature squared terms.
