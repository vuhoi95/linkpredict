Title: Generalized Kahler Geometry from supersymmetric sigma models
Authors: Andreas Bredthauer and Ulf Lindstrom and Jonas Persson and Maxim Zabzine
Abstract: We give a physical derivation of generalized Kahler geometry. Starting from a supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model, we rederive and explain the results of Gualtieri regarding the equivalence between generalized Kahler geometry and the bi-hermitean geometry of Gates-Hull-Rocek. When cast in the language of supersymmetric sigma models, this relation maps precisely to that between the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian formalisms. We also discuss topological twist in this context.
