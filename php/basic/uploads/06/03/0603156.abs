Title: A note on gauge fixing in supergravity/Kac-Moody correspondences
Authors: Christian Hillmann and Axel Kleinschmidt and Hermann Nicolai
Abstract: We explain how to achieve the traceless gauge for the spatial part of the spin connection in the framework of the recently proposed correspondence between the (appropriately truncated) bosonic sectors of maximal supergravities and the `geodesic' sigma-model over E10/K(E10) at low levels. After making this gauge choice, the residual symmetries on both sides of this correspondence match precisely. The gauge choice also allows us to give a physical interpretation to the multiplicity of certain primitive affine null roots of E10.
