Title: Weak gravity conjecture in the asymptotical dS and AdS background
Authors: Qing-Guo Huang and Miao Li and Wei Song
Abstract: The cosmological observations provide a strong evidence that there is a positive cosmological constant in our universe and thus the spacetime is asymptotical de Sitter space. The conjecture of gravity as the weakest force in the asymptotical dS space leads to a lower bound on the U(1) gauge coupling $g$, or equivalently, the positive cosmological constant gets an upper bound $\rho_V \leq g^2 M_p^4$ in order that the U(1) gauge theory can survive in four dimensions. This result has a simple explanation in string theory, i.e. the string scale $\sqrt{\alpha '}$ should not be greater than the size of the cosmic horizon. Our proposal in string theory can be generalized to U(N) gauge theory and gives a guideline to the microscopic explanation of the de Sitter entropy. The similar results are also obtained in the asymptotical anti-de Sitter space.
