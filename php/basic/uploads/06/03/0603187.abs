Title: Self-adjoint differential operators assosiated with self-adjoint  differential expressions
Authors: B. L. Voronov and D. M. Gitman and I. V. Tyutin
Abstract: Considerable attention has been recently focused on quantum-mechanical systems with boundaries and/or singular potentials for which the construction of physical observables as self-adjoint (s.a.) operators is a nontrivial problem. We present a comparative review of various methods of specifying ordinary s.a. differential operators generated by formally s.a. differential expressions based on the general theory of s.a. extensions of symmetric operators. The exposition is untraditional and is based on the concept of asymmetry forms generated by adjoint operators. The main attention is given to a specification of s.a. extensions by s.a. boundary conditions. All the methods are illustrated by examples of quantum-mechanical observables like momentum and Hamiltonian. In addition to the conventional methods, we propose a possible alternative way of specifying s.a. differential operators by explicit s.a. boundary conditions that generally have an asymptotic form for singular boundaries. A comparative advantage of the method is that it allows avoiding an evaluation of deficient subspaces and deficiency indices. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated by a number of examples of quantum-mechanical observables.
