Authors: Payal Kaura and Aalok Misra and Pramod Shukla
Abstract: Following [1] and [2], we discuss the Picard-Fuchs equation for the super Landau-Ginsburg mirror to the super-Calabi-Yau in WCP^(3|2)[1,1,1,3|1,5], (using techniques of [3,4]) Meijer basis of solutions and monodromies (at 0,1 and \infty) in the large and small complex structure limits, as well as obtain the mirror hypersurface, which in the large Kaehler limit, turns out to be either a bidegree-(6,6) hypersurface in WCP^(3|1)[1,1,1,2] x WCP^(1|1)[1,1|6] or a (Z_2-singular) bidegree-(6,12) hypersurface in WCP^(3|1)[1,1,2,6|6] x WCP^(1|1)[1,1|6].
