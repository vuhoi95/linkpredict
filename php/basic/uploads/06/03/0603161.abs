Title: The (p,q) String Tension in a Warped Deformed Conifold
Authors: Hassan Firouzjahi and Louis Leblond and S. -H. Henry Tye
Abstract: We find the tension spectrum of the bound states of p fundamental strings and q D-strings at the bottom of a warped deformed conifold. We show that it can be obtained from a D3-brane wrapping a 2-cycle that is stabilized by both electric and magnetic fluxes. Because the F-strings are Z_M-charged with non-zero binding energy, binding can take place even if (p,q) are not coprime. Implications for cosmic strings are briefly discussed.
