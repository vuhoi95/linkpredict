Title: Running Spectral Index in Noncommutative Inflation and WMAP Three Year  Results
Authors: Qing-Guo Huang and Miao Li
Abstract: A model independent analysis shows that the running of the spectral index of the three year WMAP results can be nicely realized in noncommutative inflation. We also re-examine some concrete noncommutative inflation models. We find that a large tensor-scalar ratio is required, corresponding to a low number of e-folds before the end of inflation in some simple models.
