Title: Spontaneous breaking of Lorentz invariance, black holes and perpetuum  mobile of the 2nd kind
Authors: S. L. Dubovsky and S. M. Sibiryakov
Abstract: We study the effect of spontaneous breaking of Lorentz invariance on black hole thermodynamics. We consider a scenario where Lorentz symmetry breaking manifests itself by the difference of maximal velocities attainable by particles of different species in a preferred reference frame. The Lorentz breaking sector is represented by the ghost condensate. We find that the notions of black hole entropy and temperature loose their universal meaning. In particular, the standard derivation of the Hawking radiation yields that a black hole does emit thermal radiation in any given particle species, but with temperature depending on the maximal attainable velocity of this species. We demonstrate that this property implies violation of the second law of thermodynamics, and hence, allows construction of a perpetuum mobile of the 2nd kind. We discuss possible interpretation of these results.
