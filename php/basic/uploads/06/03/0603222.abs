Title: Stochastic Quantization of Topological Field Theory: Generalized  Langevin Equation with Memory Kernel
Authors: G. Menezes and N. F. Svaiter
Abstract: We use the method of stochastic quantization in a topological field theory defined in an Euclidean space, assuming a Langevin equation with a memory kernel. We show that our procedure for the Abelian Chern-Simons theory converges regardless of the nature of the Chern-Simons coefficient.
