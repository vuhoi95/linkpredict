Title: Lateral Casimir force beyond the Proximity Force Approximation
Authors: Robson B. Rodrigues and Paulo A. Maia Neto and Astrid Lambrecht and Serge Reynaud
Abstract: We argue that the appropriate variable to study a non trivial geometry dependence of the Casimir force is the lateral component of the Casimir force, which we evaluate between two corrugated metallic plates outside the validity of the Proximity Force Approximation (PFA). The metallic plates are described by the plasma model, with arbitrary values for the plasma wavelength, the plate separation and the corrugation period, the corrugation amplitude remaining the smallest length scale. Our analysis shows that in realistic experimental situations the Proximity Force Approximation overestimates the force by up to 30%.
