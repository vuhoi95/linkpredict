Abstract: We construct a quantum field theory in noncommutative spacetime by twisting the algebra of quantum operators (especially, creation and annihilation operators) of the corresponding quantum field theory in commutative spacetime. The twisted Fock space and S-matrix consistent with this algebra have been constructed. The resultant S-matrix is consistent with that of Filk\cite{Filk}. We find from this formulation that the spin-statistics relation is not violated in the canonical noncommutative field theories.
