Title: On the statistics of quantum expectations for systems in thermal  equilibrium
Authors: Giovanni Jona-Lasinio and Carlo Presilla
Abstract: The recent remarkable developments in quantum optics, mesoscopic and cold atom physics have given reality to wave functions. It is then interesting to explore the consequences of assuming ensembles over the wave functions simply related to the canonical density matrix. In this note we analyze a previously introduced distribution over wave functions which naturally arises considering the Schroedinger equation as an infinite dimensional dynamical system. In particular, we discuss the low temperature fluctuations of the quantum expectations of coordinates and momenta for a particle in a double well potential. Our results may be of interest in the study of chiral molecules.
