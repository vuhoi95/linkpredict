Title: On Susy Standard-like models from orbifolds of D=6 Gepner orientifolds
Authors: G. Aldazabal and E. Andres and J. E. Juknevich
Abstract: As a further elaboration of the proposal of Ref. [1] we address the construction of Standard-like models from configurations of stacks of orientifold planes and D-branes on an internal space with the structure ${(Gepner model)^{c=6} \times T^2}/Z_N$. As a first step, the construction of D=6 Type II B orientifolds on Gepner points, in the diagonal invariant case and for both, odd and even, affine levels is discussed. We build up the explicit expressions for B-type boundary states and crosscaps and obtain the amplitudes among them. From such amplitudes we read the corresponding spectra and the tadpole cancellation equations. Further compactification on a T^2 torus, by simultaneously orbifolding the Gepner and the torus internal sectors, is performed. The embedding of the orbifold action in the brane sector breaks the original gauge groups and leads to N=1 supersymmetric chiral spectra. Whenever even orbifold action on the torus is considered, new branes, with worldvolume transverse to torus coordinates, must be included. The detailed rules for obtaining the D=4 model spectra and tadpole equations are shown. As an illustration we present a 3 generations Left-Right symmetric model that can be further broken to a MSSM model.
