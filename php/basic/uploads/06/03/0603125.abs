Title: Noncommutative Instantons on CP^n
Authors: Tatiana A. Ivanova and Olaf Lechtenfeld
Abstract: We construct explicit solutions of the Hermitian Yang-Mills equations on the noncommutative space C^n_\theta. In the commutative limit they coincide with the standard instantons on CP^n written in local coordinates.
