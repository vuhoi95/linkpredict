Abstract: Bosonic formulation of the negative energy sea, so called Dirac sea, is proposed by constructing a hole theory for bosons as a new formulation of the second quantization of bosonic fields. The original idea of Dirac sea for fermions, where the vacuum state is considered as a state completely filled by fermions of negative energy and holes in the sea are identified as anti-particles, is extended to boson case in a consistent manner. The bosonic vacuum consists of a sea filled by negative energy bosonic states, while physical probabilities become always positive definite. We introduce a method of the double harmonic oscillator to formulate the hole theory of bosons. Our formulation is also applicable to supersymmetric field theory. The sea for supersymmetric theories has an explicit supersymmetry. We suggest applications of our formulations to the anomaly theories and the string theories.
