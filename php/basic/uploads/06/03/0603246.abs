Title: Axionic Inflation from Large Volume Flux Compactifications
Authors: R. Holman and Jimmy A. Hutasoit
Abstract: We find a general model of {\em single-field} inflation within the context of type IIB string theory compactified on large volume Calabi-Yau orientifolds with $h^{2,1} > h^{1,1} = 2$. The inflaton is the axion part of the complexified K\"{a}hler moduli and the resulting scalar power spectrum is red, and can easily be made compatible with WMAP3 bounds on $n_s$. This model overcomes the $\eta$-problem using gaugino condensates on wrapped D7-brane while keeping the tuning of the parameters minimal.
