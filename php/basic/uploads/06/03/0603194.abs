Title: Matter localization and resonant deconfinement in a two-sheeted  spacetime
Authors: Michael Sarrazin and Fabrice Petit
Abstract: In recent papers, a model of a two-sheeted spacetime M4XZ2 was introduced and the quantum dynamics of massive fermions was studied in this framework. In the present study, we show that the physical predictions of the model are perfectly consistent with observations and most important, it can solve the puzzling problem of the four-dimensional localization of the fermion species in multidimensional spacetimes. It is demonstrated that fermion localization on the sheets arises from the combination of the discrete bulk structure and environmental interactions. The mechanism described in this paper can be seen as an alternative to the domain wall localization arising in continuous five dimensional spacetimes. Although tightly constrained, motions between the sheets are, however, not completely prohibited. As an illustration, a resonant mechanism through which fermion oscillations between the sheets might occur is described.
