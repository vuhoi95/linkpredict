Title: Little IIB Matrix Model
Authors: Yoshihisa Kitazawa and Shun'ya Mizoguchi and Osamu Saito
Abstract: We study the zero-dimensional reduced model of D=6 pure super Yang-Mills theory and argue that the large N limit describes the (2,0) Little String Theory. The one-loop effective action shows that the force exerted between two diagonal blocks of matrices behaves as 1/r^4, implying a six-dimensional spacetime. We also observe that it is due to non-gravitational interactions. We construct wave functions and vertex operators which realize the D=6, (2,0) tensor representation. We also comment on other "little" analogues of the IIB matrix model and Matrix Theory with less supercharges.
