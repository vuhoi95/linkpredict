Title: New Regions for a Chameleon to Hide
Authors: Baruch Feldman and Ann E. Nelson
Abstract: We show that inclusion of an extremely small quartic coupling constant in the potential for a nearly massless scalar field greatly increases the experimentally allowed region for the mass term and the coupling of the field to matter.
