Title: The supersymmetric configurations of N=2, d=4 supergravity coupled to  vector supermultiplets
Authors: P. Meessen and T. Ortin
Abstract: We classify all the supersymmetric configurations of ungauged N=2,d=4 supergravity coupled to n vector multiplets and determine under which conditions they are also classical solutions of the equations of motion. The supersymmetric configurations fall into two classes, depending on the timelike or null nature of the Killing vector constructed from Killing spinor bilinears. The timelike class configurations are essentially the ones found by Behrndt, Luest and Sabra, which exhaust this class and are the ones that include supersymmetric black holes. The null class configurations include pp-waves and cosmic strings.
