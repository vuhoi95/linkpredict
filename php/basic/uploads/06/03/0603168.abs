Title: On black strings & branes in Lovelock gravity
Authors: David Kastor and Robert Mann
Abstract: It is well known that black strings and branes may be constructed in pure Einstein gravity simply by adding flat directions to a vacuum black hole solution. A similar construction holds in the presence of a cosmological constant. While these constructions fail in general Lovelock theories, we show that they carry over straightforwardly within a class of Lovelock gravity theories that have (locally) unique constant curvature vacua.
