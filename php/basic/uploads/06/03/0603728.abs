Title: J functions, non-nef toric varieties and equivariant local mirror  symmetry of curves
Authors: Brian Forbes and Masao Jinzenji
Abstract: We develop techniques for computing the equivariant local mirror symmetry of curves, i.e. mirror symmetry for O(k)+O(-2-k) over P^1 for k greater than 0. We also describe related methods for dealing with mirror symmetry of non-nef toric varieties. The basic tools are equivariant I functions and their Birkhoff factorization.
