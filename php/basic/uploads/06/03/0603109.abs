Title: Parametrizations of the Dark Energy Density and Scalar Potentials
Authors: Zong-Kuan Guo and Nobuyoshi Ohta and Yuan-Zhong Zhang
Abstract: We develop a theoretical method of constructing the scalar (quintessence or phantom) potential directly from the dimensionless dark energy function X(z), the dark energy density in units of its present value. We apply our method to two parametrizations of the dark energy density, the quiessence-Lambda ansatz and the generalized Chaplygin gas model, and discuss some features of the constructed potentials.
