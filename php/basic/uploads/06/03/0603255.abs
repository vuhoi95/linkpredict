Title: Identifying the curvaton within MSSM
Authors: Rouzbeh Allahverdi and Kari Enqvist and Asko Jokinen and Anupam Mazumdar
Abstract: We consider inflaton couplings to MSSM flat directions and the thermalization of the inflaton decay products, taking into account gauge symmetry breaking due to flat direction condensates. We then search for a suitable curvaton candidate among the flat directions, requiring an early thermally induced start for the flat direction oscillations to facilitate the necessary curvaton energy density dominance. We demonstrate that the supersymmetry breaking $A$-term is crucial for achieving a successful curvaton scenario. Among the many possible candidates, we identify the ${\bf u_1dd}$ flat direction as a viable MSSM curvaton.
