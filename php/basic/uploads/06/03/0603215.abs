Title: Matrix String Description of Cosmic Singularities in a Class of  Time-dependent Solutions
Authors: Takayuki Ishino and Nobuyoshi Ohta
Abstract: A large class of time-dependent solutions with 1/2 supersymmetry were found previously. These solutions involve cosmic singularities at early time. In this paper, we study if matrix string description of the singularities in these solutions with backgrounds is possible and present several examples where the solutions can be described well in the perturbative picture.
