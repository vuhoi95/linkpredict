Title: Tunnelling, Temperature and Taub-NUT Black Holes
Authors: Ryan Kerner and R. B. Mann
Abstract: We investigate quantum tunnelling methods for calculating black hole temperature, specifically the null geodesic method of Parikh and Wilczek and the Hamilton-Jacobi Ansatz method of Angheben et al. We consider application of these methods to a broad class of spacetimes with event horizons, inlcuding Rindler and non-static spacetimes such as Kerr-Newman and Taub-NUT. We obtain a general form for the temperature of Taub-NUT-Ads black holes that is commensurate with other methods. We examine the limitations of these methods for extremal black holes, taking the extremal Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime as a case in point.
