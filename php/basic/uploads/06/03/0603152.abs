Title: D-branes and Closed String Field Theory
Authors: Yutaka Baba and Nobuyuki Ishibashi and Koichi Murakami
Abstract: We construct BRST invariant solitonic states in the OSp invariant string field theory for closed bosonic strings. Our construction is a generalization of the one given in the noncritical case. These states are made by using the boundary states for D-branes, and can be regarded as states in which D-branes or ghost D-branes are excited. We calculate the vacuum amplitude in the presence of solitons perturbatively and show that the cylinder amplitude for the D-brane is reproduced. The results imply that these are states with even number of D-branes or ghost D-branes.
