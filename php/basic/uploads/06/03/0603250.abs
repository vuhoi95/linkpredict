Abstract: In the framework of 4D Einstein-Maxwell Dilaton-Axion theory we show how to obtain a family of both unpolarized and polarized S^1XS^2 Gowdy cosmological models endowed with nontrivial axion, dilaton and electromagnetic fields from a solitonic rotating black hole-type solution by interchanging the r and t coordinates in the region located between the horizons of the black hole configuration. We also get a family of Kantowski-Sachs cosmologies with topology R^1XS^2 from the polarized Gowdy cosmological models by decompactifying one of the compact dimensions.
