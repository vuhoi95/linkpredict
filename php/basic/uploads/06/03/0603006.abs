Title: Two-Dimensional Supersymmetry: From SUSY Quantum Mechanics to Integrable  Classical Models
Authors: M. V. Ioffe and J. Mateos Guilarte and P. A. Valinevich
Abstract: Two known 2-dim SUSY quantum mechanical constructions - the direct generalization of SUSY with first-order supercharges and Higher order SUSY with second order supercharges - are combined for a class of 2-dim quantum models, which {\it are not amenable} to separation of variables. The appropriate classical limit of quantum systems allows us to construct SUSY-extensions of original classical scalar Hamiltonians. Special emphasis is placed on the symmetry properties of the models thus obtained - the explicit expressions of quantum symmetry operators and of classical integrals of motion are given for all (scalar and matrix) components of SUSY-extensions. Using Grassmanian variables, the symmetry operators and classical integrals of motion are written in a unique form for the whole Superhamiltonian. The links of the approach to the classical Hamilton-Jacobi method for related "flipped" potentials are established.
