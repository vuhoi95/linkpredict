Title: Calogero Model(s) and Deformed Oscillators
Authors: Marijan Milekovic and Stjepan Meljanac and Andjelo Samsarov
Abstract: We briefly review some recent results concerning algebraical (oscillator) aspects of the $N$-body single-species and multispecies Calogero models in one dimension. We show how these models emerge from the matrix generalization of the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian. We make some comments on the solvability of these models.
