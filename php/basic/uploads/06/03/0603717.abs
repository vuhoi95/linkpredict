Title: Electronic properties of curved graphene sheets
Authors: Alberto Cortijo and Maria A. H. Vozmediano
Abstract: A model is proposed to study the electronic structure of slightly curved graphene sheets with an arbitrary number of pentagon-heptagon pairs and Stone-Wales defects based on a cosmological analogy. The disorder induced by curvature produces characteristic patterns in the local density of states that can be observed in scanning tunnel and transmission electron microscopy.
