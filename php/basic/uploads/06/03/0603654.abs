Title: Dynamical density-density correlations in the one-dimensional Bose gas
Authors: J. -S. Caux and P. Calabrese
Abstract: The zero-temperature dynamical structure factor of the one-dimensional Bose gas with delta-function interaction (Lieb-Liniger model) is computed using a hybrid theoretical/numerical method based on the exact Bethe Ansatz solution, which allows to interpolate continuously between the weakly-coupled Thomas-Fermi and strongly-coupled Tonks-Girardeau regimes. The results should be experimentally accessible with Bragg spectroscopy.
