Title: From N=2 supersymmetric classical to quantum mechanics and back: the  SUSY WKB approximation
Authors: M. A. Gonzalez Leon and J. Mateos Guilarte and M. de la Torre Mayado
Abstract: Links between supersymmetric classical and quantum mechanics are explored. Diagrammatic representations for \hbar-expansions of norms of ground states are provided. The WKB spectra of supersymmetric non harmonic oscillators are found.
