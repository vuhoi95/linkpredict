Title: String Gyratons in Supergravity
Authors: Valeri P. Frolov and Feng-Li Lin
Abstract: We study solutions of the supergravity equations with the string-like sources moving with the speed of light. An exact solution is obtained for the gravitational field of a boosted ring string in any dimension greater than three.
