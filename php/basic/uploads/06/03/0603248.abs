Title: Implications of Holographic QCD in ChPT with Hidden Local Symmetry
Authors: M. Harada and S. Matsuzaki and K. Yamawaki
Abstract: Based on the chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) with the hidden local symmetry, we propose a methodology to calculate the large $N_c$ corrections in the holographic QCD (HQCD). As an example, we apply the method to an HQCD model recently proposed by Sakai and Sugimoto. We show that the $\rho$-$\pi$-$\pi$ coupling becomes in good agreement with the experiment due to the $1/N_c$-subleading corrections.
