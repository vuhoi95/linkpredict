Title: String Cosmology of the D-brane Universe
Authors: Inyong Cho and Eung Jin Chun and Hang Bae Kim and Yoonbai Kim
Abstract: We analyze homogeneous anisotropic cosmology driven by the dilaton and the self-interacting ``massive'' antisymmetric tensor field which are indispensable bosonic degrees with the graviton in the NS-NS sector of string theories with D-branes. We found the attractor solutions for this system, which show the overall features of general solutions, and confirmed it through numerical analysis. The dilaton possesses the potential due to the presence of the D-brane and the curvature of extra dimensions. In the presence of the non-vanishing antisymmetric tensor field, the homogeneous universe expands anisotropically while the D-brane term dominates. The isotropy is recovered as the dilaton rolls down and the curvature term dominates. With the stabilizing potential for the dilaton, the isotropy can also be recovered.
