Title: Entropy Maximization in the Presence of Higher-Curvature Interactions
Authors: Gabriel Lopes Cardoso and Dieter Lust and Jan Perz
Abstract: Within the context of the entropic principle, we consider the entropy of supersymmetric black holes in N=2 supergravity theories in four dimensions with higher-curvature interactions, and we discuss its maximization at points in moduli space at which an excess of hypermultiplets becomes massless. We find that the gravitational coupling function F^(1) enhances the maximization at these points in moduli space. In principle, this enhancement may be modified by the contribution from higher F^(g)-couplings. We show that this is indeed the case for the resolved conifold by resorting to the non-perturbative expression for the topological free energy.
