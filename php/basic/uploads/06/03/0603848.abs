Abstract: We study the constraints that spatial topology may place on the parameters of models that account for the accelerated expansion of the universe via infrared modifications to general relativity, namely the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati braneworld model as well as the Dvali-Turner and Cardassian models. By considering the Poincar\'e dodecahedral space as the circles-in-the-sky observable spatial topology, we examine the constraints that can be placed on the parameters of each model using type Ia supernovae data together with the baryon acoustic peak in the large scale correlation function of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey of luminous red galaxies and the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation shift parameter data. We show that knowledge of spatial topology does provide relevant constraints, particularly on the curvature parameter, for all models.
