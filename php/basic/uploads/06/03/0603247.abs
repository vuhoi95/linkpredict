Title: On N=8 attractors
Authors: Sergio Ferrara and Renata Kallosh
Abstract: We derive and solve the black hole attractor conditions of N=8 supergravity by finding the critical points of the corresponding black hole potential. This is achieved by a simple generalization of the symplectic structure of the special geometry to all extended supergravities with $N>2$. There are two solutions for regular black holes, one for 1/8 BPS ones and one for the non-BPS. We discuss the solutions of the moduli at the horizon for BPS attractors using N=2 language. An interpretation of some of these results in N=2 STU black hole context helps to clarify the general features of the black hole attractors.
