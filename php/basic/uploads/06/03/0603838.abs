Title: Hubble Imaging Excludes Cosmic String Lens
Authors: Eric Agol and Craig J. Hogan and Richard M. Plotkin
Abstract: The galaxy image pair CSL-1 has been a leading candidate for a cosmic string lens. High quality imaging data from the Hubble Space Telescope presented here show that it is not a lens but a pair of galaxies. The galaxies show different orientations of their principal axes, not consistent with any lens model. We present a new direct test of the straight-string lens model, using a displaced difference of the image from itself to exclude CSL-1 at high confidence.
