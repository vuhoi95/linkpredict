Title: Counting of Black Hole Microstates
Authors: A. Ghosh and P. Mitra
Abstract: The entropy of a black hole can be obtained by counting states in loop quantum gravity. The dominant term depends on the Immirzi parameter involved in the quantization and is proportional to the area of the horizon, while there is a logarithmic correction with coefficient -1/2.
