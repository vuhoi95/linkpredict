Title: Are f(R) dark energy models cosmologically viable ?
Authors: Luca Amendola and David Polarski and Shinji Tsujikawa
Abstract: All $f(R)$ modified gravity theories are conformally identical to models of quintessence in which matter is coupled to dark energy with a strong coupling. This coupling induces a cosmological evolution radically different from standard cosmology. We find that in all $f(R)$ theories that behave as a power of $R$ at large or small $R$ (which include most of those proposed so far in the literature) the scale factor during the matter phase grows as $t^{1/2}$ instead of the standard law $t^{2/3}$. This behaviour is grossly inconsistent with cosmological observations (e.g. WMAP), thereby ruling out these models even if they pass the supernovae test and can escape the local gravity constraints.
