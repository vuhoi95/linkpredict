Title: Quantum Field Theory as Effective BV Theory from Chern-Simons
Authors: Dmitry Krotov and Andrei Losev and A. Gorodentsev
Abstract: The general procedure for obtaining explicit expressions for all cohomologies of N.Berkovits's operator is suggested. It is demonstrated that calculation of BV integral for the classical Chern-Simons-like theory (Witten's OSFT-like theory) reproduces BV version of two dimensional gauge model at the level of effective action. This model contains gauge field, scalars, fermions and some other fields. We prove that this model is an example of "singular" point from the perspective of the suggested method for cohomology evaluation. For arbitrary "regular" point the same technique results in AKSZ(Alexandrov, Kontsevich, Schwarz, Zaboronsky) version of Chern-Simons theory (BF theory) in accord with [2,3].
