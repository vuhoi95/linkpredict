Title: Gravitons Enhance Fermions during Inflation
Authors: Shun-Pei Miao and R. P. Woodard
Abstract: We solve the effective Dirac equation for massless fermions during inflation in the simplest gauge, including all one loop corrections from quantum gravity. At late times the result for a spatial plane wave behaves as if the classical solution were subjected to a time dependent field strength renormalization of Z_2(t) = 1 - \frac{17}{4 \pi} G H^2 \ln(a) + O(G^2). We show that this also follows from making the Hartree approximation, although the numerical coefficients differ.
