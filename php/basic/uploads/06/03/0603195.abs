Title: On the validity of the solution of string field theory
Authors: Ehud Fuchs and Michael Kroyter
Abstract: We analyze the realm of validity of the recently found tachyon solution of cubic string field theory. We find that the equation of motion holds in a non trivial way when this solution is contracted with itself. This calculation is needed to conclude the proof of Sen's first conjecture. We also find that the equation of motion holds when the tachyon or gauge solutions are contracted among themselves.
