Title: Exotic Low Density Fermion States in the Two Measures Field Theory:  Neutrino Dark Energy
Authors: E. I. Guendelman and A. B. Kaganovich
Abstract: We study a new field theory effect in the cosmological context in the Two Measures Field Theory (TMT). TMT is an alternative gravity and matter field theory where the gravitational interaction of fermionic matter is reduced to that of General Relativity when the energy density of the fermion matter is much larger than the dark energy density. In this case also the 5-th force problem is solved automatically. In the opposite limit, where the magnitudes of fermionic energy density and scalar field dark energy density become comparable, nonrelativistic fermions can participate in the cosmological expansion in a very unusual manner. Some of the features of such states in a toy model of the late time universe filled with homogeneous scalar field and uniformly distributed nonrelativistic neutrinos: neutrino mass increases as m ~ a^{3/2}; the neutrino gas equation-of-state approaches w=-1, i.e. neutrinos behave as a sort of dark energy; the total (scalar field + neutrino) equation-of-state also approaches w=-1; the total energy density of such universe is less than it would be in the universe filled with the scalar field alone. An analytic solution is presented. A domain structure of the dark energy seems to be possible. We speculate that decays of the CLEP state neutrinos may be both an origin of cosmic rays and responsible for a late super-acceleration of the universe. In this sense the CLEP states exhibit simultaneously new physics at very low densities and for very high particle masses.
