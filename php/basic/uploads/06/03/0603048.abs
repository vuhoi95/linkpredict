Title: Quaternion-Kahler spaces, hyperkahler cones, and the c-map
Authors: Martin Rocek and Cumrun Vafa and Stefan Vandoren
Abstract: Under the action of the c-map, special Kahler manifolds are mapped into a class of quaternion-Kahler spaces. We explicitly construct the corresponding Swann bundle or hyperkahler cone, and determine the hyperkahler potential in terms of the prepotential of the special Kahler geometry.
