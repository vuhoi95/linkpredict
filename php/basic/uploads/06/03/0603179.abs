Title: Supertubes in Field Theories
Authors: Seok Kim and Ki-Myeong Lee and Ho-Ung Yee
Abstract: To a domain wall or string object, Noether charge and topological spatial objects can be attracted, forming a composite BPS (Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield) object. We consider two field theories and derive a new BPS bound on composite linear solitons involving multiple charges. Among the BPS objects `supertubes' appear when the wall or string tension is canceled by the bound energy, and could take an arbitrary closed curve. In our theories, supertubes manifest as Chern-Simons solitons, dyonic instantons, charged semi-local vortices, and dyonic instantons on vortex flux sheet.
