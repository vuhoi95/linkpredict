Title: Generic weak isolated horizons
Authors: Ayan Chatterjee and Amit Ghosh
Abstract: Weak isolated horizon boundary conditions have been relaxed supposedly to their weakest form such that both zeroth and the first law of black hole mechanics still emerge, thus making the formulation more amenable for applications in both analytic and numerical Relativity. As an additional gain it explicitly brings the non-extremal and extremal black holes at the same footing.
