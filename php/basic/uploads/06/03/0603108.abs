Title: Gauge Theories at Resolved and Deformed Singularities using Dimers
Authors: Inaki Garcia-Etxebarria and Fouad Saad and Angel M. Uranga
Abstract: The gauge theory on a set of D3-branes at a toric Calabi-Yau singularity can be encoded in a tiling of the 2-torus denoted dimer diagram (or brane tiling). We use these techniques to describe the effect on the gauge theory of geometric operations partially smoothing the singularity at which D3-branes sit, namely partial resolutions and complex deformations. More specifically, we describe the effect of arbitrary partial resolutions, including those which split the original singularity into two separated. The gauge theory correspondingly splits into two sectors (associated to branes in either singularity) decoupled at the level of massless states. We also describe the effect of complex deformations, associated to geometric transitions triggered by the presence of fractional branes with confinement in their infrared. We provide tools to easily obtain the remaining gauge theory after such partial confinement.
