Title: Gravitational magnetic monopoles and Majumdar-Papapetrou stars
Authors: Jose' P. S. Lemos and Vilson T. Zanchin
Abstract: A large amount of work has been dedicated to studying general relativity coupled to non-Abelian Yang-Mills type theories. It has been shown that the magnetic monopole, a solution of the Yang-Mills-Higgs equations can be coupled to gravitation. For a low Higgs mass there are regular solutions, and for a sufficiently massive monopole the system develops an extremal magnetic Reissner-Nordstrom quasi-horizon. These solutions, called quasi-black holes, although non-singular, are arbitrarily close to having a horizon. However, at the critical value the quasi-black hole turns into a degenerate spacetime. On the other hand, for a high Higgs mass, a sufficiently massive monopole develops also a quasi-black hole, but it turns into an extremal true horizon, with matter fields outside. One can also put a small Schwarzschild black hole inside the magnetic monopole, an example of a non-Abelian black hole. Surprisingly, Majumdar-Papapetrou systems, Abelian systems constructed from extremal dust, also show a resembling behavior. Previously, we have reported that one can find Majumdar-Papapetrou solutions which can be arbitrarily close of being a black hole, displaying quasi-black hole behavior. With the aim of better understanding the similarities between gravitational monopoles and Majumdar-Papapetrou systems, we study a system composed of two extremal electrically charged spherical shells (or stars, generically) in the Einstein--Maxwell--Majumdar-Papapetrou theory. We review the gravitational properties of the monopoles, and compare with the properties of the double extremal electric shell system. These quasi-black holes can help in the understanding of true black holes, and can give insight into the nature of the entropy of black holes in the form of entanglement.
