Title: q-Deformed Bi-Local Fields II
Authors: Haruki Toyoda and Shigefumi Naka
Abstract: We study a way of $q$-deformation of the bi-local system, the two particle system bounded by a relativistic harmonic oscillator type of potential, from both points of view of mass spectra and the behavior of scattering amplitudes. In our formulation, the deformation is done so that $P^2$, the square of center of mass momentum, enters into the deformation parameters of relative coordinates. As a result, the wave equation of the bi-local system becomes nonlinear with respect to $P^2$; then, the propagator of the bi-local system suffers significant change so as to get a convergent self energy to the second order. The study is also made on the covariant $q$-deformation in four dimensional spacetime.
