Title: Mirror symmetry formulae for the elliptic genus of complete  intersections
Authors: Vassily Gorbounov and Serge Ochanine
Abstract: In this paper we calculate the elliptic genus of certain complete intersections in products of projective spaces. We show that it is equal to the elliptic genus of the Landau-Ginzburg models that are, according to Hori and Vafa, mirror partners of these complete intersections. This provides additional evidence of the validity of their construction.
