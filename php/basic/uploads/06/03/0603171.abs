Title: Scalar perturbations and the possible self-destruction of the phantom  menace
Authors: J. C. Fabris and S. V. B. Goncalves
Abstract: Some analysis of the supernovae type Ia observational data seems to indicate that the Universe today is dominated by a phantom field, for which all energy conditions are violated. Such phantom field may imply a singularity in a future finite time, called big rip. Studying the evolution of scalar perturbations for such a field, we show that if the pressure is negative enough, the Universe can become highly inhomogeneous and this phantom menace may be avoided.
