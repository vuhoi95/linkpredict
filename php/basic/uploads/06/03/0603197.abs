Title: Mass and Thermodynamics of Kaluza-Klein Black Holes with Squashed  Horizons
Authors: Rong-Gen Cai and Li-Ming Cao and Nobuyoshi Ohta
Abstract: Recently a five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein black hole solution with squashed horizon has been found in hep-th/0510094. The black hole spacetime is asymptotically locally flat and has a spatial infinity $S^1 \hookrightarrow S^{2}$. By using "boundary counterterm" method and generalized Abbott-Deser method, we calculate the mass of this black hole. When an appropriate background is chosen, the generalized Abbott-Deser method gives the same mass as the "boundary counterterm" method. The mass is found to satisfy the first law of black hole thermodynamics. The thermodynamic properties of the Kaluza-Klein black hole are discussed and are compared to those of its undeformed counterpart, a five-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole.
