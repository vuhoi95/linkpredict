Title: On the Foundations of the Two Measures Field Theory
Authors: E. I. Guendelman and A. B. Kaganovich
Abstract: Two Measures Field Theory (TMT) uses both the Riemannian volume element \sqrt{-g}d^4x and a new one \Phi d^4x where the new measure of integration \Phi can be build of four scalar fields. Arguments in favor of TMT, both from the point of view of first principles and from the TMT results are summarized. Possible origin of the TMT and symmetries that protect the structure of TMT are reviewed. It appears that four measure scalar fields treated as "physical coordinates" allow to define local observables in quantum gravity. The resolution of the old cosmological constant problem as a possible direct consequence of the TMT structure is discussed. Other applications of TMT to cosmology and particle physics are also mentioned.
