Title: New boundary conditions for the c=-2 ghost system
Authors: Thomas Creutzig and Thomas Quella and Volker Schomerus
Abstract: We investigate a novel boundary condition for the bc system with central charge c=-2. Its boundary state is constructed and tested in detail. It appears to give rise to the first example of a local logarithmic boundary sector within a bulk theory whose Virasoro zero modes are diagonalizable.
