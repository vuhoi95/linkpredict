Title: Dual fields and E_{11}
Authors: Fabio Riccioni and Peter West
Abstract: We show that the adjoint representation of E_{11} contains generators corresponding to the infinite possible dual descriptions of the bosonic on-shell degrees of freedom of eleven dimensional supergravity. We also give an interpretation for the fields corresponding to many of the other generators in the adjoint representation.
