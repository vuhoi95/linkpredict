Title: Moduli Space of Torsional Manifolds
Authors: Melanie Becker and Li-Sheng Tseng and Shing-Tung Yau
Abstract: We characterize the geometric moduli of non-Kaehler manifolds with torsion. Heterotic supersymmetric flux compactifications require that the six-dimensional internal manifold be balanced, the gauge bundle be hermitian Yang-Mills, and also the anomaly cancellation be satisfied. We perform the linearized variation of these constraints to derive the defining equations for the local moduli. We explicitly determine the metric deformations of the smooth flux solution corresponding to a torus bundle over K3.
