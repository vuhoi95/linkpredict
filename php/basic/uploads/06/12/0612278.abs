Title: Quantum Moduli Space of the Cascading Sp(p+M) x Sp(p) Gauge Theory
Authors: Fumikazu Koyama and Futoshi Yagi
Abstract: We extend the detailed analysis of the quantum moduli space of the cascading SU(p+M) x SU(p) gauge theory in the recent paper of Dymarsky, Klebanov, and Seiberg for the Sp(p+M) x Sp(p) cascading gauge theory, which lives on the world volume of p D3-branes and M fractional D3-branes at the tip of the orientifolded conifold. As in their paper, we also find in this case that the ratio of the deformation parameters of the quantum constraint on the different branches in the gauge theory can be reproduced by the ratio of the deformation parameters of the conifold with different numbers of mobile D3-branes.
