Title: Weyl-Wigner-Moyal Formalism for Fermi Classical Systems
Authors: I. Galaviz and H. Garcia-Compean and M. Przanowski and F. J. Turrubiates
Abstract: The Weyl-Wigner-Moyal formalism of fermionic classical systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom is considered. This correspondence is studied by computing the relevant Stratonovich-Weyl quantizer. The Moyal $\star$-product, Wigner functions and normal ordering are obtained for generic fermionic systems. Finally, this formalism is used to perform the deformation quantization of the Fermi oscillator and the supersymmetric quantum mechanics.
