Title: Rotor Spectra, Berry Phases, and Monopole Fields: from Antiferromagnets  to QCD
Authors: S. Chandrasekharan and F. -J. Jiang and M. Pepe and U. -J. Wiese
Abstract: The order parameter of a finite system with a spontaneously broken continuous global symmetry acts as a quantum mechanical rotor. Both antiferromagnets with a spontaneously broken $SU(2)_s$ spin symmetry and massless QCD with a broken $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ chiral symmetry have rotor spectra when considered in a finite volume. When an electron or hole is doped into an antiferromagnet or when a nucleon is propagating through the QCD vacuum, a Berry phase arises from a monopole field and the angular momentum of the rotor is quantized in half-integer units.
