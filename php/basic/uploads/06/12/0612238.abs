Title: Euclidean solutions of Yang-Mills-dilaton theory
Authors: Y. Brihaye and G. Lavrelashvili
Abstract: Classical solutions of the Yang-Mills-dilaton theory in Euclidean space-time are investigated. Our analytical and numerical results imply existence of infinite number of branches of dyonic type solutions labelled by the number of nodes of gauge field amplitude $W$. We find that the branches of solutions exist in finite region of parameter space and discuss this issue in detail in different dilaton field normalization.
