Title: Lorentz-covariant deformed algebra with minimal length
Authors: C. Quesne and V. M. Tkachuk
Abstract: The $D$-dimensional two-parameter deformed algebra with minimal length introduced by Kempf is generalized to a Lorentz-covariant algebra describing a ($D+1$)-dimensional quantized space-time. For D=3, it includes Snyder algebra as a special case. The deformed Poincar\'e transformations leaving the algebra invariant are identified. Uncertainty relations are studied. In the case of D=1 and one nonvanishing parameter, the bound-state energy spectrum and wavefunctions of the Dirac oscillator are exactly obtained.
