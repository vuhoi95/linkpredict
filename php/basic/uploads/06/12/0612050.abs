Title: Casimir bag energy in the stochastic approximation to the pure QCD  vacuum
Authors: C. D. Fosco and L. E. Oxman
Abstract: We study the Casimir contribution to the bag energy coming from gluon field fluctuations, within the context of the stochastic vacuum model (SVM) of pure QCD. After formulating the problem in terms of the generating functional of field strength cumulants, we argue that the resulting predictions about the Casimir energy are compatible with the phenomenologically required bag energy term.
