Title: Post-Newtonian expansion for Gauss-Bonnet Gravity
Authors: Thomas P. Sotiriou and Enrico Barausse
Abstract: The Parametrized Post-Newtonian expansion of gravitational theories with a scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant is performed and confrontation of such theories with Solar system experiments is discussed.
