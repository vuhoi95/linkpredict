Abstract: It is proved that the Laurent expansion of the following Gauss hypergeometric functions, 2F1(I1+a*epsilon, I2+b*ep; I3+c*epsilon;z), 2F1(I1+a*epsilon, I2+b*epsilon;I3+1/2+c*epsilon;z), 2F1(I1+1/2+a*epsilon, I2+b*epsilon; I3+c*epsilon;z), 2F1(I1+1/2+a*epsilon, I2+b*epsilon; I3+1/2+c*epsilon;z), 2F1(I1+1/2+a*epsilon,I2+1/2+b*epsilon; I3+1/2+c*epsilon;z), where I1,I2,I3 are an arbitrary integer nonnegative numbers, a,b,c are an arbitrary numbers and epsilon is an arbitrary small parameters, are expressible in terms of the harmonic polylogarithms of Remiddi and Vermaseren with polynomial coefficients. An efficient algorithm for the calculation of the higher-order coefficients of Laurent expansion is constructed. Some particular cases of Gauss hypergeometric functions are also discussed.
