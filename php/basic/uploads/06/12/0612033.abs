Title: Surface Geometry of 5D Black Holes and Black Rings
Authors: Valeri P. Frolov and Rituparno Goswami
Abstract: We discuss geometrical properties of the horizon surface of five-dimensional rotating black holes and black rings. Geometrical invariants characterizing these 3D geometries are calculated. We obtain a global embedding of the 5D rotating black horizon surface into a flat space. We also describe the Kaluza-Klein reduction of the black ring solution (along the direction of its rotation) which relates this solution to the 4D metric of a static black hole distorted by the presence of external scalar (dilaton) and vector (`electromagnetic') field. The properties of the reduced black hole horizon and its embedding in $\E^3$ are briefly discussed.
