Title: Hawking Radiation from General Kerr-(anti)de Sitter Black Holes
Authors: Zhibo Xu and Bin Chen
Abstract: We calculate the total flux of Hawking radiation from Kerr-(anti)de Sitter black holes by using gravitational anomaly method developed in gr-qc/0502074. We consider the general Kerr-(anti)de Sitter black holes in arbitrary $D$ dimensions with the maximal number [D/2] of independent rotating parameters. We find that the physics near the horizon can be described by an infinite collection of $(1+1)$-dimensional quantum fields coupled to a set of gauge fields with charges proportional to the azimuthal angular momentums $m_i$. With the requirement of anomaly cancellation and regularity at the horizon, the Hawking radiation is determined.
