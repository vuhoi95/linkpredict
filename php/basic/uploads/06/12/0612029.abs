Title: Supersymmetric transformations for coupled channels with threshold  differences
Authors: Boris F Samsonov and Jean-Marc Sparenberg and Daniel Baye
Abstract: The asymptotic behaviour of the superpotential of general SUSY transformations for a coupled-channel Hamiltonian with different thresholds is analyzed. It is shown that asymptotically the superpotential can tend to a diagonal matrix with an arbitrary number of positive and negative entries depending on the choice of the factorization solution. The transformation of the Jost matrix is generalized to "non-conservative" SUSY transformations introduced in Sparenberg et al (2006 J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 39 L639). Applied to the zero initial potential the method permits to construct superpartners with a nontrivially coupled Jost-matrix. Illustrations are given for two- and three-channel cases.
