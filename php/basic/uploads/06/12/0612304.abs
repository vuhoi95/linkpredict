Title: Ising Spectroscopy I: Mesons at T < T_c
Authors: Pedro Fonseca and Alexander Zamolodchikov
Abstract: This paper is our progress report on the project "Ising spectroscopy", devoted to systematic study of the mass spectrum of particles in 2D Ising Field Theory in a magnetic field. Here we address the low-temperature regime, and develop quantitative approach based on the idea (originally due to McCoy and Wu) of particles being the "mesons", consisting predominantly of two quarks confined by a long-range force. Systematic implementation of this idea leads to a version of the Bethe-Salpeter equation, which yields infinite sequence of meson masses. The Bethe-Salpeter spectrum becomes exact in the limit when the magnetic field is small, and we develop the corresponding weak-coupling expansions of the meson masses. The Bethe-Salpeter equation ignores the contributions from the multi-quark components of the meson's states, but we discuss how it can be improved by treating these components perturbatively, and in particular by incorporating the radiative corrections to the quark mass and the coupling parameter (the "string tension"). The approach fails to properly treat the mesons above the stability threshold, where they are expected to become resonance states, but it is shown to yield very good approximation for the masses of all stable particles, at all real values of the IFT parameters in the low-temperature regime. We briefly discuss how the Bethe-Salpeter approximation can be used to address the case of complex parameters, which was the main motivation of this work.
