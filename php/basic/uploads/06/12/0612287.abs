Abstract: The SW map problem is formulated and solved in the BRST cohomological approach. The well known ambiguities of the SW map are shown to be associated to distinct cohomological classes. This analysis is applied to the noncommutative Chern-Simons action resulting in the emergence of $\theta$-dependent terms in the commutative action which come from the nontrivial ambiguities. It is also shown how a specific cohomological class can be choosen in order to map the noncommutative Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory into the commutative one.
