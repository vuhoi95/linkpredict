Title: Deformation of N=4 Super Yang-Mills Theory in Graviphoton Background
Authors: Katsushi Ito and Yoshishige Kobayashi and Shin Sasaki
Abstract: We study deformation of N=4 super Yang-Mills theory from type IIB superstrings with D3-branes in the constant R-R background. We compute disk amplitudes with one graviphoton vertex operator and investigate the zero-slope limit of the amplitudes. We obtain the effective action deformed by the graviphoton background, which contains the one defined in non(anti)commutative N=1 superspace as special case. The bosonic part of the Lagrangian gives the Chern-Simons term coupled with the R-R potential. We study the vacuum configuration of the deformed Lagrangian and find the fuzzy sphere configuration for scalar fields.
