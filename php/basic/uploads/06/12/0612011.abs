Title: Spectrum of CHL Dyons from Genus-Two Partition Function
Authors: Atish Dabholkar and Davide Gaiotto
Abstract: We compute the genus-two chiral partition function of the left-moving heterotic string for a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ CHL orbifold. The required twisted determinants can be evaluated explicitly in terms of the untwisted determinants and theta functions using orbifold techniques. The dependence on Prym periods cancels neatly once summation over odd charges is properly taken into account. The resulting partition function is a Siegel modular form of level two and precisely equals recently proposed dyon partition function for this model. This result provides an independent weak coupling derivation of the dyon partition function using the M-theory lift of string webs representing the dyons. We discuss generalization of this technique to general $\mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifolds.
