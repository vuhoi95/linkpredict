Title: Variational Methods in AdS/CFT
Authors: T. Andrade and M. Banados and F. Rojas
Abstract: We prove that the AdS/CFT calculation of 1-point functions can be drastically simplified by using variational arguments. We give a simple universal proof, valid for any theory that can be derived from a Lagrangian, that the large radius divergencies in 1-point functions can always be renormalized away (at least in the semiclassical approximation). The renormalized 1-point functions then follow by a simple variational problem involving only finite quantities. Several examples, a massive scalar, gravity, and renormalization flows, are discussed. Our results are general and can thus be used for dualities beyond AdS/CFT.
