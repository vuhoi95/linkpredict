Title: Conformal Gravity from AdS/CFT mechanism
Authors: Rodrigo Aros and Mauricio Romo and Nelson Zamorano
Abstract: We explicitly calculate the induced gravity theory at the boundary of an asymptotically Anti-de Sitter five dimensional Einstein gravity. We also display the action that encodes the dynamics of radial diffeomorphisms. It is found that the induced theory is a four dimensional conformal gravity plus a scalar field. This calculation confirms some previous results found by a different approach.
