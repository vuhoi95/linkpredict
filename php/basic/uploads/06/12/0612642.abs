Title: Reconstructing generalized ghost condensate model with dynamical dark  energy parametrizations and observational datasets
Authors: Jingfei Zhang and Xin Zhang and Hongya Liu
Abstract: Observations of high-redshift supernovae indicate that the universe is accelerating at the present stage, and we refer to the cause for this cosmic acceleration as ``dark energy''. In particular, the analysis of current data of type Ia supernovae (SNIa), cosmic large-scale structure (LSS), and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy implies that, with some possibility, the equation-of-state parameter of dark energy may cross the cosmological-constant boundary ($w=-1$) during the recent evolution stage. The model of ``quintom'' has been proposed to describe this $w=-1$ crossing behavior for dark energy. As a single-real-scalar-field model of dark energy, the generalized ghost condensate model provides us with a successful mechanism for realizing the quintom-like behavior. In this paper, we reconstruct the generalized ghost condensate model in the light of three forms of parametrization for dynamical dark energy, with the best-fit results of up-to-date observational data.
