Title: Deformation quantization of noncommutative quantum mechanics and  dissipation
Authors: C. Bastos and O. Bertolami and N. C. Dias and J. N. Prata
Abstract: We review the main features of the Weyl-Wigner formulation of noncommutative quantum mechanics. In particular, we present a $\star$-product and a Moyal bracket suitable for this theory as well as the concept of noncommutative Wigner function. The properties of these quasi-distributions are discussed as well as their relation to the sets of ordinary Wigner functions and positive Liouville probability densities. Based on these notions we propose criteria for assessing whether a commutative regime has emerged in the realm of noncommutative quantum mechanics. To induce this noncommutative-commutative transition, we couple a particle to an external bath of oscillators. The master equation for the Brownian particle is deduced.
