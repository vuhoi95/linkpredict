Authors: Z. G. Huang and Q. Q. Sun and W. Fang and H. Q. Lu
Abstract: In this paper, we regard dilaton in Weyl-scaled induced gravitational theory as coupled Quintessence, which is called DCQ model by us. Parametrization of the dark energy model is a good method by which we can construct the scalar potential directly from the effective equation of state function $\omega_\sigma(z)$ describing the properties of the dark energy. Applying this method to the DCQ model, we consider four parametrizations of $\omega(z)$ and investigate the features of the constructed DCQ potentials, which possess two different evolutive behaviors called "O" mode and "E" mode. Lastly, we comprise the results of the constructed DCQ model with those of quintessence model numerically.
