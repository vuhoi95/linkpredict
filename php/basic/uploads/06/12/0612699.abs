Title: The Eight Vertex Model.New results
Authors: Klaus Fabricius and Barry M. McCoy
Abstract: Whereas the tools to determine the eigenvalues of the eight-vertex transfer matrix T are well known there has been until recently incomplete knowledge about the eigenvectors of T. We describe the construction of eigenvectors of T corresponding to degenerate eigenvalues and discuss the related hidden elliptic symmetry.
