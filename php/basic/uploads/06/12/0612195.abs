Title: Measures on transitions for cosmology from eternal inflation
Authors: Anthony Aguirre and Steven Gratton and Matthew C Johnson
Abstract: We argue that in the context of eternal inflation in the landscape, making predictions for cosmological -- and possibly particle physics -- observables requires a measure on the possible cosmological histories as opposed to one on the vacua themselves. If significant slow-roll inflation occurs, the observables are generally determined by the history after the last transition between metastable vacua. Hence we start from several existing measures for counting vacua and develop measures for counting the transitions between vacua.
