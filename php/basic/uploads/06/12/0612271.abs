Title: Dilaton and axion bremsstrahlung from collisions of cosmic  (super)strings
Authors: E. Yu. Melkumova and D. V. Gal'tsov and K. Salehi
Abstract: We calculate dilaton and axion radiation generated in the collision of two straight initially unexcited strings and give a rough cosmological estimate of dilaton and axion densities produced via this mechanism in the early universe.
