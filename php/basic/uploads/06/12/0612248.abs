Title: N=4 SUSY Yang--Mills: three loops made simple(r)
Authors: Yu. L. Dokshitzer and G. Marchesini
Abstract: We construct universal parton evolution equation that produces space- and time-like anomalous dimensions for the maximally super-symmetric N=4 Yang--Mills field theory model, and find that its kernel satisfies the Gribov--Lipatov reciprocity relation in three loops. Given a simple structure of the evolution kernel, this should help to generate the major part of multi-loop contributions to QCD anomalous dimensions, due to classical soft gluon radiation effects.
