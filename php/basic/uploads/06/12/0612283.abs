Title: Flux-induced isometry gauging in heterotic strings
Authors: Wu-yen Chuang and Peng Gao
Abstract: We study the effect of flux-induced isometry gauging of the scalar manifold in N=2 heterotic string compactification with gauge fluxes. We show that a vanishing theorem by Witten provides the protection mechanism. The other ungauged isometries in hyper moduli space could also be protected, depending on the gauge bundle structure. We also discuss the related issue in IIB setting
