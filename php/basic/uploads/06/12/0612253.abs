Title: Supersymmetric AdS_3, AdS_2 and Bubble Solutions
Authors: Jerome P. Gauntlett and Nakwoo Kim and Daniel Waldram
Abstract: We present new supersymmetric AdS_3 solutions of type IIB supergravity and AdS_2 solutions of D=11 supergravity. The former are dual to conformal field theories in two dimensions with N=(0,2) supersymmetry while the latter are dual to conformal quantum mechanics with two supercharges. Our construction also includes AdS_2 solutions of D=11 supergravity that have non-compact internal spaces which are dual to three-dimensional N=2 superconformal field theories coupled to point-like defects. We also present some new bubble-type solutions, corresponding to BPS states in conformal theories, that preserve four supersymmetries.
