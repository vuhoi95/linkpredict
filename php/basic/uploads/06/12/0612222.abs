Title: The world next door - Results in landscape topography
Authors: Ulf H. Danielsson and Niklas Johansson and Magdalena Larfors
Abstract: Recently, it has become clear that neighboring multiple vacua might have interesting consequences for the physics of the early universe. In this paper we investigate the topography of the string landscape corresponding to complex structure moduli of flux compactified type IIB string theory. We find that series of continuously connected vacua are common. The properties of these series are described, and we relate the existence of infinite series of minima to certain unresolved mathematical problems in group theory. Numerical studies of the mirror quintic serve as illustrating examples.
