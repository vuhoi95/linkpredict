Title: Symmetry Breaking In Twisted Eguchi-Kawai Models
Authors: Michael Teper and Helvio Vairinhos
Abstract: We present numerical evidence for the spontaneous breaking of the centre symmetry of four-dimensional twisted Eguchi-Kawai models with SU(N) gauge group and symmetric twist, for sufficiently large N. We find that for N greater or equal than 100 this occurs for a wide range of bare couplings. Moreover for N less or equal than 144, where we have been able to perform detailed calculations, there is no window of couplings where the physically interesting confined and deconfined phases appear in the reduced model. We provide a possible interpretation for this in terms of generalised 'fluxon' configurations. We discuss the implications of our findings for the validity and utility of space-time reduced models as N goes to infinity.
