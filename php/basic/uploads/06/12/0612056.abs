Title: Chain Inflation via Rapid Tunneling in the Landscape
Authors: Katherine Freese and James T. Liu and Douglas Spolyar
Abstract: Chain inflation takes place in the string theory landscape as the universe tunnels rapidly through a series of ever lower energy vacua such as may be characterized by quantized changes in four form fluxes. The string landscape may be well suited to an early period of rapid tunneling, as required by chain inflation, followed by a later period of slow tunneling, such as may be required to explain today's dark energy and small cosmological constant. Each tunneling event (which can alternatively be thought of as a nucleation of branes) provides a fraction of an e-folding of inflation, so that hundreds of tunneling events provide the requisite amount of inflation. A specific example from M-theory compactification on manifolds with non-trivial three-cycles is presented.
