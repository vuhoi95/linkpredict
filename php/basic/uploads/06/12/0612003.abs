Title: R-Matrix and Baxter Q-Operators for the Noncompact SL(N,C) Invariant  Spin Chain
Authors: Sergey E. Derkachov and Alexander N. Manashov
Abstract: The problem of constructing the $SL(N,\mathbb{C})$ invariant solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation is considered. The solutions ($\mathcal{R}$-operators) for arbitrarily principal series representations of $SL(N,\mathbb{C})$ are obtained in an explicit form. We construct the commutative family of the operators $\mathcal{Q}_k(u)$ which can be identified with the Baxter operators for the noncompact $SL(N,\mathbb{C})$ spin magnet.
