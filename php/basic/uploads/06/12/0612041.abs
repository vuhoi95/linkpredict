Title: Are Vortex Numbers Preserved?
Authors: Yoshiaki Maeda and Akifumi Sako
Abstract: We study noncommutative vortex solutions that minimize the action functional of the Abelian Higgs model in 2-dimensional noncommutative Euclidean space. We first consider vortex solutions which are deformed from solutions defined on commutative Euclidean space to the noncommutative one. We construct solutions whose vortex numbers are unchanged under the noncommutative deformation. Another class of noncommutative vortex solutions via a Fock space representation is also studied.
