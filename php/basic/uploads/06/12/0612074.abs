Title: Is Strong Gravitational Radiation predicted by TeV-Gravity?
Authors: A. Mironov and A. Morozov
Abstract: In TeV-gravity models the gravitational coupling to particles with energies E\sim m_{Pl} \sim 10 TeV is not suppressed by powers of ultra-small ratio E/M_{Pl} with M_{Pl} \sim 10^{19} GeV. Therefore one could imagine strong synchrotron radiation of gravitons by the accelerating particles to become the most pronounced manifestation of TeV-gravity at LHC. However, this turns out to be not true: considerable damping continues to exist, only the place of E/M_{Pl} it taken by a power of a ratio \theta\omega/E, where the typical frequency \omega of emitted radiation, while increased by a number of \gamma-factors, can not reach E/\vartheta unless particles are accelerated by nearly critical fields. Moreover, for currently available magnetic fields B \sim 10 Tesla, multi-dimensionality does not enhance gravitational radiation at all even if TeV-gravity is correct.
