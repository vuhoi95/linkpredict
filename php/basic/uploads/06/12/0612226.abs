Title: Spherically expanding matter in AdS/CFT
Authors: K. Kajantie and T. Tahkokallio
Abstract: We discuss an exact time dependent O(3) symmetric solution with a horizon of the 5d AdS classical gravity equations searching for a 4d boundary theory which would correspond to expanding gauge theory matter. The boundary energy-momentum tensor and entropy density are computed. The boundary metric is the flat Friedmann one and any time dependence on the boundary is incompatible with Minkowski metric. However, at large times when curvature effects are negligible, perfect fluid behavior arises in a natural way.
