Title: Solitons in the duality-based matrix model
Authors: V. Bardek and S. Meljanac
Abstract: We analyze soliton solutions in the duality-based matrix model. There are two types of solution, a one soliton-antisoliton solution (with the constant boundary condition at infinity) and a periodic solution with an infinite number of solitons. It is shown that there is no finite number $ (n > 1) $ of solitons at finite distances in the limit when the length of the box tends to infinity. Particularly, there is no finite number of $ \delta - $ function solitons in the singular limit.
