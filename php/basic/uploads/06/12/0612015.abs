Title: Causality Constrains Higher Curvature Corrections to Gravity
Authors: A. Gruzinov and M. Kleban
Abstract: We show that causality constrains the sign of quartic Riemann corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action. Our constraint constitutes a restriction on candidate theories of quantum gravity.
