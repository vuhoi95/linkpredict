Title: Unquenched Flavors in the Klebanov-Witten Model
Authors: Francesco Benini and Felipe Canoura and Stefano Cremonesi and Carlos Nunez and Alfonso V. Ramallo
Abstract: Using AdS/CFT, we study the addition of an arbitrary number of backreacting flavors to the Klebanov-Witten theory, making many checks of consistency between our new Type IIB plus branes solution and expectations from field theory. We study generalizations of our method for adding flavors to all N=1 SCFTs that can be realized on D3-branes at the tip of a Calabi-Yau cone. Also, general guidelines suitable for the addition of massive flavor branes are developed.
