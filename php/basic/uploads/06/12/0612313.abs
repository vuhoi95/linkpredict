Title: Baryogenesis in Brans-Dicke theory
Authors: Sietse van der Post and Tomislav Prokopec
Abstract: A new mechanism for baryogenesis is proposed in the context of an extended Brans-Dicke (BD) theory. We generalize the BD scalar to complex field with CP violating coupling to curvature and show that the charged BD current can be enhanced during inflationary epoch. After inflation the current decays (via tree level interactions) into the standard model particles. When the BD scalar is charged under baryon and/or lepton number, the decay produces a net baryon number. Rather generically a sufficiently large scalar current can be produced during inflation to account for the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe. Our baryogensis scenario can in an elegant way be incorporated into a model of extended inflation.
