Title: Vacuum energy and spectral function sum rules
Authors: A. Y. Kamenshchik and A. Tronconi and G. P. Vacca and G. Venturi
Abstract: We reformulate the problem of the cancellation of the ultraviolet divergencies of the vacuum energy, particularly important at the cosmological level, in terms of a saturation of spectral function sum rules which leads to a set of conditions on the spectrum of the fundamental theory. We specialize the approach to both Minkowski and de Sitter space-times and investigate some examples.
