Title: A Renormalisation group for TCSA
Authors: Giovanni Feverati and Kevin Graham and Paul A. Pearce and Gabor Zs. Toth and Gerard Watts
Abstract: We discuss the errors introduced by level truncation in the study of boundary renormalisation group flows by the Truncated Conformal Space Approach. We show that the TCSA results can have the qualitative form of a sequence of RG flows between different conformal boundary conditions. In the case of a perturbation by the field phi(13), we propose a renormalisation group equation for the coupling constant which predicts a fixed point at a finite value of the TCSA coupling constant and we compare the predictions with data obtained using TBA equations.
