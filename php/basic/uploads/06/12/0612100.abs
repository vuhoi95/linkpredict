Title: Hidden sector renormalization of MSSM scalar masses
Authors: Andrew G. Cohen and Tuhin S. Roy and Martin Schmaltz
Abstract: Running of gauge couplings in the MSSM from a unified value at high energies leads to a successful prediction of the weak mixing angle. Supersymmetric models at the TeV scale may contain further hints of high scale physics, such as the pattern of superpartner masses when evolved from the TeV scale to a high scale using the renormalization group. This running is traditionally assumed to be independent of effects in the hidden sector. In this paper we re-examine this assumption, and conclude that the predictions for scalar masses may depend sensitively on the details of the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking. We identify mass relations that persist even when such effects are taken into account.
