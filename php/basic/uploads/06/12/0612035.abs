Title: Metastable Vacua in Flux Compactifications and Their Phenomenology
Authors: Oleg Lebedev and Valéri Löwen and Yann Mambrini and Hans Peter Nilles and Michael Ratz
Abstract: In the context of flux compactifications, metastable vacua with a small positive cosmological constant are obtained by combining a sector where supersymmetry is broken dynamically with the sector responsible for moduli stabilization, which is known as the F-uplifting. We analyze this procedure in a model-independent way and study phenomenological properties of the resulting vacua.
