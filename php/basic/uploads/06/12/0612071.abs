Title: Radius stabilization by constant boundary superpotentials in warped  space
Authors: Nobuhito Maru and Norisuke Sakai and Nobuhiro Uekusa
Abstract: A warped space model with a constant boundary superpotential has been an efficient model both to break supersymmetry and to stabilize the radius, when hypermultiplet, compensator and radion multiplet are taken into account. In such a model of the radius stabilization, the radion and moduli masses, the gravitino mass and the induced soft masses are studied. We find that a lighter physical mode composed of the radion and the moduli can have mass of the order of a TeV and that the gravitino mass can be of the order of 10$^7$ GeV. It is also shown that soft mass induced by the anomaly mediation can be of the order of 100GeV and can be dominant compared to that mediated by bulk fields. Localized F terms and D terms are discussed as candidates of cancelling the cosmological constant. We find that there is no flavor changing neutral current problem in a wide range of parameters.
