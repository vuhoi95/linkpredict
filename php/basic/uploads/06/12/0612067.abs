Title: Head-on collisions of boson stars
Authors: C. Palenzuela and I. Olabarrieta and L. Lehner and S. Liebling
Abstract: We study head-on collisions of boson stars in three dimensions. We consider evolutions of two boson stars which may differ in their phase or have opposite frequencies but are otherwise identical. Our studies show that these phase differences result in different late time behavior and gravitational wave output.
