Title: Field Definitions, Spectrum and Universality in Effective String  Theories
Authors: N. D. Hari Dass and Peter Matlock
Abstract: It is shown, by explicit calculation, that the third-order terms in inverse string length in the spectrum of the effective string theories of Polchinski and Strominger are also the same as in Nambu-Goto theory, in addition to the universal Luescher terms. While the Nambu-Goto theory is inconsistent outside the critical dimension, the Polchinski-Strominger theory is by construction consistent for any space-time dimension. In the analysis of the spectrum, care is taken not to use any field redefinition, as it is felt that this has the potential to obscure important points. Nevertheless, as field redefinition is an important tool and the definition of the field should be made precise, a careful analysis of the choice of field definition leading to the terms in the action is also presented. Further, it is shown how a choice of field definition can be made in a systematic way at higher orders. To this end the transformation of measure involved is calculated, in the context of effective string theory, and thereby a quantum evaluation made of equivalence of theories related by a field redefinition. It is found that there are interesting possibilities resulting from a redefinition of fluctuation field.
