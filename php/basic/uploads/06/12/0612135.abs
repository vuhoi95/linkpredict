Title: Mass Spectrum, Actons and Cosmological Landscape
Authors: V. V. Kozlov and I. V. Volovich
Abstract: It is suggested that the properties of the mass spectrum of elementary particles could be related with cosmology. Solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation on the Friedmann type manifold with the finite action are constructed. These solutions (actons) have a discrete mass spectrum. We suggest that such solutions could select a universe from cosmological landscape. In particular the solutions with the finite action on de Sitter space are investigated.
