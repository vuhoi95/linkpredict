Title: Direct Mediation of Meta-Stable Supersymmetry Breaking
Authors: Ryuichiro Kitano and Hirosi Ooguri and Yutaka Ookouchi
Abstract: The supersymmetric SU(Nc) Yang-Mills theory coupled to Nf matter fields in the fundamental representation has meta-stable vacua with broken supersymmetry when Nc < Nf < 3/2 Nc. By gauging the flavor symmetry, this model can be coupled directly to the standard model. We show that it is possible to make a slight deformation to the model so that gaugino masses are generated and the Landau pole problem can be avoided. The deformed model has simple realizations on intersecting branes in string theory, where various features of the meta-stable vacua are encoded geometrically as brane configurations.
