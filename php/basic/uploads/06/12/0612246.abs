Title: Living on the edge in a spacetime with multiple warping
Authors: Debajyoti Choudhury and Soumitra SenGupta
Abstract: The Randall-Sundrum warped braneworld model is generalised to six and higher dimensions such that the warping has a non-trivial dependence on more than one dimension. This naturally leads to a brane-box like configuration alongwith scalar fields with possibly interesting cosmological roles. Also obtained naturally are two towers of 3 branes with mass scales clustered around either of Planck scale and TeV scale. Such a scenario has interesting phenomenological consequences including an explanation for the observed hierarchy in the masses of standard model fermions.
