Title: Flavor quarks in AdS4 and gauge/gravity correspondence
Authors: Kazuo Ghoroku and Masafumi Ishihara and Akihiro Nakamura
Abstract: The non-perturbative properties of the gauge theories in the AdS${}_4$ are studied in the dual supergravity by including light flavor quarks, which are introduced by a D7 brane embedding. Contrary to the cases of Minkowski and dS${}_4$, the dilaton does not play any important dynamical role in the AdS${}_4$ case, and the characteristic properties like the quark confinement and the chiral symmetry breaking are realized mainly due to the geometry AdS${}_4$. The possible hadron spectra %in the AdS${}_4$ are also examined, and we find that the meson spectra are well described by the formula given by the field theory in AdS${}_4$, but the characteristic mass scale is modified by the gauge interactions for exited states.
