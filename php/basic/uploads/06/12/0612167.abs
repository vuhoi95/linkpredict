Title: Spacetime symmetries of the Lorentz-violating Maxwell-Chern-Simons model
Authors: A. J. Hariton and Ralf Lehnert
Abstract: The spacetime symmetries of classical electrodynamics supplemented with a Chern-Simons term that contains a constant nondynamical 4-vector are investigated. In addition to translation invariance and the expected three remaining Lorentz symmetries characterized by the little group of the external vector, the model possesses an additional spacetime symmetry if the nondynamical vector is lightlike. The conserved current associated with this invariance is determined, and the symmetry structure arising from this invariance and the usual little group ISO(2) is identified as SIM(2).
