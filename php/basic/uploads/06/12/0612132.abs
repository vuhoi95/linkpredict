Title: Non-perturbative SQCD Superpotentials from String Instantons
Authors: Nikolas Akerblom and Ralph Blumenhagen and Dieter Lust and Erik Plauschinn and Maximilian Schmidt-Sommerfeld
Abstract: The Affleck-Dine-Seiberg instanton generated superpotential for SQCD with Nf=Nc-1 flavours is explicitly derived from a local model of engineered intersecting D6-branes with a single E2-instanton. This computation extends also to symplectic gauge groups with Nf=Nc flavours.
