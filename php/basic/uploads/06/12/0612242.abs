Title: Holographic Bosonic Technicolor
Authors: Christopher D. Carone and Joshua Erlich and Jong Anly Tan
Abstract: We consider a technicolor model in which the expectation value of an additional, possibly composite, scalar field is responsible for the generation of fermion masses. We define the dynamics of the strongly coupled sector by constructing its holographic dual. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we study the S parameter and the phenomenology of the light technihadrons. We find that the S parameter is small over a significant region of the model's parameter space. The particle spectrum is distinctive and includes a nonstandard Higgs boson as well as heavier hadronic resonances. Technihadron masses and decay rates are calculated holographically, as a function of the model's parameters.
