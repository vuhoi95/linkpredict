Title: Dimension-changing exact solutions of string theory
Authors: Simeon Hellerman and Ian Swanson
Abstract: Superstring theories in the critical dimension D=10 are connected to one another by a well-explored web of dualities. In this paper we use closed-string tachyon condensation to connect the supersymmetric moduli space of the critical superstring to non-supersymmetric string theories in more than ten dimensions. We present a new set of classical solutions that exhibit dynamical transitions between string theories in different dimensions, with different degrees of stability and different amounts of spacetime supersymmetry. In all examples, the string-frame metric and dilaton gradient readjust themselves during the transition. The central charge of the worldsheet theory remains equal to 15, even as the total number of dimensions changes. This phenomenon arises entirely from a one-loop diagram on the string worldsheet. Allowed supersymmetric final states include half-BPS vacua of type II and SO(32) heterotic string theory. We also find solutions that bypass the critical dimension altogether and proceed directly to spacelike linear dilaton theories in dimensions greater than or equal to two.
