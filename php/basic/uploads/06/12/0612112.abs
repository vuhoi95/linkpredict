Authors: M. Chaichian and M. Mnatsakanova and A. Tureanu and Yu. Vernov
Abstract: Classical results of the axiomatic quantum field theory - Reeh and Schlieder's theorems, irreducibility of the set of field operators and generalized Haag's theorem are proven in SO(1,1) invariant quantum field theory, of which an important example is noncommutative quantum field theory. In SO(1,3) invariant theory new consequences of generalized Haag's theorem are obtained. It has been proven that the equality of four-point Wightman functions in two theories leads to the equality of elastic scattering amplitudes and thus the total cross-sections in these theories.
