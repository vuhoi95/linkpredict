Title: On gauge couplings and thresholds in Type I Gepner models and otherwise
Authors: Pascal Anastasopoulos and Massimo Bianchi and Gor Sarkissian and Yassen S. Stanev
Abstract: We derive general formulae for tree level gauge couplings and their one-loop thresholds in Type I models based on genuinely interacting internal N=2 SCFT's, such as Gepner models. We illustrate our procedure in the simple yet non-trivial instance of the Quintic. We briefly address the phenomenologically more relevant issue of determining the Weinberg angle in this class of models. Finally we initiate the study of the correspondence between `magnetized' or `coisotropic' D-branes in Gepner models and twisted representations of the underlying N=2 SCA.
