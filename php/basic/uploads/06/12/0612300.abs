Title: Planar Super-Landau Models Revisited
Authors: Thomas Curtright and Evgeny Ivanov and Luca Mezincescu and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: We use the methods of PT-symmetric quantum theory to find a one-parameter family of ISU(1|1)-invariant planar super-Landau models with positive norm, uncovering an `accidental', and generically spontaneously-broken, worldline supersymmetry, with charges that have a Sugawara-type representation in terms of the ISU(1|1) charges. In contrast to standard models of supersymmetric quantum mechanics, it is the norms of states rather than their energies that are parameter-dependent, and the spectrum changes discontinuously in the limit that worldline supersymmetry is restored.
