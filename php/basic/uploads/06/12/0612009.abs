Title: Restoration of Dynamically Broken Chiral and Color Symmetries for an  Accelerated Observer
Authors: D. Ebert and V. Ch. Zhukovsky
Abstract: We study the behavior of quark and diquark condensates at finite Unruh temperature as seen by an accelerated observer. The gap equations for these condensates have been obtained with consideration of a finite chemical potential. Critical values of the acceleration for the restoration of chiral and color symmetries have been estimated.
