Title: BTZ Black Hole as Solution of 3d Higher Spin Gauge Theory
Authors: V. E. Didenko and A. S. Matveev and M. A. Vasiliev
Abstract: BTZ black hole is interpreted as exact solution of 3d higher spin gauge theory. Solutions for free massless fields in BTZ black hole background are constructed with the help of the star-product algebra formalism underlying the formulation of 3d higher spin theory. It is shown that a part of higher spin symmetries remains unbroken for special values of the BTZ parameters.
