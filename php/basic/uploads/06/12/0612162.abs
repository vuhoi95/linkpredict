Title: Gravity as Classical Effect in Generalized Relativistic Quantum  Mechanics on Flat Background
Authors: Vadim V. Asadov and Oleg V. Kechkin
Abstract: We study classical limit for quantum mechanics with two times and temperature, which describes a generalized dynamics of relativistic point mass. In this theory, thermodynamic time means a parameter of evolution, whereas geometric time is one of space-time coordinates. We identify world lines in this theory with geodesic lines for the same point mass in standard General Relativity in its weak gravity limit. In identification performed, effective metrics is generated by weak correlations between canonical variables of the originally flat relativistic mechanics, i.e. between its space-time coordinates and moments.
