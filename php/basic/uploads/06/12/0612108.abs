Title: Gravitational waves generated by second order effects during inflation
Authors: Bob Osano and Cyril Pitrou and Peter Dunsby and Jean-Philippe Uzan and Chris Clarkson
Abstract: The generation of gravitational waves during inflation due to the non-linear coupling of scalar and tensor modes is discussed. Two methods describing gravitational wave perturbations are used and compared: a covariant and local approach, as well as a metric-based analysis based on the Bardeen formalism. An application to slow-roll inflation is also described.
