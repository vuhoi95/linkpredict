Abstract: We describe the results of the largest and most accurate three-dimensional field theory simulations of domain wall networks with junctions. We consider a previously introduced class of models which, in the limit of large number $N$ of coupled scalar fields, approaches the so-called `ideal' model (in terms of its potential to lead to network frustration). We consider values of $N$ between N=2 and N=20. In all cases we find compelling evidence for a gradual approach to scaling, with the quantitative scaling parameters having only a mild dependence on $N$. These results strongly support our no-frustration conjecture.
