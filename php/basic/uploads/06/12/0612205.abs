Title: Relating Schwarzschild Black Holes to Branes-Antibranes
Authors: Dan Gluck and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We construct in the supergravity framework a relation between thermal chargeless non-extremal black three-branes and thermal Dirichlet branes-antibranes systems. We propose this relation as a possible explanation for the intriguing similarity between the black branes Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and the field theory entropy of thermal branes-antibranes. We comment on various relations between branes, antibranes and non-BPS branes in type II string theories.
