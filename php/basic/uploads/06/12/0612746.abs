Title: Reconstruction of Hessence Dark Energy and the Latest Type Ia Supernovae  Gold Dataset
Authors: Hao Wei and Ningning Tang and Shuang Nan Zhang
Abstract: Recently, many efforts have been made to build dark energy models whose equation-of-state parameter can cross the so-called phantom divide $w_{de}=-1$. One of them is the so-called hessence dark energy model in which the role of dark energy is played by a non-canonical complex scalar field. In this work, we develop a simple method based on Hubble parameter $H(z)$ to reconstruct the hessence dark energy. As examples, we use two familiar parameterizations for $H(z)$ and fit them to the latest 182 type Ia supernovae Gold dataset. In the reconstruction, measurement errors are fully considered.
