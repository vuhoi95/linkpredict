Title: Amplitudes in Pure Yang-Mills and MHV Diagrams
Authors: Andreas Brandhuber and Bill Spence and Gabriele Travaglini
Abstract: We show how to calculate the one-loop scattering amplitude with all gluons of negative helicity in non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory using MHV diagrams. We argue that the amplitude with all positive helicity gluons arises from a Jacobian which occurs when one performs a Backlund-type holomorphic change of variables in the lightcone Yang-Mills Lagrangian. This also results in contributions to scattering amplitudes from violations of the equivalence theorem. Furthermore, we discuss how the one-loop amplitudes with a single positive or negative helicity gluon arise in this formalism. Perturbation theory in the new variables leads to a hybrid of MHV diagrams and lightcone Yang-Mills theory.
