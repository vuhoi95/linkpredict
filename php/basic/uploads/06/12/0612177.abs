Title: Black Holes in the Presence of Cosmological Constant and Large N Brane  World
Authors: Mingxing Luo and Sibo Zheng
Abstract: Analytic form has been obtained for four-dimensional black holes with a minimal Hawking temperature in a theory with cosmological constant, dilaton and gauge fields. In general dimensions, black hole solutions are shown to exist and their asymptotic behaviors are obtained. In theories of ten dimension, N coincident D3-branes as the boundary of an $AdS_5$ space are constructed by embedding black D3-branes, with a five-dimensional compactified space of negligible size if N is large, which provide natural realizations of the Randall-Sundrum scenario. For this $AdS_{5}$ background, the cosmological constant is a higher order perturbation and its effect on the spectra of standard model fields on the branes can be calculated.
