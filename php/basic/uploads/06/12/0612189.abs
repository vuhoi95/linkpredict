Title: IIA moduli stabilization with badly broken supersymmetry
Authors: Michael Dine and Alexander Morisse and Assaf Shomer and Zheng Sun
Abstract: Scherk-Schwarz compactification in string theory can be defined as orbifolding by an R symmetry, a symmetry that acts differently on bosons and fermions. Such a symmetry can arise in many situations, including toroidal and orbifold compactifications, as well as smooth Calabi-Yau spaces. If the symmetry acts freely then for large radius there are no tachyons in the spectrum. We focus mainly on stabilization by fluxes, and give examples with all moduli stabilized where the coupling is small and the internal manifold is large. Such models appear to be perturbatively stable with supersymmetry broken at the Kaluza-Klein scale. These are interesting laboratories for a variety of theoretical questions and provide models of a non-supersymmetric landscape.
