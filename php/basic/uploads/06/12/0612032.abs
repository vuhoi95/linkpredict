Title: Future Dependent Initial Conditions from Imaginary Part in Lagrangian
Authors: Holger B. Nielsen and Masao Ninomiya
Abstract: We want to unify usual equation of motion laws of nature with "laws" about initial conditions, second law of thermodynamics, cosmology. By introducing an imaginary part -- of a similar form but different parameters as the usual real part -- for the action to be used in the Feynmann path way integral we obtain a model determining (not only equations of motion but) also the initial conditions, for say a quantum field theory. We set up the formalism for e.g. expectation values, classical approximation in such a model and show that provided the imaginary part gets unimportant except in the Big Bang era the model can match the usual theory. Speculatively requiring that there be place for Dirac strings and thus in principle monopoles in the model we can push away the effects of the imaginary part to be involved only with particles not yet found. Most promising for seeing the initial condition determining effects from the imaginary part is thus the Higgs particle. We predict that the width of the Higgs particle shall likely turn out to be (appreciably perhaps) broader than calculated by summing usual decay rates. Higgs machines will be hit by bad luck.
