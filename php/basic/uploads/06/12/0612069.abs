Title: Impact of Lorentz Violation on Cosmology
Authors: Jiro Soda and Sugumi Kanno
Abstract: We discuss the impact of Lorentz violation on the cosmology. Firstly, we show that the Lorentz violation affects the dynamics of the chaotic inflationary model and gives rise to an interesting feature. Secondly, we propose the Lorentz violating DGP brane models where the Lorentz violating terms on the brane accelerate the current universe. We conjecture that the ghost disappears in the Lorentz violating DGP models.
