Title: Correlation functions of the one-dimensional attractive Bose gas
Authors: P. Calabrese and J. -S. Caux
Abstract: The zero-temperature correlation functions of the one-dimensional attractive Bose gas with delta-function interaction are calculated analytically for any value of the interaction parameter and number of particles, directly from the integrability of the model. We point out a number of interesting features, including zero recoil energy for large number of particles, analogous to a M\"ossbauer effect.
