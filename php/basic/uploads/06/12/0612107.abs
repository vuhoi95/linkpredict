Title: Quantum Liouville theory with heavy charges
Authors: Pietro Menotti and Erik Tonni
Abstract: We develop a general technique for solving the Riemann-Hilbert problem in presence of a number of heavy charges and a small one thus providing the exact Green functions of Liouville theory for various non trivial backgrounds. The non invariant regularization suggested by Zamolodchikov and Zamolodchikov gives the correct quantum dimensions; this is shown to one loop in the sphere topology and for boundary Liouville theory and to all loop on the pseudosphere. The method is also applied to give perturbative checks of the one point functions derived in the bootstrap approach by Fateev Zamolodchikov and Zamolodchikov in boundary Liouville theory and by Zamolodchikov and Zamolodchikov on the pseudosphere, obtaining complete agreement.
