Title: Hyperkahler sigma models on cotangent bundles of Hermitian symmetric  spaces using projective superspace
Authors: Masato Arai and Sergei M. Kuzenko and Ulf Lindstrom
Abstract: Kahler manifolds have a natural hyperkahler structure associated with (part of) their cotangent bundles. Using projective superspace, we construct four-dimensional N = 2 models on the tangent bundles of some classical Hermitian symmetric spaces (specifically, the four regular series of irreducible compact symmetric Kahler manifolds, and their non-compact versions). A further dualization yields the Kahler potential for the hyperkahler metric on the cotangent bundle.
