Title: Reinterpreting dark energy through backreaction: the minimally coupled  morphon field
Authors: Julien Larena and Thomas Buchert and Jean-Michel Alimi
Abstract: In the context of averaged cosmologies, the effective equations can be written in the form of "regional" Friedmannian equations with additional sources arising from the so-called backreaction of inhomogeneities. We propose a mean field description of this backreaction in terms of a regionally homogeneous scalar field: this provides a physical motivation to the phenomenological scalar fields generically called quintessence fields. We explicitly reconstruct the potential of the scalar field for a one-parameter family of scaling solutions to the backreaction problem, showing that it entails most of the standard scalar fields including e.g. standard and phantom quintessence scenarii.
