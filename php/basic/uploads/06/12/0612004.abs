Title: Noether identities in Einstein--Dirac theory and the Lie derivative of  spinor fields
Authors: Marcella Palese and Ekkehart Winterroth
Abstract: We characterize the Lie derivative of spinor fields from a variational point of view by resorting to the theory of the Lie derivative of sections of gauge-natural bundles. Noether identities from the gauge-natural invariance of the first variational derivative of the Einstein(--Cartan)--Dirac Lagrangian provide restrictions on the Lie derivative of fields.
