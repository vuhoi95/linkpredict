Title: Toda equations associated with loop groups of complex classical Lie  groups
Authors: Kh. S. Nirov and A. V. Razumov
Abstract: A Toda equation is specified by a choice of a Lie group and a $\mathbb Z$-gradation of its Lie algebra. The Toda equations associated with loop groups of complex classical Lie groups, whose Lie algebras are endowed with integrable $\mathbb Z$-gradations with finite dimensional grading subspaces, are described in an explicit form.
