Title: Field theories on spaces with linear fuzziness
Authors: A. H. Fatollahi and M. Khorrami
Abstract: A noncommutative space is considered the position operators of which satisfy the commutativity relations of a Lie algebra. The basic tools for calculation on this space, including the product of the fields, inner product and the proper measure for integration are derived. Some general aspects of perturbative field theory calculations on this space are also discussed. Among the features of such models is that they are free from ultraviolet divergences (and hence free from UV/IR mixing as well), if the group is compact. The example of the group SO(3) or SU(2) is investigated in more detail.
