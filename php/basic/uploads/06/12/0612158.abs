Title: BFT Embedding of Non-commutative Chiral Bosons
Authors: Wontae Kim and Young-Jai Park and Hyeonjoon Shin and Myung Seok Yoon
Abstract: A two dimensional model of chiral bosons in non-commutative field space is considered in the framework of the Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin (BFT) Hamiltonian embedding method converting the second-class constrained system into the first-class one. The symmetry structure associated with the first-class constraints is explored and the propagation speed of fields is equivalent to that of the second-class constraint system.
