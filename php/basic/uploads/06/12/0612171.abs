Title: The Ricci Curvature of Half-flat Manifolds
Authors: Tibra Ali and Gerald B. Cleaver
Abstract: We derive expressions for the Ricci curvature tensor and scalar in terms of intrinsic torsion classes of half-flat manifolds by exploiting the relationship between half-flat manifolds and non-compact $G_2$ holonomy manifolds. Our expressions are tested for Iwasawa and more general nilpotent manifolds. We also derive expressions, in the language of Calabi-Yau moduli spaces, for the torsion classes and the Ricci curvature of the \emph{particular} half-flat manifolds that arise naturally via mirror symmetry in flux compactifications. Using these expressions we then derive a constraint on the K\"ahler moduli space of type II string theories on these half-flat manifolds.
