Title: Baryons in Holographic QCD
Authors: Kanabu Nawa and Hideo Suganuma and Toru Kojo
Abstract: We study the baryon in holographic QCD with $D4/D8/\bar{D8}$ multi-$D$ brane system. In holographic QCD, the baryon appears as a topologically non-trivial chiral soliton in a four-dimensional effective theory of mesons. We call this topological soliton as Brane-induced Skyrmion. Some review of $D4/D8/\bar{D8}$ holographic QCD is presented from the viewpoints of recent hadron physics and phenomenologies. Four-dimensional effective theory with pions and $\rho$ mesons is uniquely derived from the non-abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action of $D8$ brane with $D4$ supergravity background, without small amplitude expansion of meson fields to discuss chiral solitons. For the hedgehog configuration of pion and $\rho$-meson fields, we derive the energy functional and the Euler-Lagrange equation of Brane-induced Skyrmion from the meson effective action induced by holographic QCD. Performing the numerical calculation, we obtain the pion profile $F(r)$ and the $\rho$-meson profile $G(r)$ of the Brane-induced Skyrmion, and estimate its total energy, energy density distribution, and root-mean-square radius. These results are compared with the experimental quantities of baryons and also with the profiles of standard Skyrmion without $\rho$ mesons. We analyze interaction terms of pions and $\rho$ mesons in Brane-induced Skyrmion, and consider the role of $\rho$-meson component appearing in baryons.
