Abstract: These are proceedings for the Les Houches Summer School ``Particle Physics and Cosmology: the Fabric of Spacetime,'' held in Les Houches, France, July 31--August 25, 2006. We summarise the discussions of our working group and outline a procedure for calculating gravity corrections to scalar field potentials, as they might be relevant for inflationary physics. We focus on a specific Randall--Sundrum type braneworld scenario and discuss the relevance of Kaluza--Klein gravitons due to the extra warped dimension.
