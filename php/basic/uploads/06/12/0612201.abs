Title: Holography of D-Brane Reconnection
Authors: Marcus Berg and Olaf Hohm and Henning Samtleben
Abstract: Gukov, Martinec, Moore and Strominger found that the D1-D5-D5' system with the D5-D5' angle at 45 degrees admits a deformation "rho" preserving supersymmetry. Under this deformation, the D5-branes and D5'-branes reconnect along a single special Lagrangian manifold. We construct the near-horizon limit of this brane setup (for which no supergravity solution is currently known), imposing the requisite symmetries perturbatively in the deformation rho. Reducing to the three-dimensional effective gauged supergravity, we compute the scalar potential and verify the presence of a deformation with the expected properties. We compute the conformal dimensions as functions of rho. This spectrum naturally organizes into N=3 supermultiplets, corresponding to the 3/16 preserved by the brane system. We give some remarks on the symmetric orbifold CFT for Q_D5=Q_D5', outline the computation of rho-deformed correlators in this theory, and probe computations in our rho-deformed background.
