Title: A Simple Model of Low-scale Direct Gauge Mediation
Authors: Csaba Cs√°ki and Yuri Shirman and John Terning
Abstract: We construct a calculable model of low-energy direct gauge mediation making use of the metastable supersymmetry breaking vacua recently discovered by Intriligator, Seiberg and Shih. The standard model gauge group is a subgroup of the global symmetries of the SUSY breaking sector and messengers play an essential role in dynamical SUSY breaking: they are composites of a confining gauge theory, and the holomorphic scalar messenger mass appears as a consequence of the confining dynamics. The SUSY breaking scale is around 100 TeV nevertheless the model is calculable. The minimal non-renormalizable coupling of the Higgs to the DSB sector leads in a simple way to a mu-term, while the B-term arises at two-loop order resulting in a moderately large tan beta. A novel feature of this class of models is that some particles from the dynamical SUSY breaking sector may be accessible at the LHC.
