Title: Lifetime of a massive particle in a de Sitter universe
Authors: Jacques Bros and Henri Epstein and Ugo Moschella
Abstract: We study particle decay in de Sitter space-time as given by first order perturbation theory in an interacting quantum field theory. We show that for fields with masses above a critical mass $m_c$ there is no such thing as particle stability, so that decays forbidden in flat space-time do occur there. The lifetime of such a particle also turns out to be independent of its velocity when that lifetime is comparable with de Sitter radius. Particles with lower mass are even stranger: The masses of their decay products must obey quantification rules, and their lifetime is zero.
