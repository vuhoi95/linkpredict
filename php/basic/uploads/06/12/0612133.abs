Title: The evolution of tensor perturbations in scalar-tensor theories of  gravity
Authors: Sante Carloni and Peter K. S. Dunsby
Abstract: The evolution equations for tensor perturbations in a generic scalar tensor theory of gravity are presented. Exact solution are given for a specific class of theories and Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker backgrounds. In these cases it is shown that, although the evolution of tensor models depends on the choice of parameters of the theory, no amplification is possible if the gravitational interaction is attractive.
