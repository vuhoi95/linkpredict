Title: Topological defects and electronic properties in graphene
Authors: Alberto Cortijo and Mar√≠a A. H. Vozmediano
Abstract: In this work we will focus on the effects produced by topological disorder on the electronic properties of a graphene plane. The presence of this type of disorder induces curvature in the samples of this material, making quite difficult the application of standard techniques of many body quantum theory. Once we understand the nature of these defects, we can apply ideas belonging to quantum field theory in curved space-time and extract information on physical properties that can be measured experimentally.
