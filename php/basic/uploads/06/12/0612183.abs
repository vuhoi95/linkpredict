Title: Lower-dimensional superstrings in the double-spinor formalism
Authors: Hiroshi Kunitomo and Shun'ya Mizoguchi
Abstract: We study lower-dimensional superstrings in the double-spinor formalism introduced by Aisaka and Kazama. These superstrings can be consistently quantized and are equivalent to the lower-dimensional pure-spinor superstrings proposed by Grassi and Wyllard. The unexpected physical spectrum of the pure-spinor superstrings may thus be regarded as a manifestation of noncriticality. We also discuss how to couple these covariant superstrings to the compactified degrees of freedom described by the N=2 superconformal field theory.
