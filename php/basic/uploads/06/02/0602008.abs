Title: Hopf solitons and Hopf Q-balls on S^3
Authors: J. Sanchez-Guillen and C. Adam and A. Wereszczynski
Abstract: Field theories with a $S^2$-valued unit vector field living on $S^3 \times \RR$ space-time are investigated. The corresponding eikonal equation, which is known to provide an integrable sector for various sigma models in different spaces, is solved giving static as well as time-dependent multiply knotted configurations on $S^3$ with arbitrary values of the Hopf index. Using these results, we then find a set of hopfions with topological charge $Q_H=m^2$, $m \in \mathbf{Z}$, in the integrable subsector of the pure $CP^1$ model. In addition, we show that the $CP^1$ model with a potential term provides time-dependent solitons. In the case of the so-called "new baby Skyrme" potential we find, e.g., exact stationary hopfions, i.e., topological $Q$-balls. Our results further enable us to construct exact static and stationary Hopf solitons in the Faddeev--Niemi model with or without the new baby Skyrme potential. Generalizations for a large class of models are also discussed.
