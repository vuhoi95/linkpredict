Title: Spinning Hopf solitons on S^3 x R
Authors: A. C. Riserio do Bonfim and L. A. Ferreira
Abstract: We consider a field theory with target space being the two dimensional sphere S^2 and defined on the space-time S^3 x R. The Lagrangean is the square of the pull-back of the area form on S^2. It is invariant under the conformal group SO(4,2) and the infinite dimensional group of area preserving diffeomorphisms of S^2. We construct an infinite number of exact soliton solutions with non-trivial Hopf topological charges. The solutions spin with a frequency which is bounded above by a quantity proportional to the inverse of the radius of S^3. The construction of the solutions is made possible by an ansatz which explores the conformal symmetry and a U(1) subgroup of the area preserving diffeomorphism group.
