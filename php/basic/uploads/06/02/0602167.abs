Title: Electrostatic and Magnetostatic Solutions in a Lorentz-Violating  Electrodynamics Model
Authors: Xun Xue and Jianfeng Wu
Abstract: We propose an effective Lorentz violating electrodynamics model via static de Sitter metric which is deviated from Minkowski metric by a minuscule amount depending on the cosmological constant. We obtain the electromagnetic field equations via the vierbein decomposition of the tensors. In addition, as an application of the electromagnetic field equations obtained, we get the solutions of electrostatic field and magnetostatic field due to a point charge and a circle current respectively and discussed the implication of the effect of Lorentz violation in our electromagnetic theory.
