Title: Euclidean solutions in Einstein-Yang-Mills-dilaton theory
Authors: Y. Brihaye and E. Radu
Abstract: We present arguments for the existence of a new type of solutions of the Euclidean Einstein-Yang-Mills-dilaton theory in $d=4$ dimensions. Possesing nonvanishing nonabelian charges, these nonselfdual configurations have no counterparts on the Lorentzian section. They provide, however, new saddle points in the Euclidean path integral.
