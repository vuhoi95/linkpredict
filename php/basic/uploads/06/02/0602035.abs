Title: KK-Masses in Dipole Deformed Field Theories
Authors: Karl Landsteiner and Sergio Montero
Abstract: We reconsider aspects of non-commutative dipole deformations of field theories. Among our findings there are hints to new phases with spontaneous breaking of translation invariance (stripe phases), similar to what happens in Moyal-deformed field theories. Furthermore, using zeta-function regularization, we calculate quantum corrections to KK-state masses. The corrections coming from non-planar diagrams show interesting but non-universal behaviour. Depending on the type of interaction the corrections can make the KK-states very heavy but also very light or even tachyonic. Finally we point out that the dipole deformation of QED is not renormalizable!
