Title: Holographic Estimate of Oblique Corrections for Technicolor
Authors: Deog Ki Hong and Ho-Ung Yee
Abstract: We study the oblique corrections to the electroweak interaction in the holographic model of technicolor theories. The oblique S parameter is expressed in terms of a solution to the equations of motion for the AdS bulk gauge fields. By analyzing the solution, we establish a rigorous proof that the S parameter is positive and is reduced by walking. We also present the precise numerical values for the S parameter of various technicolor models by solving the equations numerically.
