Abstract: We describe the general class of $N$-extended $D=(2+1)$ Galilean supersymmetries obtained, respectively, from the $N$-extended D=3 Poincar\'{e} superalgebras with maximal sets of central charges. We confirm the consistency of supersymmetry with the presence of the `exotic' second central charge $\theta$. We show further how to introduce a N=2 Galilean superfield equation describing nonrelativistic spin 0 and spin 1/2 free particles.
