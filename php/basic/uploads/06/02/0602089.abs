Title: More Dual Fluxes and Moduli Fixing
Authors: G. Aldazabal and P. G. Camara and A. Font and L. E. Ibanez
Abstract: We generalize the recent proposal that invariance under T-duality leads to additional non-geometric fluxes required so that superpotentials in type IIA and type IIB orientifolds match. We show that invariance under type IIB S-duality requires the introduction of a new set of fluxes leading to further superpotential terms. We find new classes of N=1 supersymmetric Minkowski vacua based on type IIB toroidal orientifolds in which not only dilaton and complex moduli but also Kahler moduli are fixed. The chains of dualities relating type II orientifolds to heterotic and M-theory compactifications suggests the existence of yet further flux degrees of freedom. Restricting to a particular type IIA/IIB or heterotic compactification only some of these degrees of freedom have a simple perturbative and/or geometric interpretation.
