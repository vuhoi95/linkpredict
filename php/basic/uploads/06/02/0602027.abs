Title: Towards the String Dual of N=1 SQCD-like Theories
Authors: Roberto Casero and Carlos Nunez and Angel Paredes
Abstract: We construct supergravity plus branes solutions, which we argue to be related to 4d N=1 SQCD with a quartic superpotential. The geometries depend on the ratio Nf/Nc which can be kept of order one, present a good singularity at the origin and are weakly curved elsewhere. We support our field theory interpretation by studying a variety of features like R-symmetry breaking, instantons, Seiberg duality, Wilson loops and pair creation, running of couplings and domain walls. In a second part of this paper, we address a different problem: the analysis of the interesting physics of different members of a family of supergravity solutions dual to (unflavored) N=1 SYM plus some UV completion.
