Title: de Sitter String Vacua from Perturbative Kahler Corrections and  Consistent D-terms
Authors: Susha L. Parameswaran and Alexander Westphal
Abstract: We present a new way to construct de Sitter vacua in type IIB flux compactifications, in which moduli stabilization and D-term uplifting can be combined in a manner consistent with the supergravity constraints. Here, the closed string fluxes fix the dilaton and the complex structure moduli while perturbative quantum corrections to the Kahler potential stabilize the volume Kahler modulus in an AdS_4-vacuum. Then, the presence of magnetized D7-branes in this setup provide supersymmetric D-terms in a fully consistent way which uplift the AdS_4-vacuum to a metastable dS-minimum.
