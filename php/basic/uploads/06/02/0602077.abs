Title: Dynamics of Generalized Assisted Inflation
Authors: Jelle Hartong and Andr√© Ploegh and Thomas Van Riet and Dennis B. Westra
Abstract: We study the dynamics of multiple scalar fields and a barotropic fluid in an FLRW-universe. The scalar potential is a sum of exponentials. All critical points are constructed and these include scaling and de Sitter solutions. A stability analysis of the critical points is performed for generalized assisted inflation, which is an extension of assisted inflation where the fields mutually interact. Effects in generalized assisted inflation which differ from assisted inflation are emphasized. One such a difference is that an (inflationary) attractor can exist if some of the exponential terms in the potential are negative.
