Title: Lagrangian BV quantization and Ward identities
Authors: D. Bashkirov and G. Sardanashvily
Abstract: The Ward identities are the relations which the complete Green functions of quantum fields satisfy if an original classical Lagrangian system is degenerate. A generic degenerate Lagrangian system of even and odd fields is considered. It is characterized by a hierarchy of reducible Noether identities and gauge supersymmetries parameterized by antifields and ghosts, respectively. In the framework of the BV quantization procedure, an original degenerate Lagrangian is extended to ghosts and antifields in order to satisfy the master equation. Replacing antifields with gauge fixing terms, one comes to a non-degenerate Lagrangian which is quantized in the framework of perturbed QFT. This Lagrangian possesses a BRST symmetry. The corresponding Ward identities are obtained. They generalize Ward identities in the Yang-Mills gauge theory to a general case of reducible gauge supersymmetries depending on derivatives of fields of any order. A supersymmetric Yang-Mills model is considered.
