Title: Attractor solutions for general hessence dark energy
Authors: M. Alimohammadi and H. Mohseni Sadjadi
Abstract: As a candidate for the dark energy, the hessence model has been recently introduced. We discuss the critical points of this model in almost general case, that is for arbitrary hessence potential and almost arbitrary hessence-background matter interaction. It is shown that in all models, there always exist some stable late-time attractors. It is shown that our general results coincide with those solutions obtained earlier for special cases, but some of them are new. These new solutions have two unique characteristics. First the hessence field has finite value in these solutions and second, their stabilities depend on the second derivative of the hessence potential.
