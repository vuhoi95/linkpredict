Title: Non-existence of Irreversible Processes in Compact Space Time
Authors: Holger B. Nielsen and Masao Ninomiya
Abstract: It is shown that if physical space time were truly compact there would only be of the order of one solutions to the classical field equations with a weighting to be explained. But that would not allow any peculiar choice of initial conditions that could support a non-trivial second law of thermodynamics. We present a no-go theorem: Irreversible processes would be extremely unlikely to occur, for the almost unique solution for the intrinsically compact space time world, although irreversible processes are well known to occur in general.What we here assume -- compact space time -- excludes that universe could exist eternally.
