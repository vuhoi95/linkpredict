Title: Noncritical String Correlators, Finite-N Matrix Models and the Vortex  Condensate
Authors: Anindya Mukherjee and Sunil Mukhi
Abstract: We carry out a systematic study of correlation functions of momentum modes in the Euclidean c=1 string, as a function of the radius and to all orders in perturbation theory. We obtain simple explicit expressions for several classes of correlators in terms of special functions. The Normal Matrix Model is found to be a powerful calculational tool that computes c=1 string correlators even at finite N. This enables us to obtain a simple combinatoric formula for the 2n-point function of unit momentum modes, which after T-duality determines the vortex condensate. We comment on possible applications of our results to T-duality at c=1 and to the 2d black hole/vortex condensate problem.
