Title: On Classification Of The Bubbling Geometries
Authors: A. E. Mosaffa and M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari
Abstract: In this paper we classify the ten dimensional half BPS solutions of the type IIB supergravity which have SO(4) X SO(4) X U(1) isometry found by Lin-Lunin-Maldacena (LLM). Our classification is based on their asymptotic behavior and causal structure according which they fall into two classes: 1) those with R X S^3 boundary and 2) those with one dimensional light-like boundary. Each class can be divided into some subclasses depending on the asymptotic characteristics of the solutions, which in part specify the global charges defining the geometry. We analyze each of these classes in some detail and elaborate on their dual gauge theory description. In particular, we show that the Matrix Chern-Simons theory which is the gauge theory dual to the LLM geometries, can be obtained as the effective theory of spherical threebrane probes in the half BPS sector.
