Title: Liouville field theory with heavy charges. II. The conformal boundary  case
Authors: Pietro Menotti and Erik Tonni
Abstract: We develop a general technique for computing functional integrals with fixed area and boundary length constraints. The correct quantum dimensions for the vertex functions are recovered by properly regularizing the Green function. Explicit computation is given for the one point function providing the first one loop check of the bootstrap formula.
