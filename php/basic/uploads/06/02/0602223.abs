Title: The composite operator T\bar{T} in sinh-Gordon and a series of massive  minimal models
Authors: Gesualdo Delfino and Giuliano Niccoli
Abstract: The composite operator T\bar{T}, obtained from the components of the energy-momentum tensor, enjoys a quite general characterization in two-dimensional quantum field theory also away from criticality. We use the form factor bootstrap supplemented by asymptotic conditions to determine its matrix elements in the sinh-Gordon model. The results extend to the breather sector of the sine-Gordon model and to the minimal models M_{2/(2N+3)} perturbed by the operator phi_{1,3}.
