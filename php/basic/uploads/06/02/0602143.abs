Abstract: We consider brane world models, which can be constructed in the five-dimensional Brans-Dicke theory with bulk scalar field potentials suggested by the supergravity theory. For different choices of the potentials and parameters we get: (i) an unstabilized model with the Randall-Sundrum solution for the metric and constant solution for the scalar field; (ii) models with flat background and tension-full branes; (iii) stabilized brane world models, one of which reproduces the Randall-Sundrum solution for the metric and gives an exponential solution for the scalar field. We also discuss the relationship between solutions in different frames - with non-minimal and minimal coupling of the scalar field.
