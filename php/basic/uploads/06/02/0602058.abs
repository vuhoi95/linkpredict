Title: Composite solitary waves in three-component scalar field theory: I. The  kink variety
Authors: A. Alonso Izquierdo and J. Mateos Guilarte
Abstract: We study the structure of the manifold of solitary waves in a particular three-component scalar field theoretical model in two-dimensional Minkowski space. These solitary waves involve one, two, three, four, six or seven lumps of energy.
