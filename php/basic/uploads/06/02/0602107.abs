Title: Time Dependent Cosmologies and Their Duals
Authors: Sumit R. Das and Jeremy Michelson and K. Narayan and Sandip P. Trivedi
Abstract: We construct a family of solutions in IIB supergravity theory. These are time dependent or depend on a light-like coordinate and can be thought of as deformations of AdS_5 x S^5. Several of the solutions have singularities. The light-like solutions preserve 8 supersymmetries. We argue that these solutions are dual to the N=4 gauge theory in a 3+1 dimensional spacetime with a metric and a gauge coupling that is varying with time or the light-like direction respectively. This identification allows us to map the question of singularity resolution to the dual gauge theory.
