Title: Spinor-vector supersymmetry algebra in three dimensions
Authors: Kazunari Shima and Motomu Tsuda
Abstract: We focus on a spin-3/2 supersymmetry (SUSY) algebra of Baaklini in D = 3 and explicitly show a nonlinear realization of the SUSY algebra. The unitary representation of the spin-3/2 SUSY algebra is discussed and compared with the ordinary (spin-1/2) SUSY algebra.
