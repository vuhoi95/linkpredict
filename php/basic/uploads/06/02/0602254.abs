Title: Product Representation of Dyon Partition Function in CHL Models
Authors: Justin R. David and Dileep P. Jatkar and Ashoke Sen
Abstract: A formula for the exact partition function of 1/4 BPS dyons in a class of CHL models has been proposed earlier. The formula involves inverse of Siegel modular forms of subgroups of Sp(2,Z). In this paper we propose product formulae for these modular forms. This generalizes the result of Borcherds and Gritsenko and Nikulin for the weight 10 cusp form of the full Sp(2,Z) group.
