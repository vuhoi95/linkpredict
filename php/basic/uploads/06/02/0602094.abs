Title: Finite Heisenberg Groups in Quiver Gauge Theories
Authors: Benjamin A. Burrington and James T. Liu and Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas
Abstract: We show by direct construction that a large class of quiver gauge theories admits actions of finite Heisenberg groups. We consider various quiver gauge theories that arise as AdS/CFT duals of orbifolds of C^3, the conifold and its orbifolds and some orbifolds of the cone over Y(p,q). Matching the gauge theory analysis with string theory on the corresponding spaces implies that the operators counting wrapped branes do not commute in the presence of flux.
