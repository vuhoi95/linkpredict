Title: Inflating branes inside abelian strings
Authors: Y. Brihaye and T. Delsate and B. Hartmann
Abstract: We study a 6-dimensional brane world model with an abelian string residing in the two extra dimensions. We study both static as well as inflating branes and find analytic solutions for the case of trivial matter fields in the bulk. Next to singular space-times, we also find solutions which are regular including cigar-like universes as well as solutions with periodic metric functions. These latter solutions arise if in a singular space-time a static brane is replaced by an inflating brane. We determine the pattern of generic solutions for positive, negative and zero bulk cosmological constant.
