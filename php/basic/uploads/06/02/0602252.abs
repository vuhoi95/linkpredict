Title: Hadronic Spectra and Light-Front Wavefunctions in Holographic QCD
Authors: Stanley J. Brodsky and Guy F. de Teramond
Abstract: We show how the string amplitude $\Phi(z)$ defined on the fifth dimension in AdS$_5$ space can be precisely mapped to the light-front wavefunctions of hadrons in physical spacetime. We find an exact correspondence between the holographic variable $z$ and an impact variable $\zeta$, which represents the measure of transverse separation of the constituents within the hadrons. In addition, we derive effective four dimensional Schr\"odinger equations for the bound states of massless quarks and gluons which exactly reproduce the AdS/CFT results and give a realistic description of the light-quark meson and baryon spectrum as well as the form factors for spacelike $Q^2$. Only one parameter which sets the mass scale, $\Lambda_{QCD}$, is introduced.
