Title: The Non-BPS Black Hole Attractor Equation
Authors: Renata Kallosh and Navin Sivanandam and Masoud Soroush
Abstract: We study the attractor mechanism for extremal non-BPS black holes with an infinite throat near horizon geometry, developing, as we do so, a physical argument as to why such a mechanism does not exist in non-extremal cases. We present a detailed derivation of the non-supersymmetric attractor equation. This equation defines the stabilization of moduli near the black hole horizon: the fixed moduli take values specified by electric and magnetic charges corresponding to the fluxes in a Calabi Yau compactification of string theory. They also define the so-called double-extremal solutions. In some examples, studied previously by Tripathy and Trivedi, we solve the equation and show that the moduli are fixed at values which may also be derived from the critical points of the black hole potential.
