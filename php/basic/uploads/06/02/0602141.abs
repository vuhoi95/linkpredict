Title: Instanton Calculations in the beta-deformed AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: George Georgiou and Valentin V. Khoze
Abstract: We consider non-perturbative effects in the beta-deformed N=4 supersymmetric gauge theory in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We concentrate on the correlators of the Yang-Mills operators which correspond to the lowest Kaluza-Klein modes propagating on the dual supergravity background found by Lunin and Maldacena in hep-th/0502086. In particular, we calculate all multi-instanton contributions to these correlators in the beta-deformed SYM and find a compelling agreement with the results expected in supergravity.
