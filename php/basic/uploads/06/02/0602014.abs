Title: Renormalization of two-loop diagrams in scalar lattice field theory
Authors: B. Borasoy and H. Krebs
Abstract: We present a method to calculate to very high precision the coefficients of the divergences occuring in two-loop diagrams for a massive scalar field on the lattice. The approach is based on coordinate space techniques and extensive use of the precisely known Green's function.
