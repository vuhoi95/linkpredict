Title: Hairpin Branes and D-Branes Behind the Horizon
Authors: Kazumi Okuyama and Moshe Rozali
Abstract: We study Lorentzian D-particles in linear dilaton and the two dimensional black hole backgrounds. The D-particle trajectory follows an accelerated trajectory which is smeared by stringy corrections. For the black hole background we find that the portion of the trajectory behind the horizon appears to an asymptotic observer as ghost D-particle. This suggests a way of constructing a matrix model for the Lorentzian black hole background.
