Title: Curved Superspaces and Local Supersymmetry in Supermatrix Model
Authors: Masanori Hanada and Hikaru Kawai and Yusuke Kimura
Abstract: In a previous paper, we introduced a new interpretation of matrix models, in which any d-dimensional curved space can be realized in terms of d matrices, and the diffeomorphism and the local Lorentz symmetries are included in the ordinary unitary symmetry of the matrix model. Furthermore, we showed that the Einstein equation is naturally obtained, if we employ the standard form of the action, S=-tr([A_a,A_b][A^a,A^b])+.... In this paper, we extend this formalism to include supergravity. We show that the supercovariant derivatives on any d-dimensional curved space can be expressed in terms of d supermatrices, and the local supersymmetry can be regarded as a part of the superunitary symmetry. We further show that the Einstein and Rarita-Schwinger equations are compatible with the supermatrix generalization of the standard action.
