Title: Is there a prescribed parameter's space for the adiabatic geometric  phase?
Authors: David J Fernandez C and Nora Breton
Abstract: The Aharonov-Anandan and Berry phases are determined for the cyclic motions of a non-relativistic charged spinless particle evolving in the superposition of the fields produced by a Penning trap and a rotating magnetic field. Discussion about the selection of the parameter's space and the relationship between the Berry phase and the symmetry of the binding potential is given.
