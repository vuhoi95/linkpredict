Title: SUSY Ward identities for multi-gluon helicity amplitudes with massive  quarks
Authors: Christian Schwinn and Stefan Weinzierl
Abstract: We use supersymmetric Ward identities to relate multi-gluon helicity amplitudes involving a pair of massive quarks to amplitudes with massive scalars. This allows to use the recent results for scalar amplitudes with an arbitrary number of gluons obtained by on-shell recursion relations to obtain scattering amplitudes involving top quarks.
