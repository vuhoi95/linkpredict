Title: Dynamical Higgs potentials with a landscape
Authors: J. L. F. Barbon and C. Hoyos
Abstract: We consider one-loop effective potentials for adjoint Higgs fields that originate from flat holonomies in toroidal compactification of gauge theories. We show that such potentials are "landscape-like" for large gauge groups and generic non-supersymmetric matter representations. In particular, there is a large number of vacua with similar local properties, scanning a broad band of vacuum energies.
