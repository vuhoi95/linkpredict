Title: A Journey Through Garden Algebras
Authors: Stefano Bellucci and Sylvester James Gates, Jr. and Emanuele Orazi
Abstract: The main purpose of these lectures is to give a pedagogical overview on the possibility to classify and relate off-shell linear supermultiplets in the context of supersymmetric mechanics. A special emphasis is given to a recent graphical technique that turns out to be particularly effective for describing many aspects of supersymmetric mechanics in a direct and simplifying way.
