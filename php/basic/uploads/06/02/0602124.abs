Title: Supersymmteric Null-like Holographic Cosmologies
Authors: Feng-Li Lin and Wen-Yu Wen
Abstract: We construct a new class of 1/4-BPS time dependent domain-wall solutions with null-like metric and dilaton in type II supergravities, which admit a null-like big bang singularity. Based on the domain-wall/QFT correspondence, these solutions are dual to 1/4-supersymmetric quantum field theories living on a boundary cosmological background with time dependent coupling constant and UV cutoff. In particular we evaluate the holographic $c$ function for the 2-dimensional dual field theory living on the corresponding null-like cosmology. We find that this $c$ function runs in accordance with the $c$-theorem as the boundary universe evolves, this means that the number of degrees of freedom is divergent at big bang and suggests the possible resolution of big bang singularity.
