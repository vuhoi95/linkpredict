Title: Anomalus BRST Complexes for Non-Critical Massive Strings
Authors: Marcin Daszkiewicz and Zbigniew Hasiewicz and Cezary J. Walczyk
Abstract: It is shown that the BRST resolution of the spaces of physical states of non-critical (anomalus) massive string models can be consistently defined. The appropriate anomalus complexes are obtained by canonical restrictions of the ghost extended spaces to the kernel of curvature operator and additional Gupta-Bleuler like conditions without any modifications of the matter sector. The cohomologies of the polarized anomalus complex are calculated and analyzed in details.
