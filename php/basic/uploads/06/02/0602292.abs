Title: Partition function of non-supersymmetric black holes in the supergravity  limit
Authors: Shahrokh Parvizi and Alireza Tavanfar
Abstract: In this note, we propose the free energy of general \emph{non-supersymmetric} black hole attractors arising in type IIA(B) superstrings on 3-fold Calabi-Yau, in the supergravity limit. This, by definition, differs from its counterpart BPS free energy by a factor of $4 $. Correspondingly, a mixed ensemble for these black holes is proposed.
