Title: Non-renormalization of the full <VVA> correlator at two-loop order
Authors: F. Jegerlehner and O. V. Tarasov
Abstract: By explicit calculation of the two-loop QCD corrections we show that for singlet axial and vector currents the full off-shell <VVA> correlation function in the limit of massless fermions is proportional to the one-loop result, when calculated in the MS-bar scheme. By the same finite renormalization which is needed to make the one-loop anomaly exact to all orders, we arrive at the conclusion that two-loop corrections are absent altogether, for the complete correlator not only its anomalous part. In accordance with the one-loop nature of the <VVA> correlator, one possible amplitude, which seems to be missing by accident at the one-loop level, also does not show up at the two-loop level.
