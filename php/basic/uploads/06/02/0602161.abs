Title: Quantum Mechanics of Klein-Gordon Fields II: Relativistic Coherent  States
Authors: A. Mostafazadeh and F. Zamani
Abstract: We use the formulation of the quantum mechanics of first quantized Klein-Gordon fields given in the first of this series of papers to study relativistic coherent states. In particular, we offer an explicit construction of coherent states for both charged and neutral (real) free Klein-Gordon fields as well as for charged fields interacting with a constant magnetic field. Our construction is free from the problems associated with charge-superselection rule that complicated the previous studies. We compute various physical quantities associated with our coherent states and present a detailed investigation of their classical (nonquantum) and nonrelativistic limits.
