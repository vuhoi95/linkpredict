Title: Weak gravitational lensing in brane-worlds
Authors: László Á. Gergely and Barbara Darázs
Abstract: We derive the deflection angle of light rays caused by a brane black hole with mass m and tidal charge q in the weak lensing approach, up to the second order in perturbation theory. We point out when the newly derived second order contributions become important.
