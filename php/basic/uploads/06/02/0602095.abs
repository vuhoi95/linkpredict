Title: Stability of a Noncommutative Jackiw-Teitelboim Gravity
Authors: D. V. Vassilevich and R. Fresneda and D. M. Gitman
Abstract: We start with a noncommutative version of the Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity in two dimensions which has a linear potential for the dilaton fields. We study whether it is possible to deform this model by adding quadratic terms to the potential but preserving the number of gauge symmetries. We find that no such deformation exists (provided one does not twist the gauge symmetries).
