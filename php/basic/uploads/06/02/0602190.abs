Title: Symmetric energy-momentum tensor in Maxwell, Yang-Mills, and Proca  theories obtained using only Noether's theorem
Authors: Merced Montesinos and Ernesto Flores
Abstract: The symmetric and gauge-invariant energy-momentum tensors for source-free Maxwell and Yang-Mills theories are obtained by means of translations in spacetime via a systematic implementation of Noether's theorem. For the source-free neutral Proca field, the same procedure yields also the symmetric energy-momentum tensor. In all cases, the key point to get the right expressions for the energy-momentum tensors is the appropriate handling of their equations of motion and the Bianchi identities. It must be stressed that these results are obtained without using Belinfante's symmetrization techniques which are usually employed to this end.
