Title: Composite solitary waves in three-component scalar field theory: II.  Three-body low-energy scattering
Authors: A. Alonso Izquierdo and J. Mateos Guilarte
Abstract: We discuss time evolution of some solitary waves described in the first part of this work. The adiabatic motion of the non-linear non-dispersive waves composed of three lumps is interpreted as three-body low energy scattering of these particle-like kinks.
