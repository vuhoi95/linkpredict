Title: Doubly Special Relativity: A New Relativity or Not?
Authors: Nosratollah Jafari and Ahmad Shariati
Abstract: Double Special Relativity theories are the relativistic theories in which the transformations between inertial observers are characterized by two observer-independent scales of the light speed and the Planck length. We study two main examples of these theories and want to show that these theories are not the new theories of relativity, but only are re-descriptions of Einstein's special relativity in the non-conventional coordinates.
