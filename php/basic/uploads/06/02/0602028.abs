Title: Dirac Type Gauge Theories and the Mass of the Higgs Boson
Authors: Juergen Tolksdorf and Torsten Thumstaedter
Abstract: We discuss the mass of the (physical component of the) Higgs boson in one-loop and top-quark mass approximation. For this the minimal Standard Model is regarded as a specific (parameterized) gauge theory of Dirac type. It is shown that the latter formulation, in contrast to the usual description of the Standard Model, gives a definite value for the Higgs mass. The predicted value for the Higgs mass depends on the value addressed to the top mass m_T. We obtain m_H= 186 \pm 8 GeV for m_T = 174 \pm 3 GeV (direct observation of top events), resp. m_H = 184 \pm 22 GeV for m_T = 172 \pm 10 GeV (Standard Model electroweak fit). Although the Higgs mass is predicted to be near the upper bound, m_H is in full accordance with the range 114 \leq m_H < 193 GeV that is allowed by the Standard Model. We show that the inclusion of (Dirac) massive neutrinos does not alter the results presented. We also briefly discuss how the derived mass values are related to those obtained within the frame of non-commutative geometry.
