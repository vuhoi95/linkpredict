Abstract: We show that a family of 1/2--BPS states of $\N=4$ SYM is in correspondence with a family of classical solutions of VSFT with a $B$--field playing the role of the inverse Planck constant. We show this correspondence by relating the Wigner distributions of the $N$ fermion systems representing such states, to low energy space profiles of systems of VSFT D-branes. In this context the Pauli exclusion principle appears as a consequence of the VSFT projector equation. The family of 1/2--BPS states maps through coarse--graining to droplet LLM supergravity solutions. We discuss the possible meaning of the corresponding coarse graining in the VSFT side.
