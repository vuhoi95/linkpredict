Title: Compact multigluonic scattering amplitudes with heavy scalars and  fermions
Authors: Paola Ferrario and German Rodrigo and Pere Talavera
Abstract: Combining the Berends-Giele and on-shell recursion relations we obtain an extremely compact expression for the scattering amplitude of a complex scalar-antiscalar pair and an arbitrary number of positive helicity gluons. This is one of the basic building blocks for constructing other helicity configurations from recursion relations. We also show explicity that the all positive helicity gluons amplitude for heavy fermions is proportional to the scalar one, confirming in this way the recently advocated SUSY-like Ward identities relating both amplitudes.
