Title: Supersymmetry Breaking by Constant Boundary Superpotentials in Warped  Space
Authors: Nobuhito Maru and Norisuke Sakai and Nobuhiro Uekusa
Abstract: Supersymmetry breaking by constant (field independent) superpotentials localized at boundaries is studied in a supersymmetric warped space model. We calculate the Kaluza-Klein mass spectrum of the hypermultiplet. We take into account of the radion and the compensator supermultiplets, as well as the bulk mass $c$ for the hypermultiplet. The mass splitting is similar to that of the Scherk-Schwarz supersymmetry breaking (in flat space) for large $|c|$, and has an interesting dependence on the bulk mass parameter $c$. We show that the radius is stabilized by the presence of the constant boundary superpotentials.
