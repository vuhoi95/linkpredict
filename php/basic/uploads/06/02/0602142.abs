Title: Black Hole Attractors and Pure Spinors
Authors: Jonathan P. Hsu and Alexander Maloney and Alessandro Tomasiello
Abstract: We construct black hole attractor solutions for a wide class of N=2 compactifications. The analysis is carried out in ten dimensions and makes crucial use of pure spinor techniques. This formalism can accommodate non-Kaehler manifolds as well as compactifications with flux, in addition to the usual Calabi-Yau case. At the attractor point, the charges fix the moduli according to sum_k f_k = Im(C Phi), where Phi is a pure spinor of odd (even) chirality in IIB (A). For IIB on a Calabi-Yau, Phi=Omega and the equation reduces to the usual one. Methods in generalized complex geometry can be used to study solutions to the attractor equation.
