Title: Using Muonic Hydrogen in Optical Spectroscopy Experiment to Detect Extra  Dimensions
Authors: Feng Luo and Hongya Liu
Abstract: Considering that gravitational force might deviate from Newton's inverse-square law (ISL) and become much stronger in small scale, we propose a kind of optical spectroscopy experiment to detect this possible deviation and take electronic, muonic and tauonic hydrogen atoms as examples. This experiment might be used to indirectly detect the deviation of ISL down to nanometer scale and to explore the possibility of three extra dimensions in ADD's model, while current direct gravity tests cannot break through micron scale and go beyond two extra dimensions scenario.
