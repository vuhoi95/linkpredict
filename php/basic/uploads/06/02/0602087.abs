Title: M-theory and a Topological String Duality
Authors: Robbert Dijkgraaf and Cumrun Vafa and Erik Verlinde
Abstract: We show how the topological string partition function, which is known to capture the degeneracies of a gas of BPS spinning M2-branes in M-theory compactified to 5 dimensions, is related to a 4-dimensional D-brane system that consists of single D6-brane bound to lower-dimensional branes. This system is described by a topologically twisted U(1) gauge theory, that has been conjecturally identified with quantum foam models and topological strings. This also explains, assuming the identification of Donaldson-Thomas invariants with this U(1) gauge theory, the conjectural relation between DT invariants and topological strings. Our results provide further mathematical evidence for the recently found connection between 4d and 5d black holes.
