Title: Vacuum Expectation Value of the Spinor Massive field in the Cosmic  String Space-Time
Authors: Valdir B. Bezerra and Nail R. Khusnutdinov
Abstract: We found the contribution to the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor of a massive Dirac field due to the conical geometry of the cosmic string space-time. The heat kernel and heat kernel expansion for the squared Dirac operator in this background are also considered and the first three coefficients were found in an explicity form.
