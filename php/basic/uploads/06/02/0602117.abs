Title: Negative Mass Solitons in Gravity
Authors: Hakan Cebeci and Ozgur Sarioglu and Bayram Tekin
Abstract: We first reconstruct the conserved (Abbott-Deser) charges in the spin connection formalism of gravity for asymptotically (Anti)-de Sitter spaces, and then compute the masses of the AdS soliton and the recently found Eguchi-Hanson solitons in generic odd dimensions, unlike the previous result obtained for only five dimensions. These solutions have negative masses compared to the global AdS or AdS/Z_p spacetimes. As a separate note, we also compute the masses of the recent even dimensional Taub-NUT-Reissner-Nordstrom metrics.
