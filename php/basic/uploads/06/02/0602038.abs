Title: Real Hamiltonian Forms of Affine Toda Models Related to Exceptional Lie  Algebras
Authors: Vladimir S. Gerdjikov and Georgi G. Grahovski
Abstract: The construction of a family of real Hamiltonian forms (RHF) for the special class of affine 1+1-dimensional Toda field theories (ATFT) is reported. Thus the method, proposed in [1] for systems with finite number of degrees of freedom is generalized to infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems. The construction method is illustrated on the explicit nontrivial example of RHF of ATFT related to the exceptional algebras E_6 and E_7. The involutions of the local integrals of motion are proved by means of the classical R-matrix approach.
