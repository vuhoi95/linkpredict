Title: Neutrino mixing as a source of dark energy
Authors: A. Capolupo and S. Capozziello and G. Vitiello
Abstract: We show that the vacuum condensate due to neutrino mixing in quantum field theory (QFT) contributes to the dark energy budget of the universe which gives rise to the accelerated behavior of cosmic flow. The mechanism of neutrino mixing is therefore a possible candidate to contribute to the cosmological dark energy.
