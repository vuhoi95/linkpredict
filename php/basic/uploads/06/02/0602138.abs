Title: A D-Brane Landscape on Calabi-Yau Manifolds
Authors: Duiliu-Emanuel Diaconescu and Alberto Garcia-Raboso and Kuver Sinha
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of magnetized nonsupersymmetric D5-brane configurations on Calabi-Yau orientifolds with fluxes. We show that supergravity D-terms capture supersymmetry breaking effects predicted by more abstract Pi-stability considerations. We also examine superpotential interactions in the presence of fluxes, and investigate the vacuum structure of such configurations. Based on the shape of the potential, we argue that metastable nonsupersymmetric vacua can be in principle obtained by tuning the values of fluxes.
