Title: A Higgs Mechanism for Gravity. Part II: Higher Spin Connections
Authors: Nicolas Boulanger and Ingo Kirsch
Abstract: We continue the work of hep-th/0503024 in which gravity is considered as the Goldstone realization of a spontaneously broken diffeomorphism group. We complete the discussion of the coset space Diff(d,R)/SO(1,d-1) formed by the d-dimensional group of analytic diffeomorphisms and the Lorentz group. We find that this coset space is parameterized by coordinates, a metric and an infinite tower of higher-spin-like or generalized connections. We then study effective actions for the corresponding symmetry breaking which gives mass to the higher spin connections. Our model predicts that gravity is modified at high energies by the exchange of massive higher spin particles.
