Title: Entangling oscillators through environment noise
Authors: F. Benatti and R. Floreanini
Abstract: We consider two independent bosonic oscillators immersed in a common bath, evolving in time with a completely positive, markovian, quasi-free (Gaussian) reduced dynamics. We show that an initially separated Gaussian state can become entangled as a result of a purely noisy mechanism. In certain cases, the dissipative dynamics allows the persistence of these bath induced quantum correlations even in the asymptotic equilibrium state.
