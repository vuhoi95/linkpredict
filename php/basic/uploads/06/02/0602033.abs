Title: Remarks on Hawking radiation as tunneling from the BTZ black holes
Authors: Shuang-Qing Wu and Qing-Quan Jiang
Abstract: Hawking radiation viewed as a semiclassical tunneling process from the event horizon of the (2 + 1)-dimensional rotating BTZ black hole is carefully reexamined by taking into account not only the energy conservation but also the conservation of angular momentum when the effect of the emitted particle's self-gravitation is incorporated. In contrast to previous analysis of this issue in the literature, our result obtained here fits well to the Kraus-Parikh-Wilczek's universal conclusion without any modification to the Bekenstein-Hawking area-entropy formulae of the BTZ black hole.
