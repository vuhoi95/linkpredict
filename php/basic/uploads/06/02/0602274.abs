Title: Notes on the algebraic curves in (p,q) minimal string theory
Authors: Masafumi Fukuma and Hirotaka Irie and Yoshinori Matsuo
Abstract: Loop amplitudes in (p,q) minimal string theory are studied in terms of the continuum string field theory based on the free fermion realization of the KP hierarchy. We derive the Schwinger-Dyson equations for FZZT disk amplitudes directly from the W_{1+\infty} constraints in the string field formulation and give explicitly the algebraic curves of disk amplitudes for general backgrounds. We further give annulus amplitudes of FZZT-FZZT, FZZT-ZZ and ZZ-ZZ branes, generalizing our previous D-instanton calculus from the minimal unitary series (p,p+1) to general (p,q) series. We also give a detailed explanation on the equivalence between the Douglas equation and the string field theory based on the KP hierarchy under the W_{1+\infty} constraints.
