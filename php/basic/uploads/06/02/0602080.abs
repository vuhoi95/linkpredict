Title: The elliptic scattering theory of the 1/2-XYZ and higher order Deformed  Virasoro Algebras
Authors: Davide Fioravanti and Marco Rossi
Abstract: Bound state excitations of the spin 1/2-XYZ model are considered inside the Bethe Ansatz framework by exploiting the equivalent Non-Linear Integral Equations. Of course, these bound states go to the sine-Gordon breathers in the suitable limit and therefore the scattering factors between them are explicitly computed by inspecting the corresponding Non-Linear Integral Equations. As a consequence, abstracting from the physical model the Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra of two $n$-th elliptic breathers defines a tower of $n$-order Deformed Virasoro Algebras, reproducing the $n=1$ case the usual well-known algebra of Shiraishi-Kubo-Awata-Odake \cite{SKAO}.
