Title: D1-brane with Overcritical Electric Field in AdS3 and S-brane
Authors: J. Kluson and Rashmi R. Nayak and Kamal L. Panigrahi
Abstract: We study aspects of Dirichlet S-branes, which are defined as Dirichlet boundary condition on a time like embedding of open strings, in general backgrounds. By applying T-duality along an isometry of the unphysical dS2-branes in NS-NS supported AdS3-background, we find S0-brane. We also study the time dependent tachyon condensation on the unstable Dp-brane and interpret the singular solutions as lower dimensional S(p-1)-brane that couples to real Ramond-Ramond fields while to imaginary NS-NS modes.
