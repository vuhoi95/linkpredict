Title: String loop corrected hypermultiplet moduli spaces
Authors: Daniel Robles-Llana and Frank Saueressig and Stefan Vandoren
Abstract: Using constraints from supersymmetry and string perturbation theory, we determine the string loop corrections to the hypermultiplet moduli space of type II strings compactified on a generic Calabi-Yau threefold. The corresponding quaternion-Kahler manifolds are completely encoded in terms of a single function. The latter receives a one-loop correction and, using superspace techniques, we argue for the existence of a non-renormalization theorem excluding higher loop contributions.
