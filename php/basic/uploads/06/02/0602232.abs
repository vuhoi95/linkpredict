Title: Wilsonian renormalization group properties of a novel non-critical  cosmological string configuration
Authors: J. Alexandre and N. E. Mavromatos
Abstract: We show that an exact, non-critical-string cosmological configuration of dilaton and graviton backgrounds, found in [1], constitutes an infrared stable fixed point of an exact Wilsonian renormalization group equation.
