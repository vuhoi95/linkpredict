Abstract: A systematic method to obtain the effective Lagrangian on the BPS background in supersymmetric gauge theories is worked out, taking domain walls and vortices as concrete examples. The Lagrangian in terms of the superfields for four preserved SUSY is expanded in powers of the slow-movement parameter lambda. The expansion gives the superfield form of the BPS equations at {O}(lambda^0), and all the fluctuation fields at {O}(lambda^1). The density of the Kaehler potential for the effective Lagrangian follows as an automatic consequence of the lambda expansion with manifest (four preserved) SUSY.
