Title: Invariant Bundles on $B$-fibered Calabi-Yau Spaces and the Standard  Model
Authors: Bjorn Andreas and Gottfried Curio
Abstract: We derive the Standard model gauge group together with chiral fermion generations from the heterotic string by turning on a Wilson line on a non-simply connected Calabi-Yau threefold with an SU(5) gauge group. For this we construct stable ${\bf Z_2}$-invariant $SU(4)\times U(1)$ bundles on an elliptically fibered cover Calabi-Yau threefold of special fibration type (the $B$-fibration). The construction makes use of a modified spectral cover approach giving just invariant bundles.
