Title: Dynamics of O(N) Model in a Strong Magnetic Background Field as a  Modified Noncommutative Field Theory
Authors: Amir Jafari Salim and Neda Sadooghi
Abstract: In the presence of a strong magnetic field, the effective action of a composite scalar field in an scalar O(N) model is derived using two different methods. First, in the framework of worldline formalism, the 1PI n-point vertex function for the composites is determined in the limit of strong magnetic field. Then, the n-point effective action of the composites is calculated in the regime of lowest Landau level dominance. It is shown that in the limit of strong magnetic field, the results coincide and an effective field theory arises which is comparable with the conventional noncommutative field theory. In contrast to the ordinary case, however, the UV/IR mixing is absent in this modified noncommutative field theory.
