Title: Estimation of the Lin-Yang bound of the least static energy of the  Faddeev model
Authors: Minoru Hirayama and Hitoshi Yamakoshi and Jun Yamashita
Abstract: Lin and Yang's upper bound E_Q <= cQ^(3/4) of the least static energy E_Q of the Faddeev model in a sector with a fixed Hopf index Q is investigated. By constructing an explicit trial configuration for the Faddeev field n, a possible value of the coefficient c is obtained numerically, which is much smaller than the value obtained quite recently by analytic discussions.
