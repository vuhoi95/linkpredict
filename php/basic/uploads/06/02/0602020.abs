Title: Law Behind Second Law of Thermodynamics --Unification with Cosmology--
Authors: Holger B. Nielsen and Masao Ninomiya
Abstract: In an abstract setting of a general classical mechanical system as a model for the universe we set up a general formalism for a law behind the second law of thermodynamics, i.e. really for "initial conditions". We propose a unification with the other laws by requiring similar symmetry and locality properties.
