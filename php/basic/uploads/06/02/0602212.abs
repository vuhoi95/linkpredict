Title: Normal ordering and boundary conditions for fermionic string coordinates
Authors: Nelson R. F. Braga and Hector L. Carrion and Cresus F. L. Godinho
Abstract: We build up normal ordered products for fermionic open string coordinates consistent with boundary conditions. The results are obtained considering the presence of antisymmetric tensor fields. We find a discontinuity of the normal ordered products at string endpoints even in the absence of the background. We discuss how the energy momentum tensor also changes at the world-sheet boundary in such a way that the central charge keeps the standard value at string end points.
