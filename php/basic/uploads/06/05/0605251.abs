Title: Semi-simple extension of the (super)Poincar√© algebra
Authors: Dmitrij V. Soroka and Vyacheslav A. Soroka
Abstract: A semi-simple tensor extension of the Poincar\'e algebra is proposed for the arbitrary dimensions $D$. A supersymmetric also semi-simple generalization of this extension is constructed in the D=4 dimensions. This paper is dedicated to the memory of Anna Yakovlevna Gelyukh.
