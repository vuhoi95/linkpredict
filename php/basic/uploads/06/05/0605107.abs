Title: Monopole confinement by flux tube
Authors: Chandrasekhar Chatterjee and Amitabha Lahiri
Abstract: We revisit Nambu's model of quark confinement by a tube of magnetic flux, with two additional features. The quarks are taken to be magnetic monopoles external to the tube, which seal the ends, and are also taken to be fermions. This ensures that the model is inconsistent unless there are at least two species of fermions being confined.
