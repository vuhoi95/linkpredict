Title: Second Order Noncommutative Corrections to Gravity
Authors: Xavier Calmet and Archil Kobakhidze
Abstract: In this work, we calculate the leading order corrections to general relativity formulated on a canonical noncommutative spacetime. These corrections appear in the second order of the expansion in theta. First order corrections can only appear in the gravity-matter interactions. Some implications are briefly discussed.
