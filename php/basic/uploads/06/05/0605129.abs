Title: Explicit Toric Metric on Resolved Calabi-Yau Cone
Authors: Takeshi Oota and Yukinori Yasui
Abstract: We present an explicit non-singular complete toric Calabi-Yau metric using the local solution recently found by Chen, Lu and Pope. This metric gives a new supergravity solution representing D3-branes.
