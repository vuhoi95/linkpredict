Title: Unified Theory of Annihilation-Creation Operators for Solvable  (`Discrete') Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Satoru Odake and Ryu Sasaki
Abstract: The annihilation-creation operators $a^{(\pm)}$ are defined as the positive/negative frequency parts of the exact Heisenberg operator solution for the `sinusoidal coordinate'. Thus $a^{(\pm)}$ are hermitian conjugate to each other and the relative weights of various terms in them are solely determined by the energy spectrum. This unified method applies to most of the solvable quantum mechanics of single degree of freedom including those belonging to the `discrete' quantum mechanics.
