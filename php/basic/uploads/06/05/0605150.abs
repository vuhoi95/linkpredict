Title: Tools for Deconstructing Gauge Theories in AdS5
Authors: Jorge de Blas and Adam Falkowski and Manuel Perez-Victoria and Stefan Pokorski
Abstract: We employ analytical methods to study deconstruction of 5D gauge theories in the AdS5 background. We demonstrate that using the so-called q-Bessel functions allows a quantitative analysis of the deconstructed setup. Our study clarifies the relation of deconstruction with 5D warped theories.
