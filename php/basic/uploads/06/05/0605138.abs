Title: Topological Quantum Distillation
Authors: H. Bombin and M. A. Martin-Delgado
Abstract: We construct a class of topological quantum codes to perform quantum entanglement distillation. These codes implement the whole Clifford group of unitary operations in a fully topological manner and without selective addressing of qubits. This allows us to extend their application also to quantum teleportation, dense coding and computation with magic states.
