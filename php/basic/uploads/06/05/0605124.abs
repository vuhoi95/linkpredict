Title: Non-Relativistic AdS Branes and Newton-Hooke Superalgebra
Authors: Makoto Sakaguchi and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We examine a non-relativistic limit of D-branes in AdS_5xS^5 and M-branes in AdS_{4/7}xS^{7/4}. First, Newton-Hooke superalgebras for the AdS branes are derived from AdSxS superalgebras as Inonu-Wigner contractions. It is shown that the directions along which the AdS-brane worldvolume extends are restricted by requiring that the isometry on the AdS-brane worldvolume and the Lorentz symmetry in the transverse space naturally extend to the super-isometry. We also derive Newton-Hooke superalgebras for pp-wave branes and show that the directions along which a brane worldvolume extends are restricted. Then the Wess-Zumino terms of the AdS branes are derived by using the Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology on the super-AdSxS algebra, and the non-relativistic limit of the AdS-brane actions is considered. We show that the consistent limit is possible for the following branes: Dp (even,even) for p=1 mod 4 and Dp (odd,odd) for p=3 mod 4 in AdS_5xS^5, and M2 (0,3), M2 (2,1), M5 (1,5) and M5 (3,3) in AdS_{4}xS^{7} and S^{4}xAdS_{7}. We furthermore present non-relativistic actions for the AdS branes.
