Title: Inflation, dark matter and dark energy in the string landscape
Authors: Andrew R Liddle and L Arturo Ureña-López
Abstract: We consider the conditions needed to unify the description of dark matter, dark energy and inflation in the context of the string landscape. We find that incomplete decay of the inflaton field gives the possibility that a single field is responsible for all three phenomena. By contrast, unifying dark matter and dark energy into a single field, separate from the inflaton, appears rather difficult.
