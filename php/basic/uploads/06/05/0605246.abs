Title: Particle production in field theories coupled to strong external  sources. II: Generating functions
Authors: Francois Gelis and Raju Venugopalan
Abstract: We discuss a method for computing the generating function for the multiplicity distribution in field theories with strong time dependent external sources. At leading order, the computation of the generating function reduces to finding a pair of solutions of the classical equations of motion, with non-standard temporal boundary conditions.
