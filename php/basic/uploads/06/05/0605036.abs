Title: Quantum Fields on Star Graphs
Authors: B. Bellazzini and M. Mintchev
Abstract: We construct canonical quantum fields which propagate on a star graph modeling a quantum wire. The construction uses a deformation of the algebra of canonical commutation relations, encoding the interaction in the vertex of the graph. We discuss in this framework the Casimir effect and derive the correction to the Stefan-Boltzmann law induced by the vertex interaction. We also generalize the algebraic setting for covering systems with integrable bulk interactions and solve the quantum non-linear Schroedinger model on a star graph.
