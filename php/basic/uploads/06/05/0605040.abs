Title: The fermion density operator in the droplet bosonization picture
Authors: Alberto Enciso and Alexios P. Polychronakos
Abstract: We derive the phase space particle density operator in the 'droplet' picture of bosonization in terms of the boundary operator. We demonstrate that it satisfies the correct algebra and acts on the proper Hilbert space describing the underlying fermion system, and therefore it can be used to bosonize any hamiltonian or related operator. As a demonstration we show that it reproduces the correct excitation energies for a system of free fermions with arbitrary dispersion relations.
