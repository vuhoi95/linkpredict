Title: Reionization from cosmic string loops
Authors: Ken D. Olum and Alexander Vilenkin
Abstract: Loops formed from a cosmic string network at early times would act as seeds for early formation of halos, which would form galaxies and lead to early reionization. With reasonable guesses about astrophysical and string parameters, the cosmic string scale $G\mu$ must be no more than about $3\times 10^{-8}$ to avoid conflict with the reionization redshift found by WMAP. The bound is much stronger for superstring models with a small string reconnection probability. For values near the bound, cosmic string loops may explain the discrepancy between the WMAP value and theoretical expectations.
