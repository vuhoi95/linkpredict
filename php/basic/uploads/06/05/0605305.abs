Title: Skyrmions, Hadrons and isospin chemical potential
Authors: M. Loewe and S. Mendizabal and J. C. Rojas
Abstract: Using the Hamiltonian formulation, in terms of collective variables, we explore the evolution of different skyrmionic parameters as function of the isospin chemical potential ($\mu$), such as the energy density, the charge density, the isoscalar radius and the isoscalar magnetic radius. We found that the radii start to grow very fast for $\mu \gtrsim 140$ MeV, suggesting the occurrence of a phase transition.
