Title: On non commutative sinh-Gordon Equation
Authors: U. Saleem and M. Siddiq and M. Hassan
Abstract: We give a noncommutative extension of sinh-Gordon equation. We generalize a linear system and Lax representation of the sinh-Gordon equation in noncommutative space. This generalization gives a noncommutative version of the sinh-Gordon equation with extra constraints, which can be expressed as global conserved currents.
