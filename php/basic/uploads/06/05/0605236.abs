Title: Quantum seaweed algebras and quantization of affine Cremmer-Gervais  r-matrices
Authors: M. Samsonov and A. Stolin and V. Tolstoy
Abstract: We propose a method of quantization of certain Lie bialgebra structures on the polynomial Lie algebras related to quasi-trigonometric solutions of the classical Yang--Baxter equation. The method is based on an affine realization of certain seaweed algebras and their quantum analogues. We also propose a method of $\omega$-affinization, which enables us to quantize rational $r$-matrices of $\mathfrak{sl}(3)$.
