Title: Deformed defects for scalar fields with polynomial interactions
Authors: D. Bazeia and M. A. González León and L. Losano and J. Mateos Guilarte
Abstract: In this paper we use the deformation procedure introduced in former work on deformed defects to investigate several new models for real scalar field. We introduce an interesting deformation function, from which we obtain two distinct families of models, labeled by the parameters that identify the deformation function. We investigate these models, which identify a broad class of polynomial interactions. We find exact solutions describing global defects, and we study the corresponding stability very carefully.
