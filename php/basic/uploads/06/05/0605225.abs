Title: Regge theory and statistical mechanics
Authors: F. Canfora and L. Parisi and G. Vilasi
Abstract: An interesting connection between the Regge theory of scattering, the Veneziano amplitude, the Lee-Yang theorems in statistical mechanics and nonextensive Renyi entropy is addressed. In this scheme the standard entropy and the Renyi entropy appear to be different limits of a unique mathematical object. This framework sheds light on the physical origin of nonextensivity. A non trivial application to spin glass theory is shortly outlined.
