Title: Conserved Quantities in Noncommutative Principal Chiral Model with  Wess-Zumino Term
Authors: U. Saleem and M. Hassan and M. Siddiq
Abstract: We construct noncommutative extension of U(N) principal chiral model with Wess-Zumino term and obtain an infinite set of local and non-local conserved quantities for the model using iterative procedure of Brezin {\it et.al} \cite{BIZZ}. We also present the equivalent description as Lax formalism of the model. We expand the fields perturbatively and derive zeroth- and first-order equations of motion, zero-curvature condition, iteration method, Lax formalism, local and non-local conserved quantities.
