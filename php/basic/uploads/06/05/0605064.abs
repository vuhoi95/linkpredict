Title: Non-integrability of Self-dual Yang-Mills-Higgs System
Authors: Takeo Inami and Shie Minakami and Muneto Nitta
Abstract: We examine integrability of self-dual Yang-Mills system in the Higgs phase, with taking simpler cases of vortices and domain walls. We show that the vortex equations and the domain-wall equations do not have Painleve property. This fact suggests that these equations are not integrable.
