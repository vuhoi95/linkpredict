Abstract: We consider solutions of the cosmological equations pertaining to a dissipative, dilaton-driven off-equilibrium Liouville Cosmological model, which may describe the effective field theoretic limit of a non-critical string model of the Universe. The non-criticality may be the result of an early-era catastrophic cosmic event, such as a big-bang, brane-world collision etc. The evolution of the various cosmological parameters of the model are obtained, and the effects of the dilaton and off-shell Liouville terms, including briefly those on relic densities, which distinguish the model from conventional cosmologies, are emphasised.
