Title: On the geometry of quiver gauge theories (Stacking exceptional  collections)
Authors: Christopher P. Herzog and Robert L. Karp
Abstract: In this paper we advance the program of using exceptional collections to understand the gauge theory description of a D-brane probing a Calabi-Yau singularity. To this end, we strengthen the connection between strong exceptional collections and fractional branes. To demonstrate our ideas, we derive a strong exceptional collection for every Y^{p,q} singularity, and also prove that this collection is simple.
