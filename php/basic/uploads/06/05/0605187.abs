Title: Non-singlet Q-deformed N=(1,0) and N=(1,1/2) U(1) actions
Authors: A. De Castro and L. Quevedo
Abstract: In this paper we construct N=(1,0) and N=(1,1/2) non-singlet Q-deformed supersymmetric U(1) actions in components. We obtain an exact expression for the enhanced supersymmetry action by turning off particular degrees of freedom of the deformation tensor. We analyze the behavior of the action upon restoring weekly some of the deformation parameters, obtaining a non trivial interaction term between a scalar and the gauge field, breaking the supersymmetry down to N=(1,0). Additionally, we present the corresponding set of unbroken supersymmetry transformations. We work in harmonic superspace in four Euclidean dimensions.
