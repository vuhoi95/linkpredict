Title: Supersymmetric Probes in a Rotating 5D Attractor
Authors: Wei Li and Andrew Strominger
Abstract: Supersymmetric zero-brane and one-brane probes in the squashed $AdS_2\times S^3$ near-horizon geometry of the BMPV black hole are studied. Supersymmetric zero-brane probes stabilized by orbital angular momentum on the $S^3$ are found and shown to saturate a BPS bound. We also find supersymmetric one-brane probes which have momentum and winding around a $U(1)_L\times U(1)_R$ torus in the $S^3$ and in some cases are static.
