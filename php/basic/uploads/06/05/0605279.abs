Title: New Attractors, Entropy Function and Black Hole Partition Function
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha and Hajar Ebrahim
Abstract: By making use of the entropy function formalism we study the generalized attractor equations in the four dimensional N=2 supergravity in presence of higher order corrections. This result might be used to understand a possible ensemble one could associate to an extremal black hole.
