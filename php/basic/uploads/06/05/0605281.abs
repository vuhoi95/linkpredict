Title: Space Symmetries and Quantum Behavior of Finite Energy Configurations in  SU(2)-Gauge Theory
Authors: A. V. Shurgaia and H. J. W. Mueller-Kirsten
Abstract: The quantum properties of localized finite energy solutions to classical Euler-Lagrange equations are investigated using the method of collective coordinates. The perturbation theory in terms of inverse powers of the coupling constant $g$ is constructed, taking into account the conservation laws of momentum and angular momentum (invariance of the action with respect to the group of motion M(3) of 3-dimensional Euclidean space) rigorously in every order of perturbation theory.
