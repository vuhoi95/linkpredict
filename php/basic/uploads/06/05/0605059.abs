Title: Restricting profile function of hedgehog Skyrmion
Authors: Jun Yamashita and Minoru Hirayama
Abstract: The profile function for the hedgehog Skyrmion is investigated. After discussing how the form of the profile function is restricted by the field equation, the s tatic energy is numerically calculated. It is found that the profile functions c onsidered here sometimes give the static energy smaller than previous ones.
