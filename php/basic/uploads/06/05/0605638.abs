Title: An Analytic Equation of State for Ising-like Models
Authors: D. J. O'Connor and J. A. Santiago and C. R. Stephens
Abstract: Using an Environmentally Friendly Renormalization we derive, from an underlying field theory representation, a formal expression for the equation of state, $y=f(x)$, that exhibits all desired asymptotic and analyticity properties in the three limits $x\to 0$, $x\to \infty$ and $x\to -1$. The only necessary inputs are the Wilson functions $\gamma_\lambda$, $\gamma_\phi$ and $\gamma_{\phi^2}$, associated with a renormalization of the transverse vertex functions. These Wilson functions exhibit a crossover between the Wilson-Fisher fixed point and the fixed point that controls the coexistence curve. Restricting to the case N=1, we derive a one-loop equation of state for $2< d<4$ naturally parameterized by a ratio of non-linear scaling fields. For $d=3$ we show that a non-parameterized analytic form can be deduced. Various asymptotic amplitudes are calculated directly from the equation of state in all three asymptotic limits of interest and comparison made with known results. By positing a scaling form for the equation of state inspired by the one-loop result, but adjusted to fit the known values of the critical exponents, we obtain better agreement with known asymptotic amplitudes.
