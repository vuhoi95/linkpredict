Title: Counting black hole microscopic states in loop quantum gravity
Authors: A. Ghosh and P. Mitra
Abstract: Counting of microscopic states of black holes is performed within the framework of loop quantum gravity. This is the first calculation of the pure horizon states using statistical methods, which reveals the possibility of additional states missed in the earlier calculations, leading to an increase of entropy. Also for the first time a microcanonical temperature is introduced within the framework.
