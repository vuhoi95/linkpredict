Title: New $AdS_4\times X_7$ Geometries with $\CN=6$ in M Theory
Authors: Ki-Myeong Lee and Ho-Ung Yee
Abstract: We study supersymmetric AdS_4 x X_7 solutions of 11-dim supergravity where the tri-Sasakian space X_7 has generically U(1)^2\times SU(2)_R isometry. The compact and regular 7-dim spaces X_7=S(t_1,t_2,t_3) is originated from 8-dim hyperkahler quotient of a 12-dim flat hyperkahler space by U(1) and belongs to the class of the Eschenburg space. We calculate the volume of X_7 and that of the supersymmetric five cycle via localization. From this we discuss the 3-dim dual superconformal field theories with \CN=3 supersymmetry.
