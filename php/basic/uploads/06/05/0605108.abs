Title: Supersymmetry Breaking and Moduli Stabilization with Anomalous U(1)  Gauge Symmetry
Authors: Kiwoon Choi and Kwang Sik Jeong
Abstract: We examine the effects of anomalous U(1)_A gauge symmetry on soft supersymmetry breaking terms while incorporating the stabilization of the modulus-axion multiplet responsible for the Green-Schwarz (GS) anomaly cancellation mechanism. In case of the KKLT stabilization of the GS modulus, soft terms are determined by the GS modulus mediation, the anomaly mediation and the U(1)_A mediation which are generically comparable to each other, thereby yielding the mirage mediation pattern of superparticle masses at low energy scale. Independently of the mechanism of moduli stabilization and supersymmetry breaking, the U(1)_A D-term potential can not be an uplifting potential for de Sitter vacuum when the gravitino mass is smaller than the Planck scale by many orders of magnitude. We also discuss some features of the supersymmetry breaking by red-shifted anti-brane which is a key element of the KKLT moduli stabilization.
