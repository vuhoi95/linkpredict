Title: Topological Quantum Field Theories, Strings, and Orbifolds
Authors: Ernesto Lupercio and Bernardo Uribe
Abstract: In this expository paper written for physicists and geometers we introduce the notions of TQFT and of orbifold. Then we survey the construction of TQFT's originating from orbifolds such as Chen-Ruan theory and Orbifold String Topology.
