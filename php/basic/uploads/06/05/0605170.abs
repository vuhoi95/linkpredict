Title: Black Holes with Varying Flux: A Numerical Approach
Authors: Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas and Cesar A. Terrero-Escalante
Abstract: We present a numerical study of type IIB supergravity solutions with varying Ramond-Ramond flux. We construct solutions that have a regular horizon and contain nontrivial five- and three-form fluxes. These solutions are holographically dual to the deconfined phase of confining field theories at finite temperature. As a calibration of the numerical method we first numerically reproduce various analytically known solutions including singular and regular nonextremal D3 branes, the Klebanov-Tseytlin solution and its singular nonextremal generalization. The horizon of the solutions we construct is of the precise form of nonextremal D3 branes. In the asymptotic region far away from the horizon we observe a logarithmic behavior similar to that of the Klebanov-Tseytlin solution.
