Title: Yang-Type Monopoles In 5 Dimensional Curved Space-Time
Authors: Ding-fang Zeng and Wei-shui Xu and Yi-hong Gao
Abstract: Motivated by Gibbons and Townsend's recent work, we construct Yang-Type monopoles in maximally symmetric space-time. We then analyze the dependence of horizon structure of the space-times around the 5-dimensional monopoles on the relative strength of gravitations to Yang-Mills interactions. We also analyze the stability of the monopoles against tensor type perturbations on metrics.
