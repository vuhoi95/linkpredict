Title: Another Model with Interacting Composites
Authors: M. Hortacsu and F. Taskin
Abstract: We show that we can construct a model in 3+1 dimensions where it is necessary that composite vector particles take place in physical processes as incoming and outgoing particles . Cross-section of the processes in which only the constituent spinors take place goes to zero. While the spinor-spinor scattering goes to zero, the scattering of composites gives nontrivial results.
