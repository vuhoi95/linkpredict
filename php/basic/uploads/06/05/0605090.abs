Title: Color Skyrmions in the Quark-Gluon Plasma
Authors: Jian Dai and V. P. Nair
Abstract: We consider the general formulation of nonabelian fluid dynamics based on symmetry considerations. We point out that, quite generally, this admits solitonic excitations which are the color analog of skyrmions. Some general properties of the solitons are discussed.
