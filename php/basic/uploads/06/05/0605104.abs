Title: Hidden supersymmetry in quantum bosonic systems
Authors: Francisco Correa and Mikhail S. Plyushchay
Abstract: We show that some simple well studied quantum mechanical systems without fermion (spin) degrees of freedom display, surprisingly, a hidden supersymmetry. The list includes the bound state Aharonov-Bohm, the Dirac delta and the Poschl-Teller potential problems, in which the unbroken and broken N=2 supersymmetry of linear and nonlinear (polynomial) forms is revealed.
