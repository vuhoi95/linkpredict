Title: Holographic Phase Transitions with Fundamental Matter
Authors: David Mateos and Robert C. Myers and Rowan M. Thomson
Abstract: The holographic dual of a finite-temperature gauge theory with a small number of flavours typically contains D-brane probes in a black hole background. At low temperature the branes sit outside the black hole and the meson spectrum is discrete and possesses a mass gap. As the temperature increases the branes approach a critical solution. Eventually they fall into the horizon and a phase transition occurs. In the new phase the meson spectrum is continuous and gapless. At large N and large 't Hooft coupling, this phase transition is always of first order, and in confining theories with heavy quarks it occurs at a temperature higher than the deconfinement temperature for the glue.
