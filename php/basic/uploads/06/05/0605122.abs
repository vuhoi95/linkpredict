Title: Mimicking Lambda with a spin-two ghost condensate
Authors: Claudia de Rham and Andrew J. Tolley
Abstract: We propose a simple higher-derivative braneworld gravity model which contains a stable accelerating branch, in the absence of cosmological constant or potential, that can be used to describe the late time cosmic acceleration. This model has similar qualitative features to that of Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati, such as the recovery of four-dimensional gravity at subhorizon scales, but unlike that case, the graviton zero mode is massless and there are no linearized instabilities. The acceleration rather is driven by bulk gravity in the form of a spin-two ghost condensate. We show that this model can be consistent with cosmological bounds and tests of gravity.
