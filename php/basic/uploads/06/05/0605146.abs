Abstract: We derive a complete geometrical characterisation of a large class of $AdS_3$, $AdS_4$ and $AdS_5$ supersymmetric spacetimes in eleven-dimensional supergravity using G-structures. These are obtained as special cases of a class of supersymmetric $\mathbb{R}^{1,1}$, $\mathbb{R}^{1,2}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}$ geometries, naturally associated to M5-branes wrapping calibrated cycles in manifolds with $G_2$, SU(3) or SU(2) holonomy. Specifically, the latter class is defined by requiring that the Killing spinors satisfy the same set of projection conditions as for wrapped probe branes, and that there is no electric flux. We show how the R-symmetries of the dual field theories appear as isometries of the general AdS geometries. We also show how known solutions previously constructed in gauged supergravity satisfy our more general G-structure conditions, demonstrate that our conditions for half-BPS $AdS_5$ geometries are precisely those of Lin, Lunin and Maldacena, and construct some new singular solutions.
