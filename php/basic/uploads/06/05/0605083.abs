Title: Moduli stabilization with non-Abelian fluxes
Authors: Alok Kumar and Subir Mukhopadhyay and Koushik Ray
Abstract: We study stabilization of moduli in the type--IIB superstring theory on the six-dimensional toroidal orientifold $\T^6/\Omega\cdot(-1)^{F_L}\cdot\Z_2$. We consider background space-filling D9-branes wrapped on the orientifold along with non-Abelian fluxes on its world-volume and demonstrate with two examples that this can stabilize all the complex structure moduli and some of the K\"ahler moduli.
