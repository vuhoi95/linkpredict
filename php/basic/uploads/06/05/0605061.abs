Title: Perturbation theory via Feynman diagrams in classical mechanics
Authors: R. Penco and D. Mauro
Abstract: In this paper we show how Feynman diagrams, which are used as a tool to implement perturbation theory in quantum field theory, can be very useful also in classical mechanics, provided we introduce also at the classical level concepts like path integrals and generating functionals.
