Title: Bouncing cosmological solutions and their stability
Authors: M. R. Setare and F. Darabi
Abstract: In the present paper we consider the bouncing braneworld scenario, in which the bulk is given by a five-dimensional charged AdS black hole spacetime with matter field confined in a $D_3$ brane. Then, we study the stability of solutions with respect to homogeneous and isotropic perturbations. Specifically, the AdS black hole with zero ADM mass and charge, and open horizon is an attractor, while the charged AdS black hole with zero ADM mass and flat horizon, is a repeller.
