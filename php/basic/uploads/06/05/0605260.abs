Title: D-brane probes on L^{abc} Superconformal Field Theories
Authors: Felipe Canoura and Jose D. Edelstein and Alfonso V. Ramallo
Abstract: We study supersymmetric embeddings of D-brane probes of different dimensionality in the AdS_5xL^{abc} background of type IIB string theory. In the case of D3-branes, we recover the known three-cycles dual to the dibaryonic operators of the gauge theory and we also find a new family of supersymmetric embeddings. Supersymmetric configurations of D5-branes, representing fractional branes, and of spacetime filling D7-branes (which can be used to add flavor) are also found. Stable non supersymmetric configurations corresponding to fat strings and domain walls are found as well.
