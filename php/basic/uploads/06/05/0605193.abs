Title: Two-dimensional metric and tetrad gravities as constrained second order  systems
Authors: R. N. Ghalati and N. Kiriushcheva and S. V. Kuzmin
Abstract: Using the Gitman-Lyakhovich-Tyutin generalization of the Ostrogradsky method for analyzing singular systems, we consider the Hamiltonian formulation of metric and tetrad gravities in two-dimensional Riemannian spacetime treating them as constrained higher-derivative theories. The algebraic structure of the Poisson brackets of the constraints and the corresponding gauge transformations are investigated in both cases.
