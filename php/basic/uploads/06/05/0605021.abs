Title: Superconformal Symmetry in Linear Sigma Model on Supermanifolds
Authors: Shigenori Seki and Katsuyuki Sugiyama and Tatsuya Tokunaga
Abstract: We consider a gauged linear sigma model in two dimensions with Grassmann odd chiral superfields. We investigate the Konishi anomaly of this model and find out the condition for realization of superconformal symmetry on the world-sheet. When this condition is satisfied, the theory is expected to flow into conformal theory in the infrared limit. We construct superconformal currents explicitly and study some properties of this world-sheet theory from the point of view of conformal field theories.
