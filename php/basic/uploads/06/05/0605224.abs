Title: Extracting information behind the veil of horizon
Authors: Kengo Maeda and Makoto Natsuume and Takashi Okamura
Abstract: In AdS/CFT duality, it is often argued that information behind the event horizon is encoded even in boundary correlators. However, its implication is not fully understood. We study a simple model which can be analyzed explicitly. The model is a two-dimensional scalar field propagating on the s-wave sector of the BTZ black hole formed by the gravitational collapse of a null dust. Inside the event horizon, we placed an artificial timelike singularity where one-parameter family of boundary conditions is permitted. We compute two-point correlators with two operators inserted on the boundary to see if the parameter is reflected in the correlators. In a typical case, we give an explicit form of the boundary correlators of an initial vacuum state and show that the parameter can be read off from them. This does not immediately imply that the asymptotic observer can extract the information of the singularity since one cannot control the initial state in general. Thus, we also study whether the parameter can be read off from the correlators for a class of initial states.
