Title: QCD threshold corrections to Higgs decay and to hadroproduction in  $l^+l^-$ annihilation
Authors: J. Bl√ºmlein and V. Ravindran
Abstract: We present threshold enhanced QCD corrections to the bottom quark energy distribution in Higgs boson decay and to hadroproduction in $l^+l^-$ annihilation beyond leading order in the strong coupling constant. This is achieved using the resummed decay distribution obtained using renormalisation group invariance and the mass factorisation theorem that they satisfy and Sudakov resummation of soft gluons.
