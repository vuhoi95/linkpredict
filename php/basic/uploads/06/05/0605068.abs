Title: Two-dimensional Quantum Black Holes, Branes in BTZ and Holography
Authors: Cristiano Germani and Giovanni Paolo Procopio
Abstract: We solve semiclassical Einstein equations in two dimensions with a massive source and we find a static, thermodynamically stable, quantum black hole solution in the Hartle-Hawking vacuum state. We then study the black hole geometry generated by a boundary mass sitting on a non-zero tension 1-brane embedded in a three-dimensional BTZ black hole. We show that the two geometries coincide and we extract, using holographic relations, information about the CFT living on the 1-brane. Finally, we show that the quantum black hole has the same temperature of the bulk BTZ, as expected from the holographic principle.
