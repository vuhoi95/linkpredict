Abstract: On the basis of the non-commutative q-calculus, we investigate a q-deformation of the classical Poisson bracket in order to formulate a generalized q-deformed dynamics in the classical regime. The obtained q-deformed Poisson bracket appears invariant under the action of the q-symplectic group of transformations. In this framework we introduce the q-deformed Hamilton's equations and we derive the evolution equation for some simple q-deformed mechanical systems governed by a scalar potential dependent only on the coordinate variable. It appears that the q-deformed Hamiltonian, which is the generator of the equation of motion, is generally not conserved in time but, in correspondence, a new constant of motion is generated. Finally, by following the standard canonical quantization rule, we compare the well known q-deformed Heisenberg algebra with the algebra generated by the q-deformed Poisson bracket.
