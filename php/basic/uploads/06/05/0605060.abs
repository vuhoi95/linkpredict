Title: Gravitational wave background in perfect fluid quantum cosmologies
Authors: Patrick Peter and Emanuel J. C. Pinho and Nelson Pinto-Neto
Abstract: We discuss the gravitational wave background produced by bouncing models based on a full quantum evolution of a universe filled with a perfect fluid. Using an ontological interpretation for the background wave function allows us to solve the mode equations for the tensorial perturbations, and we find the spectral index as a function of the fluid equation of state.
