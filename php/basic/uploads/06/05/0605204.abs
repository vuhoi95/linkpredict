Title: Yang-Mills Magneto-Fluid Unification
Authors: Bindu A. Bambah and Swadesh M. Mahajan and Chandrasekher Mukku
Abstract: We generalize the hybrid magneto-fluid model of a charged fluid interacting with an electromagnetic field to the dynamics of a relativistic hot fluid interacting with a non-Abelian field. The fluid itself is endowed with a non-Abelian charge and the consequences of this generalization are worked out. Applications of this formalism to the Quark Gluon Plasma are suggested.
