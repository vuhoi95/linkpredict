Title: Quantum backgrounds and QFT
Authors: Jae-Suk Park and John Terilla and Thomas Tradler
Abstract: We introduce the concept of a quantum background and a functor QFT. In the case that the QFT moduli space is smooth formal, we construct a flat quantum superconnection on a bundle over QFT which defines algebraic structures relevant to correlation functions in quantum field theory. We go further and identify chain level generalizations of correlation functions which should be present in all quantum field theories.
