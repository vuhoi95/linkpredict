Title: Non-chaotic dynamics in general-relativistic and scalar-tensor cosmology
Authors: V. Faraoni and M. N. Jensen and S. A. Theuerkauf
Abstract: In the context of scalar-tensor models of dark energy and inflation, the dynamics of vacuum scalar-tensor cosmology are analysed without specifying the coupling function or the scalar field potential. A conformal transformation to the Einstein frame is used and the dynamics of general relativity with a minimally coupled scalar field are derived for a generic potential. It is shown that the dynamics are non-chaotic, thus settling an existing debate.
