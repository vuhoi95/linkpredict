Title: Avoidance of future singularities in loop quantum cosmology
Authors: M. Sami and Parampreet Singh and Shinji Tsujikawa
Abstract: We consider the fate of future singularities in the effective dynamics of loop quantum cosmology. Non-perturbative quantum geometric effects which lead to $\rho^2$ modification of the Friedmann equation at high energies result in generic resolution of singularities whenever energy density $\rho$ diverges at future singularities of Friedmann dynamics. Such quantum effects lead to the avoidance of a Big Rip, which is followed by a recollapsing universe stable against perturbations. Resolution of sudden singularity, the case when pressure diverges but energy density approaches a finite value depends on the ratio of the latter to a critical energy density of the order of Planck. If the value of this ratio is greater than unity, the universe escapes the sudden future singularity and becomes oscillatory.
