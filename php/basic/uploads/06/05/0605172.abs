Title: Sim(2) and SUSY
Authors: Andrew G. Cohen and Daniel Z. Freedman
Abstract: The proposal of hep-ph/0601236, that the laws of physics in flat spacetime need be invariant only under a SIM(2) subgroup of the Lorentz group, is extended to include supersymmetry. $\mathcal{N}=1$ SUSY gauge theories which include SIM(2) couplings for the fermions in chiral multiplets are formulated. These theories contain two conserved supercharges rather than the usual four.
