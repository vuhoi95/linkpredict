Title: New Supersymmetric Solutions in N=2 Matter Coupled AdS_3 Supergravities
Authors: Nihat Sadik Deger and Ozgur Sarioglu
Abstract: We construct new 1/2 supersymmetric solutions in D=3, N=2, matter coupled, U(1) gauged supergravities and study some of their properties. We do this by employing a quite general supersymmetry breaking condition, from which we also redrive some of the already known solutions. Among the new solutions, we have an explicit non-topological soliton for the non-compact sigma model, a locally flat solution for the compact sigma model and a string-like solution for both types of sigma models. The last one is smooth for the compact scalar manifold.
