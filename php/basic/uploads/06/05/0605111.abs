Title: On $d=4$ Yang-Mills instantons in a spherically symmetric background
Authors: Yves Brihaye and Eugen Radu
Abstract: We present arguments for the existence of self-dual Yang-Mills instantons for several spherically symmetric backgrounds with Euclidean signature. The time-independent Yang-Mills field has finite action and a vanishing energy momentum tensor and does not disturb the geometry. We conjecture the existence of similar solutions for any nonextremal SO(3)-spherically symmetric background.
