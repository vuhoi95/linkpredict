Title: Heavy-Light Mesons from the AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: Johanna Erdmenger and Nick Evans and Johannes Grosse
Abstract: We propose a holographic description of heavy-light mesons, i.e. of mesons containing a light and a heavy quark. In the semi-classical string limit, we look at the dynamics of strings tied between two D7 branes. We consider this setup both in an AdS background and in the non-supersymmetric Constable-Myers geometry which induces chiral symmetry breaking. We compute the meson masses in each case. Finally we discuss the relevance of this result for phenomenological comparison to the physical b-quark sector.
