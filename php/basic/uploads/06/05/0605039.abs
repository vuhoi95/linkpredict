Title: Inflating Brane inside hyper-spherically symmetric defects
Authors: Y. Brihaye and T. Delsate
Abstract: Static and inflating brane world models are considered in $4+n$-dimensions with a non zero bulk cosmological constant and with a hyper-spherically symmetric topological defect residing in the $n$ extra dimensions. Several vacuum solutions can be constructed explicitely when the bulk and inflating constants are non zero. We study how these solutions are deformed by the presence of a global monopole for generic values of $n$ and a local monopole for $n=3$. New types of solutions, regular and periodic in the radial variable relative to the extra dimensions, are constructed.
