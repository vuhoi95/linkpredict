Title: Chiral Lattice Gauge Theories from Warped Domain Walls and  Ginsparg-Wilson Fermions
Authors: Tanmoy Bhattacharya and Matthew R. Martin and Erich Poppitz
Abstract: We propose a construction of a 2-dimensional lattice chiral gauge theory. The construction may be viewed as a particular limit of an infinite warped 3-dimensional theory. We also present a "single-site'' construction using Ginsparg-Wilson fermions which may avoid, in both 2 and 4 dimensions, the problems of waveguide-Yukawa models.
