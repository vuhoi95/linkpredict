Title: Supergeometry and Arithmetic Geometry
Authors: A. Schwarz and I. Shapiro
Abstract: We define a superspace over a ring $R$ as a functor on a subcategory of the category of supercommutative $R$-algebras. As an application the notion of a $p$-adic superspace is introduced and used to give a transparent construction of the Frobenius map on $p$-adic cohomology of a smooth projective variety over the ring of $p$-adic integers.
