Title: Charged rotating black holes in dilaton gravity
Authors: A. Sheykhi and N. Riazi
Abstract: We consider charged black holes with curved horizons, in five dimensional dilaton gravity in the presence of Liouville-type potential for the dilaton field. We show how, by solving a pair of coupled differential equations, infinitesimally small angular momentum can be added to these static solutions to obtain charged rotating dilaton black hole solutions. In the absence of dilaton field, the non-rotating version of the solution reduces to the five dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole, and the rotating version reproduces the five dimensional Kerr-Newman modification thereof for small rotation parameter. We also compute the angular momentum and the angular velocity of these rotating black holes which appear at the first order.
