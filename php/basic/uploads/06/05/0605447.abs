Title: Multicolored Temperley-Lieb lattice models. The ground state
Authors: A. Babichenko and D. Gepner
Abstract: Using inversion relation, we calculate the ground state energy for the lattice integrable models, based on a recently obtained baxterization of non trivial multicolored generalization of Temperley-Lieb algebras. The simplest vertex and IRF models are analyzed and found to have a mass gap.
