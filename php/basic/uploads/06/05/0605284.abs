Title: Skyrmions and the alpha-particle model of nuclei
Authors: Richard Battye and Nicholas Manton and Paul Sutcliffe
Abstract: We compute new solutions of the Skyrme model with massive pions. Concentrating on baryon numbers which are a multiple of four, we find low energy Skyrmion solutions which are composed of charge four sub-units, as in the alpha-particle model of nuclei. We summarize our current understanding of these solutions, and discuss their relationship to configurations in the alpha-particle model.
