Title: `Hidden' Symmetries of Higher Dimensional Rotating Black Holes
Authors: Valeri P. Frolov and David Kubiznak
Abstract: We demonstrate that the rotating black holes in an arbitrary number of dimensions and without any restrictions on their rotation parameters possess the same `hidden' symmetry as the 4-dimensional Kerr metric. Namely, besides the spacetime symmetries generated by the Killing vectors they also admit the (antisymmetric) Killing-Yano and symmetric Killing tensors.
