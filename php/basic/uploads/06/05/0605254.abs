Title: Schnabl's L_0 Operator in the Continuous Basis
Authors: Ehud Fuchs and Michael Kroyter
Abstract: Following Schnabl's analytic solution to string field theory, we calculate the operators ${\cal L}_0,{\cal L}_0^\dagger$ for a scalar field in the continuous $\kappa$ basis. We find an explicit and simple expression for them that further simplifies for their sum, which is block diagonal in this basis. We generalize this result for the bosonized ghost sector, verify their commutation relation and relate our expressions to wedge state representations.
