Authors: Hideki Ishihara and Masashi Kimura and Ken Matsuno and Shinya Tomizawa
Abstract: We construct the Kaluza-Klein multi-black hole solutions on the Gibbons-Hawking multi-instanton space in the five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory. We study geometric properties of the multi-black hole solutions. In particular, unlike the Gibbons-Hawking multi-instanton solutions, each nut-charge is able to take a different value due to the existence of black hole on it. The spatial cross section of each horizon can be admitted to have the topology of a different lens space L(n;1)=S^3/Z_n addition to S^3.
