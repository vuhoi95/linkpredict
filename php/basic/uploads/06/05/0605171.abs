Title: M-Theory of Matrix Models
Authors: A. Alexandrov and A. Mironov and A. Morozov
Abstract: Small M-theories unify various models of a given family in the same way as the M-theory unifies a variety of superstring models. We consider this idea in application to the family of eigenvalue matrix models: their M-theory unifies various branches of Hermitean matrix model (including Dijkgraaf-Vafa partition functions) with Kontsevich tau-function. Moreover, the corresponding duality relations look like direct analogues of instanton and meron decompositions, familiar from Yang-Mills theory.
