Title: Transition from quintessence to phantom phase in quintom model
Authors: H. Mohseni Sadjadi and M. Alimohammadi
Abstract: Assuming the Hubble parameter is a continuous and differentiable function of comoving time, we investigate necessary conditions for quintessence to phantom phase transition in quintom model. For power-law and exponential potential examples, we study the behavior of dynamical dark energy fields and Hubble parameter near the transition time, and show that the phantom-divide-line w=-1 is crossed in these models.
