Title: Inverse Symmetry Breaking in Multi-Scalar Field Theories
Authors: Marcus Benghi Pinto and Rudnei O. Ramos
Abstract: We review how the phenomena of inverse symmetry breaking (and symmetry nonrestoration) may arise in the context of relativistic as well as nonrelativistic multi-scalar field theories. We discuss how the consideration of thermal effects on the couplings produce different transition patterns for both theories. For the relativistic case, these effects allow the appearance of inverse symmetry breaking (and symmetry nonrestoration) at arbitrarily large temperatures. On the other hand, the same phenomena are suppressed in the nonrelativistic case, which is relevant for condensed matter physics. In this case, symmetry nonrestoration does not happen while inverse symmetry is allowed only to be followed by symmetry restoration characterizing a reentrant phase. The aim of this paper is to give more insight concerning the, qualitatively correct, results obtained by using one loop perturbation theory in the evaluation of thermal masses and couplings.
