Title: Geometric obstruction of black holes
Authors: Raffaele Punzi and Frederic P. Schuller and Mattias N. R. Wohlfarth
Abstract: We study the global structure of Lorentzian manifolds with partial sectional curvature bounds. In particular, we prove completeness theorems for homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies as well as static spherically symmetric spacetimes. The latter result is used to rigorously prove the absence of static spherically symmetric black holes in more than three dimensions. The proofs of these new results are preceded by a detailed exposition of the local aspects of sectional curvature bounds for Lorentzian manifolds, which extends and strengthens previous constructions.
