Title: Positronium collapse and the maximum magnetic field in pure QED
Authors: Anatoly E. Shabad and Vladimir V. Usov
Abstract: A maximum value for the magnetic field is determined, which provides the full compensation of the positronium rest mass by the binding energy in the maximum symmetry state and disappearance of the energy gap separating the electron-positron system from the vacuum. The compensation becomes possible owing to the falling to the center phenomenon. The maximum magnetic field may be related to the vacuum and describe its structure.
