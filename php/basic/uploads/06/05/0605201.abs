Abstract: In this work we explore many directions in the framework of gauge-gravity dualities. In type IIB theory we give an explicit derivation of the local metric for five branes wrapped on rigid two-cycles. Our derivation involves various interplays between warp factors, dualities and fluxes and the final result confirms our earlier predictions. We also find a novel dipole-like deformation of the background due to an inherent orientifold projection in the full global geometry. The supergravity solution for this deformation takes into account various things like the presence of a non-trivial background topology and fluxes as well as branes. Considering these, we manage to calculate the precise local solution using equations of motion. We also show that this dipole-like deformation has the desired property of decoupling the Kaluza-Klein modes from the IR gauge theory. Finally, for the heterotic theory we find new non-Kahler complex manifolds that partake in the full gauge-gravity dualities and study the mathematical structures of these manifolds including the torsion classes, Betti numbers and other topological data.
