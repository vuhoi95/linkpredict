Title: A note on dimer models and McKay quivers
Authors: Kazushi Ueda and Masahito Yamazaki
Abstract: We give one formulation of an algorithm of Hanany and Vegh which takes a lattice polygon as an input and produces a set of isoradial dimer models. We study the case of lattice triangles in detail and discuss the relation with coamoebas following Feng, He, Kennaway and Vafa.
