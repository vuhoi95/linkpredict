Title: New realizations of Lie algebra kappa-deformed Euclidean space
Authors: Stjepan Meljanac and Marko Stojic
Abstract: We study Lie algebra $\kappa$-deformed Euclidean space with undeformed rotation algebra $SO_a(n)$ and commuting vectorlike derivatives. Infinitely many realizations in terms of commuting coordinates are constructed and a corresponding star product is found for each of them. The $\kappa$-deformed noncommutative space of the Lie algebra type with undeformed Poincar{\'e} algebra and with the corresponding deformed coalgebra is constructed in a unified way.
