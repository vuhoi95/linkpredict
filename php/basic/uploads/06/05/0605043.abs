Title: Asymptotically nonflat Einstein-Born-Infeld-dilaton black holes with  Liouville-type potential
Authors: A. Sheykhi and N. Riazi and M. H. Mahzoon
Abstract: We construct some classes of electrically charged, static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions of the four-dimensional Einstein-Born-Infeld-dilaton gravity in the absence and presence of Liouville-type potential for the dilaton field and investigate their properties. These solutions are neither asymptotically flat nor (anti)-de Sitter. We show that in the presence of the Liouville-type potential, there exist two classes of solutions. We also compute temperature, entropy, charge and mass of the black hole solutions, and find that these quantities satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. We find that in order to fully satisfy all the field equations consistently, there must be a relation between the electric charge and other parameters of the system..
