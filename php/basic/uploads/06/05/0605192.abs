Title: The conformal deformation detour complex for the obstruction tensor
Authors: Thomas Branson and A. Rod Gover
Abstract: On pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of even dimension $n\geq 4$, with everywhere vanishing (Fefferman-Graham) obstruction tensor, we construct a complex of conformally invariant differential operators. The complex controls the infinitesimal deformations of obstruction-flat structures, and, in the case of Riemannian signature the complex is elliptic.
