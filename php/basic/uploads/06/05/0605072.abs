Title: Rotating Solution of Einstein-Maxwell Dilaton Gravity with Unusual  Asymptotics
Authors: A. Sheykhi and N. Riazi
Abstract: We study electrically charged, dilaton black holes, which possess infinitesimal angular momentum in the presence of one or two Liouville type potentials. These solutions are neither asymptotically flat nor (anti)-de Sitter. Some properties of the solutions are discussed.
