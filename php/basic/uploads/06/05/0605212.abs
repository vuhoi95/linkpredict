Title: Bulk fields in AdS_5 from probe D7 branes
Authors: Tony Gherghetta and Joel Giedt
Abstract: We relate bulk fields in Randall-Sundrum AdS_5 phenomenological models to the world-volume fields of probe D7 branes in the Klebanov-Witten background of type IIB string theory. The string constructions are described by AdS_5 X T^{1,1} in their near-horizon geometry, with T^{1,1} a 5d compact internal manifold that yields N=1 supersymmetry in the dual 4d gauge theory. The effective 5d Lagrangian description derived from the explicit string construction leads to additional features that are not usually encountered in phenomenological model building.
