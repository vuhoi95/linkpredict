Title: Monopole Decay in a Variable External Field
Authors: A. K. Monin and A. V. Zayakin
Abstract: The rate of monopole decay into a dyon and an electron in an inhomogeneous external electric field is calculated by semiclassical methods. Comparison is made to an earlier result where this quantity was calculated for a constant field. Experimental and cosmological tests are suggested.
