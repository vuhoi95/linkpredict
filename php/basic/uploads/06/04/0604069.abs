Title: A Paradox on Quantum Field Theory of Neutrino Mixing and Oscillations
Authors: Y. F. Li and Q. Y. Liu
Abstract: Neutrino mixing and oscillations in quantum field theory framework had been studied before, which shew that the Fock space of flavor states is unitarily inequivalent to that of mass states (inequivalent vacua model). A paradox emerges when we use these neutrino weak states to calculate the amplitude of $W$ boson decay. The branching ratio of W(+) -> e(+) + nu_mu to W(+) -> e(+) + nu_e is approximately at the order of O({m_i^2}/{k^2}). The existence of flavor changing currents contradicts to the Hamiltonian we started from, and the usual knowledge about weak processes. Also, negative energy neutrinos (or violating the principle of energy conservation) appear in this framework. We discuss possible reasons for the appearance of this paradox.
