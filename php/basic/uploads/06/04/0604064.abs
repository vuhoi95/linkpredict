Title: The false vacuum bubble nucleation due to a nonminimally coupled scalar  field
Authors: Wonwoo Lee and Bum-Hoon Lee and Chul H. Lee and Chanyong Park
Abstract: We study the possibility of forming the false vacuum bubble nucleated within the true vacuum background via the true-to-false vacuum phase transition in curved spacetime. We consider a semiclassical Euclidean bubble in the Einstein theory of gravity with a nonminimally coupled scalar field. In this paper we present the numerical computations as well as the approximate analytical computations. We mention the evolution of the false vacuum bubble after nucleation.
