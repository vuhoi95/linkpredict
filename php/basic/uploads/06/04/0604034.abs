Title: Strings at future singularities
Authors: Adam Balcerzak and Mariusz P. Dabrowski
Abstract: We discuss the behaviour of strings propagating in spacetimes which allow future singularities of either a sudden future or a Big-Rip type. We show that in general the invariant string size remains finite at sudden future singularities while it grows to infinity at a Big-Rip. This claim is based on the discussion of both the tensile and null strings. In conclusion, strings may survive a sudden future singularity, but not a Big-Rip where they are infinitely stretched.
