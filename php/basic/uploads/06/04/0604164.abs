Title: Combinatorics and field theory
Authors: Carl M. Bender and Dorje C. Brody and Bernhard K. Meister
Abstract: For any given sequence of integers there exists a quantum field theory whose Feynman rules produce that sequence. An example is illustrated for the Stirling numbers. The method employed here offers a new direction in combinatorics and graph theory.
