Abstract: By using $\phi$ -mapping method, we discuss the topological structure of the self-duality solution in Jackiw-Pi model in terms of gauge potential decomposition. We set up relationship between Chern-Simons vortices solution and topological number which is determined by Hopf index and and Brouwer degree. We also give the quantization of flux in the case. Then, we study the angular momentum of the vortex, it can be expressed in terms of the flux.
