Title: Effects from inhomogeneities in the chiral transition
Authors: Bruno G. Taketani and Eduardo S. Fraga
Abstract: We consider an approximation procedure to evaluate the finite-temperature one-loop fermionic density in the presence of a chiral background field which systematically incorporates effects from inhomogeneities in the chiral field through a derivative expansion. We apply the method to the case of a simple low-energy effective chiral model which is commonly used in the study of the chiral phase transition, the linear sigma-model coupled to quarks. The modifications in the effective potential and their consequences for the bubble nucleation process are discussed.
