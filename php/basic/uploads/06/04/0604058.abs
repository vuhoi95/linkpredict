Title: Calibrated Surfaces and Supersymmetric Wilson Loops
Authors: A. Dymarsky and S. Gubser and Z. Guralnik and J. Maldacena
Abstract: We study the dual gravity description of supersymmetric Wilson loops whose expectation value is unity. They are described by calibrated surfaces that end on the boundary of anti de-Sitter space and are pseudo-holomorphic with respect to an almost complex structure on an eight-dimensional slice of AdS_5 x S^5. The regularized area of these surfaces vanishes, in agreement with field theory non-renormalization theorems for the corresponding operators.
