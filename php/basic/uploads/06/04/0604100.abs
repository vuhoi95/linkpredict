Title: Higher Loop Bethe Ansatz for Open Spin-Chains in AdS/CFT
Authors: Keisuke Okamura and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We propose a perturbative asymptotic Bethe ansatz (PABA) for open spin-chain systems whose Hamiltonians are given by matrices of anomalous dimension for composite operators, and apply it to two types of composite operators related to two different brane configurations. One is an AdS_4 \times S^2-brane in the bulk AdS_5 \times S^5 which gives rise to a defect conformal field theory (dCFT) in the dual field theory, and the other is a giant graviton system with an open string excitation. In both cases, excitations on open strings attaching to D-branes (a D5-brane for the dCFT case, and a spherical D3-brane for the giant graviton case) can be represented by magnon states in the spin-chains with appropriate boundary conditions, in which informations of the D-branes are encoded. We concentrate on single-magnon problems, and explain how to calculate boundary S-matrices via the PABA technique. We also discuss the energy spectrum in the BMN limit.
