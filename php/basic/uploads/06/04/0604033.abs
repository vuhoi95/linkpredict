Title: Stability and thermodynamics of brane black holes
Authors: E. Abdalla and B. Cuadros-Melgar and A. B. Pavan and C. Molina
Abstract: We consider scalar and axial gravitational perturbations of black hole solutions in brane world scenarios. We show that perturbation dynamics is surprisingly similar to the Schwarzschild case with strong indications that the models are stable. Quasinormal modes and late-time tails are discussed. We also study the thermodynamics of these scenarios verifying the universality of Bekenstein's entropy bound as well as the applicability of 't Hooft's brickwall method.
