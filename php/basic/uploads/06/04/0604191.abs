Title: Worldsheet CFTs for Flat Monodrofolds
Authors: Simeon Hellerman and Johannes Walcher
Abstract: We resolve a puzzle in the theory of strings propagating on locally flat spacetimes with nontrivial Wilson lines for stringy Z_N gauge symmetries. We find that strings probing such backgrounds are described by consistent worldsheet CFTs. The level mismatch in the twisted sectors is compensated by adjusting the quantization of momentum of strings winding around the Wilson line direction in units of 1/(N^2 R) rather than 1/(N R), as might have been classically expected. We demonstrate in various examples how this improvement of the naive orbifold prescription leads to satisfaction of general physical principles such as level matching and closure of the OPE. Applying our techniques to construct a Wilson line for T-duality of a torus in the type II string (``T-fold''), we find a new 7D solution with N=1 SUSY where the moduli of the fiber torus are fixed. When the size of the base becomes small this simple monodrofold exhibits enhanced gauge symmetry and a self-T-duality on the S^1 base.
