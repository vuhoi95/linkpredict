Title: Hyper-Kaehler geometry and dualization
Authors: S. Bellucci and S. Krivonos and A. Shcherbakov
Abstract: We demonstrate that in N=8 supersymmetric mechanics with linear and nonlinear chiral supermultiplets one may dualize two auxiliary fields into physical ones in such a way that the bosonic manifold will be a hyper-Kaehler one. The key point of our construction is about different dualizations of the two auxiliary components. One of them is turned into a physical one in the standard way through its replacement by the total time derivative of some physical field. The other auxiliary field is dualized through a Lagrange multiplier. We clarify this choice of dualization by presenting the analogy with a three-dimensional case.
