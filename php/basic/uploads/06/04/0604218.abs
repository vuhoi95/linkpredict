Title: Resonance in Asymmetric Warped Geometry
Authors: Gregory Gabadadze and Luca Grisa and Yanwen Shang
Abstract: We study the spectrum of an asymmetric warped braneworld model with different AdS curvatures on either side of the brane. In addition to the RS-like modes we find a resonance state. Its mass is proportional to the geometric mean of the two AdS curvature scales, while the difference between them determines the strength of the resonance peak. There is a complementarity between the RS zero-mode and the resonance: making the asymmetry stronger weakens the zero-mode but strengthens the resonance, and vice versa. We calculate numerically the braneworld gravitational potential and discuss the holographic correspondence for the asymmetric model.
