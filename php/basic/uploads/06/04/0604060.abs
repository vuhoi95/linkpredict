Title: Generalized forms and vector fields
Authors: Saikat Chatterjee and Amitabha Lahiri and Partha Guha
Abstract: The generalized vector is defined on an $n$ dimensional manifold. Interior product, Lie derivative acting on generalized $p$-forms, $-1\le p\le n$ are introduced. Generalized commutator of two generalized vectors are defined. Adding a correction term to Cartan's formula the generalized Lie derivative's action on a generalized vector field is defined. We explore various identities of the generalized Lie derivative with respect to generalized vector fields, and discuss an application.
