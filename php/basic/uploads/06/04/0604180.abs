Title: Supersymmetric Rings in Field Theory
Authors: Jose J. Blanco-Pillado and Michele Redi
Abstract: We study the dynamics of BPS string-like objects obtained by lifting monopole and dyon solutions of N=2 Super-Yang-Mills theory to five dimensions. We present exact traveling wave solutions which preserve half of the supersymmetries. Upon compactification this leads to macroscopic BPS rings in four dimensions in field theory. Due to the fact that the strings effectively move in six dimensions the same procedure can also be used to obtain rings in five dimensions by using the hidden dimension.
