Title: Power-law Parameterized Quintessence Model
Authors: Sohrab Rahvar and M. Sadegh Movahed
Abstract: We introduce a power-law parameterized quintessence model for the dark energy which accelerate universe at the low redshifts while behaves as an ordinary matter for the early universe. We construct a unique scalar potential for this parameterized quintessence model. As the observational test, the Supernova Type Ia (SNIa) Gold sample data, size of baryonic acoustic peak from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the position of the acoustic peak from the CMB observations and structure formation from the 2dFGRS survey are used to constrain the parameters of the quintessence model. The best fit parameters indicates that the equation of state of this model at the present time is less than one $(w_0<-1)$ which violates the energy condition in General Relativity. Finally we compare the age of old objects with age of universe in this model.
