Title: Dynamical origin of the $\star_θ$-noncommutativity in field theory  from quantum mechanics
Authors: Marcos Rosenbaum and J. David Vergara and L. Román Juárez
Abstract: We show that introducing an extended Heisenberg algebra in the context of the Weyl-Wigner-Groenewold-Moyal formalism leads to a deformed product of the classical dynamical variables that is inherited to the level of quantum field theory, and that allows us to relate the operator space noncommutativity in quantum mechanics to the quantum group inspired algebra deformation noncommutativity in field theory.
