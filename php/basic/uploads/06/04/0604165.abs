Title: Remarks on Resonant Scalars in the AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: M. Banados and A. Schwimmer and S. Theisen
Abstract: The special properties of scalars having a mass such that the two possible dimensions of the dual scalar respect the unitarity and the Breitenlohner-Freedman bounds and their ratio is integral (``resonant scalars'') are studied in the AdS/CFT correspondence. The role of logarithmic branches in the gravity theory is related to the existence of a trace anomaly and to a marginal deformation in the Conformal Field Theory. The existence of asymptotic charges for the conformal group in the gravity theory is interpreted in terms of the properties of the corresponding CFT.
