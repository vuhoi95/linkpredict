Title: Matrix eigenvalue model: Feynman graph technique for all genera
Authors: Leonid Chekhov and Bertrand Eynard
Abstract: We present the diagrammatic technique for calculating the free energy of the matrix eigenvalue model (the model with arbitrary power $\beta$ by the Vandermonde determinant) to all orders of 1/N expansion in the case where the limiting eigenvalue distribution spans arbitrary (but fixed) number of disjoint intervals (curves).
