Title: 4D singular oscillator and generalized MIC-Kepler system
Authors: L. G. Mardoyan and M. G. Petrosyan
Abstract: It is shown that the generalized MIC-Kepler system and four-dimensional singular oscillator are dual to each other and the duality transformation is the generalized version of the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation.
