Title: Scattering and Bound State Green's Functions on a Plane via so(2,1) Lie  Algebra
Authors: P. F. Borges and H. Boschi-Filho and A. N. Vaidya
Abstract: We calculate the Green's functions for the particle-vortex system, for two anyons on a plane with and without a harmonic regulator and in a uniform magnetic field. These Green's functions which describe scattering or bound states (depending on the specific potential in each case) are obtained exactly using an algebraic method related to the SO(2,1) Lie group. From these Green's functions we obtain the corresponding wave functions and for the bound states we also find the energy spectra.
