Title: Gauge symmetries decrease the number of Dp-brane dimensions
Authors: B. Nikolic and B. Sazdovic
Abstract: It is known that the presence of antisymmetric background field $B_{\mu\nu}$ leads to noncommutativity of Dp-brane manifold. Addition of the linear dilaton field in the form $\Phi(x)=\Phi_0+a_\mu x^\mu$, causes the appearance of the commutative Dp-brane coordinate $x=a_\mu x^\mu$. In the present article we show that for some particular choices of the background fields, $a^2\equiv G^{\mu\nu}a_\mu a_\nu=0$ and $\tilde a^2\equiv [ (G-4BG^{-1}B)^{-1}\ ]^{\mu\nu}a_\mu a_\nu=0$, the local gauge symmetries appear in the theory. They turn some Neuman boundary conditions into the Dirichlet ones, and consequently decrease the number of the Dp-brane dimensions.
