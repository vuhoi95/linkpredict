Title: The fundamental non critical string
Authors: Adrian R. Lugo and Mauricio B. Sturla
Abstract: We obtain the (super) gravity solution in arbitrary space-time dimension less than ten, that gives a low energy description of a fundamental string embedded in a non critical vacuum, product of $d$-dimensional Minkowski space-time and a cigar-like geometry with scale $r_0$. This solution, one of the few known examples of objects doubly localized, both at the origin of the transverse space as well as at the tip of the cigar, is determined by its charge $Q$ under the Kalb-Ramond gauge field $B$, and presumably preserves, for even $d$, $2^\frac{d}{2}$ supercharges. Moreover, we show that the solution is reliable at least in a region far away from both origins, as it is the case with the well known branes of critical string theory.
