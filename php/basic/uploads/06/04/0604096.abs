Title: Scalar Casimir effect with non-local boundary conditions
Authors: Aram Saharian and Giampiero Esposito
Abstract: Non-local boundary conditions have been considered in theoretical high-energy physics with emphasis on one-loop quantum cosmology, one-loop conformal anomalies, Bose-Einstein condensation models and spectral branes. We have therefore studied the Wightman function, the vacuum expectation value of the field square and the energy-momentum tensor for a massive scalar field satisfying non-local boundary conditions on a single and two parallel plates. Interestingly, we find that suitable choices of the kernel in the non-local boundary conditions lead to forces acting on the plates that can be repulsive for intermediate distances.
