Abstract: Using 4D, N=1 superfield techniques, a discussion of the 6D sigma-model possessing simple supersymmetry is given. Two such approaches are described. Foremost it is shown that the simplest and most transparent description arises by use of a doublet of chiral scalar superfields for each 6D hypermultiplet. A second description that is most directly related to projective superspace is also presented. The latter necessarily implies the use of one chiral superfield and one nonminimal scalar superfield for each 6D hypermultiplet. A separate study of models of this class, outside the context of projective superspace, is also undertaken.
