Title: Tomography in abstract Hilbert spaces
Authors: V. I. Man'ko and G. Marmo and A. Simoni and F. Ventriglia
Abstract: The tomographic description of a quantum state is formulated in an abstract infinite dimensional Hilbert space framework, the space of the Hilbert-Schmidt linear operators, with trace formula as scalar product. Resolutions of the unity, written in terms of over-complete sets of rank-one projectors and of associated Gram-Schmidt operators taking into account their non-orthogonality, are then used to reconstruct a quantum state from its tomograms. Examples of well known tomographic descriptions illustrate the exposed theory.
