Title: Phantom Black Holes
Authors: C. J. Gao and S. N. Zhang
Abstract: The exact solutions of electrically charged phantom black holes with the cosmological constant are constructed. They are labelled by the mass, the electrical charge, the cosmological constant and the coupling constant between the phantom and the Maxwell field. It is found that the phantom has important consequences on the properties of black holes. In particular, the extremal charged phantom black holes can never be achieved and so the third law of thermodynamics for black holes still holds. The cosmological aspects of the phantom black hole and phantom field are also briefly discussed.
