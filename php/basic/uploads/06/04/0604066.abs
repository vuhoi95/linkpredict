Title: Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics of submanifolds
Authors: G. Giachetta and L. Mangiarotti and G. Sardanashvily
Abstract: Submanifolds of a manifold are described as sections of a certain fiber bundle that enables one to consider their Lagrangian and (polysymplectic) Hamiltonian dynamics as that of a particular classical field theory. In particular, their Lagrangians and Hamiltonians must satisfy rather restrictive Noether identities. For instance, this is the case of relativistic mechanics and classical string theory.
