Title: The Topological Cigar Observables
Authors: Sujay K. Ashok and Jan Troost
Abstract: We study the topologically twisted cigar, namely the SL(2,R)/U(1) superconformal field theory at arbitrary level, and find the BRST cohomology of the topologically twisted N=2 theory. We find a one to one correspondence between the spectrum of the twisted coset and singular vectors in the Wakimoto modules constructed over the SL(2,R) current algebra. The topological cigar cohomology is the crucial ingredient in calculating the closed string spectrum of topological strings on non-compact Gepner models.
