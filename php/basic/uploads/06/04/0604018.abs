Title: Baxter operators for the quantum sl(3) invariant spin chain
Authors: S. E. Derkachov and A. N. Manashov
Abstract: The noncompact homogeneous sl(3) invariant spin chains are considered. We show that the transfer matrix with generic auxiliary space is factorized into the product of three sl(3) invariant commuting operators. These operators satisfy the finite difference equations in the spectral parameters which follow from the structure of the reducible sl(3) modules.
