Title: Dark Energy as a Born-Infeld Gauge Interaction Violating the Equivalence  Principle
Authors: A. Fuzfa and J. -M. Alimi
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that dark energy does not couple to gravitation in the same way than ordinary matter, yielding a violation of the weak and strong equivalence principles on cosmological scales. We build a transient mechanism in which gravitation is pushed away from general relativity by a Born-Infeld gauge interaction acting as an "Abnormally Weighting" (dark) Energy. This mechanism accounts for the Hubble diagram of far-away supernovae by cosmic acceleration and time variation of the gravitational constant while accounting naturally for the present tests on general relativity.
