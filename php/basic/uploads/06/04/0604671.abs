Title: Theory of Ultracold Superstrings
Authors: Michiel Snoek and S. Vandoren and H. T. C. Stoof
Abstract: The combination of a vortex line in a one-dimensional optical lattice with fermions bound to the vortex core makes up an ultracold superstring. We give a detailed derivation of the way to make this supersymmetric string in the laboratory. In particular, we discuss the presence of a fermionic bound state in the vortex core and the tuning of the laser beams needed to achieve supersymmetry. Moreover, we discuss experimental consequences of supersymmetry and identify the precise supersymmetry in the problem. Finally, we make the mathematical connection with string theory.
