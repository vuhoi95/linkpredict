Title: Kinky Strings in AdS_5 x S^5
Authors: Tristan McLoughlin and Xinkai Wu
Abstract: We construct a family of closed string solutions with kinks in a subspace of AdS_5 x S^5 and study their properties. In certain limits these solutions become folded pulsating strings, although in general they are made of multiple pulsating rectangles. One unusual feature of these solutions is that their monodromy matrices are trivial, leading to vanishing quasi-momenta. Exact Backlund transformations of these solutions are found, again giving vanishing higher conserved charges. We also consider the fluctuation modes around these solutions as well as the semiclassical splitting of these strings.
