Title: Notes on High Energy Limit of Bosonic Closed String Scattering  Amplitudes
Authors: Chuan-Tsung Chan and Jen-Chi Lee and Yi Yang
Abstract: We study bosonic closed string scattering amplitudes in the high-energy limit. We find that the methods of decoupling of high-energy zero-norm states and the high-energy Virasoro constraints, which were adopted in the previous works to calculate the ratios among high-energy open string scattering amplitudes of different string states, persist for the case of closed string. However, we clarify the previous saddle-point calculation for high-energy open string scattering amplitudes and claim that only (t,u) channel of the amplitudes is suitable for saddle-point calculation. We then discuss three evidences to show that saddle-point calculation for high-energy closed string scattering amplitudes is not reliable. By using the relation of tree-level closed and open string scattering amplitudes of Kawai, Lewellen and Tye (KLT), we calculate the high-energy closed string scattering amplitudes for arbitrary mass levels. For the case of high-energy closed string four-tachyon amplitude, our result differs from the previous one of Gross and Mende, which is NOT consistent with KLT formula, by an oscillating factor.
