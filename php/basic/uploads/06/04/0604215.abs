Abstract: We perform a detailed analysis of one-loop corrections to the self-energy of the (off-shell) gauge bosons in six-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories on orbifolds. After discussing the Abelian case in the standard Feynman diagram approach, we extend the analysis to the non-Abelian case by employing the method of an orbifold-compatible one-loop effective action for a classical background gauge field. We find that bulk higher derivative and brane-localised gauge kinetic terms are required to cancel one-loop divergences of the gauge boson self energy. After their renormalisation we study the momentum dependence of both the higher derivative coupling h(k^2) and the {\it effective} gauge coupling g_eff(k^2). For momenta smaller than the compactification scales, we obtain the 4D logarithmic running of g_eff(k^2), with suppressed power-like corrections, while the higher derivative coupling is constant. We present in detail the threshold corrections to the low energy gauge coupling, due to the massive bulk modes. At momentum scales above the compactification scales, the higher derivative operator becomes important and leads to a power-like running of g_eff(k^2) with respect to the momentum scale. The coefficient of this running is at all scales equal to the renormalised coupling of the higher derivative operator which ensures the quantum consistency of the model. We discuss the relation to the similar one-loop correction in the heterotic string, to show that the higher derivative operators are relevant in that case too, since the field theory limit of the one-loop string correction does not commute with the infrared regularisation of the (on-shell) string result.
