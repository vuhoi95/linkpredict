Title: Bubble break-off in Hele-Shaw flows : Singularities and integrable  structures
Authors: Seung-Yeop Lee and Eldad Bettelheim and Paul Wiegmann
Abstract: Bubbles of inviscid fluid surrounded by a viscous fluid in a Hele-Shaw cell can merge and break-off. During the process of break-off, a thinning neck pinches off to a universal self-similar singularity. We describe this process and reveal its integrable structure: it is a solution of the dispersionless limit of the AKNS hierarchy. The singular break-off patterns are universal, not sensitive to details of the process and can be seen experimentally. We briefly discuss the dispersive regularization of the Hele-Shaw problem and the emergence of the Painlev\'e II equation at the break-off.
