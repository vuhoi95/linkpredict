Title: Special Graphs
Authors: Chandrashekar Devchand and Jean Nuyts and Gregor Weingart
Abstract: A special p-form is a p-form which, in some orthonormal basis {e_\mu}, has components \phi_{\mu_1...\mu_p} = \phi(e_{\mu_1},..., e_{\mu_p}) taking values in {-1,0,1}. We discuss graphs which characterise such forms.
