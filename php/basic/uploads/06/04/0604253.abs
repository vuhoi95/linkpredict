Title: Collider and Dark Matter Searches in Models with Mixed Modulus-Anomaly  Mediated SUSY Breaking
Authors: Howard Baer and Eun-Kyung Park and Xerxes Tata and Ting T. Wang
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenology of supersymmetric models where moduli fields and the Weyl anomaly make comparable contributions to SUSY breaking effects in the observable sector of fields. This mixed modulus-anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking (MM-AMSB) scenario is inspired by models of string compactification with fluxes, which have been shown to yield a de Sitter vacuum (as in the recent construction by Kachru {\it et al}). The phenomenology depends on the so-called modular weights which, in turn, depend on the location of various fields in the extra dimensions. We find that the model with zero modular weights gives mass spectra characterized by very light top squarks and/or tau sleptons, or where M_1\sim -M_2 so that the bino and wino are approximately degenerate. The top squark mass can be in the range required by successful electroweak baryogenesis. The measured relic density of cold dark matter can be obtained via top squark co-annihilation at low \tan\beta, tau slepton co-annihilation at large \tan\beta or via bino-wino coannihilation. Then, we typically find low rates for direct and indirect detection of neutralino dark matter. However, essentially all the WMAP-allowed parameter space can be probed by experiments at the CERN LHC, while significant portions may also be explored at an e^+e^- collider with \sqrt{s}=0.5--1 TeV. We also investigate a case with non-zero modular weights. In this case, co-annihilation, A-funnel annihilation and bulk annihilation of neutralinos are all allowed. Results for future colliders are qualitatively similar, but prospects for indirect dark matter searches via gamma rays and anti-particles are somewhat better.
