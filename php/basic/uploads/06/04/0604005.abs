Title: The Casimir effect for a massless spin-3/2 field in Minkowski spacetime
Authors: Wenbiao Liu and Kui Xiao and Hongbao Zhang
Abstract: The Casimir effect has been studied for various quantum fields in both flat and curved spacetimes. As a further step along this line, we provide an explicit derivation of Casimir effect for massless spin-3/2 field with periodic boundary condition imposed in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The corresponding results with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are also discussed.
