Title: Moduli-Space Dynamics of Noncommutative Abelian Sigma-Model Solitons
Authors: Michael Klawunn and Olaf Lechtenfeld and Stefan Petersen
Abstract: In the noncommutative (Moyal) plane, we relate exact U(1) sigma-model solitons to generic scalar-field solitons for an infinitely stiff potential. The static k-lump moduli space C^k/S_k features a natural K"ahler metric induced from an embedding Grassmannian. The moduli-space dynamics is blind against adding a WZW-like term to the sigma-model action and thus also applies to the integrable U(1) Ward model. For the latter's two-soliton motion we compare the exact field configurations with their supposed moduli-space approximations. Surprisingly, the two do not match, which questions the adiabatic method for noncommutative solitons.
