Title: Gauge/string duality and hadronic physics
Authors: Henrique Boschi-Filho and Nelson R. F. Braga
Abstract: We review some recent results on phenomenological approaches to strong interactions inspired in gauge/string duality. In particular, we discuss how such models lead to very good estimates for hadronic masses.
