Authors: Rachid Ahl Laamara and Lalla Btissam Drissi and El Hassan Saidi
Abstract: Motivated by similarities between quantum Hall systems \`{a} la Susskind and aspects of topological string theory on conifold as well as results obtained in hep-th/0601020, we study the dynamics of D-string fluids running in deformed conifold in presence of a strong and constant RR background B-field. We first introduce the basis of D-string system in fluid approximation and then derive the holomorphic non commutative gauge invariant field action describing its dynamics in conifold. This study may be also viewed as embedding Susskind description for Laughlin liquid in type IIB string theory. FQH systems on real manifolds $R\times S^{2}$ and $S^{3}$ are shown to be recovered by restricting conifold to its Lagrangian sub-manifolds. Aspects of quantum behaviour of the string fluid are discussed.
