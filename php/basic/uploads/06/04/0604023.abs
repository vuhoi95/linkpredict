Title: A Fermi Surface Model for Large Supersymmetric AdS_5 Black Holes
Authors: Micha Berkooz and Dori Reichmann and Joan Simon
Abstract: We identify a large family of 1/16 BPS operators in N=4 SYM that qualitatively reproduce the relations between charge, angular momentum and entropy in regular supersymmetric AdS_5 black holes when the main contribution to their masses is given by their angular momentum.
