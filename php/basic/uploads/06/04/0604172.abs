Title: D-Brane solutions in a light-like linear dilaton background
Authors: Rashmi R. Nayak and Kamal L. Panigrahi
Abstract: The light-like linear dilaton background presents a simple time dependent solution of type II supergravity equations of motion that preserves 1/2 supersymmetry in ten dimensions. We construct supergravity D-brane solutions in a linear dilaton background starting from the known intersecting brane solutions in string theory. By applying a Penrose limit on the intersecting (NS1-NS5-NS5')- brane solution, we find out a D5-brane in a linear dilaton background. We solve the Killing spinor equations for the brane solutions explicitly, and show that they preserve 1/4 supersymmetry. We also find a M5-brane solution in eleven dimensional supergravity.
