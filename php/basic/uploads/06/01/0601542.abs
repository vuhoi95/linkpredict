Title: Collapse of Positronium and Vacuum Instability
Authors: A. E. Shabad and V. V. Usov
Abstract: A hypercritical value for the magnetic field is determined, which provides the full compensation of the positronium rest mass by the binding energy in the maximum symmetry state and disappearance of the energy gap separating the electron-positron system from the vacuum. The compensation becomes possible owing to the falling to the center phenomenon. The structure of the vacuum is described in terms of strongly localized states of tightly mutually bound (or confined) pairs. Their delocalization for still higher magnetic field, capable of screening its further growth, is discussed.
