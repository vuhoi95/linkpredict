Title: Incorporating Memory Effects in Phase Separation Processes
Authors: T. Koide and G. Krein and Rudnei O. Ramos
Abstract: We consider the modification of the Cahn-Hilliard equation when a time delay process through a memory function is taken into account. We then study the process of spinodal decomposition in fast phase transitions associated with a conserved order parameter. Finite-time memory effects are seen to affect the dynamics of phase transition at short times and have the effect of delaying, in a significant way, the process of rapid growth of the order parameter that follows a quench into the spinodal region. These effects are important in several systems characterized by fast processes, like nonequilibrium dynamics in the early universe and in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
