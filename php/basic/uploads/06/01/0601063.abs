Title: Radial Loewner equation and dispersionless cmKP hierarchy
Authors: Kanehisa Takasaki and Takashi Takebe
Abstract: It has been shown that the dispersionless KP hierarchy (or the Benney hierarchy) is reduced to the chordal L\"owner equation. We show that the radial L\"owner equation also gives reduction of a dispersionless type integrable system. The resulting system acquires another degree of freedom and becomes the dcmKP hierarchy, which is a ``half'' of the dispersionless Toda hierarchy. The results of this article was announced in nlin.SI/0512008.
