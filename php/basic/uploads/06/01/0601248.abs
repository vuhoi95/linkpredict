Title: On Dark Matter Self-Interactions from Higher Dimensional Gravity
Authors: Nicolas Chatillon and Cosmin Macesanu and Aleksandr Pinzul and Mark Trodden
Abstract: It has recently been suggested that in a brane world scenario with large extra dimensions, short distance gravitational interactions can enhance the dark matter scattering cross-section in a velocity dependent way. Such a modification may then help to address possible problems with non-interacting cold dark matter on galactic and sub-galactic scales. We argue that, considering the singular character of the higher dimensional Newtonian potential, the scattering cross-section is UV-dependent, depending ultimately on the underlying quantum gravity theory considered. We demonstrate that for a wide class of unitary short distance regularizations, the actual cross-section is velocity-independent and does not significantly affect dark matter substructure. We comment on the problem of thermalization of ultra-light cold dark matter by gravitational interactions in the early universe.
