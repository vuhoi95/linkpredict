Abstract: Slow-roll inflation can be studied as an effective field theory. The form of the inflaton potential consistent with the data is V(phi) = N M^4 w(phi/[sqrt{N} M_{Pl}]) where phi is the inflaton field, M is the inflation energy scale, and N ~ 50 the number of efolds. The dimensionless function w(chi) and field chi are O(1). This form of the potential encodes the slow-roll expansion as an expansion in 1/N.A The Hubble parameter, inflaton mass and non-linear couplings are of the see-saw form in terms of M/M_{Pl}. The quartic coupling is lambda~1/N (M/M_{Pl})^4. The smallness of the non-linear couplings is not a result of fine tuning but a natural consequence of the validity of the effective field theory and slow roll approximation. Quantum corrections to slow roll inflation are computed and turn to be an expansion in powers (H/M_{Pl})^2. The corrections to the inflaton effective potential and its equation of motion are computed, as well as the quantum corrections to the observable power spectra. The near scale invariance of the fluctuations introduces a strong infrared behavior naturally regularized by Delta=(n_s -1)/2+r/8. We consider scalar curvature and tensor perturbations as well as light scalars and Dirac fermions coupled to the inflaton.The subhorizon part is completely specified by the trace anomaly of the fields with different spins and is solely determined by the space-time geometry. This inflationary effective potential is strikingly different from the usual Minkowski space-time result.Quantum corrections to the power spectra are expressed in terms of the CMB observables. Trace anomalies (especially the graviton part) dominate these quantum corrections in a definite direction: they enhance the scalar curvature fluctuations and reduce the tensor fluctuations.
