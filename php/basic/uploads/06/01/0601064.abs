Title: Type IIA Pati-Salam Flux Vacua
Authors: Ching-Ming Chen and Tianjun Li and Dimitri V. Nanopoulos
Abstract: We show that for supersymmetric AdS vacua on Type IIA orientifolds with flux compactifications, the RR tadpole cancellation conditions can be completely relaxed, and then the four-dimensional N=1 supersymmetry conditions are the main constraints on consistent intersecting D6-brane model building. We construct two kinds of three-family Pati-Salam models. In the first kind of models, the suitable three-family SM fermion masses and mixings can be generated at the stringy tree level, and then the rank one problem for the SM fermion Yukawa matrices can be solved. In the second kind of models, only the third family of the SM fermions can obtain masses at tree level. In these models, the complex structure parameters can be determined by supersymmetric D6-brane configurations, and all the moduli may be stabilized. The initial gauge symmetries U(4)_C \times U(2)_L \times U(2)_R and U(4)_C \times USp(2)_L \times U(2)_R can be broken down to the SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_{B-L} \times U(1)_{I_{3R}} due to the Green-Schwarz mechanism and D6-brane splittings, and further down to the SM gauge symmetry around the string scale via the supersymmetry preserving Higgs mechanism. Comparing to the previous model building, we have less bidoublet Higgs fields. However, there generically exist some exotic particles.
