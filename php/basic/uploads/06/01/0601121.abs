Abstract: We show the twisted Galilean invariance of the noncommutative parameter, even in presence of space-time noncommutativity. We then obtain the deformed algebra of the Schr\"odinger field in configuration and momentum space by studying the action of the twisted Galilean group on the non-relativistic limit of the Klein-Gordon field. Using this deformed algebra we compute the two particle correlation function to study the possible extent to which the previously proposed violation of the Pauli principle may impact at low energies. It is concluded that any possible effect is probably well beyond detection at current energies.
