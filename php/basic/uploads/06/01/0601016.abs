Title: Non-Supersymmetric Attractors and Entropy Function
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha and Hajar Ebrahim
Abstract: We study the entropy of non-supersymmetric extremal black holes which exhibit attractor mechanism by making use of the entropy function. This method, being simple, can be used to calculate corrections to the entropy due to higher order corrections to the action. In particular we apply this method for five dimensional non-supersymmetric extremal black hole which carries two magnetic charges and find the R^2 corrections to the entropy. Using the behavior of the action evaluated for the extremal black hole near the horizon, we also present a simple expression for C-function corrected by higher order corrections.
