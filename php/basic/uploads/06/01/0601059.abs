Title: On Action Invariance under Linear Spinor-Vector Supersymmetry
Authors: Kazunari Shima and Motomu Tsuda
Abstract: We show explicitly that a free Lagrangian expressed in terms of scalar, spinor, vector and Rarita-Schwinger (RS) fields is invariant under linear supersymmetry transformations generated by a global spinor-vector parameter. A (generalized) gauge invariance of the Lagrangian for the RS field is also discussed.
