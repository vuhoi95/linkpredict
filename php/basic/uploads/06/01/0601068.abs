Title: Chern-Simons Theory on S^1-Bundles: Abelianisation and q-deformed  Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Matthias Blau and George Thompson
Abstract: We study Chern-Simons theory on 3-manifolds $M$ that are circle-bundles over 2-dimensional surfaces $\Sigma$ and show that the method of Abelianisation, previously employed for trivial bundles $\Sigma \times S^1$, can be adapted to this case. This reduces the non-Abelian theory on $M$ to a 2-dimensional Abelian theory on $\Sigma$ which we identify with q-deformed Yang-Mills theory, as anticipated by Vafa et al. We compare and contrast our results with those obtained by Beasley and Witten using the method of non-Abelian localisation, and determine the surgery and framing presecription implicit in this path integral evaluation. We also comment on the extension of these methods to BF theory and other generalisations.
