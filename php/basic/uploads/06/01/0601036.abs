Title: Supersymmetry breaking and the radion in AdS_4 brane-worlds
Authors: Andrey Katz and Yael Shadmi and Yuri Shirman
Abstract: We compute the one-loop correction to the radion potential in the Randall-Sundrum model with detuned brane tensions, with supersymmetry broken by boundary conditions. We concentrate on the small-warping limit, where the one-loop correction is significant. With pure supergravity, the correction is negative, but with bulk hypermultiplets, the correction can be positive, so that the 4d curvature can be lowered, with the radion stable. We use both the KK theory, and the 4d radion effective theory for this study.
