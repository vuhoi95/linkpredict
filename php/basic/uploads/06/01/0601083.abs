Title: Numerical analysis of backreaction in acoustic black holes
Authors: Roberto Balbinot and Alessandro Fabbri and Serena Fagnocchi and Alessandro Nagar
Abstract: Using methods of Quantum Field Theory in curved spacetime, the first order in hbar quantum corrections to the motion of a fluid in an acoustic black hole configuration are numerically computed. These corrections arise from the non linear backreaction of the emitted phonons. Time dependent (isolated system) and equilibrium configurations (hole in a sonic cavity) are both analyzed.
