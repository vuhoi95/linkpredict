Title: Non-Laplacian growth, algebraic domains and finite reflection groups
Authors: Igor Loutsenko and Oksana Yermolayeva
Abstract: Dynamics of planar domains with moving boundaries driven by the gradient of a scalar field that satisfies an elliptic PDE is studied. We consider the question: For which kind of PDEs the domains are algebraic, provided the field has singularities at a fixed point inside the domain? The construction reveals a direct connection with the theory of the Calogero-Moser systems related to finite reflection groups and their integrable deformations.
