Title: Features of gravity-Yang-Mills hierarchies in d-dimensions
Authors: Eugen Radu and Cristian Stelea and D. H. Tchrakian
Abstract: Higher dimensional, direct analogues of the usual d=4 Einstein--Yang-Mills (EYM) systems are studied. These consist of the gravitational and Yang-Mills hierarchies in d=4p dimensional spacetimes, both consisting of 2p-form curvature terms only. Regular and black hole solutions are constructed in $2p+2\le d \le 4p$, in which dimensions the total mass-energy is finite, generalising the familiar Bartnik-McKinnon solutions in EYM theory for p=1. In d=4p, this similarity is complete. In the special case of d=2p+1, just beyond the finite energy range of d, exact solutions in closed form are found. Finally, d=2p+1 purely gravitational systems, whose solutions generalise the static d=3 BTZ solutions, are discussed.
