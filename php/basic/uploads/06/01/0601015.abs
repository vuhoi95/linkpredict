Title: A Lorentz-violating SO(3) model: discussing the unitarity, causality and  the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles
Authors: A. P. Baeta Scarpelli and J. A. Helayel-Neto
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the analysis of the Lorentz-violating Quantum Eletrodynamics to the non-Abelian case: an SO(3) Yang-Mills Lagrangian with the addition of the non-Abelian Chern-Simons-type term. We consider the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the model and inspect its spectrum in order to check if unitarity and causality are respected. An analysis of the topological structure is also carried out and we show that a 't Hooft-Polyakov solution for monopoles is still present.
