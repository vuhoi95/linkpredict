Title: Casimir interaction between a plate and a cylinder
Authors: T. Emig and R. L. Jaffe and M. Kardar and A. Scardicchio
Abstract: We find the exact Casimir force between a plate and a cylinder, a geometry intermediate between parallel plates, where the force is known exactly, and the plate--sphere, where it is known at large separations. The force has an unexpectedly weak decay \sim L/(H^3 \ln(H/R)) at large plate--cylinder separations H (L and R are the cylinder length and radius), due to transverse magnetic modes. Path integral quantization with a partial wave expansion additionally gives a qualitative difference for the density of states of electric and magnetic modes, and corrections at finite temperatures.
