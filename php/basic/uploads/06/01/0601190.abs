Abstract: We study the possibility of using the D-term associated to an anomalous U(1) for the uplifting of AdS vacua (to dS or Minkowski vacua) in effective supergravities arising from string theories, particularly in the type IIB context put forward by Kachru, Kallosh, Linde and Trivedi (KKLT). We find a gauge invariant formulation of such a scenario (avoiding previous inconsistencies), where the anomalous D-term cannot be cancelled, thus triggering the uplifting of the vacua. Then, we examine the general conditions for this to happen. Finally, we illustrate the results by presenting different successful examples in the type IIB context.
