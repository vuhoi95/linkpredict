Title: Off-shell BRST-VSUSY superalgebra for D=4 BF theories in the  superconnection formalism
Authors: A. Aidaoui and M. Tahiri
Abstract: We propose the superconnection formalism to construct the off-shell BRST-VSUSY superalgebra for D=4 BF theories. The method is based on the natural introduction of physical fields as well as auxiliary fields via superconnections and their associated supercurvatures defined on a superspace. We also give a prescription to build the off-shell BRST-VSUSY exact quantum action.
