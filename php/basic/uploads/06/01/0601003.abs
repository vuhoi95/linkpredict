Title: New contribution to dimension five operators on proton decay in anomaly  mediation scenario
Authors: Naoyuki Haba and Nobuchika Okada
Abstract: In supergravity, effective superpotential relevant to dimension five operators on proton decay processes also leads to supersymmetry breaking terms among sfermions, dimension four operators. These dimension four operators induce the dimension five operators through 1-loop diagrams dressed by gauginos. We find that, in a class of models with the anomaly mediation, the 1-loop contributions can be comparable to those at the tree level. Therefore, such operators have a great impact on proton decay rate. Depending on a universal phase of gaugino masses and soft mass spectrum, the proton decay rate can be enhanced or suppressed.
