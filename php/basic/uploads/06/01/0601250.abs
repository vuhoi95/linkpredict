Abstract: From the defining exchange relations of the A_{q,p}(gl_{N}) elliptic quantum algebra, we construct subalgebras which can be characterized as q-deformed W_N algebras. The consistency conditions relating the parameters p,q,N and the central charge c are shown to be related to the singularity structure of the functional coefficients defining the exchange relations of specific vertex operators representations of A_{q,p}({gl_{N}) available when N=2.
