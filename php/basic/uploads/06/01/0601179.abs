Title: Casimir energy and the superconducting phase transition
Authors: Giuseppe Bimonte and Enrico Calloni and Giampiero Esposito and Luigi Rosa
Abstract: We study the influence of Casimir energy on the critical field of a superconducting film, and we show that by this means it might be possible to directly measure, for the first time, the variation of Casimir energy that accompanies the superconducting transition. It is shown that this novel approach may also help clarifying the long-standing controversy on the contribution of TE zero modes to the Casimir energy in real materials.
