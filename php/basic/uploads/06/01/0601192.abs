Title: Non-commutative geometry and the standard model vacuum
Authors: John W. Barrett and Rachel A. Dawe Martins
Abstract: The space of Dirac operators for the Connes-Chamseddine spectral action for the standard model of particle physics coupled to gravity is studied. The model is extended by including right-handed neutrino states, and the S0-reality axiom is not assumed. The possibility of allowing more general fluctuations than the inner fluctuations of the vacuum is proposed. The maximal case of all possible fluctuations is studied by considering the equations of motion for the vacuum. Whilst there are interesting non-trivial vacua with Majorana-like mass terms for the leptons, the conclusion is that the equations are too restrictive to allow solutions with the standard model mass matrix.
