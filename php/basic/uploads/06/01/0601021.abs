Title: Intrinsic Periodicity of Time and Non-maximal Entropy of Universe
Authors: Holger B. Nielsen and Masao Ninomiya
Abstract: The universe is certainly not yet in total thermodynamical equilibrium,so clearly some law telling about special initial conditions is needed. A universe or a system imposed to behave periodically gets thereby required ``initial conditions". Those initial conditions will \underline{not} look like having already suffered the heat death, i.e. obtained the maximal entropy, like a random state. The intrinsic periodicity explains successfully why entropy is not maximal, but fails phenomenologically by leading to a \underline{constant}entropy.
