Title: Hydrodynamics of R-charged black holes
Authors: Dam T. Son and Andrei O. Starinets
Abstract: We consider hydrodynamics of N=4 supersymmetric SU(N_c) Yang-Mills plasma at a nonzero density of R-charge. In the regime of large N_c and large 't Hooft coupling the gravity dual description involves an asymptotically Anti- de Sitter five-dimensional charged black hole solution of Behrnd, Cvetic and Sabra. We compute the shear viscosity as a function of chemical potentials conjugated to the three U(1) \subset SO(6)_R charges. The ratio of the shear viscosity to entropy density is independent of the chemical potentials and is equal to 1/4\pi. For a single charge black hole we also compute the thermal conductivity, and investigate the critical behavior of the transport coefficients near the boundary of thermodynamic stability.
