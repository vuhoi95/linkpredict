Title: Opposites Attract - A Theorem About The Casimir Force
Authors: Oded Kenneth and Israel Klich
Abstract: We consider the Casimir interaction between (non-magnetic) dielectric bodies or conductors. Our main result is a proof that the Casimir force between two bodies related by reflection is always attractive, independent of the exact form of the bodies or dielectric properties. Apart from being a fundamental property of fields, the theorem and its corollaries also rule out a class of suggestions to obtain repulsive forces, such as the two hemisphere repulsion suggestion and its relatives.
