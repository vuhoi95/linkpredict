Title: Flop invariance of the topological vertex
Authors: Yukiko Konishi and Satoshi Minabe
Abstract: We prove transformation formulae for generating functions of Gromov-Witten invariants on general toric Calabi-Yau threefolds under flops. Our proof is based on a combinatorial identity on the topological vertex and analysis of fans of toric Calabi-Yau threefolds.
