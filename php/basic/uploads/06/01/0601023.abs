Title: Proton stability in grand unified theories, in strings, and in branes
Authors: Pran Nath and Pavel Fileviez Perez
Abstract: A broad overview of the current status of proton stability in unified models of particle interactions is given which includes non - supersymmetric unification, SUSY and SUGRA unified models, unification based on extra dimensions, and string-M-theory models. The extra dimensional unification includes 5D and 6D and universal extra dimensional (UED) models, and models based on warped geometry. Proton stability in a wide array of string theory and M theory models is reviewed. These include Calabi-Yau models, grand unified models with Kac-Moody levels $k>1$, a new class of heterotic string models, models based on intersecting D branes, and string landscape models. The destabilizing effect of quantum gravity on the proton is discussed. The possibility of testing grand unified models, models based on extra dimensions and string-M-theory models via their distinctive modes is investigated. The proposed next generation proton decay experiments, HyperK, UNO, MEMPHYS, ICARUS, LANNDD (DUSEL), and LENA would shed significant light on the nature of unification complementary to the physics at the LHC. Mathematical tools for the computation of proton lifetime are given in the appendices. Prospects for the future are discussed.
