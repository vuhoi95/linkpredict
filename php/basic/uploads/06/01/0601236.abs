Title: Late Time Behaviors of an Inhomogeneous Rolling Tachyon
Authors: O-Kab Kwon and Chong Oh Lee
Abstract: We study an inhomogeneous decay of an unstable D-brane in the context of Dirac-Born-Infeld~(DBI)-type effective action. We consider tachyon and electromagnetic fields with dependence of time and one spatial coordinate, and an exact solution is found under an exponentially decreasing tachyon potential, $e^{-|T|/\sqrt{2}}$, which is valid for the description of the late time behavior of an unstable D-brane. Though the obtained solution contains both time and spatial dependence, the corresponding momentum density vanishes over the entire spacetime region. The solution is governed by two parameters. One adjusts the distribution of energy density in the inhomogeneous direction, and the other interpolates between the homogeneous rolling tachyon and static configuration. As time evolves, the energy of the unstable D-brane is converted into the electric flux and tachyon matter.
