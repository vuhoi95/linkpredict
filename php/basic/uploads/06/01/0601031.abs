Title: Hidden Beauty in Multiloop Amplitudes
Authors: Freddy Cachazo and Marcus Spradlin and Anastasia Volovich
Abstract: Planar L-loop maximally helicity violating amplitudes in N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory are believed to possess the remarkable property of satisfying iteration relations in L. We propose a simple new method for studying the iteration relations for four-particle amplitudes which involves the use of certain linear differential operators and eliminates the need to fully evaluate any loop integrals. We carry out this procedure in explicit detail for the two-loop amplitude and argue that this method can be used to prove the iteration relations to all loops up to polynomials in logarithms.
