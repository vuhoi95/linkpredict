Title: Black hole entropy in 3D gravity with torsion
Authors: M. Blagojevic and B. Cvetkovic
Abstract: The role of torsion in quantum three-dimensional gravity is investigated by studying the partition function of the Euclidean theory in Riemann-Cartan spacetime. The entropy of the black hole with torsion is found to differ from the standard Bekenstein-Hawking result, but its form is in complete agreement with the first law of black hole thermodynamics.
