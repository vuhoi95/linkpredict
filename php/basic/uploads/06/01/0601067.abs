Title: Boundary State for Magnetized D9 Branes and One-Loop Calculation
Authors: Paolo Di Vecchia and Antonella Liccardo and Raffaele Marotta and Franco Pezzella and Igor Pesando
Abstract: We construct the boundary state describing magnetized D9 branes in R^{3,1} x T^6 and we use it to compute the annulus and Moebius amplitudes. We derive from them, by using open/closed string duality, the number of Landau levels on the torus T^d.
