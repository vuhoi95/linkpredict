Title: The Dirac equation in Rindler space: A pedagogical introduction
Authors: David McMahon and Paul M. Alsing and Pedro Embid
Abstract: A pedagogical introduction to the Dirac equation for massive particles in Rindler space is presented. The spin connection coefficients are explicitly derived using techniques from general relativity. We then apply the Lagrange-Green identity to greatly simplify calculation of the inner products needed to normalize the states. Finally, the Bogolubov coefficients relating the Rindler and Minkowski modes are derived in an intuitive manner. These derivations are useful for students interested in learning about quantum field theory in a curved space-time.
