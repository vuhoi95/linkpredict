Title: The Inside Story: Quasilocal Tachyons and Black Holes
Authors: Gary T. Horowitz and Eva Silverstein
Abstract: We analyze the fate of excitations in regions of closed string tachyon condensate, a question crucial for understanding unitarity in a class of black holes in string theory. First we introduce a simple new example of {\it quasilocal} tachyon condensation in a globally stable AdS/CFT background, and review tachyons' appearance in black hole physics. Then we calculate forces on particles and fields in a tachyon phase using a field theoretic model with spatially localized exponentially growing time dependent masses. This model reveals two features, both supporting unitary evolution in the bulk of spacetime. First, the growing energy of fields sourced by sets of (real and virtual) particles in the tachyon phase yields outward forces on them, leaving behind only combinations which do not source any fields. Secondly, requiring the consistency of perturbative string theory imposes cancellation of a BRST anomaly, which also yields a restricted set of states. Each of these effects supports the notion of a black hole final state arising from string-theoretic dynamics replacing the black hole singularity.
