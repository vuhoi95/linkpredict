Title: Nonabelian Strings and Axion
Authors: A. Gorsky and M. Shifman and A. Yung
Abstract: We address two distinct but related issues: (i) the impact of (two-dimensional) axions in a two-dimensional theory known to model confinement, the CP(N-1) model; (ii) bulk axions in four-dimensional Yang-Mills theory supporting non-Abelian strings. In the first case n, \bar n kinks play the role of "quarks." They are known to be confined. We show that introduction of axions leads to deconfinement (at very large distances). This is akin to the phenomenon of wall liberation in four-dimensional Yang-Mills theory. In the second case we demonstrate that the bulk axion does not liberate confined (anti)monopoles, in contradistinction with the two-dimensional model. A novel physical effect which we observe is the axion radiation caused by monopole-antimonopole pairs attached to the non-Abelian strings.
