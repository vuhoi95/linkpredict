Title: Heat-kernel expansion on non compact domains and a generalised  zeta-function regularisation procedure
Authors: Guido Cognola and Emilio Elizalde and Sergio Zerbini
Abstract: Heat-kernel expansion and zeta function regularisation are discussed for Laplace type operators with discrete spectrum in non compact domains. Since a general theory is lacking, the heat-kernel expansion is investigated by means of several examples. It is pointed out that for a class of exponential (analytic) interactions, generically the non-compactness of the domain gives rise to logarithmic terms in the heat-kernel expansion. Then, a meromorphic continuation of the associated zeta function is investigated. A simple model is considered, for which the analytic continuation of the zeta function is not regular at the origin, displaying a pole of higher order. For a physically meaningful evaluation of the related functional determinant, a generalised zeta function regularisation procedure is proposed.
