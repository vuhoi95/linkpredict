Title: Infinite N phase transitions in continuum Wilson loop operators
Authors: R. Narayanan and H. Neuberger
Abstract: We define smoothed Wilson loop operators on a four dimensional lattice and check numerically that they have a finite and nontrivial continuum limit. The continuum operators maintain their character as unitary matrices and undergo a phase transition at infinite N reflected by the eigenvalue distribution closing a gap in its spectrum when the defining smooth loop is dilated from a small size to a large one. If this large N phase transition belongs to a solvable universality class one might be able to calculate analytically the string tension in terms of the perturbative Lambda-parameter. This would be achieved by matching instanton results for small loops to the relevant large-N-universal function which, in turn, would be matched for large loops to an effective string theory. Similarities between our findings and known analytical results in two dimensional space-time indicate that the phase transitions we found only affect the eigenvalue distribution, but the traces of finite powers of the Wilson loop operators stay smooth under scaling.
