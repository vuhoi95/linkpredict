Title: Conjectures for Large N Superconformal N=4 Chiral Primary Four Point  Functions
Authors: F. A. Dolan and M. Nirschl and H. Osborn
Abstract: An expression for the four point function for half-BPS operators belonging to the [0,p,0] SU(4) representation in N=4 superconformal theories at strong coupling in the large N limit is suggested for any p. It is expressed in terms of the four point integrals defined by integration over AdS_5 and agrees with, and was motivated by, results for p=2,3,4 obtained via the AdS/CFT correspondence. Using crossing symmetry and unitarity, the detailed form is dictated by the requirement that at large N the contribution of long multiplets with twist less than 2p, which do not have anomalous dimensions, should cancel corresponding free field contributions.
