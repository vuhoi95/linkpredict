Title: Black hole production in tachyonic preheating
Authors: Teruaki Suyama and Takahiro Tanaka and Bruce Bassett and Hideaki Kudoh
Abstract: We present fully non-linear simulations of a self-interacting scalar field in the early universe undergoing tachyonic preheating. We find that density perturbations on sub-horizon scales which are amplified by tachyonic instability maintain long range correlations even during the succeeding parametric resonance, in contrast to the standard models of preheating dominated by parametric resonance. As a result the final spectrum exhibits memory and is not universal in shape. We find that throughout the subsequent era of parametric resonance the equation of state of the universe is almost dust-like, hence the Jeans wavelength is much smaller than the horizon scale. If our 2D simulations are accurate reflections of the situation in 3D, then there are wide regions of parameter space ruled out by over-production of black holes. It is likely however that realistic parameter values, consistent with COBE/WMAP normalisation, are safetly outside this black hole over-production region.
