Title: Moduli Instability in Warped Compactification
Authors: Hideo Kodama and Kunihito Uzawa
Abstract: We derive four-dimensional effective theories for warped compactification of the ten-dimensional IIB supergravity. We show that these effective theories allow a much wider class of solutions than the original higher-dimensional theories. This result indicates that the effective four-dimensional theories should be used with caution, if one regards the higher-dimensional theories more fundamental.
