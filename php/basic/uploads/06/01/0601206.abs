Authors: Chanju Kim and Yoonbai Kim and O-Kab Kwon and Ho-Ung Yee
Abstract: We study tachyon kinks with and without electromagnetic fields in the context of boundary string field theory. For the case of pure tachyon only an array of kink-antikink is obtained. In the presence of electromagnetic coupling, all possible static codimension-one soliton solutions such as array of kink-antikink, single topological BPS kink, bounce, half kink, as well as nonBPS topological kink are found, and their properties including the interpretation as branes are analyzed in detail. Spectrum of the obtained kinks coincides with that of Dirac-Born-Infeld type effective theory.
