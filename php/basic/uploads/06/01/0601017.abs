Title: $Î·$-weak-pseudo-Hermiticity generators and radially symmetric  Hamiltonians
Authors: Omar Mustafa and S. Habib Mazharimousavi
Abstract: A class of spherically symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and their \eta-weak-pseudo-Hermiticity generators are presented. An operators-based procedure is introduced so that the results for the 1D Schrodinger Hamiltonian may very well be reproduced. A generalization beyond the nodeless states is proposed. Our illustrative examples include \eta-weak-pseudo-Hermiticity generators for the non-Hermitian weakly perturbed 1D and radial oscillators, the non-Hermitian perturbed radial Coulomb, and the non-Hermitian radial Morse models.
