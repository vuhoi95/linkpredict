Title: Implications of Minimal Length Scale on the Statistical Mechanics of  Ideal Gas
Authors: Kourosh Nozari and S. H. Mehdipour
Abstract: Several alternative approaches to quantum gravity problem suggest the modification of the {\it fundamental volume $\omega_{0}$} of the accessible phase space for representative points. This modified fundamental volume has a novel momentum dependence. In this paper, we study the effects of this modification on the thermodynamics of an ideal gas within the microcanonical ensemble and using the generalized uncertainty principle(GUP). Although the induced modifications are important only in quantum gravity era, possible experimental manifestation of these effects may provides strong support for underlying quantum gravity proposal.
