Title: Dilaton Dynamics from Production of Tensionless Membranes
Authors: Sera Cremonini and Scott Watson
Abstract: In this paper we consider classical and quantum corrections to cosmological solutions of 11D SUGRA coming from dynamics of membrane states. We first consider the supermembrane spectrum following the approach of Russo and Tseytlin for consistent quantization. We calculate the production rate of BPS membrane bound states in a cosmological background and find that such effects are generically suppressed by the Planck scale, as expected. However, for a modified brane spectrum possessing enhanced symmetry, production can be finite and significant. We stress that this effect could not be anticipated given only a knowledge of the low-energy effective theory. Once on-shell, inclusion of these states leads to an attractive force pulling the dilaton towards a fixed point of S-duality, namely $g_s=1$. Although the SUGRA description breaks down in this regime, inclusion of the enhanced states suggests that the center of M-theory moduli space is a dynamical attractor. Morever, our results seem to suggest that string dynamics does indeed favor a vacuum near fixed points of duality.
