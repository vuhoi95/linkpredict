Title: The Thirring interaction in the two-dimensional  axial-current-pseudoscalar derivative coupling model
Authors: L. V. Belvedere and A. F. Rodrigues
Abstract: The authors reexamine the two-dimensional model of massive fermions interacting with a massless pseudoscalar field via axial-current-pseudoscalar derivative coupling. Performing a canonical field transformation on the Bose field algebra the model is mapped into the Thirring model with an additional vector-current-scalar-derivative interaction (Schroer-Thirring model). The complete bosonized version of the model is presented. The bosonized composite operators of the quantum Hamiltonian are obtained as the leading operators in the Wilson short distance expansion.
