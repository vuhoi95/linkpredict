Title: Noncommutative instantons from twisted conformal symmetries
Authors: Giovanni Landi and Walter D. van Suijlekom
Abstract: We construct a five-parameter family of gauge-nonequivalent SU(2) instantons on a noncommutative four sphere $S_\theta^4$ and of topological charge equal to -1. These instantons are critical points of a gauge functional and satisfy self-duality equations with respect to a Hodge star operator on forms on $S_\theta^4$. They are obtained by acting with a twisted conformal symmetry on a basic instanton canonically associated with a noncommutative instanton bundle on the sphere. A completeness argument for this family is obtained by means of index theorems. The dimension of the ``tangent space'' to the moduli space is computed as the index of a twisted Dirac operator and turns out to be equal to five, a number that survives deformation.
