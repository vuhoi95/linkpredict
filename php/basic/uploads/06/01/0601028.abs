Title: The Poincare algebra in the context of ageing systems: Lie structure,  representations, Appell systems and coherent states
Authors: Malte Henkel and Rene Schott and Stoimen Stoimenov and Jeremie Unterberger
Abstract: By introducing an unconventional realization of the Poincare algebra alt_1 of special relativity as conformal transformations, we show how it may occur as a dynamical symmetry algebra for ageing systems in non-equilibrium statistical physics and give some applications, such as the computation of two-time correlators. We also discuss infinite-dimensional extensions of alt_1 in this setting. Finally, we construct canonical Appell systems, coherent states and Leibniz functions for alt_1 as a tool for bosonic quantization.
