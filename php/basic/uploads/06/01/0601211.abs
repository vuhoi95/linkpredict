Title: Evaluation of the Casimir Force for a Dielectric-diamagnetic Cylinder  with Light Velocity Conservation Condition and the Analogue of Sellmeir's  Dispersion Law
Authors: Iver Brevik and August Romeo
Abstract: We study the Casimir pressure for a dielectric-diamagnetic cylinder subject to light velocity conservation and with a dispersion law analogous to Sellmeir's rule. Similarities to and differences from the spherical case are pointed out.
