Title: Quantum inequalities for massless spin-3/2 field in Minkowski spacetime
Authors: Bo Hu and Yi Ling and Hongbao Zhang
Abstract: Quantum inequalities have been established for various quantum fields in both flat and curved spacetimes. In particular, for spin-3/2 fields, Yu and Wu have explicitly derived quantum inequalities for massive case. Employing the similar method developed by Fewster and colleagues, this paper provides an explicit formula of quantum inequalities for massless spin-3/2 field in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime.
