Title: Aharonov-Bohm Effect and Disclinations in an Elastic Medium
Authors: Claudio Furtado and A. M. de M. Carvalho and C. A. de Lima Ribeiro
Abstract: In this work we investigate quasiparticles in the background of defects in solids using the geometric theory of defects. We use the parallel transport matrix to study the Aharonov-Bohm effect in this background. For quasiparticles moving in this effective medium we demonstrate an effect similar to the gravitational Aharonov- Bohm effect. We analyze this effect in an elastic medium with one and $N$ defects.
