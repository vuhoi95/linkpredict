Title: Constraints on the Cosmological Constant in a Static Geometry from  Periodicity in a Compact Fifth-Dimension
Authors: P. Castelo Ferreira and P. Vargas Moniz
Abstract: Withdrawn: The solutions presented in this work are not compatible with the equation of motion for g_{00}, which we did not properly verify. In the framework of this work, the only bulk solutions compatible with periodicity of the fifth dimension are constant fields. Also for a scalar field only constant solutions are obtained.
