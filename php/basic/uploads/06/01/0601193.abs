Title: A microstate for the 3-charge black ring
Authors: Stefano Giusto and Samir D. Mathur and Yogesh K. Srivastava
Abstract: We start with a 2-charge D1-D5 BPS geometry that has the shape of a ring; this geometry is regular everywhere. In the dual CFT there exists a perturbation that creates one unit of excitation for left movers, and thus adds one unit of momentum P. This implies that there exists a corresponding normalizable perturbation on the near-ring D1-D5 geometry. We find this perturbation, and observe that it is smooth everywhere. We thus find an example of `hair' for the black ring carrying three charges -- D1, D5 and one unit of P. The near-ring geometry of the D1-D5 supertube can be dualized to a D6 brane carrying fluxes corresponding to the `true' charges, while the quantum of P dualizes to a D0 brane. We observe that the fluxes on the D6 brane are at the threshold between bound and unbound states of D0-D6, and our wavefunction helps us learn something about binding at this threshold.
