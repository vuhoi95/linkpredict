Title: New calculations in Gromov-Witten theory
Authors: D. Maulik and R. Pandharipande
Abstract: We use a topological framework to study descendent Gromov-Witten theory in higher genus, non-toric settings. Two geometries are considered: surfaces of general type and the Enriques Calabi-Yau threefold. We conjecture closed formulas for surfaces of general type in classes K and 2K. For the Enriques Calabi-Yau, Gromov-Witten invariants are calculated in genus 0, 1, and 2. In genus 2, the holomorphic anomaly equation is found.
