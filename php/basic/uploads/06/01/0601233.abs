Title: Amoebas and Instantons
Authors: Takashi Maeda and Toshio Nakatsu
Abstract: We study a statistical model of random plane partitions. The statistical model has interpretations as five-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills on $\mathbb{R}^4\times S^1$ and as K\"ahler gravity on local SU(N) geometry. At the thermodynamic limit a typical plane partition called the limit shape dominates in the statistical model. The limit shape is linked with a hyperelliptic curve, which is a five-dimensional version of the SU(N) Seiberg-Witten curve. Amoebas and the Ronkin functions play intermediary roles between the limit shape and the hyperelliptic curve. In particular, the Ronkin function realizes an integration of thermodynamical density of the main diagonal partitions, along one-dimensional slice of it and thereby is interpreted as the counting function of gauge instantons. The radius of $S^1$ can be identified with the inverse temperature of the statistical model. The large radius limit of the five-dimensional Yang-Mills is the low temperature limit of the statistical model, where the statistical model is frozen to a ground state that is associated with the local SU(N) geometry. We also show that the low temperature limit corresponds to a certain degeneration of amoebas and the Ronkin functions known as tropical geometry.
