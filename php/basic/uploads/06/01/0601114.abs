Title: Gauge Invariant Regularization in the AdS/CFT Correspondence and Ghost  D-branes
Authors: Nick Evans and Tim R. Morris and Oliver J. Rosten
Abstract: A field theoretic understanding of how the radial direction in the AdS/CFT Correspondence plays the role of a gauge invariant measure of energy scale has long been missing. In SU(N) Yang-Mills, a realization of a gauge invariant cutoff has been achieved by embedding the theory in spontaneously broken SU(N|N) gauge theory. With the recent discovery of ghost D-branes an AdS/CFT Correspondence version of this scheme is now possible. We show that a very simple construction precisely ties the two pictures together providing a concrete understanding of the radial RG flow on the field theory side.
