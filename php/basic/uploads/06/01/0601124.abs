Title: Particle-like platonic solutions in scalar gravity
Authors: Burkhard Kleihaus and Jutta Kunz and Kari Myklevoll
Abstract: We construct globally regular gravitating solutions, which possess only discrete symmetries. These solutions of Yang-Mills-dilaton theory may be viewed as exact (numerical) solutions of scalar gravity, by considering the dilaton as a kind of scalar graviton, or as approximate solutions of Einstein-Yang-Mills theory. We focus on platonic solutions with cubic symmetry, related to a rational map of degree N=4. We present the first two solutions of the cubic N=4 sequence, and expect this sequence to converge to an extremal Reissner-Nordstrom solution with magnetic charge P=4.
