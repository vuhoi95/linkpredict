Title: Supersymmetric multi-charge AdS_5 black holes
Authors: Hari K. Kunduri and James Lucietti and Harvey S. Reall
Abstract: A new supersymmetric, asymptotically anti-de Sitter, black hole solution of five-dimensional U(1)^3 gauged supergravity is presented. All known examples of such black holes arise as special cases of this solution, which is characterized by three charges and two angular momenta, with one constraint relating these five quantities. Analagous solutions of U(1)^n gauged supergravity are also presented.
