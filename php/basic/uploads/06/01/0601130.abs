Title: Instantons on D7 brane probes and AdS/CFT with flavour
Authors: Riccardo Apreda and Johanna Erdmenger and Nick Evans and Johannes Grosse and Zachary Guralnik
Abstract: Recent work on adding flavour to the generalized AdS/CFT correspondence is reviewed. In particular, we consider instanton configurations on two coincident D7 brane probes. These are matched to the Higgs branch of the dual field theory. In AdS_5 x S^5, the instanton generates a flow of the meson spectrum. For non-supersymmetric gravity backgrounds, the Higgs branch is lifted by a potential, which has non-trivial physical implications. In particular these configurations provide a gravity dual description of Bose-Einstein condensation and of a thermal phase transition.
