Title: Quantization of N=1 and N=2 SUSY KdV models
Authors: Petr P. Kulish and Anton M. Zeitlin
Abstract: The quantization procedure for both N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric Korteweg-de Vries (SUSY KdV) hierarchies is constructed. Namely, the quantum counterparts of the monodromy matrices, built by means of the integrated vertex operators, are shown to satisfy a specialization of reflection equation, leading to the quantum integrable theory. The relation of such models to the study of integrable perturbed superconformal and topological models is discussed.
