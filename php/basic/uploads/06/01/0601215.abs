Authors: R. Ahl Laamara and A. Belhaj and L. B. Drissi and E. H. Saidi
Abstract: We use local mirror symmetry to study a class of local Calabi-Yau super-manifolds with bosonic sub-variety V_b having a vanishing first Chern class. Solving the usual super- CY condition, requiring the equality of the total U(1) gauge charges of bosons \Phi_{b} and the ghost like fields \Psi_{f} one \sum_{b}q_{b}=\sum_{f}Q_{f}, as \sum_{b}q_{b}=0 and \sum_{f}Q_{f}=0, several examples are studied and explicit results are given for local A_{r} super-geometries. A comment on purely fermionic super-CY manifolds corresponding to the special case where q_{b}=0, \forall b and \sum_{f}Q_{f}=0 is also made.\bigskip
