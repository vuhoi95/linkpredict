Title: Teleportation by a Majorana Medium
Authors: Gordon W. Semenoff and Pasquale Sodano
Abstract: It is argued that Majorana zero modes in a system of quantum fermions can mediate a teleportation-like process with the actual transfer of electronic material between well separated points. The problem is formulated in the context of a quasi-realistic and exactly solvable model of a quantum wire embedded in a bulk p-wave superconductor. An explicit computation of the tunneling amplitude is given.
