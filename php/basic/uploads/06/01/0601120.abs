Title: Quantum Field Theories in Nonextensive Tsallis Statistics
Authors: H. Kohyama and A. Niegawa
Abstract: Within the framework of Tsallis statistics with q ~ 1, we construct a perturbation theory for treating relativistic quantum field systems. We find that there appear initial correlations, which do not exist in the Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics. Applying this framework to a quark-gluon plasma, we find that the so-called thermal masses of quarks and gluons are smaller than in the case of Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics.
