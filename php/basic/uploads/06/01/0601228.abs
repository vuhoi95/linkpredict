Title: BTZ Black Hole with Chern-Simons and Higher Derivative Terms
Authors: Bindusar Sahoo and Ashoke Sen
Abstract: The entropy of a BTZ black hole in the presence of gravitational Chern-Simons terms has previously been analyzed using Euclidean action formalism. In this paper we treat the BTZ solution as a two dimensional black hole by regarding the angular coordinate as a compact direction, and use Wald's Noether charge method to calculate the entropy of this black hole in the presence of higher derivative and gravitational Chern-Simons terms. The parameters labelling the black hole solution can be determined by extremizing an entropy function whose value at the extremum gives the entropy of the black hole.
