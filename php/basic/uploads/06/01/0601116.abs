Title: Non-commutative multi-dimensional cosmology
Authors: N. Khosravi and S. Jalalzadeh and H. R. Sepangi
Abstract: A non-commutative multi-dimensional cosmological model is introduced and used to address the issues of compactification and stabilization of extra dimensions and the cosmological constant problem. We show that in such a scenario these problems find natural solutions in a universe described by an increasing time parameter.
