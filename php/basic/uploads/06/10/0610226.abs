Title: Push on a Casimir apparatus in a weak gravitational field
Authors: Giuseppe Bimonte and Enrico Calloni and Giampiero Esposito and Luigi Rosa
Abstract: The influence of the gravity acceleration on the regularized energy-momentum tensor of the quantized electromagnetic field between two plane parallel conducting plates is derived. We use Fermi coordinates and work to first order in the constant acceleration parameter. A new simple formula for the trace anomaly is found to first order in the constant acceleration, and a more systematic derivation is therefore obtained of the theoretical prediction according to which the Casimir device in a weak gravitational field will experience a tiny push in the upwards direction.
