Title: Vector Solitons and Spontaneous Lorentz Violation Mechanism
Authors: L. P. Colatto and A. L. A. Penna and W. C. Santos
Abstract: Taking a full 3D nonlinear vector matter field dynamics, a vector version of a soliton state was found. The Nielsen-Olesen procedure was used in order to derive a Lorentz-violation vector parameter which characterizes, via Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking mechanism, the non-trivial vacuum. A stable vortex configuration is obtained, and although the Chern-Simons-type terms do not contribute to the value of the vortex core, the propagator analysis suggests us the possibility of a contribution to the size of the vortex core and to the growth of the field to achieve the asymptotic limit value with the distance.
