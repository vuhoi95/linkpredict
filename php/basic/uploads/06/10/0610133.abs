Title: Extra-weakly Interacting Dark Matter
Authors: Daniel Feldman and Boris Kors and Pran Nath
Abstract: We investigate a new type of dark matter with couplings to ordinary matter naturally suppressed by at least one order of magnitude compared to weak interactions. Despite the extra-weak interactions massive particles of this type (XWIMPs) can satisfy the WMAP relic density constraints due to coannihilation if their masses are close to that of the lightest state of the MSSM. The region in the parameter space of a suitably extended mSUGRA model consistent with the WMAP3 constraints on XWIMPs is determined. Plots for sparticles masses are given which can be subject to test at the LHC. We also discuss the sensitivity of the analysis to the top mass. As an example for an explicit model we show that such a form of dark matter can arise in certain $Z'$ extensions of the MSSM. Specifically we consider an abelian extension with spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking via Fayet-Iliopoulos D-terms in the hidden sector. The LSP of the full model arises from the extra $U(1)_X$ sector with extra-weak couplings to Standard Model particles due to experimental constraints. With R-parity conservation the new XWIMP is a candidate for cold dark matter. In a certain limit the model reduces to the \st extension of the MSSM without a Higgs mechanism, and wider ranges of models with similar characteristics are easy to construct.
