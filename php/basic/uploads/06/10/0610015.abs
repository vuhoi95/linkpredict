Title: Supersymmetric Intersecting Branes in Time-dependent Backgrounds
Authors: Nobuyoshi Ohta and Kamal L. Panigrahi
Abstract: We construct a family of supersymmetric solutions in time-dependent backgrounds in supergravity theories. One class of the solutions are intersecting brane solutions and another class are brane solutions in pp-wave backgrounds, and their intersection rules are also given. The relation to existing literature is also discussed. An example of D1-D5 with linear null dilaton together with its possible dual theory is briefly discussed.
