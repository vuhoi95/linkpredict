Title: Holographic Viscosity of Fundamental Matter
Authors: David Mateos and Robert C. Myers and Rowan M. Thomson
Abstract: A holographic dual of a finite-temperature SU(N_c) gauge theory with a small number of flavours N_f << N_c typically contains D-branes in a black hole background. By considering the backreaction of the branes, we demonstrate that, to leading order in N_f/N_c, the viscosity to entropy ratio in these theories saturates the conjectured universal bound eta/s >= 1/4\pi. The contribution of the fundamental matter eta_fund is therefore enhanced at strong 't Hooft coupling lambda; for example, eta_fund ~ lambda N_c N_f T^3 in four dimensions. Other transport coefficients are analogously enhanced. These results hold with or without a baryon number chemical potential.
