Title: Universal regularization for string field theory
Authors: Ehud Fuchs and Michael Kroyter
Abstract: We find an analytical regularization for string field theory calculations. This regularization has a simple geometric meaning on the worldsheet, and is therefore universal as level truncation. However, our regularization has the added advantage of being analytical. We illustrate how to apply our regularization to both the discrete and continuous basis for the scalar field and for the bosonized ghost field, both for numerical and analytical calculations. We reexamine the inner products of wedge states, which are known to differ from unity in the oscillator representation in contrast to the expectation from level truncation. These inner products describe also the descent relations of string vertices. The results of applying our regularization strongly suggest that these inner products indeed equal unity. We also revisit Schnabl's algebra and show that the unwanted constant vanishes when using our regularization even in the oscillator representation.
