Title: Sub-eV Hubble scale inflation within gauge mediated supersymmetry  breaking
Authors: Rouzbeh Allahverdi and Asko Jokinen and Anupam Mazumdar
Abstract: Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking has all the necessary ingredients for a successful sub-eV Hubble scale inflation $H_{\rm inf} \sim 10^{-3}-10^{-1}$ eV. The model generates the right amplitude for scalar density perturbations and a spectral tilt within the range, $0.90 \leq n_s \leq 1$. The reheat temperature is $T_{\rm R} \ls 10$ TeV, which strongly prefers electroweak baryogenesis and creates the right abundance of gravitinos with a mass $m_{3/2} \gs 100$ keV to be the dark matter.
