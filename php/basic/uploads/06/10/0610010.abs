Title: Gauss-Bonnet gravity, brane world models, and non-minimal coupling
Authors: K. Farakos and P. Pasipoularides
Abstract: We study the case of brane world models with an additional Gauss-Bonnet term in the presence of a bulk scalar field which interacts non-minimally with gravity, via a possible interaction term of the form $-1/2 \xi R \phi^2$. The Einstein equations and the junction conditions on the brane are formulated, in the case of the bulk scalar field. Static solutions of this model are obtained by solving numerically the Einstein equations with the appropriate boundary conditions on the brane. Finally, we present graphically and comment these solutions for several values of the free parameters of the model.
