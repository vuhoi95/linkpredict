Title: Some Aspects of c=-2 Theory
Authors: M. A. Rajabpour and S. Rouhani and A. A. Saberi
Abstract: We investigate some aspects of the c=-2 logarithmic conformal field theory. These include the various representations related to this theory, the structures which come out of the Zhu algebra and the W algebra related to this theory. We try to find the fermionic representations of all of the fields in the extended Kac table especially for the untwisted sector case. In addition, we calculate the various OPEs of the fields, especially the energy-momentum tensor. Moreover, we investigate the important role of the zero modes in this model. We close the paper by considering the perturbations of this theory and their relationship to integrable models and generalization of Zamolodchikov's $c-$theorem.
