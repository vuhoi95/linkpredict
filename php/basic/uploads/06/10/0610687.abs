Title: Magnetothermoelectric Response at a Superfluid--Mott Insulator  Transition
Authors: M. J. Bhaseen and A. G. Green and S. L. Sondhi
Abstract: We investigate the finite temperature magnetothermoelectric response in the vicinity of a superfluid--Mott insulator quantum phase transition. We focus on the particle-hole symmetric transitions of the Bose--Hubbard model, and combine Lorentz invariance arguments with quantum Boltzmann calculations. By means of an epsilon expansion, we find that a non-vanishing thermoelectric tensor and a finite thermal conductivity are supported in this quantum critical regime. We comment on the singular Nernst effect in this problem.
