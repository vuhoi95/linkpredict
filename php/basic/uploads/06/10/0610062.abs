Title: Scatterings of Massive String States from D-brane and Their Linear  Relations at High Energies
Authors: Chuan-Tsung Chan and Jen-Chi Lee and Yi Yang
Abstract: We study scatterings of bosonic massive closed string states at arbitrary mass levels from D-brane. We discover that all the scattering amplitudes can be expressed in terms of the generalized hypergeometric function with special arguments, which terminates to a finite sum and, as a result, the whole scattering amplitudes consistently reduce to the usual beta function. For the simple case of D-particle, we explicitly calculate high-energy limits of a series of the above scattering amplitudes for arbitrary mass levels, and derive infinite linear relations among them for each fixed mass level. The ratios of these high-energy scattering amplitudes are found to be consistent with the decoupling of high-energy zero-norm states of our previous works.
