Title: General Relativity from a gauged WZW term
Authors: Andres Anabalon and Steven Willison and Jorge Zanelli
Abstract: In this paper two things are done. First it is shown how a four dimensional gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten term arises from the five dimensional Einstein-Hilbert plus Gauss-Bonnet lagrangian with a special choice of the coefficients. Second, the way in which the equations of motion of four-dimensional General Relativity arise is exhibited.
