Abstract: We construct an M-solitons solutions in Jackiw-Pi model depends on 5M parameters(two positions, one scale, one phase per solition and one charge of each solution). By using \phi -mapping method, we discuss the topological structure of the self-duality solution in Jackiw-Pi model in terms of gauge potential decomposition. We set up relationship between Chern-Simons vortices solution and topological number which is determined by Hopf indices and and Brouwer degrees. We also give the quantization of flux in this case.
