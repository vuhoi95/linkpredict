Title: On a negative flow of the AKNS hierarchy and its relation to a  two-component Camassa-Holm equation
Authors: H. Aratyn and J. F. Gomes and A. H. Zimerman
Abstract: Different gauge copies of the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) model labeled by an angle $\theta$ are constructed and then reduced to the two-component Camassa--Holm model. Only three different independent classes of reductions are encountered corresponding to the angle $\theta$ being 0, $\pi/2$ or taking any value in the interval $0<\theta<\pi/2$. This construction induces B\"{a}cklund transformations between solutions of the two-component Camassa--Holm model associated with different classes of reduction.
