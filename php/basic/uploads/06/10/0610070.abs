Title: CPT-odd Leptogenesis
Authors: Pavel A. Bolokhov and Maxim Pospelov
Abstract: We calculate the baryon asymmetry of the Universe resulting from the combination of higher-dimensional Lorentz-noninvariant CPT-odd operators and dimension five operators that induce the majorana mass for neutrinos. The strength of CPT-violating dimension five operators capable of producing the observed value of baryon abundance is directly related to neutrino masses and found to be in the trans-Planckian range 10^{-24}-10^{-22} GeV^{-1}. Confronting it with observational tests of Lorentz symmetry, we find that this range of Lorentz/CPT violation is strongly disfavored by the combination of the low-energy constraints and astrophysical data.
