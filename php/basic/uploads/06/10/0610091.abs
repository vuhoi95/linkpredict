Title: Rotating spacetimes with a cosmological constant
Authors: Christos Charmousis and David Langlois and Daniele Steer and Robin Zegers
Abstract: We develop solution-generating techniques for stationary metrics with one angular momentum and axial symmetry, in the presence of a cosmological constant and in arbitrary spacetime dimension. In parallel we study the related lower dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton static spacetimes with a Liouville potential. For vanishing cosmological constant, we show that the field equations in more than four dimensions decouple into a four dimensional Papapetrou system and a Weyl system. We also show that given any four dimensional 'seed' solution, one can construct an infinity of higher dimensional solutions parametrised by the Weyl potentials, associated to the extra dimensions. When the cosmological constant is non-zero, we discuss the symmetries of the field equations, and then extend the well known works of Papapetrou and Ernst (concerning the complex Ernst equation) in four-dimensional general relativity, to arbitrary dimensions. In particular, we demonstrate that the Papapetrou hypothesis generically reduces a stationary system to a static one even in the presence of a cosmological constant. We also give a particular class of solutions which are deformations of the (planar) adS soliton and the (planar) adS black hole. We give example solutions of these techniques and determine the four-dimensional seed solutions of the 5 dimensional black ring and the Myers-Perry black hole.
