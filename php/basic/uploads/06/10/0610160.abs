Title: QED(1+1) on the Light Front and its implications for  semiphenomenological methods in QCD(3+1)
Authors: V. A. Franke and S. A. Paston and E. V. Prokhvatilov
Abstract: A possibility of semiphenomenological description of vacuum effects in QCD quantized on the Light Front (LF) is discussed. A modification of the canonical LF Hamiltonian for QCD is proposed, basing on the detailed study of the exact description of vacuum condensate in QED(1+1) that uses correct form of LF Hamiltonian.
