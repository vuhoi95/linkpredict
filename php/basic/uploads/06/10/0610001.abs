Title: Dipole-Deformed Bound States and Heterotic Kodaira Surfaces
Authors: Keshav Dasgupta and Josh Guffin and Rhiannon Gwyn and Sheldon Katz
Abstract: We study a particular N = 1 confining gauge theory with fundamental flavors realised as seven branes in the background of wrapped five branes on a rigid two-cycle of a non-trivial global geometry. In parts of the moduli space, the five branes form bound states with the seven branes. We show that in this regime the local supergravity solution is surprisingly tractable, even though the background topology is non-trivial. New effects such as dipole deformations may be studied in detail, including the full backreactions. Performing the dipole deformations in other ways leads to different warped local geometries. In the dual heterotic picture, which is locally given by a C* fibration over a Kodaira surface, we study details of the geometry and the construction of bundles. We also point out the existence of certain exotic bundles in our framework.
