Abstract: We construct two new classes of spacetimes generated by spinning and traveling magnetic sources in $(n+1)$-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity with Liouville-type potential. These solutions are neither asymptotically flat nor (A)dS. The first class of solutions which yields a $(n+1)$-dimensional spacetime with a longitudinal magnetic field and $k$ rotation parameters have no curvature singularity and no horizons, but have a conic geometry. We show that when one or more of the rotation parameters are nonzero, the spinning branes has a net electric charge that is proportional to the magnitude of the rotation parameters. The second class of solutions yields a static spacetime with an angular magnetic field, and have no curvature singularity, no horizons, and no conical singularity. Although one may add linear momentum to the second class of solutions by a boost transformation, one does not obtain a new solution. We find that the net electric charge of these traveling branes with one or more nonzero boost parameters is proportional to the magnitude of the velocity of the branes. We also use the counterterm method and calculate the conserved quantities of the solutions.
