Title: Orders and dimensions for sl(2) or sl(3) module categories and Boundary  Conformal Field Theories on a torus
Authors: Robert Coquereaux and Gil Schieber
Abstract: After giving a short description, in terms of action of categories, of some of the structures associated with sl(2) and sl(3) boundary conformal field theories on a torus, we provide tables of dimensions describing the semisimple and co-semisimple blocks of the corresponding weak bialgebras (quantum groupoids), tables of quantum dimensions and orders, and tables describing induction - restriction. For reasons of size, the sl(3) tables of induction are only given for theories with self-fusion (existence of a monoidal structure).
