Title: Static strings in Randall-Sundrum scenarios and the quark anti-quark  potential: Erratum
Authors: Henrique Boschi-Filho and Nelson R. F. Braga and Cristine N. Ferreira
Abstract: We correct the energy of the static strings in hep-th/0512295, for large quark anti-quark separation. This energy is a smooth function of the quark separation for any position of the infrared brane. The asymptotic behavior of this energy is that of the Cornell potential as stated in the article. However, this identification does not fixes the AdS radius.
