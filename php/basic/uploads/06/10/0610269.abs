Title: QCD Effects in the Decays of TeV Black Holes
Authors: Christian Alig and Manuel Drees and Kin-ya Oda
Abstract: In models with ``large'' and/or warped extra dimensions, the higher-dimensional Planck scale may be as low as a TeV. In that case black holes with masses of a few TeV are expected to be produced copiously in multi-TeV collisions, in particular at the LHC. These black holes decay through Hawking radiation into typically O(20) Standard Model particles. Most of these particles would be strongly interacting. Naively this would lead to a final state containing 10 or so hadronic jets. However, it has been argued that the density of strongly interacting particles would be so large that they thermalize, forming a ``chromosphere'' rather than well-defined jets. In order to investigate this, we perform a QCD simulation which includes parton-parton scattering in addition to parton showering. We find the effects of parton scattering to remain small for all cases we studied, leading to the conclusion that the decays of black holes with masses within the reach of the LHC will not lead to the formation of chromospheres.
