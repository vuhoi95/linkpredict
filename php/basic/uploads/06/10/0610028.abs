Title: First-order formalism for scalar field in cosmology
Authors: D. Bazeia and L. Losano and J. J. Rodrigues
Abstract: We present a general procedure to solve the equations of motion for cosmological models driven by real scalar fields with first-order differential equations. The method seems to have great power, since it works for closed, flat or open space-time, for scalar fields with both standard and tachyonic dynamics. We illustrate the procedure solving several examples which model situations of current interest to modern cosmology.
