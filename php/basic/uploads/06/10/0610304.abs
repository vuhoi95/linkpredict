Title: Twisted brane charges for non-simply connected groups
Authors: Matthias R Gaberdiel and Terry Gannon
Abstract: The charges of the twisted branes for strings on the group manifold SU(n)/Z_d are determined. To this end we derive explicit (and remarkably simple) formulae for the relevant NIM-rep coefficients. The charge groups of the twisted and untwisted branes are compared and found to agree for the cases we consider.
