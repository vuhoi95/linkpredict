Abstract: Unlike BPS $p$-brane, non-supersymmetric (non-susy) $p$-brane could be either charged or chargeless. As envisaged in [hep-th/0503007], we construct an intersecting non-susy $p$-brane with chargeless non-susy $q$-brane by taking T-dualities along the delocalized directions of the non-susy $q$-brane solution delocalized in $(p-q)$ transverse directions (where $p\geq q$). In general these solutions are characterized by four independent parameters. We show that when $q=0$ the intersecting charged as well as chargeless non-susy $p$-brane with chargeless 0-brane can be mapped by a coordinate transformation to black $p$-brane when two of the four parameters characterizing the solution take some special values. For definiteness we restrict our discussion to space-time dimensions $d=10$. We observe that parameters characterizing the black brane and the related dynamics are in general in a different branch of the parameter space from those describing the brane-antibrane annihilation process. We demonstrate this in the two examples, namely, the non-susy D0-brane and the intersecting non-susy D4 and D0-branes, where the solutions with the explicit microscopic descriptions are known.
