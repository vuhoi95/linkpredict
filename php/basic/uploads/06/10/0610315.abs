Title: Expanding the class of general exact solutions for interacting two field  kinks
Authors: A. de Souza Dutra and A. C. Amaro de Faria Jr
Abstract: In this work we extend the range of applicability of a method recently introduced where coupled first-order nonlinear equations can be put into a linear form, and consequently be solved completely. Some general consequences of the present extension are then commented.
