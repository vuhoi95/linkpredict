Title: Dyson-Schwinger Equations and Coulomb Gauge Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: P. Watson and H. Reinhardt
Abstract: Coulomb gauge Yang-Mills theory is considered within the first order formalism. It is shown that the action is invariant under both the standard BRS transform and an additional component. The Ward-Takahashi identity arising from this non-standard transform is shown to be automatically satisfied by the equations of motion.
