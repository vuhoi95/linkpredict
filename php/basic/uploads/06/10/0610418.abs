Title: Reconstruction of manifolds in noncommutative geometry
Authors: Adam Rennie and Joseph C. Varilly
Abstract: We show that the algebra A of a commutative unital spectral triple (A,H,D) satisfying several additional conditions, slightly stronger than those proposed by Connes, is the algebra of smooth functions on a compact spin manifold.
