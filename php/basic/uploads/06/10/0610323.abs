Authors: B. Mirza and R. Narimani and M. Zarei
Abstract: In this work the Aharonov-Casher (AC) phase is calculated for spin one particles in a noncommutative space. The AC phase has previously been calculated from the Dirac equation in a noncommutative space using a gauge-like technique [17]. In the spin-one, we use kemmer equation to calculate the phase in a similar manner. It is shown that the holonomy receives non-trivial kinematical corrections. By comparing the new result with the already known spin 1/2 case, one may conjecture a generalized formula for the corrections to holonomy for higher spins.
