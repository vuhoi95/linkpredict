Title: CPT/Lorentz Invariance Violation and Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Paola Arias and Ashok Das and Jorge Gamboa and Justo Lopez-Sarrion and Fernando Mendez
Abstract: Analogies between the noncommutative harmonic oscillator and noncommutative fields are analyzed. Following this analogy we construct examples of quantum fields theories with explicit CPT and Lorentz symmetry breaking. Some applications to baryogenesis and neutrino oscillation are also discussed
