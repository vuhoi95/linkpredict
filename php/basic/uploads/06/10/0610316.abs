Title: Higher Equations of Motion in N = 1 SUSY Liouville Field Theory
Authors: A. Belavin and Al. Zamolodchikov
Abstract: Similarly to the ordinary bosonic Liouville field theory, in its N=1 supersymmetric version an infinite set of operator valued relations, the ``higher equations of motions'', holds. Equations are in one to one correspondence with the singular representations of the super Virasoro algebra and enumerated by a couple of natural numbers $(m,n)$. We demonstrate explicitly these equations in the classical case, where the equations of type $(1,n)$ survive and can be interpreted directly as relations for classical fields. General form of the higher equations of motion is established in the quantum case, both for the Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond series.
