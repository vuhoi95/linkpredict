Title: The Asymptotic Spectrum of the N=4 Super Yang-Mills Spin Chain
Authors: Heng-Yu Chen and Nick Dorey and Keisuke Okamura
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the asymptotic spectrum of the spin chain description of planar N=4 SUSY Yang-Mills. The states appearing in the spectrum belong to irreducible representations of the unbroken supersymmetry SU(2|2) x SU(2|2) with non-trivial extra central extensions. The elementary magnon corresponds to the bifundamental representation while boundstates of Q magnons form a certain short representation of dimension 16Q^{2}. Generalising the Beisert's analysis of the Q=1 case, we derive the exact dispersion relation for these states by purely group theoretic means.
