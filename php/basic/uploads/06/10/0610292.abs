Title: Local transformations of units in Scalar-Tensor Cosmology
Authors: Riccardo Catena and Massimo Pietroni and Luca Scarabello
Abstract: The physical equivalence of Einstein and Jordan frame in Scalar Tensor theories has been explained by Dicke in 1962: they are related by a local transformation of units. We discuss this point in a cosmological framework. Our main result is the construction of a formalism in which all the physical observables are frame-invariant. The application of this approach to CMB codes is at present under analysis.
