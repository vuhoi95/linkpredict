Title: Born-Infeld Type Phantom Model in the $ω-ω'$ Plane
Authors: Z. G. Huang and X. H. Li and Q. Q. Sun
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of Born-Infeld(B-I) phantom model in the $\omega-\omega'$ plane, which is defined by the equation of state parameter for the dark energy and its derivative with respect to $N$(the logarithm of the scale factor $a$). We find the scalar field equation of motion in $\omega-\omega'$ plane, and show mathematically the property of attractor solutions which correspond to $\omega_\phi\sim-1$, $\Omega_\phi=1$, which avoid the "Big rip" problem and meets the current observations well.
