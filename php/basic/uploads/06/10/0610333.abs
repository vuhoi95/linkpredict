Abstract: We present new off-shell formulations for the massive superspin-3/2 multiplet. In the massless limit, they reduce respectively to the old minimal (n=-1/3) and non-minimal ($n\neq -1/3, 0$) linearized formulations for 4D N=1 supergravity. Duality transformations, which relate the models constructed, are derived.
