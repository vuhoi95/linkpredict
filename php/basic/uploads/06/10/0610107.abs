Title: Modified gravity inspired DGP brane cosmology
Authors: K. Atazadeh and H. R. Sepangi
Abstract: We consider a DGP brane scenario where a scalar field is present on the brane through the introduction of a scalar potential, itself motivated by the notion of modified gravity. This theory predicts that the mass appearing in the gravitational potential is modified by the addition of the mass of the scalar field. The cosmological implications that such a scenario entails are examined and shown to be consistent with a universe expanding with power-law acceleration.
