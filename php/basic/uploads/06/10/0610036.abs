Title: Quantum Algebras Associated With Bell States
Authors: Yong Zhang and Naihuan Jing and Mo-Lin Ge
Abstract: The antisymmetric solution of the braided Yang--Baxter equation called the Bell matrix becomes interesting in quantum information theory because it can generate all Bell states from product states. In this paper, we study the quantum algebra through the FRT construction of the Bell matrix. In its four dimensional representations via the coproduct of its two dimensional representations, we find algebraic structures including a composition series and a direct sum of its two dimensional representations to characterize this quantum algebra. We also present the quantum algebra using the FRT construction of Yang--Baxterization of the Bell matrix.
