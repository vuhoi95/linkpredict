Title: Boundary states, matrix factorisations and correlation functions for the  E-models
Authors: Christoph A. Keller and Sebastiano Rossi
Abstract: The open string spectra of the B-type D-branes of the N=2 E-models are calculated. Using these results we match the boundary states to the matrix factorisations of the corresponding Landau-Ginzburg models. The identification allows us to calculate specific terms in the effective brane superpotential of E_6 using conformal field theory methods, thereby enabling us to test results recently obtained in this context.
