Title: Superconducting Quantum Point contacts and Maxwell Potential
Authors: Arafa H Aly and Jamila Douari
Abstract: The quantization of the current in a superconducting quantum point contact is reviewed and the critical current is discussed at different temperatures depending on the carrier concentration as well by suggesting a constant potential in the semiconductor and then a Maxwell potential. When the Fermi wave length is comparable with the constriction width we showed that the critical current has a step-like variation as a function of the constriction width and the carrier concentration.
