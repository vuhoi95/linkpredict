Title: Radiative Properties of the Stueckelberg Mechanism
Authors: T. J. Marshall and D. G. C. McKeon
Abstract: We examine the mechanism for generating a mass for a U(1) vector field introduced by Stueckelberg. First, it is shown that renormalization of the vector mass is identical to the renormalization of the vector field on account of gauge invariance. We then consider how the vector mass affects the effective potential in scalar quantum electrodynamics at one-loop order. The possibility of extending this mechanism to couple, in a gauge invariant way, a charged vector field to the photon is discussed.
