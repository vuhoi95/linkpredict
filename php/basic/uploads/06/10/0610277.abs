Title: Massless and Massive Vector Goldstone Bosons in Nonlinear Quantum  Electrodynamics
Authors: J. L. Chkareuli and Z. R. Kepuladze
Abstract: The spontaneous Lorentz invariance violation (SLIV) developing in QED type theories with the nonlinear four-vector field constraint $A_{\mu}^{2}=M^{2}$ (where $M$ is a proposed scale of the Lorentz violation) is considered in the case when the internal U(1) charge symmetry is also spontaneously broken. We show that such a SLIV pattern induces the genuine vector Goldstone boson which appears massless when the U(1) symmetry is exact and becomes massive in its broken phase. However, for both of phases an apparent Lorentz violation is completely canceled out in all the observable processes so that the physical Lorentz invariance in theory is ultimately restored.
