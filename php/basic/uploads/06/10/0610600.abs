Abstract: We analyze the 3-year WMAP data and look for a deviation from Gaussianity in the form of a 3-point function that has either of the two theoretically motivated shapes: local and equilateral. There is no evidence of departure from Gaussianity and the analysis gives the presently tightest bounds on the parameters f_ NL^local and f_NL^equil., which define the amplitude of respectively the local and the equilateral non-Gaussianity: -36 < f_NL^local < 100, -256 < f_NL^equil. < 332 at 95% C.L.
