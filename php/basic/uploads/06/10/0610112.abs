Title: Irradiated closed Friedmann brane-worlds
Authors: Zoltán Keresztes and Ibolya Képíró
Abstract: We consider the evolution of a closed Friedmann brane irradiated by a bulk black hole. Both absorption on the brane and transmission across the brane are allowed, the latter representing a generalization over a previously studied model. Without transmission, a critical behaviour could be observed, when the acceleration due to radiation pressure and the deceleration introduced by the increasing self-gravity of the brane roughly compensate each other. We show here that increasing transmission leads to the disappearance of the critical behaviour.
