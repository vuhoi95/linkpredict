Title: Einstein-Yang-Mills solutions in higher dimensional de Sitter spacetime
Authors: Yves Brihaye and Eugen Radu and D. H. Tchrakian
Abstract: We consider particle-like and black holes solutions of the Einstein-Yang-Mills system with positive cosmological constant in d>4 spacetime dimensions. These configurations are spherically symmetric and present a cosmological horizon for a finite value of the radial coordinate, approaching asymptotically the de Sitter background. In the usual Yang--Mills case we find that the mass of these solutions, evaluated outside the cosmological horizon at future/past infinity generically diverges for d>4. Solutions with finite mass are found by adding to the action higher order gauge field terms belonging to the Yang--Mills hierarchy. A discussion of the main properties of these solutions and their differences from those to the usual Yang-Mills model, both in four and higher dimensions is presented.
