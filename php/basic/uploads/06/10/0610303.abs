Title: A Vector Supersymmetry Killing the Infrared Singularity of Gauge  Theories in Noncommutative Space
Authors: Daniel N. Blaschke and Fran√ßois Gieres and Olivier Piguet and Manfred Schweda
Abstract: We show that the "topological BF-type" term introduced by Slavnov in order to cure the infrared divergences of gauge theories in noncommutative space can be characterized as the consequence of a new symmetry. This symmetry is a supersymmetry, generated by vector charges, of the same type as the one encountered in Chern-Simons or BF topological theories.
