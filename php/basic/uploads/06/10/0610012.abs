Title: Exact finite size spectrum in super sine-Gordon model
Authors: Arpad Hegedus and Francesco Ravanini and Junji Suzuki
Abstract: We present the coupled nonlinear integral equations (NLIE) governing the finite size effects in N=1 super sine-Gordon model for the vacuum as well as for the excited states. Their infrared limit correctly yields the scattering data of the super sine-Gordon S-matrix conjectured by Ahn. Ultraviolet analysis is in agreement with the expected conformal data of c=3/2 CFT. Conformal perturbation theory further corroborates this result.
