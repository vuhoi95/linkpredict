Title: Holography with Schroedinger Potentials
Authors: Brian Batell and Andrew Larkoski
Abstract: We examine the analogue one-dimensional quantum mechanics problem associated with bulk scalars and fermions in a slice of AdS_5. The ``Schroedinger'' potential can take on different qualitative shapes depending on the values of the mass parameters in the bulk theory. Several interesting correlations between the shape of the Schroedinger potential and the holographic theory exist. We show that the quantum mechanical picture is a useful guide to the holographic theory by examining applications from phenomenology.
