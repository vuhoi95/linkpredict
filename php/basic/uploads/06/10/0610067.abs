Title: Modified teleparallel gravity: inflation without inflaton
Authors: Rafael Ferraro and Franco Fiorini
Abstract: Born-Infeld strategy to smooth theories having divergent solutions is applied to teleparallel equivalent of General Relativity. Differing from other theories of modified gravity, modified teleparallelism leads to second order equations, since teleparallel Lagrangian only contains first derivatives of the vierbein. We show that Born-Infeld-modified teleparallelism solves the particle horizon problem in a spatially flat FRW universe by providing an initial exponential expansion without resorting to an inflaton field.
