Title: A Positive-Definite Scalar Product for Free Proca Particle
Authors: V. Jakubsky and J. Smejkal
Abstract: We implement recent results of pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics to description of relativistic massive particle with spin-one. We derive a one-parameter family of Lorentz invariant positive-definite scalar products on the space of solutions of Proca equation.
