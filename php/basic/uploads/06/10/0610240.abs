Title: Riccion as a Cosmic Cold Dark Matter Candidate and late cosmic  acceleration
Authors: S. K. Srivastava and K. P. Sinha
Abstract: In the past few years, a possibility is investigated, where curvature itself behaves as a source of dark energy. So, it is natural to think whether curvature can produce dark matter too. It is found that, at classical level, higher-derivative gravity yields curvature inspired particles namely riccions [11]. Here, it is probed whether riccion can be a possible source of dark matter. Further, it is found that the late universe accelerates. Here, it is interesting to see that acceleration is obtained from curvature without using any dark energy source of exotic matter.
