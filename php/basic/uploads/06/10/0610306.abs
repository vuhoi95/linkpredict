Abstract: We provide a short discussion of the dimension two condensate <A^2> and its influence on the infrared behaviour of the gluon propagator in the Landau gauge. Simultaneously, we pay attention to the issue of Gribov copies in the Landau gauge. We also briefly discuss a local, gauge invariant non-Abelian action with mass parameter, constructed from the dimension 2 operator $F_{\mu\nu} (D^2)^{-1} F_{\mu\nu}$.
