Title: Gauge/gravity duality and meta-stable dynamical supersymmetry breaking
Authors: Riccardo Argurio and Matteo Bertolini and Sebastian Franco and Shamit Kachru
Abstract: We engineer a class of quiver gauge theories with several interesting features by studying D-branes at a simple Calabi-Yau singularity. At weak 't Hooft coupling we argue using field theory techniques that these theories admit both supersymmetric vacua and meta-stable non-supersymmetric vacua, though the arguments indicating the existence of the supersymmetry breaking states are not decisive. At strong 't Hooft coupling we find simple candidate gravity dual descriptions for both sets of vacua.
