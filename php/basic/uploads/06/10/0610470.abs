Title: A gravitational wave window on extra dimensions
Authors: Chris Clarkson and Sanjeev S. Seahra
Abstract: We report on the possibility of detecting a submillimetre-sized extra dimension by observing gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by pointlike objects orbiting a braneworld black hole. Matter in the `visible' universe can generate a discrete spectrum of high frequency GWs with amplitudes moderately weaker than the predictions of general relativity (GR), while GW signals generated by matter on a `shadow' brane hidden in the bulk are potentially strong enough to be detected using current technology. We know of no other astrophysical phenomena that produces GWs with a similar spectrum, which stresses the need to develop detectors capable of measuring this high-frequency signature of large extra dimensions.
