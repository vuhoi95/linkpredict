Title: On the Magic Matrix by Makhlin and the B-C-H Formula in SO(4)
Authors: Kazuyuki Fujii and Tatsuo Suzuki
Abstract: A closed expression to the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (B-C-H) formula in SO(4) is given by making use of the magic matrix by Makhlin. As far as we know this is the {\bf first nontrivial example} on (semi-) simple Lie groups summing up all terms in the B-C-H expansion.
