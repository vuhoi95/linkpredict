Title: Relationship between quantum mechanics with and without monopoles
Authors: Levon Mardoyan and Armen Nersessian and Armen Yeranyan
Abstract: We show that the inclusion of the monopole field in the three- and five-dimensional spherically symmetric quantum mechanical systems, supplied by the addition of the special centrifugal term, does not yield any change in the radial wavefunction and in the functional dependence of the energy spectra on quantum numbers. The only change in the spectrum is the lift of the range of the total and azimuth quantum numbers. The changes in the angular part wavefunction are independent of the specific choice of the (central) potential. We also present the integrable model of the spherical oscillator which is different from the Higgs oscillator.
