Title: Running of Newton's constant and non integer powers of the d'Alembertian
Authors: D. LÃ³pez Nacir and F. D. Mazzitelli
Abstract: The running of Newton's constant can be taken into account by considering covariant, non local generalizations of the field equations of general relativity. These generalizations involve nonanalytic functions of the d'Alembertian, as $(-\Box)^{-\alpha}$, with $\alpha$ a non integer number, and $\ln[-\Box]$. In this paper we define these non local operators in terms of the usual two point function of a massive field. We analyze some of their properties, and present specific calculations in flat and Robertson Walker spacetimes.
