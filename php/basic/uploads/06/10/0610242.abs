Title: Renormalization group flows for $Z_5$ parafermionic field theory
Authors: Vladimir S. Dotsenko and Benoit Estienne
Abstract: Using the renormalization group approach, the Coulomb gas and the coset techniques, the effect of slightly relevant perturbations is studied for the second parafermionic field theory with the symmetry $Z\_{5}$. New fixed points are found and classified.
