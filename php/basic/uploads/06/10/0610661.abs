Title: Constraining Extended Theories of Gravity using Solar System Tests
Authors: Gianluca Allemandi and Matteo Luca Ruggiero
Abstract: Solar System tests give nowadays constraints on the estimated value of the cosmological constant, which can be accurately derived from different experiments regarding gravitational redshift, light deflection, gravitational time-delay and geodesic precession. Assuming that each reasonable theory of gravitation should satisfy Solar System tests, we use these limits on the estimated value of the cosmological constant to constrain extended theories of Gravity, which are nowadays studied as possible theories for cosmological models and provide viable solutions to the cosmological constant problem and the explanation of the present acceleration of the Universe. We obtain that the estimated values, from Solar System tests, for the parameters appearing in the extended theories of Gravity are orders of magnitude bigger than the values obtained in the framework of cosmologically relevant theories.
