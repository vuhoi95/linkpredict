Title: Elliptic Flow, Kasner Universe and Holographic Dual of RHIC Fireball
Authors: Sang-Jin Sin and Shin Nakamura and Sang Pyo Kim
Abstract: We consider a holographic dual of hydrodynamics of N=4 SYM plasma that undergoes non-isotropic three-dimensional expansion relevant to RHIC fireball. Our model is a natural extension of the Bjorken's one-dimensional expansion, and it describes an elliptic flow whose v2 and eccentricity are given in terms of anisotropy parameters. Holographic renormalization shows that absence of conformal anomaly in the SYM theory constrains our local rest frame to be a Kasner spacetime. We show that the Kasner spcetime provides a simple description of the anisotropically expanding fluid within a well-controled approximation. We also find that the dual geometry determines some of the hydrodynamic quantities in terms of the initial condition and the fundamental constants.
