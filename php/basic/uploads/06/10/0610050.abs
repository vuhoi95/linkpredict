Title: Equivalence classes for gauge theories
Authors: M. A. M. Gomes and R. R. Landim
Abstract: In this paper we go deep into the connection between duality and fields redefinition for general bilinear models involving the 1-form gauge field $A$. A duality operator is fixed based on "gauge embedding" procedure. Dual models are shown to fit in equivalence classes of models with same fields redefinitions.
