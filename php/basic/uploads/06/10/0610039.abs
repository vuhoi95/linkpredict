Title: Super coset space geometry
Authors: A. F. Kleppe and Chris Wainwright
Abstract: Super coset spaces play an important role in the formulation of supersymmetric theories. The aim of this paper is to review and discuss the geometry of super coset spaces with particular focus on the way the geometrical structures of the super coset space G/H are inherited from the super Lie group G. The isometries of the super coset space are discussed and a definition of Killing supervectors - the supervectors associated with infinitesimal isometries - is given that can be easily extended to spaces other than coset spaces.
