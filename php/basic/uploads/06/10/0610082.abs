Title: Strategies and obstacles in constructing realistic higher-dimensional  models
Authors: Bohdan Grzadkowski and Jose Wudka
Abstract: We discuss several aspects of higher dimensional models that contain bulk gauge and fermion fields only. In particular we argue that non-standard boundary conditions involving charge-conjugate fermion fields offer attractive model building possibilities. We also discuss a no-go theorem for 5-dimensional models which severely limits their phenomenological relevance.
