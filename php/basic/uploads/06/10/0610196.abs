Authors: J. Bellorin and P. Meessen and T. Ortin
Abstract: We classify the supersymmetric solutions of ungauged N=1 d=5 SUGRA coupled to vector multiplets and hypermultiplets. All the solutions can be seen as deformations of solutions with frozen hyperscalars. We show explicitly how the 5-dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom black hole is deformed when hyperscalars are living on SO(4,1)/SO(4) are turned on, reducing its supersymmetry from 1/2 to 1/8. We also describe in the timelike and null cases the solutions that have one extra isometry and can be reduced to N=2,d=4 solutions. Our formulae allows the uplifting of certain N=2,d=4 black holes to N=1,d=5 black holes on KK monopoles or to pp-waves propagating along black strings.
