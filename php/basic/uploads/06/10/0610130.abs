Title: Power law in a gauge-invariant cut-off regularisation
Authors: T. Varin and J. Welzel and A. Deandrea and D. Davesne
Abstract: We study one-loop quantum corrections of a compactified Abelian 5d gauge field theory. We use a cut-off regularisation procedure which respects the symmetries of the model, i.e. gauge invariance, exhibits the expected power-like divergences and therefore allows the derivation of power-law behavior of the effective 4d gauge coupling in a coherent manner.
