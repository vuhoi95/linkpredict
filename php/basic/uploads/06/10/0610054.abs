Title: Testable Flipped SU(5) x U(1)_X Models
Authors: Jing Jiang and Tianjun Li and Dimitri V. Nanopoulos
Abstract: The little hierarchy between the GUT scale and the string scale may give us some hints that can be tested at the LHC. To achieve string-scale gauge coupling unification, we introduce additional vector-like particles. We require that these vector-like particles be standard, form complete GUT multiplets, and have masses around the TeV scale or close to the string scale. Interestingly, only the flipped SU(5) x U(1)_X models can work elegantly. We consider all possible sets of vector-like particles with masses around the TeV scale. And we introduce vector-like particles with masses close to the string scale which can mimic the string-scale threshold corrections. We emphasize that all of these vector-like particles can be obtained in the interesting flipped SU(5) x U(1)_X string models from the four-dimensional free fermionic string construction. Assuming the low-energy supersymmetry, high-scale supersymmetry, and split supersymmetry, we show that the string-scale gauge coupling unification can indeed be achieved in the flipped SU(5) x U(1)_X models. These models can be tested at the LHC by observing simple sets of vector-like particles at the TeV scale. Moreover, we discuss a simple flipped SU(5) x U(1)_X model with string-scale gauge coupling unification and high-scale supersymmetry by introducing only one pair of the vector-like particles at the TeV scale, and we predict the corresponding Higgs boson masses. Also, we briefly comment on the string-scale gauge coupling unification in the model with low-energy supersymmetry by introducing only one pair of the vector-like particles at the intermediate scale. And we briefly comment on the mixings among the SM fermions and the corresponding extra vector-like particles.
