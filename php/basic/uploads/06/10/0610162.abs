Title: Discrete symmetries and 1/3-quantum vortices in condensates of F=2 cold  atoms
Authors: Gordon W. Semenoff and Fei Zhou
Abstract: In this Letter we study discrete symmetries of mean field manifolds of condensates of F=2 cold atoms, and various unconventional quantum vortices. Discrete quaternion symmetries result in two species of spin defects that can only appear in integer vortices while {\em cyclic} symmetries are found to result in a phase shift of $2\pi/3$ (or $4\pi/3$) and therefore 1/3- (or 2/3-) quantum vortices in condensates. We also briefly discuss 1/3-quantum vortices in condensates of trimers.
