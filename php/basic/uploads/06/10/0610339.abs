Title: Tachyon warm inflationary universe models
Authors: R. Herrera and S. del Campo and C. Campuzano
Abstract: Warm inflationary universe models in a tachyon field theory are studied. General conditions required for these models to be realizable are derived and discussed. We describe scalar perturbations (in the longitudinal gauge) and tensor perturbations for these scenarios. We develop our models for a constant dissipation parameter $\Gamma$ in one case and one dependent on $\phi$ in the other case. We have been successful in describing such of inflationary universe models. We use recent astronomical observations for constraining the parameters appearing in our model. Also, our results are compared with their analogous found in the cool inflationary case.
