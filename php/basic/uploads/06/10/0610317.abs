Title: Bosonized supersymmetry of anyons and supersymmetric exotic particle on  the non-commutative plane
Authors: Peter A. Horvathy and Mikhail S. Plyushchay and Mauricio Valenzuela
Abstract: A covariant set of linear differential field equations, describing an N=1 supersymmetric anyon system in (2+1)D, is proposed in terms of Wigner's deformation of the bosonic Heisenberg algebra. The non-relativistic ``Jackiw-Nair'' limit extracts the ordinary bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom from the Heisenberg-Wigner algebra. It yields first-order, non-relativistic wave equations for a spinning particle on the non-commutative plane that admits a Galilean exotic planar N=1 supersymmetry.
