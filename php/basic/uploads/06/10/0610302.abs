Title: Renormalized Higher Powers of White Noise and the  Virasoro-Zamolodchikov-$w_\infty$ Algebra
Authors: Luigi Accardi and Andreas Boukas
Abstract: Recently (cf. \cite{ABIDAQP06} and \cite{ABIJMCS06}) L. Accardi and A. Boukas proved that the generators of the second quantized Virasoro--Zamolodchikov--$w_{\infty}$ algebra can be expressed in terms of the Renormalized Higher Powers of White Noise and conjectured that this inclusion might in fact be an identity, in the sense that the converse is also true. In this paper we prove that this conjecture is true. We also explain the difference between this result and the Boson representation of the Virasoro algebra, which realizes, in the 1--mode case (in particular without renormalization), an inclusion of this algebra into the full oscillator algebra. This inclusion was known in the physical literature and some heuristic results were obtained in the direction of the extension of this inclusion to the 1--mode Virasoro--Zamolodchikov--$w_{\infty}$ algebra. However the possibility of an identification of the second quantizations of these two algebras was not even conjectured in the physics literature.
