Title: Scherk-Schwarz twist in 5D conformal SUGRA
Authors: Hiroyuki Abe and Yutaka Sakamura
Abstract: We reinterpret the Scherk-Schwarz (SS) boundary condition for SU(2)_R in a compactified five-dimensional (5D) Poincare supergravity in terms of the twisted SU(2)_U gauge fixing in 5D conformal supergravity. In such translation, only the compensator hypermultiplet is relevant to the SS twist, and various properties of the SS mechanism can be easily understood. Especially we show the equivalence between the SS twist and boundary constant superpotentials at the full supergravity level.
