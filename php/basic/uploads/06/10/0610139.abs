Title: On the nature of "hidden symmetry" or "accidental degeneracy" in the  Kepler problem
Authors: Tamar T. Khachidze and Anzor A. Khelashvili
Abstract: We propose a symmetry of the Dirac equation under the interchange of signs of eigenvalues of the Dirac's $K$ operator. We show that the only potential which obeys this requirement is the Coulomb one for both vector and scalar cases.
