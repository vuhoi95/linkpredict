Title: Black String Entropy and Fourier-Mukai Transform
Authors: Iosif Bena and Duiliu-Emanuel Diaconescu and Bogdan Florea
Abstract: We propose a microscopic description of black strings in F-theory based on string duality and Fourier-Mukai transform. These strings admit several different microscopic descriptions involving D-brane as well as M2 or M5-brane configurations on elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds. In particular our results can also be interpreted as an asymptotic microstate count for D6-D2-D0 configurations in the limit of large D2-charge on the elliptic fiber. The leading behavior of the microstate degeneracy in this limit is shown to agree with the macroscopic entropy formula derived from the black string supergravity solution.
