Title: The AdS_5 x S^5 superstrings in the generalized light-cone gauge
Authors: H. Itoyama and T. Oota
Abstract: The kappa-symmetry-fixed Green-Schwarz action in the AdS_5 x S^5 background is treated canonically in a version of the light-cone gauge. After reviewing the generalized light-cone gauge for a bosonic sigma model, we present the Hamiltonian dynamics of the Green-Schwarz action by using the transverse degrees of freedom. The remaining fermionic constraints are all second class, which we treat by the Dirac bracket. Upon quantization, all of the transverse coordinates are inevitably non-commutative.
