Title: Black Ring Solutions in 5D Heterotic String Theory: A Full Field  Configuration
Authors: Alfredo Herrera-Aguilar and Hugo Raymundo Marquez-Falcon
Abstract: We show how to obtain a non-supersymmetric black ring configuration in the framework of 5D Heterotic String Theory using the matrix Ernst potential (MEP) formalism, which enables us to include non-trivial dilaton, gauge and antisymmetric tensor fields.
