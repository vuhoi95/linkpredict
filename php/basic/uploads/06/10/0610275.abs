Title: Correlator of Fundamental and Anti-symmetric Wilson Loops in AdS/CFT  Correspondence
Authors: Ta-Sheng Tai and Satoshi Yamaguchi
Abstract: We study the two circular Wilson loop correlator in which one is of anti-symmetric representation, while the other is of fundamental representation in 4-dimensional ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory. This correlator has a good AdS dual, which is a system of a D5-brane and a fundamental string. We calculated the on-shell action of the string, and clarified the Gross-Ooguri transition in this correlator. Some limiting cases are also examined.
