Title: Funnel's Fluctuations in Dyonic Case: Intersecting D1-D3 Branes
Authors: Jamila Douari and Arafa H Aly
Abstract: The fluctuations of funnel solutions of intersecting D1 and D3 branes are quite explicitly discussed by treating different modes and different directions of the fluctuation at the presence of world volume electric field. The boundary conditions are found to be Neumann boundary conditions.
