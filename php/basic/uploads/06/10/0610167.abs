Title: Electric S-brane solutions with parallel forms on Ricci-flat factor  space
Authors: V. D. Ivashchuk and V. N. Melnikov and D. Singleton
Abstract: In this paper we generalize electric S-brane solutions with maximal number of branes. Previously for the action containing D-dimensional gravity, a scalar field and antisymmetric (p+2)-form we found composite, electric S-brane solutions with all non-zero ``charge'' densities which obeyed self-duality or anti-self-duality relations. These solutions occurred when D = 4m+1 = 5, 9, 13, >... and p = 2m-1 = 1, 3, 5, ... Here we generalize these solutions to the case when the spatial 4m-dimensional submanifold is Ricci-flat rather than simply Euclidean-flat and the charge density form is a parallel self-dual or anti-self-dual form of rank 2m. Also generalizations are found for the case when there is an extra ``internal'' Ricci-flat manifold not covered by the S-branes. In the case when one allows a phantom scalar field a subset of these solutions lead to accelerated expansion of this extra spatial factor space not covered by the S-branes while the other spatial factor space of dimension 4m contracts. Some of these S-brane solutions also provide specific examples of solutions of type IIA supergravity.
