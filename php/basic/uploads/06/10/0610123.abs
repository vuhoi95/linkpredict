Title: Zeeman Effect In The Framework of Moyal Noncommutativity and String  Theory
Authors: A. El Boukili and E. H. Saidi and M. B. Sedra
Abstract: Stimulated by the importance of noncommutative geometry in recent developments in string theory, D-branes and integrable systems, one intends in this work to present a new insight towards adapting the famous idea of Zeeman effect to noncommutativity \`a la Moyal and develop an analysis leading to connect our results to the Bigatti-Suskind (BS) formulation.
