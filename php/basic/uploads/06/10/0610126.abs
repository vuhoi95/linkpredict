Title: Supersymmetric gyratons in five dimensions
Authors: Marco M. Caldarelli and Dietmar Klemm and Emanuele Zorzan
Abstract: We obtain the gravitational and electromagnetic field of a spinning radiation beam-pulse (a gyraton) in minimal five-dimensional gauged supergravity and show under which conditions the solution preserves part of the supersymmetry. The configurations represent generalizations of Lobatchevski waves on AdS with nonzero angular momentum, and possess a Siklos-Virasoro reparametrization invariance. We compute the holographic stress-energy tensor of the solutions and show that it transforms without anomaly under these reparametrizations. Furthermore, we present supersymmetric gyratons both in gauged and ungauged five-dimensional supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of vector supermultiplets, which include gyratons on domain walls.
