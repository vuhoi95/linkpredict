Title: Entanglement as a source of black hole entropy
Authors: Saurya Das and S. Shankaranarayanan
Abstract: We review aspects of black hole thermodynamics, and show how entanglement of a quantum field between the inside and outside of a horizon can account for the area-proportionality of black hole entropy, provided the field is in its ground state. We show that the result continues to hold for Coherent States and Squeezed States, while for Excited States, the entropy scales as a power of area less than unity. We also identify location of the degrees of freedom which give rise to the above entropy.
