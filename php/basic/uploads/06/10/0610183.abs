Abstract: We present globally regular vortex-type solutions for a pure SU(2) Yang-Mills field coupled to gravity in 3+1 dimensions. These gravitating vortices are static, cylindrically symmetric and purely magnetic, and they support a non-zero chromo-magnetic flux through their cross section. In addition, they carry a constant non-Abelian current, and so in some sense they are analogs of the superconducting cosmic strings. They have a compact central core dominated by a longitudinal magnetic field and endowed with an approximately Melvin geometry. This magnetic field component gets color screened in the exterior part of the core, outside of which the fields approach exponentially fast those of the electrovacuum Bonnor solutions with a circular magnetic field. In the far field zone the solutions are not asymptotically flat but tend to vacuum Kasner metrics.
