Title: Spectral tilt in A-term inflation
Authors: Rouzbeh Allahverdi and Anupam Mazumdar
Abstract: Recently in hep-ph/0605035 and hep-ph/0608138, we have shown that primordial inflation can be embedded within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, while providing the right amplitude for the density perturbations and a tilted spectrum which matches the current data. In this short note we show that the model predicts a range of spectral tilt, $0.92 \leq n_s \leq 1$, depending on deviation from the saddle point condition. The spectral tilt saturates the lower limit when the saddle point condition is met. On the other hand the upper limit can be achieved for a slight deviation towards the point of inflection. The running of the spectral tilt remains small, and the amplitude of the temperature anisotropies remains in the correct observational regime.
