Title: Thermodynamics of black holes in $(n+1)$-dimensional  Einstein-Born-Infeld dilaton gravity
Authors: A. Sheykhi and N. Riazi
Abstract: We construct a new class of $(n+1)$-dimensional $(n\geq3)$ black hole solutions in Einstein-Born-Infeld-dilaton gravity with Liouville-type potential for the dilaton field and investigate their properties. These solutions are neither asymptotically flat nor (anti)-de Sitter. We find that these solutions can represent black holes, with inner and outer event horizons, an extreme black hole or a naked singularity provided the parameters of the solutions are chosen suitably. We compute the thermodynamic quantities of the black hole solutions and find that these quantities satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. We also perform stability analysis and investigate the effect of dilaton on the stability of the solutions.
