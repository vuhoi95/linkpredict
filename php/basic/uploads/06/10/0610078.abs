Abstract: We analyze the axially-symmetric scalar perturbations of 6D chiral gauged supergravity compactified on the general warped geometries in the presence of two source branes. We find all of the conical geometries are marginally stable for normalizable perturbations (in disagreement with some recent calculations) and the nonconical for regular perturbations, even though none of them are supersymmetric (apart from the trivial Salam-Sezgin solution, for which there are no source branes). The marginal direction is the one whose presence is required by the classical scaling property of the field equations, and all other modes have positive squared mass. In the special case of the conical solutions, including (but not restricted to) the unwarped `rugby-ball' solutions, we find closed-form expressions for the mode functions in terms of Legendre and Hypergeometric functions. In so doing we show how to match the asymptotic near-brane form for the solution to the physics of the source branes, and thereby how to physically interpret perturbations which can be singular at the brane positions.
