Title: The box diagram in Yukawa theory
Authors: Bernard L. G. Bakker and Jorn K. Boomsma and Chueng-Ryong Ji
Abstract: We present a light-front calculation of the box diagram in Yukawa theory. The covariant box diagram is finite for the case of spin-1/2 constituents exchanging spin-0 particles. In light-front dynamics, however, individual time-ordered diagrams are divergent. We analyze the corresponding light-front singularities and show the equivalence between the light-front and covariant results by taming the singularities.
