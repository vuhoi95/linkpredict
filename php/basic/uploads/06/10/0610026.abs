Title: Vacuum induced torque between corrugated metallic plates
Authors: Robson B. Rodrigues and Paulo A. Maia Neto and A. Lambrecht and S. Reynaud
Abstract: We study the torque arising between two corrugated metallic plates due to the interaction with electromagnetic vacuum. This Casimir torque can be measured with torsion pendulum techniques for separation distances as large as 1$\mu$m. It allows one to probe the nontrivial geometry dependence of the Casimir energy in a configuration which can be evaluated theoretically with accuracy. In the optimal experimental configuration, the commonly used proximity force approximation turns out to overestimate the torque by a factor 2 or larger.
