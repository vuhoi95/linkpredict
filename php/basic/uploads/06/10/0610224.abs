Title: Two and Three Loops Beta Function of Non Commutative $Î¦^4_4$ Theory
Authors: Margherita Disertori and Vincent Rivasseau
Abstract: The simplest non commutative renormalizable field theory, the $\phi_4^4$ model on four dimensional Moyal space with harmonic potential is asymptotically safe at one loop, as shown by H. Grosse and R. Wulkenhaar. We extend this result up to three loops. If this remains true at any loop, it should allow a full non perturbative construction of this model.
