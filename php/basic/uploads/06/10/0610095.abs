Title: Dynamical properties of a Soliton in a Potential Well
Authors: B. Piette and W. J. Zakrzewski
Abstract: We analyse the scattering of a two-dimensional soliton on a potential well. We show that this soliton can pass through the well, bounce back or become trapped and we study the dependence of the critical velocity on the width and the depth of the well. We also present a model based on a pseudo-geodesic approximation to the full system which shows that the vibrational modes of the soliton play a crucial role in the dynamical properties of its interactions with potential wells.
