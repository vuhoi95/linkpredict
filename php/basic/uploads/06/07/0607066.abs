Title: Quantum Collective QCD String Dynamics
Authors: Steven Steinke and Johann Rafelski
Abstract: The string breaking model of particle production is extended in order to help explain the transverse momentum distribution in elementary collisions. Inspired by an idea of Bialas', we treat the string using a collective coordinate approach. This leads to a chromo-electric field strength which fluctuates, and in turn implies that quarks are produced according to a thermal distribution.
