Title: Triangulated Surfaces in Twistor Space: A Kinematical Set up for  Open/Closed String Duality
Authors: M. Carfora and C. Dappiaggi and V. L. Gili
Abstract: We exploit the properties of the three-dimensional hyperbolic space to discuss a simplicial setting for open/closed string duality based on (random) Regge triangulations decorated with null twistorial fields. We explicitly show that the twistorial N-points function, describing Dirichlet correlations over the moduli space of open N-bordered genus g surfaces, is naturally mapped into the Witten-Kontsevich intersection theory over the moduli space of N-pointed closed Riemann surfaces of the same genus. We also discuss various aspects of the geometrical setting which connects this model to PSL(2,C) Chern-Simons theory.
