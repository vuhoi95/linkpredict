Authors: Arindam Chakraborty and Subhankar Ray and J. Shamanna
Abstract: The integrability of a classical Calogero systems with anti-periodic boundary condition is studied. This system is equivalent to the periodic model in the presence of a magnetic field. Gauge momentum operators for the anti-periodic Calogero system are constructed. These operators are hermitian and simultaneously diagonalizable with the Hamiltonian. A general scheme for constructing such momentum operators for trigonometric and hyperbolic Calogero-Sutherland model is proposed. The scheme is applicable for both periodic and anti-periodic boundary conditions. The existence of these momentum operators ensures the integrability of the system. The interaction parameter $\lambda$ is restricted to a certain subset of real numbers. This restriction is in fact essential for the construction of the hermitian gauge momentum operators.
