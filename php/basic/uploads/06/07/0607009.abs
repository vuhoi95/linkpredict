Title: Classical and quantum behavior of the generic cosmological solution
Authors: Giovanni Imponente and Giovanni Montani
Abstract: In the present paper we generalize the original work of C.W. Misner \cite{M69q} about the quantum dynamics of the Bianchi type IX geometry near the cosmological singularity. We extend the analysis to the generic inhomogeneous universe by solving the super-momentum constraint and outlining the dynamical decoupling of spatial points. Firstly, we discuss the classical evolution of the model in terms of the Hamilton-Jacobi approach as applied to the super-momentum and super-Hamiltonian constraints; then we quantize it in the approximation of a square potential well after an ADM reduction of the dynamics with respect to the super-momentum constraint only. Such a reduction relies on a suitable form for the generic three-metric tensor which allows the use of its three functions as the new spatial coordinates. We get a functional representation of the quantum dynamics which is equivalent to the Misner-like one when extended point by point, since the Hilbert space factorizes into $\infty^3$ independent components due to the parametric role that the three-coordinates assume in the asymptotic potential term. Finally, we discuss the conditions for having a semiclassical behavior of the dynamics and we recognize that this already corresponds to having mean occupation numbers of order $\mathcal{O}(10^2)$.
