Title: Confinement from constant field condensates
Authors: Patricio Gaete and Eduardo Guendelman and Euro Spallucci
Abstract: For a $(2+1)$-dimensional reformulated SU(2) Yang-Mills theory, we compute the interaction potential within the framework of the gauge-invariant but path-dependent variables formalism. This reformulation is due to the presence of a constant gauge field condensate. Our results show that the interaction energy contains a linear term leading to the confinement of static probe charges. This result is equivalent to that of the massive Schwinger model.
