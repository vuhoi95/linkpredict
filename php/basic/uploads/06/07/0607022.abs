Abstract: We develop the linear equations that describe graviton perturbations of AdS_5-Schwarzschild generated by a string trailing behind an external quark moving with constant velocity. Solving these equations allows us to evaluate the stress tensor in the boundary gauge theory. Components of the stress tensor exhibit directional structures in Fourier space at both large and small momentum. We comment on the possible relevance of our results to relativistic heavy ion collisions.
