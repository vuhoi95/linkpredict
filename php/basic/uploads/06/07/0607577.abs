Title: Measuring Statistical Isotropy of CMB Anisotropy
Authors: Tarun Souradeep and Amir Hajian and Soumen Basak
Abstract: The statistical expectation values of the temperature fluctuations and polarization of cosmic microwave background (CMB) are assumed to be preserved under rotations of the sky. We investigate the statistical isotropy (SI) of the CMB maps recently measured by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) using the bipolar spherical harmonic formalism proposed in Hajian & Souradeep 2003 for CMB temperature anisotropy and extended to CMB polarization in Basak, Hajian & Souradeep 2006. The Bipolar Power Spectrum (BiPS) had been measured for the full sky CMB anisotropy maps of the first year WMAP data and now for the recently released three years of WMAP data. We also introduce and measure directional sensitive reduced Bipolar coefficients on the three year WMAP ILC map. Consistent with our published results from first year WMAP data we have no evidence for violation of statistical isotropy on large angular scales. Preliminary analysis of the recently released first WMAP polarization maps, however, indicate significant violation of SI even when the foreground contaminated regions are masked out. Further work is required to confirm a possible cosmic origin and rule out the (more likely) origin in observational artifact such as foreground residuals at high galactic latitude.
