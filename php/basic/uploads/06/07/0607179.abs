Title: Twist as a Symmetry Principle and the Noncommutative Gauge Theory  Formulation
Authors: M. Chaichian and A. Tureanu and G. Zet
Abstract: Based on the analysis of the most natural and general ansatz, we conclude that the concept of twist symmetry, originally obtained for the noncommutative space-time, cannot be extended to include internal gauge symmetry. The case is reminiscent of the Coleman-Mandula theorem. Invoking the supersymmetry may reverse the situation.
