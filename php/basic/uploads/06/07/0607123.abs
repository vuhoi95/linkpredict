Title: A Holographic Dual of Hydrodynamics
Authors: Shin Nakamura and Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: We consider a gravity dual description of time dependent, strongly interacting large-Nc N=4 SYM. We regard the gauge theory system as a fluid with shear viscosity. Our fluid is expanding in one direction following the Bjorken's picture that is relevant to RHIC experiments. We obtain the dual geometry at the late time that is consistent with dissipative hydrodynamics. We show that the integration constants that cannot be determined by hydrodynamics are given by looking at the horizon of the dual geometry. Relationship between time dependence of the energy density and bulk singularity is also discussed.
