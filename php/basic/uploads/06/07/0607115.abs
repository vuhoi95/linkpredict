Title: Noncommutative Gravity
Authors: E. Harikumar and Victor O. Rivelles
Abstract: We consider simple extensions of noncommutativity from flat to curved spacetime. One possibility is to have a generalization of the Moyal product with a covariantly constant noncommutative tensor $\theta^{\mu\nu}$. In this case the spacetime symmetry is restricted to volume preserving diffeomorphisms which also preserve $\theta^{\mu\nu}$. Another possibility is an extension of the Kontsevich product to curved spacetime. In both cases the noncommutative product is nonassociative. We find the the order $\theta^2$ noncommutative correction to the Newtonian potential in the case of a covariantly constant $\theta^{\mu\nu}$. It is still of the form $1/r$ plus an angle dependent piece. The coupling to matter gives rise to a propagator which is $\theta$ dependent.
