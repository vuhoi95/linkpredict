Title: The role of the electromagnetic field in the formation of domains in the  process of symmetry breaking phase transitions
Authors: Emilio Del Giudice and Giuseppe Vitiello
Abstract: In the framework of quantum field theory we discuss the emergence of a phase locking among the electromagnetic modes and the matter components on an extended space-time region. We discuss the formation of extended domains exhibiting in their fundamental states non-vanishing order parameters, whose existence is not included in the Lagrangian. Our discussion is motivated by the interest in the study of the general problem of the stability of mesoscopic and macroscopic complex systems arising from fluctuating quantum components in connection with the problem of defect formation during the process of non-equilibrium symmetry breaking phase transitions characterized by an order parameter.
