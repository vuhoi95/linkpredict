Title: Lorentz Symmetry Derived from Lorentz Violation in the Bulk
Authors: Orfeu Bertolami and Carla Carvalho
Abstract: We consider bulk fields coupled to the graviton in a Lorentz violating fashion. We expect that the overly tested Lorentz symmetry might set constraints on the induced Lorentz violation in the brane, and hence on the dynamics of the interaction of bulk fields on the brane. We also use the requirement for Lorentz symmetry to constrain the cosmological constant observed on the brane.
