Title: The Spatial String Tension, Thermal Phase Transition, and AdS/QCD
Authors: Oleg Andreev and Valentine I. Zakharov
Abstract: We present results of modeling the temperature dependence of the spatial string tension and thermal phase transition in a five-dimensional framework nowadays known as AdS/QCD. For temperatures close to the critical one we find a behaviour remarkably consistent with the lattice results.
