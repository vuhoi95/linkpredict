Title: Ageing in disordered magnets and local scale-invariance
Authors: Malte Henkel and Michel Pleimling
Abstract: The ageing of the bond-disordered two-dimensional Ising model quenched to below its critical point is studied through the two-time autocorrelator and thermoremanent magnetization (TRM). The corresponding ageing exponents are determined. The form of the scaling function of the TRM is well described by the theory of local scale-invariance.
