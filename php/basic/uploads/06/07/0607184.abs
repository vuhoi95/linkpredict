Title: Amplitude for N-Gluon Superstring Scattering
Authors: S. Stieberger and T. R. Taylor
Abstract: We consider scattering processes involving N gluonic massless states of open superstrings with certain Regge slope alpha'. At the semi-classical level, the string world-sheet sweeps a disk and N gluons are created or annihilated at the boundary. We present exact expressions for the corresponding amplitudes, valid to all orders in alpha', for the so-called maximally helicity violating configurations, with N=4, 5 and N=6. We also obtain the leading O(alpha'^2) string corrections to the zero-slope N-gluon Yang-Mills amplitudes.
