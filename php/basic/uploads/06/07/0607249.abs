Authors: Kazem Bitaghsir-Fadafan and Mohammad R. Garousi
Abstract: We apply the prescription proposed in hep-th/0307197 for non-abelian expansion of S-matrix elements, to the S-matrix element of four tachyons and one gauge field in superstring theory. We show that the leading order terms of the expansion are in perfect agreement with the non-abelian generalization of the tachyon DBI action in which the tachyon potential is $V(T)=1+\pi\alpha' m^2T^2+\frac{1}{2!}(\pi\alpha' m^2T^2)^2+...$ where $m^2=-1/(2\alpha')$ is the mass of tachyon. This calculation fixes the coefficient of $T^4$ in the potential without on-shell ambiguity.
