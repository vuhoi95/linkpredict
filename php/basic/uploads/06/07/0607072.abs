Title: Anisotropic effects of background fields on Born-Infeld electromagnetic  waves
Authors: Matias Aiello and Gabriel Bengochea and Rafael Ferraro
Abstract: We show exact solutions of Born-Infeld theory for electromagnetic plane waves propagating in the presence of static background fields. The non-linear character of Born-Infeld equations generates an interaction between background and wave that changes the speed of propagation and adds a longitudinal component to the wave. As a consequence, in a magnetic background the ray direction differs from the propagation direction --a behavior resembling the one of a wave in an anisotropic medium--. This feature could open up a way to experimental tests of Born-Infeld theory.
