Title: Above Barrier Dirac Multiple Scattering and Resonances
Authors: Stefano De Leo and Pietro Rotelli
Abstract: We extend an above barrier analysis made with the Schrodinger equation to the Dirac equation. We demonstrate the perfect agreement between the barrier results and back to back steps. This implies the existence of multiple (indeed infinite) reflected and transmitted wave packets. These packets may be well separated in space or partially overlap. In the latter case interference effects can occur. For the extreme case of total overlap we encounter resonances. The conditions under which resonance phenomena can be observed is discussed and illustrated by numerical calculations.
