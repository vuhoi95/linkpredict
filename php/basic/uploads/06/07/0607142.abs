Title: Pure Gauge SU(2) Seiberg-Witten Theory and Modular Forms
Authors: Kirsten Vogeler and Michael Flohr
Abstract: We identify the spectral curve of pure gauge SU(2) Seiberg-Witten theory with the Weierstrass curve $\mathbbm{C}/L \ni z \mapsto (1,\wp(z),\wp(z)')$ and thereby obtain explicitely a modular form from which the moduli space parameter $u$ and lattice parameters $a$, $a_D$ can be derived in terms of modular respectively theta functions. We further discuss its relationship with the $c=-2$ triplet model conformal field theory.
