Title: Decays of Four Intersecting Fluxbranes
Authors: Sunggeun Lee and Soonkeon Nam
Abstract: We consider decays of four intersecting fluxbranes which are obtained by considering a higher dimensional Kerr blackhole with four angular momentum parameters, which is the maximum number of angular momentum parameters in string/M-theory. As a result of the intersection, we get lower dimensional fluxbranes. Since generic magnetic fields break all supersymmetries, the resulting fluxbranes are unstable and will decay. Just as a single fluxbrane decays into the nucleation of spherical D6-branes; the intersecting ones decay into the nucleation of lower dimensional spherical branes. Contrary to a single fluxbrane case, the decay of four intersecting fluxbranes has additional decay channels. We also calculate the corresponding Euclidean action to obtain the decay rates. Although the action cannot be explicitly and simply written in terms of the magnetic parameters, we can extract some interesting results by taking various limits of the magnetic parameters.
