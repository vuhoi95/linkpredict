Title: Dyon Spectrum in N=4 Supersymmetric Type II String Theories
Authors: Justin R. David and Dileep P. Jatkar and Ashoke Sen
Abstract: We compute the spectrum of quarter BPS dyons in freely acting Z_2 and Z_3 orbifolds of type II string theory compactified on a six dimensional torus. For large charges the result for statistical entropy computed from the degeneracy formula agrees with the corresponding black hole entropy to first non-leading order after taking into account corrections due to the curvature squared terms in the effective action. The result is significant since in these theories the entropy of a small black hole, computed using the curvature squared corrections to the effective action, fails to reproduce the statistical entropy associated with elementary string states.
