Title: Super Symmetric Partners in T4- space
Authors: P. S. Bisht and O. P. S. Negi
Abstract: Constructing the operators connecting the state of energy associated with super partner Hamiltonians and super partner potentials for a linear harmonic oscillator has been discussed and it is shown that any super symmetric eigen state of one of the super partner potentials in T4-space is paired in energy with a symmetric eigen state of the other partner potential.
