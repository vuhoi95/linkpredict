Title: Algebraic Quantum Gravity (AQG) II. Semiclassical Analysis
Authors: K. Giesel and T. Thiemann
Abstract: In the previous article a new combinatorial and thus purely algebraical approach to quantum gravity, called Algebraic Quantum Gravity (AQG), was introduced. In the framework of AQG existing semiclassical tools can be applied to operators that encode the dynamics of AQG such as the Master constraint operator. In this article we will analyse the semiclassical limit of the (extended) algebraic Master constraint operator and show that it reproduces the correct infinitesimal generators of General Relativity. Therefore the question whether General Relativity is included in the semiclassical sector of the theory, which is still an open problem in LQG, can be significantly improved in the framework of AQG. For the calculations we will substitute SU(2) by U(1)^3. That this substitution is justified will be demonstrated in the third article of this series
