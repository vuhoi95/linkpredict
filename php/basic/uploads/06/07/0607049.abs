Title: Asymptotic Entanglement of Two Independent Systems in a Common Bath
Authors: F. Benatti and R. Floreanini
Abstract: Two, non-interacting systems immersed in a common bath and evolving with a Markovian, completely positive dynamics can become initially entangled via a purely noisy mechanism. Remarkably, for certain, phenomenologically relevant environments, the quantum correlations can persist even in the asymptotic long-time regime.
