Authors: Joshua L. Davis and Finn Larsen and Ross O'Connell and Diana Vaman
Abstract: We study d=2 0A string theory perturbed by tachyon momentum modes in backgrounds with non-trivial tachyon condensate and Ramond-Ramond (RR) flux. In the matrix model description, we uncover a complexified Toda lattice hierarchy constrained by a pair of novel holomorphic string equations. We solve these constraints in the classical limit for general RR flux and tachyon condensate. Due to the non-holomorphic nature of the tachyon perturbations, the transcendental equations which we derive for the string susceptibility are manifestly non-holomorphic. We explore the phase structure and critical behavior of the theory.
