Title: New family of models for incompressible quantum liquids in $d\geq 2$
Authors: Chyh-Hong Chern and Dung-Hai Lee
Abstract: Through Haldane's construction, the fractional quantum Hall states on a two-sphere was shown to be the ground states of {\it one-dimensional} SU(2) spin Hamiltonians. In this Letter we generalize this construction to obtain a new class of SU(N) spin Hamiltonians. These Hamiltonians describes center-of-mass-position conserving pair hopping fermions in space dimension $d\ge 2$. We conjecture that the excitations of these models posses fractional fermion number.
