Title: Measuring Modular Weights in Mirage Unification Models at the LHC and  ILC
Authors: Howard Baer and Eun-Kyung Park and Xerxes Tata and Ting T. Wang
Abstract: String compactification with fluxes yields MSSM soft SUSY breaking terms that receive comparable contributions from modulus and anomaly mediation whose relative strength is governed by a phenomenological parameter $\alpha$. Gaugino and first/second generation (and sometimes also Higgs and third generation) scalar mass parameters unify at a mirage unification scale $Q \not= M_{\rm GUT}$, determined by the value of $\alpha$. The ratio of scalar to gaugino masses at this mirage unification scale depends directly on the scalar field modular weights, which are fixed in turn by the brane or brane intersections on which the MSSM fields are localized. We outline a program of measurements which can in principle be made at the CERN LHC and the International Linear $e^+e^-$ collider (ILC) which can lead to a determination of the modular weights.
