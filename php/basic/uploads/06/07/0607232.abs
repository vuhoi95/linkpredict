Title: Logarithmic Minimal Models
Authors: Paul A. Pearce and Jorgen Rasmussen and Jean-Bernard Zuber
Abstract: Working in the dense loop representation, we use the planar Temperley-Lieb algebra to build integrable lattice models called logarithmic minimal models LM(p,p'). Specifically, we construct Yang-Baxter integrable Temperley-Lieb models on the strip acting on link states and consider their associated Hamiltonian limits. These models and their associated representations of the Temperley-Lieb algebra are inherently non-local and not (time-reversal) symmetric. In the continuum scaling limit, they yield logarithmic conformal field theories with central charges c=1-6(p-p')^2/pp' where p,p'=1,2,... are coprime. The first few members of the principal series LM(m,m+1) are critical dense polymers (m=1, c=-2), critical percolation (m=2, c=0) and logarithmic Ising model (m=3, c=1/2). For the principal series, we find an infinite family of integrable and conformal boundary conditions organized in an extended Kac table with conformal weights Delta_{r,s}=(((m+1)r-ms)^2-1)/4m(m+1), r,s=1,2,.... The associated conformal partition functions are given in terms of Virasoro characters of highest-weight representations. Individually, these characters decompose into a finite number of characters of irreducible representations. We show with examples how indecomposable representations arise from fusion.
