Title: Classical instability of Kerr-AdS black holes and the issue of final  state
Authors: Vitor Cardoso and Oscar J. C. Dias and Shijun Yoshida
Abstract: It is now established that small Kerr-Anti-de Sitter (Kerr-AdS) black holes are unstable against scalar perturbations, via superradiant amplification mechanism. We show that small Kerr-AdS black holes are also unstable against gravitational perturbations and we compute the features of this instability. We also describe with great detail the evolution of this instability. In particular, we identify its endpoint state. It corresponds to a Kerr-AdS black hole whose boundary is an Einstein universe rotating with the light velocity. This black hole is expected to be slightly oblate and to co-exist in equilibrium with a certain amount of outside radiation.
