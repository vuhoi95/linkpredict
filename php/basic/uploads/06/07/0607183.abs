Title: Meta-Stable Supersymmetry Breaking Vacua on Intersecting Branes
Authors: Hirosi Ooguri and Yutaka Ookouchi
Abstract: We identify configurations of intersecting branes that correspond to the meta-stable supersymmetry breaking vacua in the four-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory coupled to massive flavors. We show how their energies, the stability properties, and the decay processes are described geometrically in terms of the brane configurations.
