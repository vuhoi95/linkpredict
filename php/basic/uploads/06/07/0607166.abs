Title: Unruh effect for a Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati Brane
Authors: Hongsheng Zhang and Zong-Hong Zhu
Abstract: In braneworld cosmology the brane accelerates in the bulk, and hence it perceives Unruh radiations in the bulk. We discuss the Unruh effect for a Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) brane. We find that the Unruh temperature is proportional to the acceleration of the brane, but chemical potential appears in the distribution function for massless modes. The Unruh temperature does not vanish even at the limit $r_c\to \infty$, which means the gravitational effect of the 5th dimension vanishes. The Unruh temperature equals the $geometric$ temperature when the the density of matter on the brane goes to zero for branch $\epsilon=1$, no matter what the value of the cross radius $r_c$ and the spatial curvature of the brane take. And if the state equation of the matter on the brane satisfies $p=-\rho$, the Unruh temperature always equals the geometric temperature of the brane for both the two branches, which is also independent of the cross radius and the spatial curvature. The Unruh temperature is always higher than geometric temperature for a dust dominated brane.
