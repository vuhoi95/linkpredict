Title: The N=8 Supergravity Hamiltonian as a Quadratic Form
Authors: Sudarshan Ananth and Lars Brink and Rainer Heise and Harald G. Svendsen
Abstract: We conjecture that the light-cone Hamiltonian of N=8 Supergravity can be expressed as a quadratic form. We explain why this rewriting is unique to maximally supersymmetric theories. The N=8 quartic interaction vertex is constructed and used to verify that this conjecture holds to second order in the coupling constant.
