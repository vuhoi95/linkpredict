Title: N=4 superconformal mechanics as a Non linear Realization
Authors: Andres Anabalon and Joaquim Gomis and Kiyoshi Kamimura and Jorge Zanelli
Abstract: An action for a superconformal particle is constructed using the non linear realization method for the group PSU(1,1|2), without introducing superfields. The connection between PSU(1,1|2) and black hole physics is discussed. The lagrangian contains six arbitrary constants and describes a non-BPS superconformal particle. The BPS case is obtained if a precise relation between the constants in the lagrangian is verified, which implies that the action becomes kappa-symmetric.
