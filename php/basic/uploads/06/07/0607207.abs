Title: Cancellation of energy-divergences and renormalizability in Coulomb  gauge QCD within the Lagrangian formalism
Authors: A. Ni√©gawa and M. Inui and H. Kohyama
Abstract: In Coulomb gauge QCD in the Lagrangian formalism, energy divergences arise in individual diagrams. We give a proof on cancellation of these divergences to all orders of perturbation theory without obstructing the algebraic renormalizability of the theory.
