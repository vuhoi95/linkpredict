Title: Supersymmetric Rotating Black Hole in a Compactified Spacetime
Authors: Kei-ichi Maeda and Nobuyoshi Ohta and Makoto Tanabe
Abstract: We construct a supersymmetric rotating black hole with asymptotically flat four-dimensional spacetime times a circle, by superposing an infinite number of BMPV black hole solutions at the same distance in one direction. The near horizon structure is the same as that of the five-dimensional BMPV black hole. The rotation of this black hole can exceed the Kerr bound in general relativity ($q\equiv a/G_4 M=1$), if the size is small.
