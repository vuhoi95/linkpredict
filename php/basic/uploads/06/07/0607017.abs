Title: The rational parts of one-loop QCD amplitudes III: The six-gluon case
Authors: Zhi-Guang Xiao and Gang Yang and Chuan-Jie Zhu
Abstract: The rational parts of 6-gluon one-loop amplitudes with scalars circulating in the loop are computed by using the newly developed method for computing the rational parts directly from Feynman integrals. We present the analytic results for the two MHV helicity configurations: $(1^-2^+3^+4^-5^+6^+)$ and $(1^-2^+3^-4^+5^+6^+)$, and the two NMHV helicity configurations: $(1^-2^-3^+4^-5^+6^+)$ and $(1^-2^+3^-4^+5^-6^+)$. Combined with the previously computed results for the cut-constructible part, our results are the last missing pieces for the complete partial helicity amplitudes of the 6-gluon one-loop QCD amplitude.
