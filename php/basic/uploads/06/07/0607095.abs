Title: Generalised N=2 permutation branes
Authors: Stefan Fredenhagen and Matthias R. Gaberdiel
Abstract: Generalised permutation branes in products of N=2 minimal models play an important role in accounting for all RR charges of Gepner models. In this paper an explicit conformal field theory construction of these generalised permutation branes for one simple class of examples is given. We also comment on how this may be generalised to the other cases.
