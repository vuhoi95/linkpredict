Title: Phantom field fluctuation induced Higgs effect
Authors: A. Patkos and Zs. Szep
Abstract: Symmetry breaking solutions are investigated in the $N\to \infty$ limit for the ground state of a system consisting of a Lorentz-scalar, N component ``phantom'' field and an O(N) singlet. The most general form of O(N) x Z_2 invariant quartic interaction is considered. The non-perturbatively renormalised solution demonstrates the possibility for Z_2 symmetry breaking induced by phantom fluctuations. It becomes also evident that the strength of the ``internal'' dynamics of the N-component field tunes away the ratio of the Higgs condensate and the Higgs mass from its perturbative (nearly tree-level) expression.
