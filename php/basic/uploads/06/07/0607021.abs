Title: A note on topological amplitudes in hybrid string theory
Authors: J. Kappeli and S. Theisen and P. Vanhove
Abstract: We study four-dimensional compactifications of type II superstrings on Calabi-Yau spaces in the hybrid formalism. Chiral and twisted-chiral interactions are rederived, which involve the coupling of the compactification moduli to two powers of the Weyl-tensor and of the derivative of the universal tensor field-strength. We review the formalism and provide details of some of its technicalities.
