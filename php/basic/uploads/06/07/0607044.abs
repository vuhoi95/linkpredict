Abstract: Recently, classical solutions for strings moving in AdS5 x S5 have played an important role in understanding the AdS/CFT correspondence. A large set of them were shown to follow from an ansatz that reduces the solution of the string equations of motion to the study of a well-known integrable 1-d system known as the Neumann-Rosochatius (NR) system. However, other simple solutions such as spiky strings or giant magnons in S5 were not included in the NR ansatz. We show that, when considered in the conformal gauge, these solutions can be also accomodated by a version of the NR-system. This allows us to describe in detail a giant magnon solution with two additional angular momenta and show that it can be interpreted as a superposition of two magnons moving with the same speed. In addition, we consider the spin chain side and describe the corresponding state as that of two bound states in the infinite SU(3) spin chain. We construct the Bethe ansatz wave function for such bound state.
