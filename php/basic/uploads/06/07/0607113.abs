Title: Confinement from spontaneous breaking of scale symmetry
Authors: Patricio Gaete and Eduardo Guendelman
Abstract: We show that one can obtain naturally the confinement of static charges from the spontaneous symmetry breaking of scale invariance in a gauge theory. At the classical level a confining force is obtained and at the quantum level, using a gauge invariant but path-dependent variables formalism, the Cornell confining potential is explicitly obtained. Our procedure answers completely to the requirements by 't Hooft for ''perturbative confinement''.
