Title: An Index Theorem for Graphene
Authors: Jiannis K. Pachos and Michael Stone
Abstract: We consider a graphene sheet folded in an arbitrary geometry, compact or with nanotube-like open boundaries. In the continuous limit, the Hamiltonian takes the form of the Dirac operator, which provides a good description of the low energy spectrum of the lattice system. We derive an index theorem that relates the zero energy modes of the graphene sheet with the topology of the lattice. The result coincides with analytical and numerical studies for the known cases of fullerene molecules and carbon nanotubes and it extend to more complicated molecules. Potential applications to topological quantum computation are discussed.
