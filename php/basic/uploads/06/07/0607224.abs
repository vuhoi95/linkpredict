Title: String predictions for near future colliders from one-loop scattering  amplitudes around D-brane worlds
Authors: Massimo Bianchi and Alessio V. Santini
Abstract: We derive compact expressions for one-loop scattering amplitudes of four open-string vector bosons around supersymmetric configurations with intersecting or magnetized D-branes on toroidal orbifolds. We check the validity of our formulae against the structure of their singularities and their behaviour under modular transformations to the transverse channel, exposing closed string exchange. We then specialize to the case of forward scattering and compute the total cross section for two massless open string vector bosons on the brane to decay into closed strings in the bulk, relying on the optical theorem. Although not directly related to collider signatures our predictions represent a step forward towards unveiling phenomenological implications of open and unoriented superstrings
