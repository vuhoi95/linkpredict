Title: Perturbative zero-point energy for a cylinder of elliptical section
Authors: Adrian R. Kitson and August Romeo
Abstract: We examine the Casimir effect for a perfectly conducting cylinder of elliptical section, taking as reference the known case of circular section. The zero-point energy of this system is evaluated by the mode summation method, using the ellipticity as a perturbation parameter. Mathieu function techniques are applied.
