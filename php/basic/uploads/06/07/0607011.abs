Title: Can Quantum Gravitational Effects Manifest themselves at Large  Distances?
Authors: Kourosh Nozari and Behnaz Fazlpour
Abstract: Consider a proposed model of the universe with $\hbar$ much greater than its well-known value of $10^{-34} Js$. In this model universe, very large objects can show quantum behaviors. In a scenario with large extra dimensions, $\hbar$ can attains very large values depending on the dimensionality of spacetime. In this letter, we show that although conventional thinking indicates that quantum gravitational effects should manifest themselves only at very small scales, in actuality quantum gravitational effects can manifest themselves at large scales too. We use the generalized uncertainty principle with a non-zero minimal uncertainty in momentum as our primary input to construct a mathematical framework for our proposal.
