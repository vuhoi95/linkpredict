Title: Towards Noncommutative Quantum Black Holes
Authors: J. C. Lopez-Dominguez and O. Obregon and C. Ramirez and M. Sabido
Abstract: In this paper we study noncommutative black holes. We use a diffeomorphism between the Schwarzschild black hole and the Kantowski-Sachs cosmological model, which is generalized to noncommutative minisuperspace. Through the use of the Feynman-Hibbs procedure we are able to study the thermodynamics of the black hole, in particular, we calculate the Hawking's temperature and entropy for the noncommutative Schwarzschild black hole.
