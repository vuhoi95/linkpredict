Title: Thermal Operator and Cutting Rules at Finite Temperature and Chemical  Potential
Authors: F. T. Brandt and Ashok Das and Olivier Espinosa and J. Frenkel and Silvana Perez
Abstract: In the context of scalar field theories, both real and complex, we derive the cutting description at finite temperature (with zero/finite chemical potential) from the cutting rules at zero temperature through the action of a simple thermal operator. We give an alternative algebraic proof of the largest time equation which brings out the underlying physics of such a relation. As an application of the cutting description, we calculate the imaginary part of the one loop retarded self-energy at zero/finite temperature and finite chemical potential and show how this description can be used to calculate the dispersion relation as well as the full physical self-energy of thermal particles.
