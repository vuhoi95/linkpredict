Title: Drag force in SYM plasma with B field from AdS/CFT
Authors: Toshihiro Matsuo and Dan Tomino and Wen-Yu Wen
Abstract: We investigate drag force in a thermal plasma of N=4 super Yang-Mills theory via both fundamental and Dirichlet strings under the influence of non-zero NSNS $B$-field background. In the description of AdS/CFT correspondence the endpoint of these strings correspondes to an external monopole or quark moving with a constant electromagnetic field. We demonstrate how the configuration of string tail as well as the drag force obtains corrections in this background.
