Abstract: In this review we first discuss the theoretical motivations for possible CPT violation and deviations from ordinary quantum-mechanical behavior of field-theoretic systems in the context of an extended class of quantum-gravity models. Then we proceed to a description of precision tests of CPT symmetry using mainly neutral kaons. We emphasize the possibly unique role of neutral meson factories in providing specific tests of models where the quantum-mechanical CPT operator is not well-defined, leading to modifications of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen particle correlators. Finally, we present tests of CPT, T, and CP using charged kaons, and in particular K_l4 decays, which are interesting due to the high statistics attainable in experiments.
