Title: A note on N=(2,2) superfields in two dimensions
Authors: Joris Maes and Alexander Sevrin
Abstract: Motivated by the results in {\tt hep-th/0508228}, we perform a careful analysis of the allowed linear constraints on $N=(2,2)$ scalar superfields. We show that only chiral, twisted-chiral and semi-chiral superfields are possible. Various subtleties are discussed.
