Title: The Quadratic Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity in Two-Dimensions
Authors: M. Adak and T. Dereli
Abstract: A 2D symmetric teleparallel gravity model is given by a generic 4-parameter action that is quadratic in the non-metricity tensor. Variational field equations are derived. A class of conformally flat solutions is given. We also discuss static and cosmological solutions.
