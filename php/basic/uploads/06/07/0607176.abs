Title: Barrier Paradox in the Klein Zone
Authors: Stefano De Leo and Pietro Rotelli
Abstract: We study the solutions for a one-dimensional electrostatic potential in the Dirac equation when the incoming wave packet exhibits the Klein paradox (pair production). With a barrier potential we demonstrate the existence of multiple reflections (and transmissions). The antiparticle solutions which are necessarily localized within the barrier region create new pairs with each reflection at the potential walls. Consequently we encounter a new paradox for the barrier because successive outgoing wave amplitudes grow geometrically.
