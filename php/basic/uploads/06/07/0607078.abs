Title: Cosmological monopoles and non-abelian black holes
Authors: Yves Brihaye and Betti Hartmann and Eugen Radu and Cristian Stelea
Abstract: We discuss magnetic monopole solutions of the Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs equations with a positive cosmological constant. These configurations approach asymptotically the de Sitter spacetime background and exist only for a nonzero Higgs potential. We find that the total mass of the solutions within the cosmological horizon is finite. However, their mass evaluated by using the surface counterterm method outside the cosmological horizon at early/late time infinity generically diverges. Magnetic monopole solutions with finite mass and noninteger charge are found however in a truncation of the theory with a vanishing Higgs field. Both solutions with a regular origin and cosmological black holes are studied, special attention being paid to the computation of the global charges.
