Title: Unified Split Octonion Formulation of Dyons
Authors: P. S. Bisht and Shalini Dangwal and O. P. S. Negi
Abstract: Demonstrating the split octonion formalism for unified fields of dyons (electromagnetic fields) and gravito-dyons (gravito-Heavisidian fields of linear gravity), relevant field equations are derived in compact, simpler and manifestly covariant forms. It has been shown that this unified model reproduces the dynamics of structure of fields associated with individual charges (masses) in the absence of others.
