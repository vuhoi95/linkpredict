Title: Diffeomorphism, kappa transformations and the theory of non-linear  realisations
Authors: Joaquim Gomis and Kiyoshi Kamimura and Peter West
Abstract: We will show how the theory of non-linear realisations can be used to naturally incorporate world line diffeomorphisms and kappa transformations for the point particle and superpoint particle respectively. Similar results also hold for a general p-brane and super p-brane, however, we must in these cases include an additional Lorentz transformation.
