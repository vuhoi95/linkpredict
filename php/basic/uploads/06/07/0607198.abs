Title: A supersymmetric matrix model: II. Exploring higher-fermion-number  sectors
Authors: G. Veneziano and J. Wosiek
Abstract: Continuing our previous analysis of a supersymmetric quantum-mechanical matrix model, we study in detail the properties of its sectors with fermion number F=2 and 3. We confirm all previous expectations, modulo the appearance, at strong coupling, of {\it two} new bosonic ground states causing a further jump in Witten's index across a previously identified critical 't Hooft coupling $\lambda_c$. We are able to elucidate the origin of these new SUSY vacua by considering the $\lambda \to \infty$ limit and a strong coupling expansion around it.
