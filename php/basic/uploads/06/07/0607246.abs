Title: Elementary Kaluza-Klein Towers revisited
Authors: Fernand Grard and Jean Nuyts
Abstract: Considering that the momentum squared in the extra dimensions is the physically relevant quantity for the generation of the Kaluza-Klein mass states, we have reanalyzed mathematically the procedure for five dimensional scalar fields within the Arkhani-Ahmed, Dimopoulos and Dvali scenario. We find new sets of physically allowed boundary conditions. Beside the usual results, they lead to new towers with non regular mass spacing, to lonely mass states and to tachyons. We remark that, since the SO(1,4) symmetry is to be broken due to the compactification of the extra dimensions, the speed of light could be different in the fifth dimension. This would lead to the possible appearance of a new universal constant besides $\hbar$ and $c$.
