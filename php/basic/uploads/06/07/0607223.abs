Title: Fixing Moduli in Exact Type IIA Flux Vacua
Authors: Bobby S. Acharya and Francesco Benini and Roberto Valandro
Abstract: Type IIA flux compactifications with O6-planes have been argued from a four dimensional effective theory point of view to admit stable, moduli free solutions. We discuss in detail the ten dimensional description of such vacua and present exact solutions in the case when the O6-charge is smoothly distributed. In the localised case, the solution is a half-flat, non-Calabi-Yau metric. Finally, using the ten dimensional description we show how all moduli are stabilised and reproduce precisely the results of de Wolfe et al.
