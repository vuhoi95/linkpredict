Title: Color-dressed recursive relations for multi-parton amplitudes
Authors: Claude Duhr and Stefan Hoeche and Fabio Maltoni
Abstract: Remarkable progress inspired by twistors has lead to very simple analytic expressions and to new recursive relations for multi-parton color-ordered amplitudes. We show how such relations can be extended to include color and present the corresponding color-dressed formulation for the Berends-Giele, BCF and a new kind of CSW recursive relations. A detailed comparison of the numerical efficiency of the different approaches to the calculation of multi-parton cross sections is performed.
