Title: Hybrid Formalism, Supersymmetry Reduction, and Ramond-Ramond Fluxes
Authors: William D. Linch III and Brenno Carlini Vallilo
Abstract: The supersymmetric hybrid formalism for Type II strings is used to study partial supersymmetry breaking in four and three dimensions. We use worldsheet techniques to derive effects of internal Ramond-Ramond fluxes such as torsions, superpotentials and warping.
