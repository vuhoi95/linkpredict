Title: Vacuum Birefringence as a Probe of Planck Scale Noncommutativity
Authors: Steven A. Abel and Joerg Jaeckel and Valentin V. Khoze and Andreas Ringwald
Abstract: Because of ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing, the low energy physics of noncommutative gauge theories in the Moyal-Weyl approach seems to depend crucially on the details of the ultraviolet completion. However, motivated by recent string theory analyses, we argue that their phenomenology with a very general class of UV completions can be accurately modelled by a cutoff close to the Planck scale. In the infrared the theory tends continuously to the commutative gauge theory. If the photon contains contributions from a trace-U(1), we would observe vacuum birefringence, i.e. a polarisation dependent propagation speed, as a residual effect of the noncommutativity. Constraints on this effect require the noncommutativity scale to be close to the Planck scale.
