Title: Quasi-Normal Modes of Brane-Localised Standard Model Fields II: Kerr  Black Holes
Authors: P. Kanti and R. A. Konoplya and A. Zhidenko
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of the fundamental quasinormal modes of all Standard Model fields propagating on a brane embedded in a higher-dimensional rotating black hole spacetime. The equations of motion for fields with spin $s=0, 1/2$ and 1 propagating in the induced-on-the-brane background are solved numerically, and the dependence of their QN spectra on the black hole angular momentum and dimensionality of spacetime is investigated. It is found that the brane-localised field perturbations are longer-lived when the higher-dimensional black hole rotates faster, while an increase in the number of transverse-to-the-brane dimensions reduces their lifetime. Finally, the quality factor $Q$, that determines the best oscillator among the different field perturbations, is investigated and found to depend on properties of both the particular field studied (spin, multipole numbers) and the gravitational background (dimensionality, black hole angular momentum number).
