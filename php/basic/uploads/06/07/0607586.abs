Title: Transverse KÃ¤hler geometry of Sasaki manifolds and toric  Sasaki-Einstein manifolds
Authors: Akito Futaki and Hajime Ono and Guofang Wang
Abstract: In this paper we study compact Sasaki manifolds in view of transverse K\"ahler geometry and extend some results in K\"ahler geometry to Sasaki manifolds. In particular we define integral invariants which obstruct the existence of transverse K\"ahler metric with harmonic Chern forms. The integral invariant $f_1$ for the first Chern class case becomes an obstruction to the existence of transverse K\"ahler metric of constant scalar curvature. We prove the existence of transverse K\"ahler-Ricci solitons (or {\it Sasaki-Ricci soliton}) on compact toric Sasaki manifolds whose basic first Chern form of the normal bundle of the Reeb foliation is positive and the first Chern class of the contact bundle is trivial. We will further show that if $S$ is a compact toric Sasaki manifold with the above assumption then by deforming the Reeb field we get a Sasaki-Einstein structure on $S$. As an application we obtain irregular toric Sasaki-Einstein metrics on the unit circle bundles of the powers of the canonical bundle of the two-point blow-up of the complex projective plane.
