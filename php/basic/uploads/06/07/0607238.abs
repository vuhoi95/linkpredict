Title: New Grand Unified Models with Intersecting D6-branes, Neutrino Masses,  and Flipped SU(5)
Authors: Mirjam Cvetic and Paul Langacker
Abstract: We construct new supersymmetric SU(5) Grand Unified Models based on Z4 x Z2 orientifolds with intersecting D6-branes. Unlike constructions based on Z2 x Z2 orientifolds, the orbifold images of the three-cycles wrapped by D6-branes correspond to new configurations and thus allow for models in which, in addition to the chiral sector in 10 and 5-bar representations of SU(5), only, there can be new sectors with (15 + 15-bar) and (10 + 10-bar) vector-pairs. We construct an example of such a globally consistent, supersymmetric model with four-families, two Standard Model Higgs pair-candidates and the gauge symmetry U(5) x U(1) x Sp(4). In a N = 2 sector, there are 5 x (15 + 15-bar) and 1 x (10 + 10-bar) vector pairs, while another N = 1 sector contains one vector-pair of 15-plets. The N = 2 vector pairs can obtain a large mass dynamically by parallel D6-brane splitting in a particu- lar two-torus. The 15-vector-pairs provide, after symmetry breaking to the Standard Model (via parallel D-brane splitting), triplet pair candidates which can in principle play a role in generating Majorana- type masses for left-handed neutrinos, though the necessary Yukawa couplings are absent in the specific construction. Similarly, the 10- vector-pairs can play the role of Higgs fields of the flipped SU(5), though again there are phenomenological difficulties for the specific construction.
