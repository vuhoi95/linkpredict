Title: The emergence of background geometry from quantum fluctuations
Authors: J. Ambjorn and R. Janik and W. Westra and S. Zohren
Abstract: We show how the quantization of two-dimensional gravity leads to an (Euclidean) quantum space-time where the average geometry is that of constant negative curvature and where the Hartle-Hawking boundary condition arises naturally.
