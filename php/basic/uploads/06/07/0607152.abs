Title: Notes on Collective Field Theory of Matrix and Spin Calogero Models
Authors: InÃªs Aniceto and Antal Jevicki
Abstract: Matrix models and related Spin-Calogero-Sutherland models are of major relevance in a variety of subjects, ranging from condensed matter physics to QCD and low dimensional string theory. They are characterized by integrability and exact solvability. Their continuum, field theoretic representations are likewise of definite interest. In this paper we describe various continuum, field theoretic representations of these models based on bosonization and collective field theory techniques. We compare various known representations and describe some nontrivial applications.
