Title: Study of the flux tube thickness in 3d LGT's by means of 2d spin models
Authors: M. Caselle and P. Grinza and N. Magnoli
Abstract: We study the flux tube thickness in the confining phase of the (2+1)d SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory near the deconfining phase transition. Following the Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture, we map the problem to the study of the <epsilon sigma sigma> correlation function in the two-dimensional spin model with Z_2 global symmetry, (i.e. the 2d Ising model) in the high-temperature phase. Using the form factor approach we obtain an explicit expression for this function and from it we infer the behaviour of the flux density of the original (2+1)d LGT. Remarkably enough the result we obtain for the flux tube thickness agrees (a part from an overall normalization) with the effective string prediction for the same quantity.
