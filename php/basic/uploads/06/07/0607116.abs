Title: Magnon-Like Dispersion Relation from M-Theory
Authors: P. Bozhilov and R. C. Rashkov
Abstract: We investigate classical rotating membranes in two different backgrounds. First, we obtain membrane solution in $AdS_4\times S^7$ background, analogous to the solution obtained by Hofman and Maldacena in the case of string theory. We find a magnon type dispersion relation similar to that of Hofman and Maldacena and to the one found by Dorey for the two spin case. In the appendix of the paper, we consider membrane solutions in $AdS_7\times S^4$, which give new relations between the conserved charges.
