Abstract: We develop the BRST approach to Lagrangian construction for the massive integer higher spin fields in an arbitrary dimensional AdS space. The theory is formulated in terms of auxiliary Fock space. Closed nonlinear symmetry algebra of higher spin bosonic theory in AdS space is found and method of deriving the BRST operator for such an algebra is proposed. General procedure of Lagrangian construction describing the dynamics of bosonic field with any spin is given on the base of the BRST operator. No off-shell constraints on the fields and the gauge parameters are used from the very beginning. As an example of general procedure, we derive the Lagrangians for massive bosonic fields with spin 0, 1 and 2 containing total set of auxiliary fields and gauge symmetries.
