Abstract: We investigate the effects of dissipation in the deconfining transition for a pure SU(2) gauge theory. Using an effective model for the order parameter, we study its Langevin evolution numerically, and compare results from local additive noise dynamics to those obtained considering an exponential non-local kernel for early times.
