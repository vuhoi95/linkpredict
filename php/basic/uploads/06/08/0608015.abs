Title: Viability of f(R) Theories with Additional Powers of Curvature
Authors: Anthony W. Brookfield and Carsten van de Bruck and Lisa M. H. Hall
Abstract: We consider a modified gravity theory, f(R)=R-a/R^n+bR^m, in the metric formulation, which has been suggested to produce late time acceleration in the Universe, whilst satisfying local fifth-force constraints. We investigate the parameter range for this theory, considering the regimes of early and late-time acceleration, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and fifth-force constraints. We conclude that it is difficult to find a unique range of parameters for consistency of this theory.
