Title: Dual giant gravitons in AdS$_m$ $\times$ Y$^n$ (Sasaki-Einstein)
Authors: Aniket Basu and Gautam Mandal
Abstract: We consider BPS motion of dual giant gravitons on Ad$S_5\times Y^5$ where $Y^5$ represents a five-dimensional Sasaki-Einstein manifold. We find that the phase space for the BPS dual giant gravitons is symplectically isomorphic to the Calabi-Yau cone over $Y^5$, with the K\"{a}hler form identified with the symplectic form. The quantization of the dual giants therefore coincides with the K\"{a}hler quantization of the cone which leads to an explicit correspondence between holomorphic wavefunctions of dual giants and gauge-invariant operators of the boundary theory. We extend the discussion to dual giants in $AdS_4 \times Y^7$ where $Y^7$ is a seven-dimensional Sasaki-Einstein manifold; for special motions the phase space of the dual giants is symplectically isomorphic to the eight-dimensional Calabi-Yau cone.
