Title: Kinematic and Weyl singularities
Authors: W. C. Lim and A. A. Coley and S. Hervik
Abstract: We study the properties of a future singularity encountered by a perfect fluid observer in tilting spatially homogeneous Bianchi cosmologies. We derive the boost formulae for the Weyl tensor to establish that, for two observers that are asymptotically null with respect to each other, their respective Weyl parameters generally both tend to zero, constant, or infinity together. We examine three classes of typical examples and one exceptional class. Given the behaviour of the Weyl parameter, we can predict that the singularity encountered is a Weyl singularity or a kinematic singularity. The analysis suggests that the kinematic variables are also useful in indicating a singularity in these models.
