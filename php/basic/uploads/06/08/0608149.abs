Title: The Gross-Neveu Model from String Theory
Authors: E. Antonyan and J. A. Harvey and D. Kutasov
Abstract: We study an intersecting D-brane model which at low energies describes (1+1)-dimensional chiral fermions localized at defects on a stack of N_c D4-branes. Fermions at different defects interact via exchange of massless (4+1)-dimensional fields. At weak coupling this interaction gives rise to the Gross-Neveu (GN) model and can be studied using field theoretic techniques. At strong coupling one can describe the system in terms of probe branes propagating in a curved background in string theory. The chiral symmetry is dynamically broken at zero temperature and is restored above a critical temperature T_c which depends on the coupling. The phase transition at T_c is first order at strong coupling and second order at weak coupling.
