Title: Baryogenesis, Dark Matter and the Pentagon
Authors: T. Banks and S. Echols and J. L. Jones
Abstract: We present a new mechanism for baryogenesis, which links the baryon asymmetry of the universe to the dark matter density. The mechanism arises naturally in the Pentagon model of TeV scale physics. In that context, it forces a re-evaluation of some of the assumptions of the model, and we detail the changes that are required in order to fit observations.
