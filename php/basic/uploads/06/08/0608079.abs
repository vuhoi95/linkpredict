Title: Scalar-Composite Model in 6 - 2ÎµDimensions
Authors: Keiichi Akama and Takashi Hattori
Abstract: We study the model of a composite-scalar made of a pair of scalar fields in 6-2 epsilon dimensions, using equivalence to the renormalizable three-elementary-scalar model under the "compositeness condition." In this model, the composite-scalar field is induced by the quantum effects through the vacuum polarization of elementary-scalar fields with 2N species. We first investigate scale dependences of the coupling constant and masses, in the renormalizable three-elementary-scalar model, and derive the results for the composite model by imposing the compositeness condition. The model exhibits the formerly found general property that the coupling constant of the composite field is independent of the scale.
