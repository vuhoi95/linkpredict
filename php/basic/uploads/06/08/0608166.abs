Title: Low energy effective gravitational equations on a Gauss-Bonnet brane
Authors: Tsutomu Kobayashi and Tetsuya Shiromizu and Nathalie Deruelle
Abstract: We present effective gravitational equations at low energies in a $Z_2$-symmetric braneworld with the Gauss-Bonnet term. Our derivation is based on the geometrical projection approach, and we solve iteratively the bulk geometry using the gradient expansion scheme. Although the original field equations are quite complicated due to the presence of the Gauss-Bonnet term, our final result clearly has the form of the Einstein equations plus correction terms, which is simple enough to handle. As an application, we consider homogeneous and isotropic cosmology on the brane. We also comment on the holographic interpretation of bulk gravity in the Gauss-Bonnet braneworld.
