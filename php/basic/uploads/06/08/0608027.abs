Title: Time Delay and Time Advance in Resonance Theory
Authors: Enrico De Micheli and Giovanni Alberto Viano
Abstract: We propose a theory of the resonance-antiresonance scattering process which differs considerably from the classical one (the Breit-Wigner theory), which is commonly used in the phenomenological analysis. Here both resonances and antiresonances are described in terms of poles of the scattering amplitude: the resonances by poles in the first quadrant while the antiresonances by poles in the fourth quadrant of the complex angular momentum plane. The latter poles are produced by non-local potentials, which derive from the Pauli exchange forces acting among the nucleons or the quarks composing the colliding particles.
