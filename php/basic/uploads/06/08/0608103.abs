Title: Emergence of the fuzzy horizon through gravitational collapse
Authors: Anand Murugan and Vatche Sahakian
Abstract: For a large enough Schwarzschild black hole, the horizon is a region of space where gravitational forces are weak; yet it is also a region leading to numerous puzzles connected to stringy physics. In this work, we analyze the process of gravitational collapse and black hole formation in the context of light-cone M theory. We find that, as a shell of matter contracts and is about to reveal a black hole horizon, it undergoes a thermodynamic phase transition. This involves the binding of D0 branes into D2's, and the new phase leads to large membranes of the size of the horizon. These in turn can sustain their large size through back-reaction and the dielectric Myers effect - realizing the fuzzball proposal of Mathur and the Matrix black hole of M(atrix) theory. The physics responsible for this phenomenon lies in strongly coupled 2+1 dimensional non-commutative dynamics. The phenomenon has a universal character and appears generic.
