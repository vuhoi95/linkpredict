Title: The magnon kinematics of the AdS/CFT correspondence
Authors: Cesar Gomez and Rafael Hernandez
Abstract: The planar dilatation operator of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills is the hamiltonian of an integrable spin chain whose length is allowed to fluctuate. We will identify the dynamics of length fluctuations of planar N=4 Yang-Mills with the existence of an abelian Hopf algebra Z symmetry with non-trivial co-multiplication and antipode. The intertwiner conditions for this Hopf algebra will restrict the allowed magnon irreps to those leading to the magnon dispersion relation. We will discuss magnon kinematics and crossing symmetry on the spectrum of Z. We also consider general features of the underlying Hopf algebra with Z as central Hopf subalgebra, and discuss the giant magnon semiclassical regime.
