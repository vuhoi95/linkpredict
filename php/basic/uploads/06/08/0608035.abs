Title: Quantum Mechanics on Noncommutative Spacetime
Authors: Xavier Calmet and Michele Selvaggi
Abstract: We consider electrodynamics on a noncommutative spacetime using the enveloping algebra approach and perform a non-relativistic expansion of the effective action. We obtain the Hamiltonian for quantum mechanics formulated on a canonical noncommutative spacetime. An interesting new feature of quantum mechanics formulated on a noncommutative spacetime is an intrinsic electric dipole moment. We note however that noncommutative intrinsic dipole moments are not observable in present experiments searching for an EDM of leptons or nuclei such as the neutron since they are spin independent. These experiments are sensitive to the energy difference between two states and the noncommutative effect thus cancels out. Bounds on the noncommutative scale found in the literature relying on such intrinsic electric dipole moment are thus incorrect.
