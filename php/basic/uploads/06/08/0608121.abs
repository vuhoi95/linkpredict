Title: Landscape Predictions for the Higgs Boson and Top Quark Masses
Authors: Brian Feldstein and Lawrence J. Hall and Taizan Watari
Abstract: If the Standard Model is valid up to scales near the Planck mass, and if the cosmological constant and Higgs mass parameters scan on a landscape of vacua, it is well known that the observed orders of magnitude of these quantities can be understood from environmental selection for large-scale structure and atoms. If in addition the Higgs quartic coupling scans, with a probability distribution peaked at low values, environmental selection for a phase having a scale of electroweak symmetry breaking much less than the Planck scale leads to a most probable Higgs mass of 106 GeV. While fluctuations below this are negligible, the upward fluctuation is 25/p GeV, where p measures the strength of the peaking of the a priori distribution of the quartic coupling. If the top Yukawa coupling also scans, the most probable top quark mass is predicted to lie in the range (174--178) GeV, providing the standard model is valid to at least 10^{17} GeV. The downward fluctuation is 35 GeV/ \sqrt{p}, suggesting that p is sufficiently large to give a very precise Higgs mass prediction. While a high reheat temperature after inflation could raise the most probable value of the Higgs mass to 118 GeV, maintaining the successful top prediction suggests that reheating is limited to about 10^8 GeV, and that the most probable value of the Higgs mass remains at 106 GeV. If all Yukawa couplings scan, then the e,u,d and t masses are understood to be outliers having extreme values induced by the pressures of strong environmental selection, while the s, \mu, c, b, \tau Yukawa couplings span only two orders of magnitude, reflecting an a priori distribution peaked around 10^{-3}. Extensions of these ideas allow order of magnitude predictions for neutrino masses, the baryon asymmetry and important parameters of cosmological inflation.
