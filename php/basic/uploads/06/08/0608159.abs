Title: Retrofitting O'Raifeartaigh Models with Dynamical Scales
Authors: Michael Dine and Jonathan L. Feng and Eva Silverstein
Abstract: We provide a method for obtaining simple models of supersymmetry breaking, with all small mass scales generated dynamically, and illustrate it with explicit examples. We start from models of perturbative supersymmetry breaking, such as O'Raifeartaigh and Fayet models, that would respect an $R$ symmetry if their small input parameters transformed as the superpotential does. By coupling the system to a pure supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (or a more general supersymmetric gauge theory with dynamically small vacuum expectation values), these parameters are replaced by powers of its dynamical scale in a way that is naturally enforced by the symmetry. We show that supersymmetry breaking in these models may be straightforwardly mediated to the supersymmetric Standard Model, obtain complete models of direct gauge mediation, and comment on related model building strategies that arise in this simple framework.
