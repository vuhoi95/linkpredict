Authors: Shalini Dangwal and P. S. Bisht and O. P. S. Negi
Abstract: Starting with the generalized field equation of dyons and gravito-dyons, we study the theory of octonion variables to the SU (2) non-Abelian gauge formalism. We demonstrate the resemblance of octonion covariant derivative with the gauge covariant derivative of generalized fields of dyons.Expressing the generalized four-potential, current and fields of gravito-dyons in terms of split octonion variables, the U (1) abelian and SU (2) non-Abelian gauge structure of dyons and gravito-dyons are described. It is emphasized that in general the generalized four-current is not conserved but only the Noetherian four-current is considered to be conserved one. The present formalism yields the theory of electric (gravitational) charge (mass) in the absence of magnetic(Heavisidean) charge (mass) on dyons (gravito-dyons) or vice versa.
