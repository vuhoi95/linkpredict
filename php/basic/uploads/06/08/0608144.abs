Title: Information geometry of U(1) instantons on self-dual manifolds
Authors: Rajesh Parwani and Harvendra Singh
Abstract: We use the information metric to investigate the moduli space of a U(1) instanton on (anti)self-dual manifolds, finding an $AdS$ geometry similar to that for the moduli space of a Yang-Mills instanton on flat space. We discuss our results from the perspective of gauge/gravity duality.
