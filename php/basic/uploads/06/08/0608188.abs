Title: Hidden Sector Baryogenesis
Authors: Bhaskar Dutta and Jason Kumar
Abstract: We introduce a novel mechanism for baryogenesis, in which mixed anomalies between the hidden sector and $U(1)_{baryon}$ drive the baryon asymmetry. We demonstrate that this mechanism occurs quite naturally in intersecting-brane constructions of the Standard Model, and show that it solves some of the theoretical difficulties faced in matching baryogenesis to experimental bounds. We illustrate with a specific example model. We also discuss the possible signals at the LHC.
