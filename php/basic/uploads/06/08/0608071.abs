Title: Stabilization of test particles in Induced Matter Kaluza-Klein theory
Authors: S. Jalalzadeh and B. Vakili and F. Ahmadi and H. R. Sepangi
Abstract: The stability conditions for the motion of classical test particles in an $% n $-dimensional Induced Matter Kaluza-Klein theory is studied. We show that stabilization requires a variance of the strong energy condition for the induced matter to hold and that it is related to the hierarchy problem. Stabilization of test particles in a FRW universe is also discussed.
