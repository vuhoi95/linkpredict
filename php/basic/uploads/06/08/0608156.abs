Abstract: We give a direct path-integral calculation of the partition function for pure 3+1 dimensional U(N) Yang-Mills theory at large N on a small three-sphere, up to two-loop order in perturbation theory. From this, we calculate the one-loop shift in the Hagedorn/deconfinement temperature for the theory at small volume, finding that it increases (in units of the inverse sphere radius) as we go to larger coupling (larger volume). Our results also allow us to read off the sum of one-loop anomalous dimensions for all operators with a given engineering dimension in planar Yang-Mills theory on R^4. As checks on our calculation, we reproduce both the Hagedorn shift and some of the anomalous dimension sums by independent methods using the results of hep-th/0412029 and hep-th/0408178. The success of our calculation provides a significant check of methods used in hep-th/0502149 to establish a first order deconfinement transition for pure Yang-Mills theory on a small three-sphere.
