Authors: Kazutoshi Araki and Takeo Inami and Hiroaki Nakajima
Abstract: We study the instanton equation of the supersymmetric CP^{N-1} sigma model on non(anti)commutative superspace in two dimensions. We show that the undeformed instanton equation is consistent with the deformed equations of motion. Then we conclude that the instanton equation is not deformed by superspace non(anti)commutativity.
