Title: Exactly solvable associated Lame potentials and supersymmetric  transformations
Authors: David J. Fernandez C. and Asish Ganguly
Abstract: A systematic procedure to derive exact solutions of the associated Lame equation for an arbitrary value of the energy is presented. Supersymmetric transformations in which the seed solutions have factorization energies inside the gaps are used to generate new exactly solvable potentials; some of them exhibit an interesting property of periodicity defects.
