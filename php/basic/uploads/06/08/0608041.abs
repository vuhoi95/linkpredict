Title: Shape Invariant Potential and Semi-Unitary Transformations (SUT) for  Supersymmetric Harmonic Oscillator in T4-Space
Authors: P. S. Bisht and O. P. S. Negi
Abstract: Constructing the Semi - Unitary Transformation (SUT) to obtain the supersymmetric partner Hamiltonians for a one dimensional harmonic oscillator, it has been shown that under this transformation the supersymmetric partner loses its ground state in T^{4}- space while its eigen functions constitute a complete orthonormal basis in a subspace of full Hilbert space. Keywords: Supersymmetry, Superluminal Transformations, Semi Unitary Transformations. PACS No: 14.80Lv
