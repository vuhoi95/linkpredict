Title: On the way from matter-dominated era to dark energy universe
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov and Hrvoje Stefancic
Abstract: We develop the general program of the unification of matter-dominated era with acceleration epoch for scalar-tensor theory or dark fluid. The general reconstruction of single scalar-tensor theory is fulfilled. The explicit form of scalar potential for which the theory admits matter-dominated era, transition to acceleration and (asymptotically deSitter) acceleration epoch consistent with WMAP data is found. The interrelation of the epochs of deceleration-acceleration transition and matter dominance-dark energy transition for dark fluids with general EOS is investigated. We give several examples of such models with explicit EOS (using redshift parametrization) where matter-dark energy domination transition may precede the deceleration-acceleration transition. As some by-product, the reconstruction scheme is applied to scalar-tensor theory to define the scalar potentials which may produce the dark matter effect. The obtained modification of Newton potential may explain the rotation curves of galaxies.
