Title: Arrow of time in generalized quantum theory and its classical limit  dynamics
Authors: V. V. Asadov and O. V. Kechkin
Abstract: In this paper we have studied a generalized quantum theory and its consistent classical limit, which possess a well-defined arrow of time in their dynamics. The original quantum theory is defined as analytically dependent on complex time and specified by non-Hermitian Hamiltonian structure.
