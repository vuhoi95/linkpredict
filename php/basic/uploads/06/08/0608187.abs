Title: Vanishing Preons in the Fifth Dimension
Authors: Jai Grover and Jan B Gutowski and Wafic Sabra
Abstract: We examine supersymmetric solutions of N=2, D=5 gauged supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of abelian vector multiplets using the spinorial geometry method. By making use of methods developed in hep-th/0606049 to analyse preons in type IIB supergravity, we show that there are no solutions preserving exactly 3/4 of the supersymmetry.
