Title: On the Hopf algebra structure of the AdS/CFT S-matrix
Authors: Jan Plefka and Fabian Spill and Alessandro Torrielli
Abstract: We formulate the Hopf algebra underlying the su(2|2) worldsheet S-matrix of the AdS_5 x S^5 string in the AdS/CFT correspondence. For this we extend the previous construction in the su(1|2) subsector due to Janik to the full algebra by specifying the action of the coproduct and the antipode on the remaining generators. The nontriviality of the coproduct is determined by length-changing effects and results in an unusual central braiding. As an application we explicitly determine the antiparticle representation by means of the established antipode.
