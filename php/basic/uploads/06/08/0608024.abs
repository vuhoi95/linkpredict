Title: Bosonization of the Schwinger Model by Noncommutative Chiral Bosons
Authors: Joseph Ben Geloun and Jan Govaerts and M. Norbert Hounkonnou
Abstract: Bosonization of the Schwinger model with noncommutative chiral bosons is considered on a spacetime of cylinder topology. Using point splitting regularization, manifest gauge invariance is maintained throughout. Physical consequences are discussed.
