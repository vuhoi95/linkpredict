Title: Solitons and giants in matrix models
Authors: Ivan Andric and Larisa Jonke and Danijel Jurman
Abstract: We present a method for solving BPS equations obtained in the collective-field approach to matrix models. The method enables us to find BPS solutions and quantum excitations around these solutions in the one-matrix model, and in general for the Calogero model. These semiclassical solutions correspond to giant gravitons described by matrix models obtained in the framework of AdS/CFT correspondence. The two-field model, associated with two types of giant gravitons, is investigated. In this duality-based matrix model we find the finite form of the $n$-soliton solution. The singular limit of this solution is examined and a realization of open-closed string duality is proposed.
