Title: No-Drag String Configurations for Steadily Moving Quark-Antiquark Pairs  in a Thermal Bath
Authors: Philip C. Argyres and Mohammad Edalati and Justin F. Vazquez-Poritz
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of stationary string configurations on a five-dimensional AdS black hole background which correspond to quark-antiquark pairs steadily moving in an N=4 super Yang-Mills thermal bath. There are many branches of solutions, depending on the quark velocity and separation as well as on whether Euclidean or Lorentzian configurations are examined.
