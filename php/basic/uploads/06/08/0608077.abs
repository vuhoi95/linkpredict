Title: Operator product expansion of higher rank Wilson loops from D-branes and  matrix models
Authors: Simone Giombi and Riccardo Ricci and Diego Trancanelli
Abstract: In this paper we study correlation functions of circular Wilson loops in higher dimensional representations with chiral primary operators of N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. This is done using the recently established relation between higher rank Wilson loops in gauge theory and D-branes with electric fluxes in supergravity. We verify our results with a matrix model computation, finding perfect agreement in both the symmetric and the antisymmetric case.
