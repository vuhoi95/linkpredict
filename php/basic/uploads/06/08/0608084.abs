Title: Spectrum-Generating Algebra for Charged Strings
Authors: Akira Kokado and Gaku Konisi and Takesi Saito
Abstract: When an open string ends with charges on a D2-brane, which involves constant background magnetic field perpendicular to the brane, we construct the spectrum-generating algebra for this charged string, which assures that our system is ghost-free under some conditions. The application to the Hall effect for charged strings is also shortly remarked.
