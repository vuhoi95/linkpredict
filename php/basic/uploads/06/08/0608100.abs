Title: The topological AC effect on noncommutative phase space
Authors: Kang Li and Jianhua Wang
Abstract: The Aharonov-Casher (AC) effect in non-commutative(NC) quantum mechanics is studied. Instead of using the star product method, we use a generalization of Bopp's shift method. After solving the Dirac equations both on noncommutative space and noncommutative phase space by the new method, we obtain the corrections to AC phase on NC space and NC phase space respectively.
