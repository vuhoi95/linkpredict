Title: CMB Anomalies from Relic Anisotropy
Authors: A. E. Gumrukcuoglu and Carlo R. Contaldi and Marco Peloso
Abstract: Most of the analysis of the Cosmic Microwave Background relies on the assumption of statistical isotropy. However, given some recent evidence pointing against isotropy, as for instance the observed alignment of different multipoles on large scales, it is worth testing this assumption against the increasing amount of available data. As a pivot model, we assume that the spectrum of the primordial perturbations depends also on their directionality (rather than just on the magnitude of their momentum, as in the standard case). We explicitly compute the correlation matrix for the temperature anisotropies in the simpler case in which there is a residual isotropy between two spatial directions. As a concrete example, we consider a different initial expansion rate along one direction, and the following isotropization which takes place during inflation. Depending on the amount of inflation, this can lead to broken statistical isotropy on the largest observable scales.
