Title: Spinning Gravitating Skyrmions
Authors: Theodora Ioannidou and Burkhard Kleihaus and Jutta Kunz
Abstract: We investigate self-gravitating rotating solutions in the Einstein-Skyrme theory. These solutions are globally regular and asymptotically flat. We present a new kind of solutions with zero baryon number, which possess neither a flat limit nor a static limit.
