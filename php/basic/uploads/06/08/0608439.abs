Title: Scalar-field-dominated cosmology with a transient accelerating phase
Authors: F. C. Carvalho and J. S. Alcaniz and J. A. S. Lima and R. Silva
Abstract: A new cosmological scenario driven by a slow rolling homogeneous scalar field whose exponential potential $V(\Phi)$ has a quadratic dependence on the field $\Phi$ in addition to the standard linear term is discussed. The derived equation of state for the field predicts a transient accelerating phase, in which the Universe was decelerated in the past, began to accelerate at redshift $z \sim 1$, is currently accelerated, but, finally, will return to a decelerating phase in the future. This overall dynamic behavior is profoundly different from the standard $\Lambda$CDM evolution, and may alliviate some conflicts in reconciling the idea of a dark energy-dominated universe with observables in String/M-theory. The theoretical predictions for the present transient scalar field plus dark matter dominated stage are confronted with cosmological observations in order to test the viability of the scenario.
