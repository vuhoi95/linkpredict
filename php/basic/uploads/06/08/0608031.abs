Title: Energy Conditions and Supernovae Observations
Authors: J. Santos and J. S. Alcaniz and M. J. Reboucas
Abstract: In general relativity, the energy conditions are invoked to restrict general energy-momentum tensors on physical grounds. We show that in the standard Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker approach to cosmological modelling where the equation of state of the cosmological fluid is unknown, the energy conditions provide model-independent bounds on the behavior of the distance modulus of cosmic sources as a function of the redshift. We use both the gold and the legacy samples of current type Ia supenovae to carry out a model-independent analysis of the energy conditions violation in the context of standard cosmology.
