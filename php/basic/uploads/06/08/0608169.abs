Title: Relationship Between Solitonic Solutions of Five-Dimensional Einstein  Equations
Authors: Shinya Tomizawa and Hideo Iguchi and Takashi Mishima
Abstract: We give the relation between the solutions generated by the inverse scattering method and the B\"acklund transformation applied to the vacuum five-dimensional Einstein equations. In particular, we show that the two-solitonic solutions generated from an arbitrary diagonal seed by the B\"acklund transformation are contained within those generated from the same seed by the inverse scattering method.
