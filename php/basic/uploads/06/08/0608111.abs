Title: Spin-Charge Separation, Conformal Covariance and the SU(2) Yang-Mills  Theory
Authors: Ludvig D. Faddeev and Antti J. Niemi
Abstract: In the low energy domain of four-dimensional SU(2) Yang-Mills theory the spin and the charge of the gauge field can become separated from each other. The ensuing field variables describe the interacting dynamics between a version of the O(3) nonlinear $\sigma$-model and a nonlinear Grassmannian $\sigma$-model, both of which may support closed knotted strings as stable solitons. Lorentz transformations act projectively in the O(3) model which breaks global internal rotation symmetry and removes massless Goldstone bosons from the particle spectrum. The entire Yang-Mills Lagrangian can be recast into a generally covariant form with a conformally flat metric tensor. The result contains the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian together with a nonvanishing cosmological constant, and insinuates the presence of a novel dimensionfull parameter in the Yang-Mills theory.
