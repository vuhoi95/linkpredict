Title: Decoherence of Anyonic Charge in Interferometry Measurements
Authors: Parsa Bonderson and Kirill Shtengel and J. K. Slingerland
Abstract: We examine interferometric measurements of the topological charge of (non-Abelian) anyons. The target's topological charge is measured from its effect on the interference of probe particles sent through the interferometer. We find that superpositions of distinct anyonic charges a and a' in the target decohere (exponentially in the number of probes particles used) when the probes have nontrivial monodromy with the charges that may be fused with a to give a'.
