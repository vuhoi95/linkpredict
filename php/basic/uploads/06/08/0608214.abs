Title: Gauge Generators, Transformations and Identities on a Noncommutative  Space
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Saurav Samanta
Abstract: By abstracting a connection between gauge symmetry and gauge identity on a noncommutative space, we analyse star (deformed) gauge transformations with usual Leibnitz rule as well as undeformed gauge transformations with a twisted Leibnitz rule. Explicit structures of the gauge generators in either case are computed. It is shown that, in the former case, the relation mapping the generator with the gauge identity is a star deformation of the commutative space result. In the latter case, on the other hand, this result gets twisted to yield the desired map.
