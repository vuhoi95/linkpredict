Title: Propagation of a string across the cosmological singularity
Authors: Przemyslaw Malkiewicz and Wlodzimierz Piechocki
Abstract: Our results concern the transition of a quantum string through the singularity of the compactified Milne (CM) space. We restrict our analysis to the string winding around the compact dimension (CD) of spacetime. The CD undergoes contraction to a point followed by re-expansion. We demonstrate that both classical and quantum dynamics of considered string are well defined. Most of presently available calculations strongly suggest that the singularity of a time dependent orbifold is useless as a model of the cosmological singularity. We believe that our results bring, to some extent, this claim into question.
