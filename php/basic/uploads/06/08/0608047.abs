Title: Domain Wall and Periodic Solutions of Coupled phi4 Models in an External  Field
Authors: Avinash Khare and Avadh Saxena
Abstract: Coupled double well (phi4) one-dimensional potentials abound in both condensed matter physics and field theory. Here we provide an exhaustive set of exact periodic solutions of a coupled $\phi^4$ model in an external field in terms of elliptic functions (domain wall arrays) and obtain single domain wall solutions in specific limits. We also calculate the energy and interaction between solitons for various solutions. Both topological and nontopological (e.g. some pulse-like solutions in the presence of a conjugate field) domain walls are obtained. We relate some of these solutions to the recently observed magnetic domain walls in certain multiferroic materials and also in the field theory context wherever possible. Discrete analogs of these coupled models, relevant for structural transitions on a lattice, are also considered.
