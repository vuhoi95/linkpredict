Authors: Eiji Nakano and Shunsuke Teraguchi and Wen-Yu Wen
Abstract: In this note, two important transport observables in the RHIC experiment, relaxation time constant and jet quenching parameter, are calculated from an AdS/QCD model. A quark moving in the viscous medium such as the Quark-Gluon-Plasma is modelled by an open string whose end point travels on the boundary of a deformed AdS_5 black hole. The correction introduced via the deformed AdS_5 is believed to help us better understand the data which is expected to be measured in the RHIC.
