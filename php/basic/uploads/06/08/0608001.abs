Title: Modular Invariants and Fischer-Griess Monster
Authors: Marcin Jankiewicz and Thomas W. Kephart
Abstract: We show interesting relations between extremal partition functions of a family of conformal field theories and dimensions of the irreducible representations of the Fischer-Griess Monster sporadic group. We argue that these relations can be interpreted as an extension of Monster moonshine.
