Title: Shear viscosity in weakly coupled ${\cal N} {=} 4$ Super Yang-Mills  theory compared to QCD
Authors: Simon C. Huot and Sangyong Jeon and Guy D. Moore
Abstract: We compute the shear viscosity of weakly coupled N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory. Our result for [eta/s], the viscosity to entropy-density ratio, is many times smaller than the corresponding weak-coupling result in QCD. This suggests that [eta/s] of QCD near the transition point is several times larger than the viscosity bound, [eta/s] >= 1/4 pi.
