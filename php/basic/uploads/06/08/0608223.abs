Title: Quantum equivalence between the self-dual and the Maxwell-Chern-Simons  models nonlinearly coupled to U(1) scalar fields
Authors: D. Dalmazi and Elias L. Mendonca
Abstract: The use of master actions to prove duality at quantum level becomes cumbersome if one of the dual fields interacts nonlinearly with other fields. This is the case of the theory considered here consisting of U(1) scalar fields coupled to a self-dual field through a linear and a quadratic term in the self-dual field. Integrating perturbatively over the scalar fields and deriving effective actions for the self-dual and the gauge field we are able to consistently neglect awkward extra terms generated via master action and establish quantum duality up to cubic terms in the coupling constant. The duality holds for the partition function and some correlation functions. The absence of ghosts imposes restrictions on the coupling with the scalar fields.
