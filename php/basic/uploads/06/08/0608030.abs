Title: Spin-field Interaction Effects and Loop Dynamics in AdS/CFT Duality
Authors: A. I. Karanikas and C. N. Ktorides
Abstract: The spin-field interaction is considered, in the context of the gauge fields/string correspondence, in the large 't Hooft coupling limit. The latter can be viewed as a WKB-type approximation to the AdS/CFT duality conjecture. Basic theoretical objects entering the present study are (a) the Wilson loop functional, on the gauge field side and (b) the sigma model action for the string propagating in AdS$_5$. Spin effects are introduced in a worldline setting, via the spin factor for a particle entity propagating on a Wilson loop contour. The computational tools employed for conducting the relevant analysis, follow the methodological guidelines introduced in two papers by Polyakov and Rychkov. The main result is expressed in terms of the modification of the spin factor brought about by dynamical effects, both perturbative and non-perturbative, according to AdS/CFT in the considered limit.
