Title: Invariant conserved currents in gravity theories with local Lorentz and  diffeomorphism symmetry
Authors: Yuri N. Obukhov and Guillermo F. Rubilar
Abstract: We discuss conservation laws for gravity theories invariant under general coordinate and local Lorentz transformations. We demonstrate the possibility to formulate these conservation laws in many covariant and noncovariant(ly looking) ways. An interesting mathematical fact underlies such a diversity: there is a certain ambiguity in a definition of the (Lorentz-) covariant generalization of the usual Lie derivative. Using this freedom, we develop a general approach to construction of invariant conserved currents generated by an arbitrary vector field on the spacetime. This is done in any dimension, for any Lagrangian of the gravitational field and of a (minimally or nonminimally) coupled matter field. A development of the "regularization via relocalization" scheme is used to obtain finite conserved quantities for asymptotically nonflat solutions. We illustrate how our formalism works by some explicit examples.
