Title: A-term inflation and the MSSM
Authors: J. C. Bueno Sanchez and K. Dimopoulos and David H. Lyth
Abstract: The parameter space for A-term inflation is explored with $W=\lambda_p \phi^p/(p M_P^{p-3})$. With p=6 and \lambda_p~1, the observed spectrum and spectral tilt can be obtained with soft mass of order 10^2 GeV but not with a much higher mass. The case p=3 requires \lambda_p~10^{-9} to 10^{-12}. The ratio m/A requires fine-tuning, which may be justified on environmental grounds. An extension of the MSSM to include non-renormalizable terms and/or Dirac neutrino masses might support either A-term inflation or modular inflation.
