Title: Quantum Radiation Reaction and the Green's Function Decomposition
Authors: Atsushi Higuchi and Giles D. R. Martin
Abstract: We analyze the change in position (the position shift) of the wave packet of a charged scalar particle due to radiation reaction in the $\hbar \to 0$ limit of quantum electrodynamics. In particular, we re-express the formula previously obtained for the position shift in terms of Green's functions for the electromagnetic field, thus clarifying the relation between the quantum and classical derivations of the radiation-reaction force.
