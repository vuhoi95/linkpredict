Title: Mergers and Typical Black Hole Microstates
Authors: Iosif Bena and Chih-Wei Wang and Nicholas P. Warner
Abstract: We use mergers of microstates to obtain the first smooth horizonless microstate solutions corresponding to a BPS three-charge black hole with a classically large horizon area. These microstates have very long throats, that become infinite in the classical limit; nevertheless, their curvature is everywhere small. Having a classically-infinite throat makes these microstates very similar to the typical microstates of this black hole. A rough CFT analysis confirms this intuition, and indicates a possible class of dual CFT microstates. We also analyze the properties and the merging of microstates corresponding to zero-entropy BPS black holes and black rings. We find that these solutions have the same size as the horizon size of their classical counterparts, and we examine the changes of internal structure of these microstates during mergers.
