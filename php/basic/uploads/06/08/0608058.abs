Title: Radion Stabilization In 5D SUGRA
Authors: Filipe Paccetti Correia and Michael G. Schmidt and Zurab Tavartkiladze
Abstract: We present a detailed study of radion stabilization within 5D conformal SUGRA compactified on an $S^{(1)}/Z_2$ orbifold. We use an effective 4D superfield description developed in our previous work. The effects of tree level bulk and boundary couplings, and in particular of one loop contributions and of a non perturbative correction on the radion stabilization are investigated. We find new examples of radion stabilization in non SUSY and (meta-stable) SUSY preserving Minkowski vacua.
