Title: Entropy function and attractors for AdS black holes
Authors: Jose F. Morales and Henning Samtleben
Abstract: We apply Sen's entropy formalism to the study of the near horizon geometry and the entropy of asymptotically AdS black holes in gauged supergravities. In particular, we consider non-supersymmetric electrically charged black holes with AdS_2 xS^{d-2} horizons in U(1)^4 and U(1)^3 gauged supergravities in d=4 and d=5 dimensions, respectively. We study several cases including static/rotating, BPS and non-BPS black holes in Einstein as well as in Gauss-Bonnet gravity. In all examples, the near horizon geometry and black hole entropy are derived by extremizing the entropy function and are given entirely in terms of the gauge coupling, the electric charges and the angular momentum of the black hole.
