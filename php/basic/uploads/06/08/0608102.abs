Title: A study of the bound states for square potential wells with  position-dependent mass
Authors: A. Ganguly and S. Kuru and J. Negro and L. M. Nieto
Abstract: A square potential well with position-dependent mass is studied for bound states. Applying appropriate matching conditions, a transcendental equation is derived for the energy eigenvalues. Numerical results are presented graphically and the variation of the energy of the bound states are calculated as a function of the well-width and mass.
