Title: Noncommutative M-branes from Covariant Open Supermembranes
Authors: Makoto Sakaguchi and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We discuss an open supermembrane in the presence of a constant three-form. The boundary conditions to ensure the kappa-invariance of the action lead to possible Dirichlet branes. It is shown that a noncommutative (NC) M5-brane is possible as a boundary and the self-duality condition that the flux on the world-volume satisfies is derived from the requirement of the kappa-symmetry. We also find that the open supermembrane can attach to each of infinitely many M2-branes on an M5-brane, namely a strong flux limit of the NC M5-brane.
