Title: Instantons and Merons in Matrix Models
Authors: A. Alexandrov and A. Mironov and A. Morozov
Abstract: Various branches of matrix model partition function can be represented as intertwined products of universal elementary constituents: Gaussian partition functions Z_G and Kontsevich tau-functions Z_K. In physical terms, this decomposition is the matrix-model version of multi-instanton and multi-meron configurations in Yang-Mills theories. Technically, decomposition formulas are related to representation theory of algebras of Krichever-Novikov type on families of spectral curves with additional Seiberg-Witten structure. Representations of these algebras are encoded in terms of "the global partition functions". They interpolate between Z_G and Z_K associated with different singularities on spectral Riemann surfaces. This construction is nothing but M-theory-like unification of various matrix models with explicit and representative realization of dualities.
