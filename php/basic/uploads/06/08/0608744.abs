Title: On Stokes Matrices of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces
Authors: Charles F. Doran and Shinobu Hosono
Abstract: We consider Laplace transforms of the Picard-Fuchs differential equations of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces and calculate their Stokes matrices. We also introduce two different types of Laplace transforms of Gel'fand-Kapranov-Zelevinski hypergeometric systems.
