Title: Supersymmetry and noncommutative geometry Part III: The noncommutative  supersymmetric Standard Model
Authors: Wim Beenakker and Walter D. van Suijlekom and Thijs van den Broek
Abstract: In a previous paper we developed a formalism to construct (potentially) supersymmetric theories in the context of noncommutative geometry. We apply this formalism to explore the existence of a noncommutative version of the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). We obtain the exact particle content of the MSSM and identify (in form) its interactions but conclude that their coefficients are such that the standard action functional used in noncommutative geometry is in fact not supersymmetric.
