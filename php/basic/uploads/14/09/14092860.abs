Title: Cosmic expansion histories in massive bigravity with symmetric matter  coupling
Authors: Jonas Enander and Adam R. Solomon and Yashar Akrami and Edvard Mortsell
Abstract: We study the cosmic expansion history of massive bigravity with a viable matter coupling which treats both metrics on equal footing. We derive the Friedmann equation for the effective metric through which matter couples to the two metrics, and study its solutions. For certain parameter choices, the background cosmology is identical to that of LCDM. More general parameters yield dynamical dark energy, which can still be in agreement with observations of the expansion history. We study specific parameter choices of interest, including minimal models, maximally-symmetric models, and a candidate partially-massless theory.
