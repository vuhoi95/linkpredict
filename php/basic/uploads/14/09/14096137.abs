Title: Polarized triple-collinear splitting functions at NLO for processes with  photons
Authors: German F. R. Sborlini and Daniel de Florian and German Rodrigo
Abstract: We compute the polarized splitting functions in the triple collinear limit at next-to-leading order accuracy (NLO) in the strong coupling $\alpha_{\rm S}$, for the splitting processes $\gamma \to q \bar{q} \gamma$, $\gamma \to q \bar{q} g$ and $g \to q \bar{q} \gamma$. The divergent structure of each splitting function was compared to the predicted behaviour according to Catani's formula. The results obtained in this paper are compatible with the unpolarized splitting functions computed in a previous article. Explicit results for NLO corrections are presented in the context of conventional dimensional regularization (CDR).
