Title: Unbound geodesics from the ergosphere and potential observability of  debris from ultrahigh energy particle collisions
Authors: J. Gariel and N. O. Santos and J. Silk
Abstract: Particle collisions in black hole ergoregions may result in extremely high center of mass energies that could probe new physics if escape to infinity were possible. Here we show that some geodesics at high inclinations to the equatorial plane may be unbound. Hence a finite flux of annihilation debris is able to escape, especially in the case of near-extremal Kerr black holes and if the Penrose process plays a role. For a class of Penrose processes, we show that the Wald inequalities are satisfied, allowing the Penrose process to have a key role in high energy ejection. Hence the possibility of observing new physics effects from a black hole accelerator at unprecedentedly high particle collision energies remains a tantalizing, if futuristic, experimental vision.
