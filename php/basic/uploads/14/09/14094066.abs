Title: Holographic phase transition and Quasinormal modes in Lovelock gravity
Authors: Kai Lin and Jeferson de Oliveira and Elcio Abdalla
Abstract: In this work we aim at discussing the effects of higher order corrections to curvature on the Lovelock AdS black holes quasinormal spectrum and, in the context of gauge/gravity correspondence, their consequences for the formation of holographic superconductors. We also explore the hydrodynamic limit of the $U(1)$ gauge field perturbations in $d$ dimensions.
