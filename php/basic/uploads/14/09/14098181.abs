Title: Modified energy-momentum conservation laws and vacuum Cherenkov  radiation
Authors: J. M. Carmona and J. L. Cortes and B. Romeo
Abstract: We present a general parametrization for the leading order terms in a momentum power expansion of a non-universal Lorentz-violating, but rotational invariant, kinematics and its implications for two-body decay thresholds. The considered framework includes not only modified dispersion relations for particles, but also modified energy-momentum conservation laws, something which goes beyond effective field theory. As a particular and relevant example, bounds on the departures from special relativistic kinematics from the non-observation of vacuum Cherenkov radiation are discussed and compared with those obtained within the effective field theory scenario.
