Abstract: The structure of finite energy non-monopole solutions with azimuthal magnetic flux of topological origin is studied in the pure bosonic sector of the Weinberg-Salam model. Applying a variational method we have found simple magnetic field configurations which minimize the energy functional and possess energies of order 1 TeV. Such configurations correspond to composite bound states of W, Z and Higgs bosons with essentially less energy in comparison to monopole like particles supposed to be found at LHC.
