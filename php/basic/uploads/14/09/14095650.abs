Title: Convergence of Derivative Expansion in Supersymmetric Functional RG  Flows
Authors: Marianne Heilmann and Tobias Hellwig and Benjamin Knorr and Marcus Ansorg and Andreas Wipf
Abstract: We confirm the convergence of the derivative expansion in two supersymmetric models via the functional renormalization group method. Using pseudo-spectral methods, high-accuracy results for the lowest energies in supersymmetric quantum mechanics and a detailed description of the supersymmetric analogue of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point of the three-dimensional Wess-Zumino model are obtained. The superscaling relation proposed earlier, relating the relevant critical exponent to the anomalous dimension, is shown to be valid to all orders in the supercovariant derivative expansion and for all $d \ge 2$.
