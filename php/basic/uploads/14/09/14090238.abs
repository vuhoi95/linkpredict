Title: Scalar-Interchange Potential and Magnetic/Thermodynamic Properties of  Graphene-like Materials
Authors: José Abdalla Helayël-Neto and Elena Konstantinova and Ricardo Spagnuolo Martins
Abstract: By means of numerical simulations, we explore possible effects of a special interparticle interaction potential which is a function of external and internal conditions of graphene-like systems. In addition to the electromagnetic interaction, we introduce a new potential due to the exchange of a massive scalar, associated to the so-called Kekul\'e deformations; this interaction displays a spin-dependent profile. It turns out that the magnitude of Kekul\'e deformation may significantly affect physical properties of graphene. A Monte Carlo analysis enables one to analyze the behavior of the system under variation of the applied external field, temperature, and the particular type of the exchanged excitation that induces the potential. We pursue an investigation of the spin configurations, we analyze differences in thermal equilibrium magnetization and we carry out calculations of the magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat in the presence of the Kekul\'e-induced new potential.
