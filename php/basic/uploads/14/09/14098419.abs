Abstract: Non-linear sigma models with scalar fields taking values on $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^n$ complex manifolds are addressed. In the simplest $n=1$ case, where the target manifold is the $\mathbb{S}^2$ sphere, we describe the scalar fields by means of stereographic maps. In this case when the $\mathbb{U}(1)$ symmetry is gauged and Maxwell and mass terms are allowed, the model accommodates stable self-dual vortices of two kinds with different energies per unit length and where the Higgs field winds at the cores around the two opposite poles of the sphere. Allowing for dielectric functions in the magnetic field, similar and richer self-dual vortices of different species in the south and north charts can be found by slightly modifying the potential. Two different situations are envisaged: either the vacuum orbit lies on a parallel in the sphere, or one pole and the same parallel form the vacuum orbit. Besides the self-dual vortices of two species, there exist BPS domain walls in the second case. Replacing the Maxwell contribution of the gauge field to the action by the second Chern-Simons secondary class, only possible in $(2+1)$-dimensional Minkowski space-time, new BPS topological defects of two species appear. Namely, both BPS vortices and domain ribbons in the south and the north charts exist because the vacuum orbit consits of the two poles and one parallel. Formulation of the gauged $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^2$ model in a Reference chart shows a self-dual structure such that BPS semi-local vortices exist. The transition functions to the second or third charts break the $\mathbb{U}(1)\times\mathbb{S}\mathbb{U}(2)$ semi-local symmetry, but there is still room for standard self-dual vortices of the second species. The same structures encompassing $N$ complex scalar fields are easily generalized to gauged $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^N$ models.
