Title: Greybody Factors for Scalar Fields emitted by a Higher-Dimensional  Schwarzschild-de-Sitter Black-Hole
Authors: Panagiota Kanti and Thomas Pappas and Nikolaos Pappas
Abstract: In this work, we consider the propagation of scalar particles in a higher-dimensional Schwarzschild-de-Sitter black-hole spacetime, both on the brane and in the bulk. Our analysis applies for arbitrary partial modes and for both minimal and non-minimal coupling of the scalar field. A general expression for the greybody factor is analytically derived in each case, and its low-energy behaviour is studied in detail. Its profile in terms of scalar properties (angular-momentum number and non-minimal coupling parameter) and spacetime properties (number of extra dimensions and cosmological constant) is thoroughly investigated. In contrast to previous studies, the effect of the cosmological constant is taken into account both close to and far away from the black-hole horizon. The dual role of the cosmological constant, that may act either as a helping agent to the emission of scalar particles or as a deterring effect depending on the value of the non-minimal coupling parameter, is also demonstrated.
