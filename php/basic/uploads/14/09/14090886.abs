Title: The nonlinear dynamical stability of infrared modifications of gravity
Authors: Richard Brito and Alexandra Terrana and Matthew Johnson and Vitor Cardoso
Abstract: Scalar forces "screened" by the Vainshtein mechanism may hold the key to understanding the cosmological expansion of our universe, while predicting new and exciting features in the interaction between massive bodies. Here we explore the dynamics of the Vainshtein screening mechanism, focusing on the decoupling limit of the DGP braneworld scenario and dRGT massive gravity. We show that there is a vast set of initial conditions whose evolution is well defined and which are driven to the static, screening solutions of these theories. Screening solutions are stable and behave coherently under small fluctuations: they oscillate and eventually settle to an equilibrium configuration, the timescale for the oscillations and damping being dictated by the Vainshtein radius of the screening solutions. At very late times, a power-law decay ensues, in agreement with known analytical results. However, we also conjecture that physically interesting processes such as gravitational collapse of compact stars may not possess a well-posed initial value problem. Finally, we construct solutions with nontrivial multipolar structure describing the screening field of deformed, asymmetric bodies and show that higher multipoles are screened more efficiently than the monopole component.
