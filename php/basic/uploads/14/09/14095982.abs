Title: Supersymmetry and noncommutative geometry Part I: Supersymmetric  almost-commutative geometries
Authors: Wim Beenakker and Walter D. van Suijlekom and Thijs van den Broek
Abstract: Noncommutative geometry has seen remarkable applications for high energy physics, viz. the geometrical interpretation of the Standard Model. The question whether it also allows for supersymmetric theories has so far not been answered in a conclusive way. In this first of three papers we do a systematic analysis of the possibilities for almost-commutative geometries on a 4-dimensional, flat background to exhibit not only a particle content that is eligible for supersymmetry but also have a supersymmetric action. We come up with an approach in which we identify the basic 'building blocks' of potentially supersymmetric theories and the demands for their action to be supersymmetric. Examples that satisfy these demands turn out to be sparse.
