Title: Alpha- and Omega-Deformations from fluxes in M-Theory
Authors: Neil Lambert and Domenico Orlando and Susanne Reffert
Abstract: We discuss an SL(2,R) family of deformed N=2 four-dimensional gauge theories which we derive from a flux background in M-theory. In addition to the Omega-deformation this family includes a new deformation, which we call the Alpha-deformation, which can be viewed as an S-dual to the Omega-deformation. We study these gauge theories in two ways: by constructing a non-Abelian (but UV-complete) Lagrangian, and by their strong coupling lift to M-theory where their low-energy dynamics can be determined by examining the equation of motion of a single M5-brane wrapped on a Riemann surface.
