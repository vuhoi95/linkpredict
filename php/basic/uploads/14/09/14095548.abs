Title: Thermodynamic phase transition based on the non-singular temperature
Authors: Myungseok Eune and Yongwan Gim and Wontae Kim
Abstract: The Hawking temperature for the Schwarzschild black hole is divergent when the mass of the black hole vanishes; however the corresponding geometry becomes the Minkowski spacetime whose intrinsic temperature is zero. In connection with this issue, we construct a non-singular temperature which follows the Hawking temperature for the large black hole while it vanishes when the black hole completely evaporated. In order for thermodynamic significances of this modified temperature, we calculate thermodynamic quantities and study phase transitions. It turns out that even the small black hole can be stable below a certain temperature, and the hot flat space is always metastable so that it decays into the stable small black hole or the stable large black hole.
