Title: One-loop Structure of Higher Rank Wilson Loops in AdS/CFT
Authors: Alberto Faraggi and James T. Liu and Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas and Guojun Zhang
Abstract: The half-supersymmetric Wilson loop in $\mathcal N=4$ SYM is arguably the central non-local operator in the AdS/CFT correspondence. On the field theory side, the vacuum expectation values of Wilson loops in arbitrary representations of $SU(N)$ are captured to all orders in perturbation theory by a Gaussian matrix model. Of prominent interest are the $k$-symmetric and $k$-antisymmetric representations, whose gravitational description is given in terms of D3- and D5-branes, respectively, with fluxes in their world volumes. At leading order in $N$ and $\lambda$ the agreement in both cases is exact. In this note we explore the structure of the next-to-leading order correction in the matrix model and compare with existing string theory calculations. We find agreement in the functional dependence on $k$ but a mismatch in the numerical coefficients.
