Title: Screening of quark-monopole in N=4 plasma
Authors: Wei-shui Xu and Ding-fang Zeng
Abstract: We study a quark-monopole bound system moving in N=4 SYM plasma with a constant velocity by the AdS/CFT correspondence. The screening length of this system is calculated, and is smaller than that of the quark-antiquark bound state.
