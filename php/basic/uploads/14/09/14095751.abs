Title: An analysis of the intermediate field theory of $T^4$ tensor model
Authors: Viet Anh Nguyen and Stephane Dartois and Bertrand Eynard
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the multi-matrix model arising from the intermediate field representation of the tensor model with all quartic melonic interactions. We derive the saddle point equation and the Schwinger-Dyson constraints. We then use them to describe the leading and next-to-leading eigenvalues distribution of the matrices.
