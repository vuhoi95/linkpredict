Title: Kahler Potential and Ambiguities in 4d N=2 SCFTs
Authors: Jaume Gomis and Nafiz Ishtiaque
Abstract: The partition function of four-dimensional N=2 superconformal field theories on S^4 computes the exact Kahler potential on the space of exactly marginal couplings [1]. We present a new elementary proof of this result using supersymmetry Ward identities. The partition function is a section rather than a function, and is subject to ambiguities coming from Kahler transformations acting on the Kahler potential. This ambiguity is realized by a local supergravity counterterm in the underlying SCFT. We provide an explicit construction of the Kahler ambiguity counterterm in the four dimensional N=2 off-shell supergravity theory that admits S^4 as a supersymmetric background.
