Title: Temperature in warm inflation in non minimal kinetic coupling model
Authors: H. Mohseni Sadjadi and Parviz Goodarzi
Abstract: Warm inflation in the non minimal derivative coupling model with a general dissipation coefficient is considered. We investigate conditions for the existence of the slow roll approximation and study cosmological perturbations. The spectral index, and the power spectrum are calculated and the temperature of the universe at the end of the slow roll warm inflation is obtained.
