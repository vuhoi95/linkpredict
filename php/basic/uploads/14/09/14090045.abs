Title: Electrostatic Self-energy of a Charged Particle in the Surroundings of a  Topologically Charged Black Hole in the Brane
Authors: Alexis Larranaga and Alejandro Cardenas-Avendano and Daniel Alexdy Torres
Abstract: We determine the self-energy for a point charge held stationary in a topologically charged black hole spacetime arising from the Randall-Sundrum II braneworld model, showing that it has two contributions, one of geometric origin and the other of topological one.
