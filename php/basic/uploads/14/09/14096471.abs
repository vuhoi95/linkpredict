Title: An Inverse Scattering Construction of the JMaRT Fuzzball
Authors: Despoina Katsimpouri and Axel Kleinschmidt and Amitabh Virmani
Abstract: We present an inverse scattering construction in STU supergravity of the two-charge single-rotation JMaRT fuzzball. The key element in our construction is the fact that with appropriate changes in the parameters, the JMaRT fuzzball can be smoothly connected to the Myers-Perry instanton.
