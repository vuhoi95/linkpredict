Title: Very General Holographic Superconductors and Entanglement Thermodynamics
Authors: Anshuman Dey and Subhash Mahapatra and Tapobrata Sarkar
Abstract: We construct and analyze holographic superconductors with generalized higher derivative couplings, in single R-charged black hole backgrounds in four and five dimensions. These systems, which we call very general holographic superconductors, have multiple tuning parameters and are shown to exhibit a rich phase structure. We establish the phase diagram numerically as well as by computing the free energy, and then validated the results by calculating the entanglement entropy for these systems. The entanglement entropy is shown to be a perfect indicator of the phase diagram. The differences in the nature of the entanglement entropy in R-charged backgrounds compared to the AdS-Schwarzschild cases are pointed out. We also compute the analogue of the entangling temperature for a subclass of these systems and compare the results with non-hairy backgrounds.
