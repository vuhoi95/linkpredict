Title: Two Dimensional Horava-Lifshitz Black Hole Solutions
Authors: D. Bazeia and F. A. Brito and F. G. Costa
Abstract: In this paper we address the issue of black hole solutions in (1+1)-dimensional non-projectable Horava-Lifshitz gravity. We consider several models by considering different potentials in the scalar matter sector. We also consider the gravitational collapse of a distribution of pressureless dust filling a region in one-dimensional space. The time of the collapse can be faster or slower depending on the parameter $\lambda$ of the theory.
