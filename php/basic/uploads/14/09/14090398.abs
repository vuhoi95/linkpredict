Title: Parametric Representation of Rank d Tensorial Group Field Theory:  Abelian Models with Kinetic Term $\sum_{s}|p_s| + Î¼$
Authors: Joseph Ben Geloun and Reiko Toriumi
Abstract: We consider the parametric representation of the amplitudes of Abelian models in the so-called framework of rank $d$ Tensorial Group Field Theory. These models are called Abelian because their fields live on $U(1)^D$. We concentrate on the case when these models are endowed with particular kinetic terms involving a linear power in momenta. New dimensional regularization and renormalization schemes are introduced for particular models in this class: a rank 3 tensor model, an infinite tower of matrix models $\phi^{2n}$ over $U(1)$, and a matrix model over $U(1)^2$. For all divergent amplitudes, we identify a domain of meromorphicity in a strip determined by the real part of the group dimension $D$. From this point, the ordinary subtraction program is applied and leads to convergent and analytic renormalized integrals. Furthermore, we identify and study in depth the Symanzik polynomials provided by the parametric amplitudes of generic rank $d$ Abelian models. We find that these polynomials do not satisfy the ordinary Tutte's rules (contraction/deletion). By scrutinizing the "face"-structure of these polynomials, we find a generalized polynomial which turns out to be stable only under contraction.
