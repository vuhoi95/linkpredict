Title: Two-loop Master Integrals with the Simplified Differential Equations  approach
Authors: Costas G. Papadopoulos and Damiano Tommasini and Christopher Wever
Abstract: We calculate the complete set of two-loop Master Integrals with two off mass-shell legs with massless internal propagators, that contribute to amplitudes of diboson $V_1V_2$ production at the LHC. This is done with the Simplified Differential Equations approach to Master Integrals, which was recently proposed by one of the authors.
