Title: Parity violation in pre-inflationary bounce
Authors: Yu-Tong Wang and Yun-Song Piao
Abstract: The power suppression at largest scale in the CMB TT powerspectrum might imply the occurrence of a pre-inflationary bounce. We calculate the circularly polarized gravitational wave, leaded by the gravitational Chern-Simons term which universally appears in particle physics and string theory, in an inflationary background with the pre-inflationary bounce. The circularly polarized gravitational wave will induce TB and EB correlations at CMB last scatting surface. We find that although the BB powerspectrum at largest scale is also suppressed, the TB and EB powerspectra at corresponding scales may be enhanced.
