Title: Conformal Invariance in noncommutative geometry and mutually interacting  Snyder Particles
Authors: Souvik Pramanik and Subir Ghosh and Probir Pal
Abstract: A system of relativistic Snyder particles with mutual two-body interaction that lives in a Non-Commutative Snyder geometry is studied. The underlying novel symplectic structure is a coupled and extended version of (single particle) Snyder algebra. In a recent work by Casalbuoni and Gomis, Phys.Rev. D90, 026001 (2014), a system of interacting conventional particles (in commutative spacetime) was studied with special emphasis on it's Conformal Invariance. Proceeding along the same lines we have shown that our interacting Snyder particle model is also conformally invariant. Moreover, the conformal Killing vectors have been constructed. Our main emphasis is on the Hamiltonian analysis of the conformal symmetry generators. We demonstrate that the Lorentz algebra remains undeformed but validity of the full conformal algebra requires further restrictions.
