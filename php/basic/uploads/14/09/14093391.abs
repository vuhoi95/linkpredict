Title: Strong lensing interferometry for compact binaries
Authors: Ue-Li Pen and I-Sheng Yang
Abstract: We propose a possibility to improve the current precision measurements on compact binaries. When the orbital axis is almost perpendicular to our line of sight, a pulsar behind its companion can form two strong-lensing images. These images cannot be resolved, but we can use multi-wavelength interferometry to accurately determine the passage through superior conjunction. This method does not depend strongly on the stability of the pulse profile, and applies equally well to both slow and fast pulsars. We discuss the possible improvement this can bring to the bound on stochastic gravitational wave background and to determine black hole spin. We also discuss the possibility of discovering a suitable binary system by the Square Kilometer Array that our method can apply to.
