Title: Quantum Gravity Effect in Torsion Driven Inflation and CP violation
Authors: Sayantan Choudhury and Barun Kumar Pal and Banasri Basu and Pratul Bandyopadhyay
Abstract: We have derived an effective potential for inflationary scenario from torsion and quantum gravity correction in terms of the scalar field hidden in torsion. A strict bound on the CP violating $\theta$ parameter, ${\cal O}(10^{-10})<\theta<{\cal O}(10^{-9})$ has been obtained, using {\tt Planck+WMAP9} best fit cosmological parameters.
