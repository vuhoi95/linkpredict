Title: Graviweak Unification in the Visible and Invisible Universe and  Inflation from the Higgs Field False Vacuum
Authors: C. R. Das and L. V. Laperashvili
Abstract: In the present paper we develop the self-consistent $Spin(4,4)$-invariant model of the unification of gravity with weak $SU(2)$ interactions in the assumption of the existence of visible and invisible sectors of the Universe. It was shown that the consequences of the multiple point principle predicting two degenerate vacua in the Standard Model (SM) suggest a theory of Inflation, in which the inflaton field $\sigma$ starts trapped in a cold coherent state in the "false vacuum" of the Universe at the value of the Higgs field's VEV $v\sim 10^{18}$ GeV (in the visible world). Then the inflations of the two Higgs doublet fields, visible $\phi$ and mirror $\phi'$, lead to the emergence of the SM vacua at the Electroweak scales with the Higgs boson VEVs $v_1\approx 246$ GeV and $v'_1=\zeta v_1$ (with $\zeta \sim 100$) in the visible and invisible worlds, respectively.
