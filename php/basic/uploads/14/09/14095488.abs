Title: Connecting the Hadron Mass Scale to the Fundamental Mass Scale of  Quantum Chromodynamics
Authors: Alexandre Deur and Stanley J. Brodsky and Guy F. de Teramond
Abstract: Establishing an explicit connection between the long distance physics of confinement and the dynamical interactions of quarks and gluons at short distances has been a long-sought goal of quantum chromodynamics. Using holographic QCD, we derive a direct analytic relation between the scale $\kappa$ which determines the masses of hadrons and the scale $\Lambda_{s}$ which controls the predictions of perturbative QCD at very short distances. The resulting prediction $\Lambda_{s}=0.341\pm0.032$ GeV in the $\overline{MS}$ scheme agrees well with the experimental average $0.339\pm0.016$ GeV. We also derive a relation between $\Lambda_{s}$ and the QCD string tension $\sigma$. This connection between the fundamental hadronic scale underlying the physics of quark confinement and the perturbative QCD scale controlling hard collisions can be carried out in any renormalization scheme.
