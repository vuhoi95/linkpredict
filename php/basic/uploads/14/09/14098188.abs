Title: Lie algebra type noncommutative phase spaces are Hopf algebroids
Authors: Stjepan Meljanac and Zoran Škoda and Martina Stojić
Abstract: For a noncommutative configuration space whose coordinate algebra is the universal enveloping algebra of a finite dimensional Lie algebra, it is known how to introduce an extension playing the role of the corresponding noncommutative phase space, namely by adding the commuting deformed derivatives in a consistent and nontrivial way, therefore obtaining certain deformed Heisenberg algebra. This algebra has been studied in physical contexts, mainly in the case of the kappa-Minkowski space-time. Here we equip the entire phase space algebra with a coproduct, so that it becomes an instance of a completed variant of a Hopf algebroid over a noncommutative base, where the base is the enveloping algebra.
