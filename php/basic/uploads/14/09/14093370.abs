Title: Open problems in gravitational physics
Authors: S. Capozziello and G. Lambiase
Abstract: We discuss some fundamental issues underlying gravitational physics and point out some of the main shortcomings of Einstein's General Relativity. In particular, after taking into account the role of the two main objects of relativistic theories of gravity, i.e. the metric and the connection fields, we consider the possibility that they are not trivially related so that the geodesic structure and the causal structure of the spacetime could be disentangled, as supposed in the Palatini formulation of gravity. In this perspective, the Equivalence Principle, in its weak and strong formulations, can play a fundamental role in discriminating among competing theories. The possibility of its violation at quantum level could open new perspectives in gravitational physics and in unification with other interactions. We shortly debate the possibility of equivalence principle measurements by ground-based and space experiments.
