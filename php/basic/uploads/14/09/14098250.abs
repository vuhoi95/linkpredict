Title: Hodge Theory and Symplectic Boundary Conditions
Authors: Li-Sheng Tseng and Lihan Wang
Abstract: We study symplectic Laplacians on compact symplectic manifolds with boundary. These Laplacians are associated with symplectic cohomologies of differential forms and can be of fourth-order. We introduce several natural boundary conditions on differential forms and use them to establish Hodge theory by proving various form decomposition and also isomorphisms between the symplectic cohomologies and the spaces of harmonic fields. These novel boundary conditions can be applied in certain cases to study relative symplectic cohomologies and Lefschetz maps between relative de Rham cohomologies. As an application, our results are used to solve boundary value problems of differential forms.
