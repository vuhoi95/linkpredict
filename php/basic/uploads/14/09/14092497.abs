Title: Bosonic Coherent Motions in the Universe
Authors: Jihn E. Kim and Yannis Semertzidis and Shinji Tsujikawa
Abstract: We mini-review the role of fundamental spin-0 bosons as bosonic coherent motion (BCM) in the Universe. The fundamental spin-0 bosons have the potential to account for the baryon number generation, cold dark matter (CDM) via BCM, dark energy, and inflation. Among these, here we focus on the CDM possibility because it can be experimentally tested with the current experimental techniques. We also comment briefly on the panoply of the other roles of spin-0 bosons.
