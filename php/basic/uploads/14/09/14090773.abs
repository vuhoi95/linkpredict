Title: Polyakov loop spectroscopy in the confined phase of gluodynamics and QCD
Authors: E. Megias and E. Ruiz Arriola and L. L. Salcedo
Abstract: By using a simple relativistic model, we compute the glueball and gluelump spectra and relate these quantities, respectively, to the trace anomaly and Polyakov loop in the adjoint representation of gluodynamics. This spectroscopic description of thermodynamics is extended with the inclusion of quarks. The relation between the hadron resonance gas and the Polyakov loop in the fundamental and higher representations is addressed.
