Title: Einstein-Yang-Mills Scattering Amplitudes From Scattering Equations
Authors: Freddy Cachazo and Song He and Ellis Ye Yuan
Abstract: We present the building blocks that can be combined to produce tree-level S-matrix elements of a variety of theories with various spins mixed in arbitrary dimensions. The new formulas for the scattering of $n$ massless particles are given by integrals over the positions of $n$ points on a sphere restricted to satisfy the scattering equations. As applications, we obtain all single-trace amplitudes in Einstein--Yang--Mills (EYM) theory, and generalizations to include scalars. Also in EYM but extended by a B-field and a dilaton, we present all double-trace gluon amplitudes. The building blocks are made of Pfaffians and Parke--Taylor-like factors of subsets of particle labels.
