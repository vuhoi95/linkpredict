Title: Theories of Class S and New N=1 SCFTs
Authors: James McGrane and Brian Wecht
Abstract: We describe an infinite two-parameter subfamily of theories of class S where dialing one of the parameters interpolates between Gaiotto's T_N theory and a theory of N^2 free hypermultiplets. After using the reduced superconformal index to study the operator content, we use these theories to construct new N=1 SCFTs and then examine the flows between them.
