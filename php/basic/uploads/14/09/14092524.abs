Title: Involutive constrained systems and Hamilton-Jacobi formalism
Authors: M. C. Bertin and B. M. Pimentel and C. E. Valc√°rcel
Abstract: In this paper, we study singular systems with complete sets of involutive constraints. The aim is to establish, within the Hamilton-Jacobi theory, the relationship between the Frobenius' theorem, the infinitesimal canonical transformations generated by constraints in involution with the Poisson brackets, and the lagrangian point (gauge) transformations of physical systems.
