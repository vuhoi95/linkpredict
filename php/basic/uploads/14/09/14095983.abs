Title: Supersymmetry and noncommutative geometry Part II: Supersymmetry  breaking
Authors: Wim Beenakker and Walter D. van Suijlekom and Thijs van den Broek
Abstract: We describe how a soft supersymmetry breaking Lagrangian arises naturally in the context of almost-commutative geometries that fall within the classification of those having a supersymmetric particle content as well as a supersymmetric spectral action. All contributions to such a Lagrangian are seen to either be generated automatically after introducing gaugino masses to the theory or coming from the second Seeley-DeWitt coefficient that is already part of the spectral action. In noncommutative geometry, a supersymmetric particle content and the appearance of a soft breaking Lagrangian thus appear to be intimately connected to each other.
