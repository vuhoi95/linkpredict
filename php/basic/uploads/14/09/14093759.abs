Title: Non-commutative Einstein-Proca Space-time
Authors: Blanca Gónzales and Román Linares and Marco Maceda and Oscar Sánchez-Santos
Abstract: In this work we present a deformed model of Einstein-Proca space-time based on the replacement of point-like sources by non-commutative smeared distributions. We discuss the solutions to the set of non-commutative Einstein-Proca equations thus obtained, with emphasis on the issue of singularities and horizons.
