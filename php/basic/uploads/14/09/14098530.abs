Title: Hydrogen atom in space with a compactified extra dimension and potential  defined by Gauss' law
Authors: Martin Bure≈° and Petr Siegl
Abstract: We investigate the consequences of one extra spatial dimension for the stability and energy spectrum of the non-relativistic hydrogen atom with a potential defined by Gauss' law, i.e. proportional to $1/|x|^2$. The additional spatial dimension is considered to be either infinite or curled-up in a circle of radius $R$. In both cases, the energy spectrum is bounded from below for charges smaller than the same critical value and unbounded from below otherwise. As a consequence of compactification, negative energy eigenstates appear: if $R$ is smaller than a quarter of the Bohr radius, the corresponding Hamiltonian possesses an infinite number of bound states with minimal energy extending at least to the ground state of the hydrogen atom.
