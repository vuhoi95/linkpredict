Title: Double Soft Limits of Cosmological Correlations
Authors: Mehrdad Mirbabayi and Matias Zaldarriaga
Abstract: Correlation functions of two long-wavelength modes with several short-wavelength modes are shown to be related to lower order correlation functions, using the background wave method, and independently, by exploiting symmetries of the wavefunction of the Universe. These soft identities follow from the non-linear extension of the adiabatic modes of Weinberg, and their generalization by Hinterbichler et. al. The extension is shown to be unique. A few checks of the identities are presented.
