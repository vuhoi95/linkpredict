Title: Bonus scaling and BCFW in N=7 supergravity
Authors: Jin-Yu Liu and En Shih
Abstract: In search of natural building blocks for supergravity amplitudes, a tentative criteria is term-by-term bonus z^-2 large momentum scaling. For a given choice of deformation legs, we present such an expansion in the form of a BCFW representation in N=7 supergravity based on a special shift. We will show that this improved scaling behavior, with respect to the fully N=8 representation, is due to its automatic incorporation of the so called bonus relations.
