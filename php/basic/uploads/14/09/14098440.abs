Title: Superconformal Quantum Mechanics and the Discrete Light-Cone  Quantisation of N=4 SUSY Yang-Mills
Authors: Nick Dorey and Andrew Singleton
Abstract: We study the quantum mechanical sigma model arising in the discrete light-cone quantisation of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The target space is a certain torus fibration over a scale-invariant special Kahler manifold. We show that the expected SU(1,1|4) light-cone superconformal invariance of the N=4 theory emerges in a limit where the volume of the fibre goes to zero and give an explicit construction of the generators. The construction given here yields a large new family of superconformal quantum mechanical models with SU(1,1|4) invariance.
