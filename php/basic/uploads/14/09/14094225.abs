Title: Anomalous Hall Effect for semiclassical chiral fermions
Authors: P. -M. Zhang and P. A. Horv√°thy
Abstract: Semiclassical chiral fermions manifest the anomalous spin-Hall effect: when put into a pure electric field they suffer a side jump, analogous to what happens to their massive counterparts in non-commutative mechanics. The transverse shift is consistent with the conservation of the angular momentum. In a pure magnetic field instead, spiraling motion is found. Motion in Hall-type perpendicular electric and magnetic fields is also studied.
