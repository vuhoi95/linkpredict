Title: Generalized BRST symmetry for arbitrary spin conformal field theory
Authors: Sudhaker Upadhyay and Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: We develop the finite field-dependent BRST (FFBRST) transformation for arbitrary spin-s conformal field theories. We discuss the novel features of the FFBRST transformation in these systems. To illustrate the results we consider the spin-1 and spin-2 conformal field theories in two examples. Within the formalism we found that FFBRST transformation connects the generating functionals of spin-1 and spin-2 conformal field theories in linear and non-linear gauges. Further, the conformal field theories in the framework of FFBRST transformation are also analysed in Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formulation to establish the results.
