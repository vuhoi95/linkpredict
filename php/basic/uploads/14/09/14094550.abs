Title: Bilinear Covariants and Spinor Fields Duality in Quantum Clifford  Algebras
Authors: Rafal Ablamowicz and Icaro Gon√ßalves and Roldao da Rocha
Abstract: Classification of quantum spinor fields according to quantum bilinear covariants is introduced in a context of quantum Clifford algebras on Minkowski spacetime. Once the bilinear covariants are expressed in terms of algebraic spinor fields, the duality between spinor and quantum spinor fields is thus discussed. Hence, by endowing the underlying spacetime with an arbitrary bilinear form with a antisymmetric part in addition to a symmetric spacetime metric, quantum algebraic spinor fields and deformed bilinear covariants can be constructed. They are therefore compared to the classical (non quantum) ones. Classes of quantum spinor fields are introduced and compared with Lounesto's spinor field classification. A physical interpretation of the deformed parts and the underlying Z-grading is proposed. The existence of an arbitrary bilinear form endowing the spacetime already has been explored in the literature in the context of quantum gravity. Here, it is shown further to play a prominent role in the structure of Dirac, Weyl, and Majorana spinor fields, besides the most general flagpoles, dipoles and flag-dipoles ones as well. We introduce a new duality between the standard and the quantum spinor fields, by showing that when Clifford algebras over vector spaces endowed with an arbitrary bilinear form are taken into account, a mixture among the classes does occur. Consequently, novel features regarding the spinor fields can be derived.
