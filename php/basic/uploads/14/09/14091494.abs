Authors: Andrea Coser and Marco Beria and Giuseppe Brandino and Robert Konik and Giuseppe Mussardo
Abstract: We study the spectrum of Landau-Ginzburg theories in 1+1 dimensions using the truncated conformal space approach employing a compactified boson. We study these theories both in their broken and unbroken phases. We first demonstrate that we can reproduce the expected spectrum of a $\Phi^2$ theory (i.e. a free massive boson) in this framework. We then turn to $\Phi^4$ in its unbroken phase and compare our numerical results with the predictions of two-loop perturbation theory, finding excellent agreement. We then analyze the broken phase of $\Phi^4$ where kink excitations together with their bound states are present. We confirm the semiclassical predictions for this model on the number of stable kink-antikink bound states. We also test the semiclassics in the double well phase of $\Phi^6$ Landau-Ginzburg theory, again finding agreement.
