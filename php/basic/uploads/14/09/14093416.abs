Title: Dimer representations of the Temperley-Lieb algebra
Authors: Alexi Morin-Duchesne and Jorgen Rasmussen and Philippe Ruelle
Abstract: A new spin-chain representation of the Temperley-Lieb algebra $TL_n(\beta=0)$ is introduced and related to the dimer model. Unlike the usual XXZ spin-chain representations of dimension $2^n$, this dimer representation is of dimension $2^{n-1}$. A detailed analysis of its structure is presented and found to yield indecomposable zigzag modules.
