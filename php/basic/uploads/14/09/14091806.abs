Abstract: Production of electron-positron pairs from the quantum vacuum polarized by the superposition of a strong and a perturbative oscillating electric-field mode is studied. Our outcomes rely on a nonequilibrium quantum field theoretical approach, described by the quantum kinetic Boltzmann-Vlasov equation. By superimposing the perturbative mode, the characteristic resonant effects and Rabi-like frequencies in the single-particle distribution function are modified, as compared to the predictions resulting from the case driven by a strong oscillating field mode only. This is demonstrated in the momentum spectra of the produced pairs. Moreover, the dependence of the total number of pairs on the intensity parameter of each mode is discussed and a strong enhancement found for large values of the relative Keldysh parameter.
