Title: R-symmetric Axion/Natural Inflation in Supergravity via Deformed Moduli  Dynamics
Authors: Keisuke Harigaya and Masahiro Ibe and Tsutomu T. Yanagida
Abstract: We construct a natural inflation model in supergravity where the inflaton is identified with a modulus field possessing a shift symmetry. The superpotential for the inflaton is generated by meson condensation due to strong dynamics with deformed moduli constraints. In contrast to models based on gaugino condensation, the inflaton potential is generated without $R$-symmetry breaking and hence does not depend on the gravitino mass. Thus, our model is compatible with low scale supersymmetry.
