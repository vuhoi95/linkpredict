Title: Holomorphy without Supersymmetry in the Standard Model Effective Field  Theory
Authors: Rodrigo Alonso and Elizabeth E. Jenkins and Aneesh V. Manohar
Abstract: The anomalous dimensions of dimension-six operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) respect holomorphy to a large extent. The holomorphy conditions are reminiscent of supersymmetry, even though the SMEFT is not a supersymmetric theory.
