Title: Abelian Hypermultiplet Gaugings and BPS Vacua in N = 2 Supergravity
Authors: Harold Erbin and Nick Halmagyi
Abstract: We analyze the gauging of Abelian isometries on the hypermultiplet scalar manifolds of N = 2 supergravity in four dimensions. This involves a study of symmetric special quaternionic-K\"ahler manifolds, building on the work of de Wit and Van Proeyen. In particular we compute the general set of Killing prepotentials and associated compensators for these manifolds manifolds. This allows us to glean new insights about AdS 4 vacua which preserve the full N = 2 supersymmetry as well as BPS static black hole horizons.
