Title: A note on the fuzzy sphere area spectrum, black hole luminosity, and the  quantum nature of spacetime
Authors: Victor Santos and C. A. S. Silva and C. A. S. Almeida
Abstract: Non-commutative corrections to the classical expression for the fuzzy sphere area are found out through the asymptotic expansion for its heat kernel trace. As an important consequence, some quantum gravity deviations in the luminosity of black holes must appear. We calculate these deviations for a static, spherically symmetric, black-hole with a horizon modeled by a fuzzy sphere. The results obtained could be verified through the radiation of black holes formed in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
