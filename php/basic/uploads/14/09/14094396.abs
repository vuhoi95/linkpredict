Abstract: In this paper we consider a geometrical Yukawa coupling as a solution to the problem of gauge field localization. We show that upon dimensional reduction the vector field component of the field is localized but the scalar component ($A_5$) is not. We show this for any smooth version of the Randall-Sundrum model. The covariant version of the model with geometrical coupling simplify the generalization to smooth versions generated by topological defects. This kind of model has been considered some time ago, but there it has been introduced two free parameters in order to get a localized solution which satisfy the boundary conditions: a mass term in five dimensions and a coupling with the brane. The boundary condition fix one of them and the model is left with one free parameter $M$. First we show that by considering a Yukawa coupling with the Ricci scalar it is possible to unify these two parameter in just one fixed by the boundary condition. With this we get a consistent model with no free parameters and the mass term can be interpreted as a coupling to the cosmological constant.
