Title: Radiation of Supersymmetric Particles from Aharonov-Bohm R-string
Authors: Yutaka Ookouchi and Takahiro Yonemoto
Abstract: We study radiation of supersymmetric particles from an Aharonov-Bohm string associated with a discrete R-symmetry. Radiation of the lightest supersymmetric particle, when combined with the observed dark matter density, imposes constraints on the string tension or the freeze-out temperature of the particle. We also calculate the amplitude for Aharonov-Bohm radiation of massive spin $3/2$ particles.
