Title: Remnants of Black Rings from Gravity's Rainbow
Authors: Ahmed Farag Ali and Mir Faizal and Mohammed M. Khalil
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a spinning black ring and a charged black ring in the context of gravity's rainbow. By incorporating rainbow functions proposed by Amelino-Camelia, et al. in [arXiv:hep-th/9605211, arXiv:0806.0339v2] in the metric of the black rings, a considerable modification happens to their thermodynamical properties. We calculate corrections to the temperature, entropy and heat capacity of the black rings. These calculations demonstrate that the behavior of Hawking radiation changes considerably near the Planck scale in gravity's rainbow, where it is shown that black rings do not evaporate completely and a remnant is left as the black rings evaporate down to Planck scale.
