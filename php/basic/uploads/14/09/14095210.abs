Title: Anderson localization in QCD-like theories
Authors: Matteo Giordano and Tamas G. Kovacs and Ferenc Pittler
Abstract: We review the present status of the Anderson transition in the spectrum of the Dirac operator of QCD-like theories on the lattice. Localized modes at the low-end of the spectrum have been found in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory with overlap and staggered valence fermions as well as in Nf=2+1 QCD with staggered quarks. We draw an analogy between the transition from localized to delocalized modes in the Dirac spectrum and the Anderson transition in electronic systems. The QCD transition turns out to be in the same universality class as the transition in the corresponding Anderson model. We also speculate on the possible physical relevance of this transition to QCD at high temperature and the possible finite temperature phase transition in QCD-like models with different fermion contents.
