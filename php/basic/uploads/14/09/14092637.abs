Title: Cosmological dynamics in higher-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet  gravity
Authors: Fabrizio Canfora and Alex Giacomini and Sergey A. Pavluchenko
Abstract: In this paper we perform a systematic classification of the regimes of cosmological dynamics in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with generic values of the coupling constants. We consider a manifold which is a warped product of a four dimensional Friedmann-Robertson-Walker space-time with a $D$-dimensional Euclidean compact constant curvature space with two independent scale factors. A numerical analysis of the time evolution as function of the coupling constants and of the curvatures of the spatial section and of the extra dimension is performed. We describe the distribution of the regimes over the initial conditions space and the coupling constants. The analysis is performed for two values of the number of extra dimensions ($D\geqslant 6$ both) which allows us to describe the effect of the number of the extra dimensions as well.
