Title: On holography for (pseudo-)conformal cosmology
Authors: M. Libanov and V. Rubakov and S. Sibiryakov
Abstract: We propose a holographic dual for (pseudo-)conformal cosmological scenario, with a scalar field that forms a moving domain wall in adS_5. The domain wall separates two vacua with unequal energy densities. Unlike in the existing construction, the 5d solution is regular in the relevant space-time domain.
