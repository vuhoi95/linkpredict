Abstract: In this article, we derive the fermionic formalism of Hamiltonians as well as corresponding excitation spectrums and states of Calogero-Sutherland(CS), Laughlin and Halperin systems, respectively. In addition, we study the triangular property of these Hamiltonians and prove the integrability in these three cases.
