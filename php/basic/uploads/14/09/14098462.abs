Title: The phase structure of QCD for heavy quarks
Authors: Christian S. Fischer and Jan LÃ¼cker and Jan M. Pawlowski
Abstract: We investigate the nature of the deconfinement and Roberge-Weiss transition in the heavy quark regime for finite real and imaginary chemical potential within the functional approach to continuum QCD. We extract the critical phase boundary between the first order and cross-over regions, and also explore tricritical scaling. Our results confirm previous ones from finite volume lattice studies.
