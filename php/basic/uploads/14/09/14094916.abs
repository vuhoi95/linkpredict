Title: Topologically distinct critical theories emerging from the bulk  entanglement spectrum of integer quantum Hall states on a lattice
Authors: Qiong Zhu and Xin Wan and Guang-Ming Zhang
Abstract: The critical theories for the topological phase transitions of integer quantum Hall states to a trivial insulating state with the same symmetry can be obtained by calculating the ground state entanglement spectrum under a symmetric checkerboard bipartition. In contrast to the gapless edge excitations under the left-right bipartition, a quantum network with bulk gapless excitations naturally emerges at the Brillouin zone center without fine tuning. On a large finite lattice, the resulting critical theory for the $\nu =1$ state is the (2+1) dimensional relativistic quantum field theory characterized by a \textit{single} Dirac cone spectrum and a pair of \textit{fractionalized} zero-energy states, while for the $\nu =2$ state the critical theory exhibits a parabolic spectrum and no sign of fractionalization in the zero-energy states. A triangular correspondence is established among the bulk topological theory, gapless edge theory, and the critical theory via the ground state entanglement spectrum.
