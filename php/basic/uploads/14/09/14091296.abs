Title: Spherical T-duality II: An infinity of spherical T-duals for  non-principal SU(2)-bundles
Authors: Peter Bouwknegt and Jarah Evslin and Varghese Mathai
Abstract: Recently we initiated the study of spherical T-duality for spacetimes that are principal SU(2)-bundles. In this paper, we extend spherical T-duality to spacetimes that are oriented non-principal SU(2)-bundles. There are several interesting new examples in this case and a new phenomenon appearing in the non-principal case is the existence of infinitely many spherical T-duals.
