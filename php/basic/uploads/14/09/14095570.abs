Title: Algebraic geometry informs perturbative quantum field theory
Authors: David Broadhurst and Oliver Schnetz
Abstract: Single-scale Feynman diagrams yield integrals that are periods, namely projective integrals of rational functions of Schwinger parameters. Algebraic geometry may therefore inform us of the types of number to which these integrals evaluate. We give examples at 3, 4 and 6 loops of massive Feynman diagrams that evaluate to Dirichlet $L$-series of modular forms and examples at 6, 7 and 8 loops of counterterms that evaluate to multiple zeta values or polylogarithms of the sixth root of unity. At 8 loops and beyond, algebraic geometry informs us that polylogs are insufficient for the evaluation of terms in the beta-function of $\phi^4$ theory. Here, modular forms appear as obstructions to polylogarithmic evaluation.
