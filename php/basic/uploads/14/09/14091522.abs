Title: Schroedinger Invariance from Lifshitz Isometries in Holography and Field  Theory
Authors: Jelle Hartong and Elias Kiritsis and Niels A. Obers
Abstract: We study non-relativistic field theory coupled to a torsional Newton-Cartan geometry both directly as well as holographically. The latter involves gravity on asymptotically locally Lifshitz space-times. We define an energy-momentum tensor and a mass current and study the relation between conserved currents and conformal Killing vectors for flat Newton-Cartan backgrounds. It is shown that flat NC space-time realizes two copies of the Lifshitz algebra that together form a Schroedinger algebra (without the central element). We show why the Schroedinger scalar model has both copies as symmetries and the Lifshitz scalar model only one. Finally we discuss the holographic dual of this phenomenon by showing that the bulk Lifshitz space-time realizes the same two copies of the Lifshitz algebra.
