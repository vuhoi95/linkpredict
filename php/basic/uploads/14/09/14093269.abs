Title: Entanglement entropy as a witness of the Aharonov-Bohm effect in QFT
Authors: Ra√∫l E. Arias and David D. Blanco and Horacio Casini
Abstract: We study the dependence of the entanglement entropy with a magnetic flux, and show that the former quantity witnesses an Aharonov Bohm-like effect. In particular, we consider free charged scalar and Dirac fields living on a two dimensional cylinder and study how the entanglement entropy for a strip-like region on the surface of the cylinder is affected by a magnetic field enclosed by it.
