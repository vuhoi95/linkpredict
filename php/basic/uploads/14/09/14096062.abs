Title: Anisotropic Fermi surface from holography
Authors: Li Qing Fang and Xian-Hui Ge and Jian-Pin Wu and Hong-Qiang Leng
Abstract: We investigate the probe holographic fermions by using an anisotropic charged black brane solution. We derive the equation of motion of probe bulk fermions with one Fermi momentum along the anisotropic and one along the isotropic directions. We then numerically solve the equation and analyze the properties of Green function with these two momentums. We find in this case the shape of Fermi surface is anisotropic. However, for both Fermi momentums perpendicular to the anisotropic direction, the Fermi surface is isotropic. We verify that our system obeys the recently conjectured bound for thermoelectric diffusion constants for the stable branch of the black brane solutions.
