Title: Inflation in supergravity without Kahler potential
Authors: Shuntaro Aoki and Yusuke Yamada
Abstract: We propose a new class of inflation models in supergravity with higher derivative terms. In those models, the K\"ahler potential does not contain the inflaton multiplet, but a supersymmetric derivative term does. In the models, inflation is effectively driven by a single scalar field with a standard kinetic term and a scalar potential. Remarkably, the so-called $\eta$ problem does not exist in our models.
