Abstract: We study geodesics in the complete family of nonexpanding impulsive gravitational waves propagating in spaces of constant curvature, that is Minkowski, de Sitter and anti-de Sitter universes. Employing the continuous form of the metric we prove existence and uniqueness of continuously differentiable geodesics (in the sense of Filippov) and use a C^1-matching procedure to explicitly derive their form.
