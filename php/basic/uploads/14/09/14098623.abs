Title: A journey to 3d: exact relations for adjoint SQCD from dimensional  reduction
Authors: Antonio Amariti and Claudius Klare
Abstract: In this note we elaborate on the reduction of four dimensional Seiberg duality with adjoint matter to three dimensions. We use the exact formulation of the superconformal index and of the partition function as instruments to test this reduction. We translate the identity between indices of the dual 4d theories to 3d. This produces various new identities between partition functions of 3d dual phases.
