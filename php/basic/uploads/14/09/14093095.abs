Title: Linearized fluid/gravity correspondence: from shear viscosity to all  order hydrodynamics
Authors: Yanyan Bu and Michael Lublinsky
Abstract: In ref. \cite{1406.7222}, we reported a construction of all order linearized fluid dynamics with strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory as underlying microscopic description. The linearized fluid/gravity correspondence makes it possible to resum all order derivative terms in the fluid stress tensor. Dissipative effects are fully encoded by the shear term and a new one, emerging starting from third order in hydrodynamic derivative expansion. In this work, we provide all computational details omitted in \cite{1406.7222} and present additional results. We derive closed-form linear holographic RG flow-type equations for momenta-dependent transport coefficient functions. Generalized Navier-Stokes equations are shown to emerge from the constraint components of the bulk Einstein equations. We perturbatively solve the RG equations for the viscosity functions, up to third order in derivative expansion, and up to this order compute spectrum of small fluctuations. Finally, we solve the RG equations numerically, thus accounting for all order derivative terms in the boundary stress tensor.
