Title: About the Absence of Exotics and the Coulomb Branch Formula
Authors: Michele Del Zotto and Ashoke Sen
Abstract: The absence of exotics is a conjectural property of the spectrum of BPS states of four--dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric QFT's. In this letter we revisit the precise statement of this conjecture, and develop a general strategy that, if applicable, entails the absence of exotic BPS states. Our method is based on the Coulomb branch formula and on quiver mutations. In particular, we obtain the absence of exotic BPS states for all pure SYM theories with simple simply--laced gauge group $G$, and, as a corollary, of infinitely many other lagrangian $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories.
