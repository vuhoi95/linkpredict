Title: Semi-Classical Localisation Properties of Quantum Oscillators on a  Noncommutative Configuration Space
Authors: Fabio Benatti and Laure Gouba
Abstract: When dealing with the classical limit of two quantum mechanical oscillators on a noncommutative configuration space, the limits corresponding to the removal of configuration-space noncommutativity and position-momentum noncommutativity do not commute. We address this behaviour from the point of view of the phase-space localisation properties of the Wigner functions of coherent states under the two limits.
