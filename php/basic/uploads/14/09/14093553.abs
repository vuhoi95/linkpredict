Title: The matrix model for hypergeometric Hurwitz numbers
Authors: Jan Ambjorn and Leonid Chekhov
Abstract: We present the multi-matrix models that are the generating functions for branched covers of the complex projective line ramified over $n$ fixed points $z_i$, $i=1,\dots,n$, (generalized Grotendieck's dessins d'enfants) of fixed genus, degree, and the ramification profiles at two points, $z_1$ and $z_n$. We take a sum over all possible ramifications at other $n-2$ points with the fixed length of the profile at $z_2$ and with the fixed total length of profiles at the remaining $n-3$ points. All these models belong to a class of hypergeometric Hurwitz models thus being tau functions of the Kadomtsev--Petviashvili (KP) hierarchy. In the case described above, we can present the obtained model as a chain of matrices with a (nonstandard) nearest-neighbor interaction of the type $\tr M_iM_{i+1}^{-1}$. We describe the technique for evaluating spectral curves of such models, which opens the possibility of applying the topological recursion for developing $1/N^2$-expansions of these model. These spectral curves turn out to be of an algebraic type.
