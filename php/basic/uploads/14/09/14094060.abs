Title: Aspects of Effective Theory for Multiple M5-Branes Compactified On  Circle
Authors: Pei-Ming Ho and Yutaka Matsuo
Abstract: A supersymmetric non-Abelian self-dual gauge theory with the explicit introduction of Kaluza-Klein modes is proposed to give a classical description of multiple M5-branes on $R^5 \times S^1$. The gauge symmetry is parametrized by Lie-algebra valued 1-forms with the redundancy of a 0-form, and the supersymmetry transformations without gauge-fixing are given. We study BPS configurations involving KK modes, including M-waves and M2-branes with non-trivial distributions around the circle. Finally, this supersymmetric gauge theory of two-forms can be equipped with more general non-Abelian gerbes in five dimensions.
