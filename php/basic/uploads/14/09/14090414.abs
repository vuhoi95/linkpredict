Authors: Yong-Soo Jho and Jae-Ho Han and Ki-Seok Kim
Abstract: Introducing both Berry curvature and chiral anomaly into Landau's Fermi-liquid theory, we construct a topological Fermi-liquid theory, applicable to interacting Weyl metals in the absence of time reversal symmetry. Following the Landau's Fermi-liquid theory, we obtain an effective free-energy functional in terms of the density field of chiral fermions. The density field of chiral fermions is determined by a self-consistent equation, minimizing the effective free-energy functional with respect to the order-parameter field. Beyond these thermodynamic properties, we construct Boltzmann transport theory to encode both the Berry curvature and the chiral anomaly in the presence of forward scattering of a Fermi-liquid state, essential for understanding dynamic correlations in interacting Weyl metals. This generalizes the Boltzmann transport theory for the Landau's Fermi-liquid state in the respect of incorporating the topological structure and extends that for noninteracting Weyl metals in the sense of introducing the forward scattering. Finally, we justify this topological Fermi-liquid theory, generalizing the first-quantization description for noninteracting Weyl metals into the second-quantization representation for interacting Weyl metals. First, we derive a topological Fermi-gas theory, integrating over high-energy electronic degrees of freedom deep inside a pair of chiral Fermi surfaces. As a result, we reproduce a topological Drude model with both the Berry curvature and the chiral anomaly. Second, we take into account interactions between such low-energy chiral fermions on the pair of chiral Fermi surfaces. We perform the renormalization group analysis, and find that only forward scattering turns out to be marginal above possible superconducting transition temperatures, justifying the topological Fermi-liquid theory of interacting Weyl metals with time reversal symmetry breaking.
