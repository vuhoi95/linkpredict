Title: The Challenge of Realizing F-term Axion Monodromy Inflation in String  Theory
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Daniela Herschmann and Erik Plauschinn
Abstract: A systematic analysis of possibilities for realizing single-field F-term axion monodromy inflation via the flux-induced superpotential in type IIB string theory is performed. In this well-defined setting the conditions arising from moduli stabilization are taken into account, where we focus on the complex-structure moduli but ignore the Kaehler moduli sector. Our analysis leads to a no-go theorem, if the inflaton involves the universal axion. We furthermore construct an explicit example of F-term axion monodromy inflation, in which a single axion-like field is hierarchically lighter than all remaining complex-structure moduli.
