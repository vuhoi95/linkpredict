Title: Interpolating between $a$ and $F$
Authors: Simone Giombi and Igor R. Klebanov
Abstract: We study the dimensional continuation of the sphere free energy in conformal field theories. In continuous dimension $d$ we define the quantity $\tilde F=\sin (\pi d/2)\log Z$, where $Z$ is the path integral of the Euclidean CFT on the $d$-dimensional round sphere. $\tilde F$ smoothly interpolates between $(-1)^{d/2}\pi/2$ times the $a$-anomaly coefficient in even $d$, and $(-1)^{(d+1)/2}$ times the sphere free energy $F$ in odd $d$. We calculate $\tilde F$ in various examples of unitary CFT that can be continued to non-integer dimensions, including free theories, double-trace deformations at large $N$, and perturbative fixed points in the $\epsilon$ expansion. For all these examples $\tilde F$ is positive, and it decreases under RG flow. Using perturbation theory in the coupling, we calculate $\tilde F$ in the Wilson-Fisher fixed point of the $O(N)$ vector model in $d=4-\epsilon$ to order $\epsilon^4$. We use this result to estimate the value of $F$ in the 3-dimensional Ising model, and find that it is only a few percent below $F$ of the free conformally coupled scalar field. We use similar methods to estimate the $F$ values for the $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu model in $d=3$ and the $O(N)$ model in $d=5$. Finally, we carry out the dimensional continuation of interacting theories with 4 supercharges, for which we suggest that $\tilde F$ may be calculated exactly using an appropriate version of localization on $S^d$. Our approach provides an interpolation between the $a$-maximization in $d=4$ and the $F$-maximization in $d=3$.
