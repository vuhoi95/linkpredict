Title: Duality invariance of $s \ge 3/2$ fermions in AdS
Authors: S. Deser and D. Seminara
Abstract: We show that in D=4 AdS, $s\ge 3/2$ partially massless (PM) fermions retain the duality invariances of their flat space massless counterparts. They have tuned ratios $ {m^2}/{M^2}\ne 0$ that turn them into sums of effectively massless unconstrained helicity $\pm(s,\cdots,\frac{3}{2})$ excitations, shorn of the lowest (non-dual)\helicity $\pm \frac{1}{2}$-rung and -more generally- of succeeding higher rung as well. Each helicity mode is separately duality invariant, like its flat space counterpart.
