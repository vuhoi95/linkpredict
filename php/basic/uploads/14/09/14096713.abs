Title: Localization of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ Supersymmetric Theories on $S^1  \times D^2$
Authors: Yutaka Yoshida and Katsuyuki Sugiyama
Abstract: We study three dimensional N=2 supersymmetric Chern-Simons-Matter theories on the direct product of circle and two dimensional hemisphere (S^1 x D^2) with specified boundary conditions by the method of localization. We construct boundary interactions to cancel the supersymmetric variation of three dimensional superpotential term and Chern-Simons term and show inflows of bulk-boundary anomalies. It finds that the boundary conditions induce two dimensional N=(0,2) type supersymmetry on the boundary torus. We also study the relation between the 3d-2d coupled partition function of our model and three dimensional holomorphic blocks.
