Title: Large N Chern-Simons with massive fundamental fermions - A model with no  bound states
Authors: Yitzhak Frishman and Jacob Sonnenschein
Abstract: In a previous paper, we analyzed the theory of massive fermions in the fundamental representation coupled to a U(N) Chern-Simons gauge theory in three dimensions at level K. It was done in the large N, large K limits where Lambda=N/K was kept fixed. Among other results, we showed there that there are no high mass quark anti-quark bound states. Here we show that there are no bound states at all.
