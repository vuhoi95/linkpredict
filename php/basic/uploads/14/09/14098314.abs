Title: Strong-coupling phases of the anisotropic Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation
Authors: Thomas Kloss and Léonie Canet and Nicolás Wschebor
Abstract: We study the anisotropic Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation using nonperturbative renormalization group methods. In contrast to a previous analysis in the weak-coupling regime we find the strong coupling fixed point corresponding to the isotropic rough phase to be always locally stable and unaffected by the anisotropy even at non-integer dimensions. Apart from the well-known weak coupling and the now well established isotropic strong coupling behavior, we find an anisotropic strong coupling fixed point for nonlinear couplings of opposite signs at non-integer dimensions.
