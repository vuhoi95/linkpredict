Authors: Yuichi Hoshino and Tomohiro Inagaki and Yuichi Mizutani
Abstract: An Abelian gauge theory with Chern-Simons term is investigated for a four-component Dirac fermion in 1+2 dimensions. The Ball-Chiu (BC) vertex function is employed to modify the rainbow-ladder approximation for the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equation. We numerically solve the SD equation and show the gauge dependence for the resulting phase boundary for the parity and the chiral symmetry.
