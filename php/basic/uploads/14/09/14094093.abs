Title: Instanton-soliton loops in 5D super-Yang-Mills
Authors: Constantinos Papageorgakis and Andrew B. Royston
Abstract: Soliton contributions to perturbative processes in QFT are controlled by a form factor, which depends on the soliton size. We provide a demonstration of this fact in a class of scalar theories with generic moduli spaces. We then argue that for instanton-solitons in 5D super-Yang-Mills theory the analogous form factor does not lead to faster-than-any-power suppression in the perturbative coupling. We also discuss the implications of such contributions for the UV behavior of maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills in 5D and its relation to the (2,0) CFT in 6D. This is a contribution to the proceedings of the "String Math 2013'" conference and is a condensed version of results appearing in 1404.0016 and 1403.5017.
