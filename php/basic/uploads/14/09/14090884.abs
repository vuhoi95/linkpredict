Title: Stability and Binding Energy of Small Asymptotically Randall-Sundrum  Black Holes
Authors: Scott Fraser and Douglas M. Eardley
Abstract: We study the binding of a small black hole to a positive-tension brane in the second Randall-Sundrum scenario (RS2) with orbifold symmetry. We find that a small black hole on the brane has substantial gravitational binding energy to the brane, and is stable against escaping into the bulk. This result can be applied in other models with an orbifold-symmetric brane. We also find a novel static black hole, which is completely localized off the brane and is unstable against translations transverse to the brane. Our results are obtained analytically by applying a variational principle to black hole initial data. This paper is the second in a series on asymptotically RS black holes.
