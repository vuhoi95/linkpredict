Authors: Alexander A. Andrianov and Andrey V. Sokolov
Abstract: The notions of weak and strong minimizability of a matrix intertwining operator are introduced. Criterion of strong minimizability of a matrix intertwining operator is revealed. Criterion and sufficient condition of existence of a constant symmetry matrix for a matrix Hamiltonian are presented. A method of constructing of a matrix Hamiltonian with a given constant symmetry matrix in terms of a set of arbitrary scalar functions and eigen- and associated vectors of this matrix is offered. Examples of constructing of $2\times2$ matrix Hamiltonians with given symmetry matrices for the cases of different structure of Jordan form of these matrices are elucidated.
