Title: The Blackbody Radiation Laws in the $ \textrm{AdS}_5 \times {\cal S}^5 $  Spacetime
Authors: Ramaton Ramos and Henrique Boschi-Filho
Abstract: In the footsteps of our previous work \cite{RamatonBoschi} we generalize the Stefan-Boltzmann and Wien's displacement laws for the $ \textrm{AdS}_5 \times {\cal S}^5 $ spacetime, the background of the AdS/CFT correspondence foremost realization. Our results take into account the $ \textrm{AdS}_5 \times {\cal S}^5 $ full dimensionality in the electromagnetic field $A^{\mu}$ wave equation, which yields the higher-dimensional blackbody characteristic features suggested in literature. In particular, the total radiated power and the spectral radiancy match the original Stefan-Boltzmann and Wien's displacement laws in the low-energy regime up to available experimental data.
