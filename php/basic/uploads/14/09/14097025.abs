Abstract: We make a joint analysis of BICEP2 and recently released Planck HFI 353 GHz dust polarization data, and find that there is no evidence for the primordial gravitational waves and the bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio becomes $r<0.083$ at $95%$ confidence level in the base $\Lambda$CDM + tensor model. Extending to the model with running of scalar spectral index, the bound is a little bit relaxed to $r<0.116$ at $95%$ confidence level. Our results imply that the inflation model with a single monomial potential is marginally disfavored at around $95%$ confidence level. Especially, the $m^2\phi^2/2$ inflation model is disfavored at more than $2\sigma$ level. However, the Starobinsky inflation model gives a nice fit.
