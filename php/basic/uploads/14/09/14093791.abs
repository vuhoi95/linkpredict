Title: Quasi-exactly-solvable confining solutions for spin-1 and spin-0 bosons  in (1+1)-dimensions with a scalar linear potential
Authors: Luis B. Castro and Antonio S. de Castro
Abstract: We point out a misleading treatment in the recent literature regarding confining solutions for a scalar potential in the context of the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau theory. We further present the proper bound-state solutions in terms of the generalized Laguerre polynomials and show that the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions depend on the solutions of algebraic equations involving the potential parameter and the quantum number.
