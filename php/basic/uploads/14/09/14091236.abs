Title: Rigour and Rigidity: Systematics on particle physics D6-brane models on  Z(2)xZ(6)
Authors: Jill Ecker and Gabriele Honecker and Wieland Staessens
Abstract: We launch a systematic search for phenomenologically appealing string vacua with intersecting D-branes on the promising T6/Z(2)xZ(6)xOR orientifold with discrete torsion. The number of independent background lattices is reduced from six to two by new symmetries. The occurrence of USp(2N) and SO(2N) versus U(N) gauge groups is classified as well as D-branes without matter in the adjoint and/or symmetric representation. Supersymmetric fractional D6-branes allowing for RR tadpole cancellation are fully classified in terms of all possible values of the one complex structure modulus inherited from the underlying six-torus. We then systematically investigate the conditions for three particle generations at pairwise intersections of two D6-branes. Global SU(5) GUT models on T6/Z(2)xZ(6)xOR are excluded by demanding three generations and no exotic matter in the 15 representation. Two prototypes of global Pati-Salam models with a mild amount of vector-like exotic matter are found.
