Title: Hydrodynamic Modes of a holographic $p-$ wave superfluid
Authors: Raul E. Arias and Ignacio Salazar Landea
Abstract: In this work we analyze the hydrodynamics of a $p-$ wave superfluid on its strongly coupled regime by considering its holographic description. We obtain the poles of the retarded Green function through the computation of the quasi-normal modes of the dual AdS black hole background finding diffusive, pseudo-diffusive and sound modes. For the sound modes we compute the speed of sound and its attenuation as function of the temperature. For the diffusive and pseudo-diffusive modes we find that they acquire a non-zero real part at certain finite momentum.
