Title: Cosmological perturbations in massive gravity with doubly coupled matter
Authors: A. Emir Gümrükçüoğlu and Lavinia Heisenberg and Shinji Mukohyama
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological perturbations around FLRW solutions to non- linear massive gravity with a new effective coupling to matter proposed recently. Unlike the case with minimal matter coupling, all five degrees of freedom in the gravity sector propagate on generic self-accelerating FLRW backgrounds. We study the stability of the cosmological solutions and put constraints on the parameters of the theory by demanding the correct sign for the kinetic terms for scalar, vector and tensor perturbations.
