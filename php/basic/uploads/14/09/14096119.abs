Title: An accurate determination of the Hubble constant from Baryon Acoustic  Oscillation datasets
Authors: Cheng Cheng and Qing-Guo Huang
Abstract: Even though the Hubble constant cannot be significantly determined by the low-redshift Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data alone, it can be tightly constrained once the high-redshift BAO data are combined. Combining BAO data from 6dFGS, BOSS DR11 clustering of galaxies, WiggleZ and $z=2.34$ from BOSS DR11 quasar Lyman-$\alpha$ forest lines, we get $H_0=68.17^{+1.55}_{-1.56}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. In addition, adopting the the simultaneous measurements of $H(z)$ and $D_A(z)$ from the two-dimensional two-point correlation function from BOSS DR9 CMASS sample and two-dimensional matter power spectrum from SDSS DR7 sample, we obtain $H_0=68.11\pm1.69$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Finally, combining all of the BAO datasets, we conclude $H_0=68.11\pm 0.86$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, a 1.3% determination.
