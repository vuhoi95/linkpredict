Title: Exact correlation functions in SU(2) N=2 superconformal QCD
Authors: Marco Baggio and Vasilis Niarchos and Kyriakos Papadodimas
Abstract: We report an exact solution of 2- and 3-point functions of chiral primary fields in SU(2) N=2 super-Yang-Mills theory coupled to four hypermultiplets. It is shown that these correlation functions are non-trivial functions of the gauge coupling, obeying differential equations which take the form of the semi-infinite Toda chain. We solve these equations recursively in terms of the Zamolodchikov metric that can be determined exactly from supersymmetric localization on the four-sphere. Our results are verified independently in perturbation theory with a Feynman diagram computation up to 2-loops. This is a short version of a companion paper that contains detailed technical remarks, additional material and aspects of an extension to SU(N) gauge group.
