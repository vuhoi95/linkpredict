Title: On Clifford-Algebraic "Holoraumy", Dimensional Extension, and SUSY  Holography
Authors: S. J. Gates Jr. and T. Hubsch and K. Stiffler
Abstract: We analyze the group of maximal automorphisms of the $N$-extended world-line supersymmetry algebra, and its action on off-shell supermultiplets. This defines a concept of "holoraumy" that extends the notions of holonomy and curvature in a novel way and provides information about the geometry of the supermultiplet field-space. In turn, the "holoraumy" transformations of 0-brane dimensionally reduced supermultiplets provide information about Lorentz transformations in the higher-dimensional spacetime from which the 0-brane supermultiplets are descended. Specifically, Spin(3) generators are encoded within 0-brane "holoraumy" tensors. World-line supermultiplets are thus able to holographically encrypt information about higher dimensional spacetime geometry.
