Title: The Higgs Mass, Superconnections and the TeV-scale Left-Right Symmetric  Model
Authors: Ufuk Aydemir and Djordje Minic and Chen Sun and Tatsu Takeuchi
Abstract: We discuss the physical implications of formulating the Standard Model (SM) in terms of the superconnection formalism involving the superalgebra su(2/1). In particular, we discuss the prediction of the Higgs mass according to the formalism and point out that it is ~170 GeV, in clear disagreement with experiment. To remedy this problem, we extend the formalism to the superalgebra su(2/2), which extends the SM to the left-right symmetric model (LRSM) and accommodates a ~126 GeV Higgs. Both the SM in the su(2/1) case and the LRSM in the su(2/2) case are argued to emerge at ~4 TeV from an underlying theory in which the spacetime geometry is modified by the addition of a discrete extra dimension. The formulation of the exterior derivative in this model space suggests a deep connection between the modified geometry, which can be described in the language of non-commutative geometry (NCG), and the spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetries. The implication is that spontaneous symmetry breaking could actually be geometric/quantum gravitational in nature. The non-decoupling phenomenon seen in the Higgs sector can then be reinterpreted in a new light as due to the mixing of low energy (SM) physics and high energy physics associated with quantum gravity, such as string theory. The phenomenology of a TeV scale LRSM is also discussed, and we argue that some exciting discoveries may await us at the LHC, and other near-future experiments.
