Title: Dynamical holographic QCD model
Authors: Danning Li and Mei Huang
Abstract: We develop a dynamical holographic QCD model, which resembles the renormalization group from ultraviolet (UV) to infrared (IR). The dynamical holographic model is constructed in the graviton-dilaton-scalar framework with the dilaton background field $\Phi$ and scalar field $X$ responsible for the gluodynamics and chiral dynamics, respectively. We summarize our results on hadron spectra, QCD phase transition and transport properties including the jet quenching parameter and the shear/bulk viscosity in the framework of the dynamical holographic QCD model.
