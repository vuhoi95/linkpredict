Title: Quantum quench in long-range field theories
Authors: M. A. Rajabpour and S. Sotiriadis
Abstract: We study equilibration properties of observables in long-range field theories after the mass quench in $d=1,2$ and $3$ dimensions. We classify the regimes where we expect equilibration or its absence in different dimensions. In addition we study the effect of the initial state in the equilibration properties of our system. In the case of free field theories we show that whenever we have equilibration the long-time limit of correlations can be described by the Generalized Gibbs Ensemble. We prove that all integrals of motions in our system are non-local.
