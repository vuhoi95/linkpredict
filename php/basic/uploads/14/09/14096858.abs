Title: Gauge Fields on Torus and Partition Function of Strings
Authors: Atsushi Nakamula and Kiyoshi Shiraishi
Abstract: In this paper we consider the interrelation between compactified string theories on torus and gauge fields on it. We start from open string theories with background gauge fields and derive partition functions by path integral. Since the effects of background fields and compactification correlate only through string zero modes, we investigate these zero modes. From this point of view, we discuss the Wilson loop mechanism at finite temperature. For the closed string, only a few comments are mentioned.
