Authors: Slimane Zaim and Abdelkader Bahache
Abstract: We obtain exact solutions of the 2D Schr\"odinger equation with the Singular Even-Power and Inverse-Power Potentials in non-commutative complex space, using the Power-series expansion method. Hence we can say that the Schr\"odinger equation in non-commutative complex space describes to the particles with spin (1/2)in an external uniform magnitic field. Where the noncommutativity play the role of magnetic field with created the total magnetic moment of particle with spin 1/2, who in turn shifted the spectrum of energy. Such effects are similar to the Zeeman splitting in a commutative space.
