Title: Lifshitz Space-Times for Schroedinger Holography
Authors: Jelle Hartong and Elias Kiritsis and Niels A. Obers
Abstract: We show that asymptotically locally Lifshitz space-times are holographically dual to field theories that exhibit Schroedinger invariance. This involves a complete identification of the sources, which describe torsional Newton-Cartan geometry on the boundary and transform under the Schroedinger algebra. We furthermore identify the dual vevs from which we define and construct the boundary energy-momentum tensor and mass current and show that these obey Ward identities that are organized by the Schroedinger algebra. We also point out that even though the energy flux has scaling dimension larger than z+2, it can be expressed in terms of computable vev/source pairs.
