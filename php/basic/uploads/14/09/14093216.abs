Title: Twisted Gauge Theory Model of Topological Phases in Three Dimensions
Authors: Yidun Wan and Juven Wang and Huan He
Abstract: We propose an exactly solvable lattice Hamiltonian model of topological phases in $3+1$ dimensions, based on a generic finite group $G$ and a $4$-cocycle $\omega$ over $G$. We show that our model has topologically protected degenerate ground states and obtain the formula of its ground state degeneracy on the $3$-torus. In particular, the ground state spectrum implies the existence of purely three-dimensional looplike quasi-excitations specified by two nontrivial flux indices and one charge index. We also construct other nontrivial topological observables of the model, namely the $SL(3,\mathbb{Z})$ generators as the modular $S$ and $T$ matrices of the ground states, which yield a set of topological quantum numbers classified by $\omega$ and quantities derived from $\omega$. Our model fulfills a Hamiltonian extension of the $3+1$-dimensional Dijkgraaf-Witten topological gauge theory with a gauge group $G$. This work is presented to be accessible for a wide range of physicists and mathematicians.
