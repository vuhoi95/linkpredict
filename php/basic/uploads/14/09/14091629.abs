Title: Spectrum of edge states in the $Î½=0$ quantum Hall phases in graphene
Authors: P. K. Pyatkovskiy and V. A. Miransky
Abstract: Edge excitations of the $\nu=0$ quantum Hall state in monolayer graphene are studied within the mean-field theory with different symmetry-breaking terms. The analytical expressions for the continuum (Dirac) model wave functions are obtained for the charge density wave, Kekul\'e distortion, ferromagnetic, and (canted) antiferromagnetic phases. The dispersion equations for each phase and boundary type (zigzag and armchair) are derived, numerically solved, and compared to the results of the corresponding effective tight-binding model. The effect of the next-to-nearest neighbor hopping parameter on the edge state spectrum is studied and revealed to be essential. The criteria for the existence of gapless edge states are established for each phase and edge type.
