Title: Information-Entropic Measure of Energy-Degenerate Kinks in Two-Field  Models
Authors: R. A. C. Correa and A. de Souza Dutra and M. Gleiser
Abstract: We investigate the existence and properties of kink-like solitons in a class of models with two interacting scalar fields. In particular, we focus on models that display both double and single-kink solutions, treatable analytically using the Bogomol'nyi--Prasad--Sommerfield bound (BPS). Such models are of interest in applications that include Skyrmions and various superstring-motivated theories. Exploring a region of parameter space where the energy for very different spatially-bound configurations is degenerate, we show that a newly-proposed momentum-space entropic measure called Configurational Entropy (CE) can distinguish between such energy-degenerate spatial profiles. This information-theoretic measure of spatial complexity provides a complementary perspective to situations where strictly energy-based arguments are inconclusive.
