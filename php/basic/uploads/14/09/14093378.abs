Title: Noncommutative quantum mechanics of simple matter systems interacting  with circularly polarized gravitational waves
Authors: Sunandan Gangopadhyay and Anirban Saha and Swarup Saha
Abstract: The response of a test particle, both for the free case and under the harmonic oscillator potential, to circularly polarized gravitational waves is investigated in a noncommutative quantum mechanical setting. The system is quantized following the prescription in \cite{ncgw1}. Standard algebraic techniques are then employed to solve the Hamiltonian of the system. The solutions, in both cases, show signatures of the coordinate noncommutativity. In the harmonic oscillator case, this signature plays a key role in altering the resonance point and the oscillation frequency of the system.
