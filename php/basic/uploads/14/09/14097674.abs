Title: Gradient Correction to Photon Emission Rate at Strong Coupling
Authors: Kiminad A. Mamo and Ho-Ung Yee
Abstract: We compute the correction to the photon emission rate in first order of shear components of fluid velocity gradients, $\sigma_{ij}$, in near-equilibrium hydrodynamic plasma at strong coupling regime, using the real-time Schwinger-Keldysh formalism in AdS/CFT correspondence. Our result is an integral of an analytic expression. We observe that the gradient correction to the photon emission rate at strong coupling is about 0.3 - 0.4 times of the equilibrium rate in units of $\sigma_{ij}/T$.
