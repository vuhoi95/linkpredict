Title: Possible Supersymmetric Kinematics
Authors: Chao-Guang Huang and Lin Li
Abstract: The contraction method in different limits to obtain 22 different realizations of kinematical algebras is applied to study the supersymmetric extension of \AdS\ algebra and its contractions. It is shown that $\frak{p}_2$ $\frak{h}_-$, $\frak{p}'$, $\frak{c}_2$ and $\frak{g}'$ algebras, in addition to $\frak{d}_-$, $\frak{p}$, $\frak{n}_-$, $\frak{g}$ and $\frak{c}$ algebras, have supersymmetric extension, while $\frak{n}_{-2}$, $\frak{g}_2$ and $\frak{g}'_2$ algebras have no supersymmetric extension. The connections among the superalgebras are established.
