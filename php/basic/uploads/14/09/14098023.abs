Title: Neutrino-antineutrino mass splitting in the Standard Model and  baryogenesis
Authors: Kazuo Fujikawa and Anca Tureanu
Abstract: On the basis of a previously proposed mechanism of neutrino-antineutrino mass splitting in the Standard Model, which is Lorentz and $SU(2)\times U(1)$ invariant but non-local to evade $CPT$ theorem, we discuss the possible implications of neutrino-antineutrino mass splitting on neutrino physics and baryogenesis. It is shown that non-locality within a distance scale of the Planck length, that may not be fatal to unitarity in generic effective theory, can generate the neutrino-antineutrino mass splitting of the order of observed neutrino mass differences, which is tested in oscillation experiments, and non-negligible baryon asymmetry depending on the estimate of sphaleron dynamics. The one-loop order induced electron-positron mass splitting in the Standard Model is shown to be finite and estimated at $\sim 10^{-20}$ eV, well below the experimental bound $< 10^{-2}$ eV. The induced $CPT$ violation in the $K$-meson in the Standard Model is expected to be even smaller and well below the experimental bound $|m_{K}-m_{\bar{K}}|<0.44\times 10^{-18}$ GeV.
