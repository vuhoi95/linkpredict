Title: Dynamical symmetry enhancement near IIA horizons
Authors: U. Gran and J. Gutowski and U. Kayani and G. Papadopoulos
Abstract: We show that smooth type IIA Killing horizons with compact spatial sections preserve an even number of supersymmetries, and that the symmetry algebra of horizons with non-trivial fluxes includes an sl(2,R) subalgebra. This confirms the conjecture of [1] for type IIA horizons. As an intermediate step in the proof, we also demonstrate new Lichnerowicz type theorems for spin bundle connections whose holonomy is contained in a general linear group.
