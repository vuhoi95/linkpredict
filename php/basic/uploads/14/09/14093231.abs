Title: Newtonian wormholes
Authors: Jos√© P. S. Lemos and Paulo Luz
Abstract: A wormhole solution in Newtonian gravitation, enhanced through an equation relating the Ricci scalar to the mass density, is presented. The wormhole inhabits a spherically symmetric curved space, with one throat and two asymptotically flat regions. Particle dynamics in this geometry is studied, and the three distinct dynamical radii, namely, the geodesic, circumferential, and curvature radii, appear naturally in the study of circular motion. Generic motion is also analysed. A limiting case, although inconclusive, suggests the possibility of having a Newtonian black hole in a region of finite (nonzero) size.
