Authors: Marisa Fernandez and Stefan Ivanov and Luis Ugarte and Dimiter vassilev
Abstract: Conformally compact and complete smooth solutions to the Strominger system with non vanishing flux, non-trivial instanton and non-constant dilaton using the first Pontrjagin form of the (-)-connection} on 6-dimensional non-Kaehler nilmanifold are presented. In the conformally compact case the dilaton is determined by the real slices of the elliptic Weierstrass function. The dilaton of non-compact complete solutions is given by the fundamental solution of the Laplacian on $R^4$.
