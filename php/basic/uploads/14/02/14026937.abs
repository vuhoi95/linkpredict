Title: Holography and non-local operators in the BTZ black hole with non-zero  angular momentum
Authors: D. S. Ageev and I. Ya. Aref'eva
Abstract: We study quark-antiquark potential using the AdS/CFT correspondence in the BTZ black hole with non-zero angular momentum. Using explicit form of string configurations relevant to a calculation of the potential we find that the potential exhibits different dependencies on angular momentum values in the Euclidean and the Lorentzian signatures of the BTZ.
