Title: Combinatorial Interpretation of the Scalar Products of State Vectors of  Integrable Models
Authors: N. M. Bogoliubov and C. Malyshev
Abstract: The representation of the Bethe wave functions of certain integrable models via the Schur functions allows to apply the well-developed theory of the symmetric functions to the calculation of the thermal correlation functions. The algebraic relations arising in the calculation of the scalar products and the correlation functions are based on the Binet-Cauchy formula for the Schur functions. We provide a combinatorial interpretation of the formula for the scalar products of the Bethe state-vectors in terms of nests of the self-avoiding lattice paths constituting the so-called watermelon configurations. The interpretation proposed is, in its turn, related to the enumeration of the boxed plane partitions.
