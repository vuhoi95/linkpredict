Title: Gauge/gravity dualities and bulk phase transitions
Authors: Anton F. Faedo and Maurizio Piai and Daniel Schofield
Abstract: We consider D7-branes probing several classes of Type IIB supergravity backgrounds, and study the classical problem of finding equilibrium configurations for the embedding functions. This is a method employed to model chiral symmetry breaking in the gravity dual of a strongly-coupled, confining gauge theory. We unveil and discuss a new type of phase transition appearing in the gravity systems, which is similar in nature and meaning to bulk phase transitions on the lattice. The existence of this genre of phase transition puts a new, intrinsic limit on the region of parameter space which can be used to study the physics of the dual field theory. We complete the analysis of D7 embeddings in wrapped-D5 supergravity backgrounds, and explain in what cases chiral-symmetry breaking is sensibly modelled by the gravity construction.
