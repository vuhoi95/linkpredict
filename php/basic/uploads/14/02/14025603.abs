Title: Rotating strings confronting PDG mesons
Authors: Jacob Sonnenschein and Dorin Weissman
Abstract: We revisit the model of mesons as rotating strings with massive endpoints and confront it with meson spectra. We look at Regge trajectories both in the (J,M2) and (n,M2) planes, where J and n are the angular momentum and radial excitation number respectively. We start from states comprised of u and d quarks alone, move on to trajectories involving s and c quarks, and finally analyze the trajectories of the heaviest observed b-bbar mesons. The endpoint masses provide the needed transition between the linear Regge trajectories of the light mesons to the deviations from linear behavior encountered for the heavier mesons, all in the confines of the same simple model. From our fits we extract the values of the quark endpoint masses, the Regge slope (string tension) and quantum intercept. The model also allows for a universal fit where with a single value of the Regge slope we fit all the (J,M2) trajectories involving u, d, s, and c quarks. We include a list of predictions for higher mesons in both J and n.
