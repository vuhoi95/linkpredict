Title: Chiral Langevin theory for non-Abelian plasmas
Authors: Yukinao Akamatsu and Naoki Yamamoto
Abstract: Charged plasmas with chirality imbalance are unstable and tend to reduce the imbalance. This chiral plasma instability is, however, not captured in (anomalous) hydrodynamics for high-temperature non-Abelian plasmas. We derive a Langevin-type classical effective theory with anomalous parity-violating effects for non-Abelian plasmas that describes the chiral plasma instability at the magnetic scale. We show that the time scale of the instability is of order $[g^4 T \ln(1/g)]^{-1}$ at weak coupling.
