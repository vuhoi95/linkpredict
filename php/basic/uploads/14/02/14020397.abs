Authors: Tajron Jurić and Domagoj Kovačević and Stjepan Meljanac
Abstract: Hopf algebroid structures on the Weyl algebra (phase space) are presented. We define the coproduct for the Weyl generators from Leibniz rule. The codomain of the coproduct is modified in order to obtain an algebra structure. We use the dual base to construct the target map and antipode. The notion of twist is analyzed for $\kappa$-deformed phase space in Hopf algebroid setting. It is outlined how the twist in the Hopf algebroid setting reproduces the full Hopf algebra structure of $\kappa$-Poincar\'e algebra. Several examples of realizations are worked out in details.
