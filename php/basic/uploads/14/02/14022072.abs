Title: Black Holes as Beads on Cosmic Strings
Authors: Amjad Ashoorioon and Robert B. Mann
Abstract: We consider the possibility of formation of cosmic strings with black holes as beads. We focus on the simplest setup where two black holes are formed on a long cosmic string. It turns out the in absence of a background magnetic field and for observationally viable values for cosmic string tensions, $\mu<2\times 10^{-7}$, the tension of the strut in between the black holes has to be less than the ones that run into infinity. This result does not change if a cosmological constant is present. However if the background magnetic field is turned on, we can have stable setups where the tensions of all cosmic strings are equal. We derive the equilibrium conditions in each of these setups depending on whether the black holes are extremal or non-extremal. We obtain cosmologically acceptable solutions with solar mass black holes and intragalactic strength cosmic magnatic field.
