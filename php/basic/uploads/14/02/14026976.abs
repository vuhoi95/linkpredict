Title: Spectral theorem in noncommutative field theories: Jacobi dynamics
Authors: Antoine Géré and Jean-Christophe Wallet
Abstract: Jacobi operators appear as kinetic operators of several classes of noncommutative field theories (NCFT) considered recently. This paper deals with the case of bounded Jacobi operators. A set of tools mainly issued from operator and spectral theory is given in a way applicable to the study of NCFT. As an illustration, this is applied to a gauge-fixed version of the induced gauge theory on the Moyal plane expanded around a symmetric vacuum. The characterization of the spectrum of the kinetic operator is given, showing a behavior somewhat similar to a massless theory. An attempt to characterize the noncommutative geometry related to the gauge fixed action is presented. Using a Dirac operator obtained from the kinetic operator, it is shown that one can construct an even, regular, weakly real spectral triple. This spectral triple does not define a noncommutative metric space for the Connes spectral distance.
