Abstract: In this work we show that relativistic contributions to the ground state energy of the hydrogen atom arising from the presence of a minimal length introduced by a Lorentz-covariant algebra are more relevant than non-relativistic ones, and because of this the non-relativistic approach is not suitable. In addition, comparing our result with experimental data we can roughly estimate the upper bound for the minimal length value of the order $10^{-20}m$.
