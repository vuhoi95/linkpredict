Title: New Results on Compact Structures
Authors: D. Bazeia and L. Losano and R. Menezes
Abstract: We investigate the presence of localized solutions in models described by a single real scalar field with generalized dynamics. The study offers a method to solve very intricate nonlinear ordinary differential equations, and we illustrate the results with some examples on localized structures with compact profile, in models with polynomial and nonpolynomial interactions. We also show that the compact solutions we have found are all linearly stable.
