Title: Polyakov Loops for the ABJ Theory
Authors: Mir Faizal and Tsou Sheung Tsun
Abstract: In this paper we will first construct Polyakov loops for the ABJ theory. Then we will construct the connection and curvature in this loop space. We will also analyse certain generalization of Polyakov loops and apply them to the ABJ theory. Finally, we will use this formalism for analysing topological defects like monopoles in the ABJ theory.
