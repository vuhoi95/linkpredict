Abstract: Representations of the Poincar\'{e} symmetry are studied by using a Hilbert space with a phase space content. The states are described by wave functions ( quasi amplitudes of probability) associated with Wigner functions (quasi probability density). The gauge symmetry analysis provides a realization of the Seiberg-Witten gauge theory for noncommutative fields.
