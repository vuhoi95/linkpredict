Title: Towards Non-Commutative Deformations of Relativistic Wave Equations in  2+1 Dimensions
Authors: Bernd J. Schroers and Matthias Wilhelm
Abstract: We consider the deformation of the Poincar\'e group in 2+1 dimensions into the quantum double of the Lorentz group and construct Lorentz-covariant momentum-space formulations of the irreducible representations describing massive particles with spin 0, 1/2 and 1 in the deformed theory. We discuss ways of obtaining non-commutative versions of relativistic wave equations like the Klein-Gordon, Dirac and Proca equations in 2+1 dimensions by applying a suitably defined Fourier transform, and point out the relation between non-commutative Dirac equations and the exponentiated Dirac operator considered by Atiyah and Moore.
