Title: On the Ground State Wave Function of Matrix Theory
Authors: Ying-Hsuan Lin and Xi Yin
Abstract: We propose an explicit construction of the leading terms in the asymptotic expansion of the ground state wave function of BFSS SU(N) matrix quantum mechanics. Our proposal is consistent with the expected factorization property in various limits of the Coulomb branch, and involves a different scaling behavior from previous suggestions. We comment on some possible physical implications.
