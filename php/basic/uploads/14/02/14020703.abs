Title: Tunnel determinants from spectral zeta functions. Instanton effects in  quantum mechanics
Authors: Alberto Alonso-Izquierdo and Juan Mateos Guilarte
Abstract: In this paper we develop an spectral zeta function regularization procedure on the determinants of instanton fluctuation operators that describe the semi-classical order of tunnel effects bewtween degenerate vacua.
