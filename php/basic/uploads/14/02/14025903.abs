Abstract: We study kink scattering processes in the (1+1)-dimensional $\varphi^6$ model in the framework of the collective coordinate approximation. We find critical values of the initial velocities of the colliding kinks. These critical velocities distinguish different regimes of collisions. The exact equation of motion for the $\varphi^6$ model is also solved numerically with the same initial conditions. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of the collective coordinate approximation, and also outline its applicability limits. Resonance phenomena and the so-called escape windows are also observed in the kink collisions.
