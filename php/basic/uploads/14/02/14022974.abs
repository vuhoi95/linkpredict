Title: N=2 string amplitudes and the Omega background
Authors: Ioannis Florakis and Ahmad Zein Assi
Abstract: We review recent work [1, 2] on obtaining a realisation of the $\Omega$-background in terms of a special series of higher-derivative generalised F-terms in the effective $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity action. We discuss the motivation behind the identification of these couplings, their relation to the Nekrasov partition function and connect them to a worldsheet approach towards the refined topological string.
