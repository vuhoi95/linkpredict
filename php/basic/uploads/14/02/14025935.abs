Abstract: Spherically symmetric solutions for f(T) gravity models are derived by the so called Noether Symmetry Approach. First, we present a full set of Noether symmetries for some minisuperspace models. Then, we compute analytical solutions and find that spherically symmetric solutions in f(T) gravity can be recast in terms of Schwarzschild-like solutions modified by a distortion function depending on a characteristic radius. The obtained solutions are more general than those obtained by the usual solution methods.
