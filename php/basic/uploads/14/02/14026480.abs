Title: $U(1)$ Gauge Field Localization on Bloch Brane with Chumbes-Holf da  Silva-Hott Mechanism
Authors: Zhen-Hua Zhao and Yu-Xiao Liu and Yuan Zhong
Abstract: We follow the Chumbes-Holf da Silva-Hott (CHH) mechanism to study the (qusi-)localization of $U(1)$ gauge field on the Bloch brane. The localization of $U(1)$ gauge field is discussed for four kinds of Bloch brane solutions: the original Bloch brane solution, the generalized Bloch brane solution, and the degenerate Bloch brane solutions I and II. With the CHH mechanism, we find that the mass spectrum of the gauge field Kaluza-Klein modes is continuous and only the zero mode of the gauge field is localized on the brane. For the massive modes, there exist resonant modes only on the degenerate Bloch branes.
