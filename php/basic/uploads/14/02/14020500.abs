Title: Entanglement And Non-Trivial Topologies
Authors: Thiago Prudencio and Diego Julio Cirilo-Lombardo
Abstract: We consider states defined on non-trivial topologies of Torus, Mobius and Torus-Mobius. Adequate operators leading to the construction of coherent states, two-mode coherent states and entangled states are derived and we show a class of entangled states on Torus that are related to the entanglement of photons by orbital angular momentum states.
