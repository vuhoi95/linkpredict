Abstract: In arXiv:1401.3025 a new mechanism of energy loss by primordial black holes passing through neutron stars has been proposed, which is more efficient, by many orders of magnitude, than the existing ones. In this comment we point out a problem in the calculations of arXiv:1401.3025 that may invalidate the result.
