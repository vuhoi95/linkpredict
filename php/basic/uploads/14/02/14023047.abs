Title: Lorentz Invariance Violation and Modified Hawking Fermions Tunneling  from Black Strings
Authors: Shu-Zheng Yang and Kai Lin and Jin Li and Qing-Quan Jiang
Abstract: Recently the modified Dirac equation with Lorentz invariance violation has been proposed, which would be helpful to resolve some issues in quantum gravity theory and high energy physics. In this paper, the modified Dirac equation has been generalized in curved spacetime, and then fermion tunneling of black strings is researched under this correctional Dirac field theory. We also use semi-classical approximation method to get correctional Hamilton-Jacobi equation, so that the correctional Hawking temperature and correctional black hole's entropy are derived.
