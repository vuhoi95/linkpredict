Title: Models of AdS_2 Backreaction and Holography
Authors: Ahmed Almheiri and Joseph Polchinski
Abstract: We develop models of 1+1 dimensional dilaton gravity describing flows to $AdS_2$ from higher dimensional $AdS$ and other spaces. We use these to study the effects of backreaction on holographic correlators. We show that this scales as a relevant effect at low energies, for compact transverse spaces. We also discuss effects of matter loops, as in the CGHS model.
