Title: Radiation reaction at the level of the action
Authors: Ofek Birnholtz and Shahar Hadar and Barak Kol
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to highlight a recently proposed method for the treatment of classical radiative effects, in particular radiation reaction, via effective field theory methods. We emphasize important features of the method, and in particular the doubling of fields. We apply the method to two simple systems: for the mass-rope system in 1+1 dimensions we derive an effective action for the mass which describes a damped harmonic oscillator, while for the electromagnetic charge-field system, i.e. the system of an accelerating electric charge in 3+1 d, we derive the leading Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac force.
