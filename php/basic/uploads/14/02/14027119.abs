Title: Massive minimal subtraction scheme and "partial-$p$" in anisotropic  Lifshitz space(time)s
Authors: Emanuel V. Souza and Paulo R. S. Carvalho and Marcelo M. Leite
Abstract: We introduce the "partial-$p$" operation in a massive Euclidean $\lambda\phi^{4}$ scalar field theory describing anisotropic Lifshitz critical behavior. We then develop a minimal subtraction a la $Bogoliubov-Parasyuk-Hepp-Zimmermann$ renormalization scheme. As an application we compute critical exponents diagrammatically using the orthogonal approximation at least up to two-loop order and show their equivalence with other renormalization techniques. We discuss possible applications of the method in other field-theoretic contexts.
