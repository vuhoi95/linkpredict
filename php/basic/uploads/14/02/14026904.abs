Abstract: It is shown that the Wahlquist metric, which is a stationary, axially symmetric perfect fluid solution with $\rho+3p=\text{const.}$, admits a rank-2 generalized closed conformal Killing-Yano tensor with a skew-symmetric torsion. Taking advantage of the presence of such a tensor, we obtain a higher-dimensional generalization of the Wahlquist metric in arbitrary dimensions, including a family of vacuum black hole solutions with spherical horizon topology such as Schwarzschild-Tangherlini, Myers-Perry and higher-dimensional Kerr-NUT-(A)dS metrics and a family of static, spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions in higher dimensions.
