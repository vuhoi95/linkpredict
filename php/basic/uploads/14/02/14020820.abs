Authors: Mohammad Ghanaatian and Afsaneh Bazrafshan and Wilson G. Brenna
Abstract: In this paper we shall elucidate some of the effects of the quartic quasitopological term for Lifshitz-symmetric black holes. The field equations of this theory are difficult to solve exactly; here we will use numerical solutions both to verify previous exact solutions for quartic quasitopological AdS black holes as well as to examine new quasitopological Lifshitz-symmetric black hole solutions, in order to determine the effect of the quartic coupling parameter on the black hole's thermodynamic behavior. We shall find that the quartic parameter controls solutions very similarly to the cubic parameter, allowing for the construction of a theory with another free parameter which may find meaning in the phase transition behaviour of a gauge/gravity context.
