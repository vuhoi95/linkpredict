Authors: Rajesh Kumar Gupta and Shailesh Lal and Somyadip Thakur
Abstract: We compute the logarithmic correction to black hole entropy about exponentially suppressed saddle points of the Quantum Entropy Function corresponding to Z(N) orbifolds of the near horizon geometry of the extremal black hole under study. By carefully accounting for zero mode contributions we show that the logarithmic contributions for quarter--BPS black holes in N=4 supergravity and one--eighth BPS black holes in N=8 supergravity perfectly match with the prediction from the microstate counting. We also find that the logarithmic contribution for half--BPS black holes in N = 2 supergravity depends non-trivially on the Z(N) orbifold. Our analysis draws heavily on the results we had previously obtained for heat kernel coefficients on Z(N) orbifolds of spheres and hyperboloids in arXiv:1311.6286 and we also propose a generalization of the Plancherel formula to Z(N) orbifolds of hyperboloids to an expression involving the Harish-Chandra character of SL(2,R), a result which is of possible mathematical interest.
