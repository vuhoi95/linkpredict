Title: A Note on the CFT Origin of the Strong Constraint of DFT
Authors: Andre Betz and Ralph Blumenhagen and Dieter Lust and Felix Rennecke
Abstract: In double field theory, motivated by its field theoretic consistency, the level matching condition is generalized to the so-called strong constraint. In this note, it is investigated what the two-dimensional conformal field theory origin of this constraint is. Initially treating the left- and right-movers as independent, we compute the torus partition function as well as a generalized Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude. In non-compact directions the strong constraint arises from the factorization of the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude over physical states as determined by the modular invariant partition function. From the same argument, along internal toroidal directions, no analogous constraint arises.
