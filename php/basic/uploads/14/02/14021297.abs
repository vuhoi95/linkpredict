Title: Conformal Newton-Hooke symmetry of Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator
Authors: Krzysztof Andrzejewski and Anton Galajinsky and Joanna Gonera and Ivan Masterov
Abstract: It is demonstrated that the Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator in arbitrary dimension enjoys the l-conformal Newton-Hooke symmetry provided frequencies of oscillation form the arithmetic sequence omega_k=(2k-1) omega_1, where k=1,...,n, and l is the half-integer (2n-1)/2. The model is shown to be maximally superintegrable. A link to n decoupled isotropic oscillators is discussed and an interplay between the l-conformal Newton-Hooke symmetry and symmetries characterizing each individual isotropic oscillator is analyzed.
