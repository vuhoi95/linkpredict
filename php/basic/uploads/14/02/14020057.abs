Title: Bosonic (p - 1)-forms in Einstein-Cartan theory of gravity
Authors: Jorge Alfaro and Simon Riquelme
Abstract: We introduce bosonic (p - 1)-form fields that couple to the spin connection of the Einstein-Cartan theory of gravity thus becoming a non-trivial source of space-time torsion. We analyze all the general features of both the matter and the gravitational sectors of the theory. Finally we briefly consider the implications of the existence of such fields in different physical settings.
