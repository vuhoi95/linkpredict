Title: Collapsing rotating shells in Myers-Perry-AdS$_5$ spacetime: A  perturbative approach
Authors: Jorge V. Rocha and Raphael Santarelli and TÃ©rence Delsate
Abstract: We study gravitational perturbations sourced by a rotating test shell collapsing into five-dimensional Myers-Perry black holes in anti-de Sitter (AdS). Our attention is restricted to the case in which the two possible angular momenta of the geometry are set equal. In this situation the background is cohomogeneity-1, which amounts to a crucial technical simplification. It is found that the linearized Einstein equations are consistent only when the test shell is corotating with the spacetime. However, it is argued that this is a consequence of the matter on the shell being described by dust or, more precisely, noninteracting test particles. We compute the mass and angular momenta of the perturbed spacetime using a counterterm subtraction method, for which we provide an explicit formula that has not appeared previously in the literature. The results are in agreement with the expected expressions for energy and angular momenta of geodesic particles in AdS$_5$.
