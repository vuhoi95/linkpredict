Title: Quasinormal modes of asymptotically flat rotating black holes
Authors: Oscar J. C. Dias and Gavin S. Hartnett and Jorge E. Santos
Abstract: We study the main properties of general linear perturbations of rotating black holes in asymptotically flat higher-dimensional spacetimes. In particular, we determine the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum of singly spinning and equal angular momenta Myers-Perry black holes (MP BHs). Emphasis is also given to the timescale of the ultraspinning and bar-mode instabilities in these two families of MP BHs. For the bar-mode instabilities in the singly spinning MP BH, we find excellent agreement with our linear analysis and the non-linear time evolution of Shibata and Yoshino for d=6,7 spacetime dimensions. We find that d=5 singly spinning BHs are linearly stable. In the context of studying general relativity in the large dimension limit, we obtain the QNM spectrum of Schwarzschild BHs and rotating MP BHs for large dimensions. We identify two classes of modes. For large dimensions, we find that in the limit of zero rotation, unstable modes of the MP BHs connect to a class of Schwarzschild QNMs that saturate to finite values.
