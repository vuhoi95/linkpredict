Title: Non-supersymmetric Microstates of the MSW System
Authors: Souvik Banerjee and Borun D. Chowdhury and Bert Vercnocke and Amitabh Virmani
Abstract: We present an analysis parallel to that of Giusto, Ross, and Saxena (arXiv:0708.3845) and construct a discrete family of non-supersymmetric microstate geometries of the Maldacena-Strominger-Witten system. The supergravity configuration in which we look for the smooth microstates is constructed using SO(4,4) dualities applied to an appropriate seed solution. The SO(4,4) approach offers certain technical advantages. Our microstate solutions are smooth in five dimensions, as opposed to all previously known non-supersymmetric microstates with AdS3 cores, which are smooth only in six dimensions. The decoupled geometries for our microstates are related to global AdS3 x S2 by spectral flows.
