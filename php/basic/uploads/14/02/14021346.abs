Title: Reconstruction of Domain Wall Universe and Localization of Gravity
Authors: Masafumi Higuchi and Shin'ichi Nojiri
Abstract: We construct a four-dimensional domain wall universe by using the Brans-Dicke type gravity with two scalar field. We give a formulation where for arbitrarily given warp factor and scale factor, we construct an action which reproduces both of the warp and scale factors as a solution of the Einstein equation and the field equations given by the action. This formulation could be called as reconstruction. We show that the model does not contain ghost with negative kinetic term and there occur the localization of gravity as in the Randall-Sundrum model. It should be noted that in the equation of the graviton, there appear extra terms related with the extra dimension, which might affect the tensor mode in the fluctuations
