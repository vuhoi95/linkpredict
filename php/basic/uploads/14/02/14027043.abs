Title: Fermi Liquids from D-Branes
Authors: Moshe Rozali and Darren Smyth
Abstract: We discuss finite density configurations on probe D-branes, in the presence of worldvolume fermions. To this end we consider a phenomenological model whose bosonic sector is governed by the DBI action, and whose charged sector is purely fermionic. In this model, we demonstrate the existence of a compact worldvolume embedding, stabilized by a Fermi surface on the D- brane. The finite density state in the boundary QFT is a Fermi-like liquid. We comment on the possibility of realizing non-Fermi liquids in this setup.
