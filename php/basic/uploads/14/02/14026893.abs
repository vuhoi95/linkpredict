Title: Creation operators for the Fateev-Zamolodchikov spin chain
Authors: M. Jimbo and T. Miwa and F. Smirnov
Abstract: In our previous works on the XXZ chain of spin one half, we have studied the problem of constructing a basis of local operators whose members have simple vacuum expectation values. For this purpose a pair of fermionic creation operators have been introduced. In this article we extend this construction to the spin one case. We formulate the fusion procedure for the creation operators, and find a triplet of bosonic as well as two pairs of fermionic creation operators. We show that the resulting basis of local operators satisfies the dual reduced qKZ equation.
