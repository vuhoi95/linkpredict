Title: Effective field theory for fluids: Hall viscosity from a  Wess-Zumino-Witten term
Authors: Michael Geracie and Dam Thanh Son
Abstract: We propose an effective action that describe a relativistic fluid with Hall viscosity. The construction involves a Wess-Zumino-Witten term that exists only in (2+1) spacetime dimensions. We note that this formalism can accommodate only a Hall viscosity which is a homogeneous function of the entropy and particle number densities of degree one.
