Abstract: Gaining insight about ensembles of magnetic configurations, that could originate the confining string tension between quarks, constitutes a major concern in current lattice investigations. This interest also applies to a different approach, where gauge models with spontaneous symmetry breaking are constructed to describe the confining string as a smooth vortex solution. In this article, we initially show how to incorporate non Abelian information into an ensemble of monopoles in $4D$, characterized by phenomenological parameters. Next, using some recent techniques developed for polymers, we were able to relate the coloured ensemble with a non Abelian gauge model. This could offer an interesting perspective to discuss some of the different approaches to describe confinement.
