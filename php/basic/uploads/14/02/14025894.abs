Title: Conformal Carroll groups and BMS symmetry
Authors: C. Duval and G. W. Gibbons and P. A. Horvathy
Abstract: The Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group is shown to be the conformal extension of Levy-Leblond's "Carroll" group. Further extension to the Newman-Unti (NU) group is also discussed in the Carroll framework.
