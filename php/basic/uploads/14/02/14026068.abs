Title: Bounds on $\mathcal{N}=1$ Superconformal Theories with Global Symmetries
Authors: Micha Berkooz and Ran Yacoby and Amir Zait
Abstract: Recently, the conformal-bootstrap has been successfully used to obtain generic bounds on the spectrum and OPE coefficients of unitary conformal field theories. In practice, these bounds are obtained by assuming the existence of a scalar operator in the theory and analyzing the crossing-symmetry constraints of its 4-point function. In $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal theories with a global symmetry there is always a scalar primary operator, which is the top of the current-multiplet. In this paper we analyze the crossing-symmetry constraints of the 4-point function of this operator for $\mathcal{N}=1$ theories with $SU(N)$ global symmetry. We analyze the current-current OPE, and derive the superconformal blocks, generalizing the work of Fortin, Intrilligator and Stergiou to the non-Abelian case and finding new superconformal blocks which appear in the Abelian case. We then use these results to obtain bounds on the coefficient of the current 2-point function.
