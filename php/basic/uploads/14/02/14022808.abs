Title: The Thermal Scalar and Random Walks in AdS3 and BTZ
Authors: Thomas G. Mertens and Henri Verschelde and Valentin I. Zakharov
Abstract: We analyze near-Hagedorn thermodynamics of strings in the WZW $AdS_3$ model. We compute the thermal spectrum of all primaries and find the thermal scalar explicitly in the string spectrum using CFT twist techniques. Then we use the link to the Euclidean WZW BTZ black hole and write down the Euclidean BTZ spectrum. We give a Hamiltonian interpretation of the thermal partition function of angular orbifolds where we find a reappearance of discrete states that dominate the partition function. Using these results, we discuss the nature of the thermal scalar in the WZW BTZ model. As a slight generalization of the angular orbifolds, we discuss the $AdS_3$ string gas with a non-zero chemical potential corresponding to angular momentum around the spatial cigar. For this model as well, we determine the thermal spectrum and the Hagedorn temperature as a function of chemical potential. Finally the nature of $\alpha'$ corrections to the $AdS_3$ thermal scalar action is analyzed and we find the random walk behavior of highly excited strings in this particular $AdS_3$ background.
