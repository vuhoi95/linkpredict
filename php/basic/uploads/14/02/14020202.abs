Title: Free-fall energy density and flux in the Schwarzschild black hole
Authors: Wontae Kim and Bibhas Ranjan Majhi
Abstract: In the four-dimensional background of Schwarzschild black hole, we investigate the energy densities and fluxes in the freely falling frames for the Boulware, Unruh, and Israel-Hartle-Hawking states. In particular, we study their behaviors near the horizon and asymptotic spatial infinity by using the trace anomaly of a conformally invariant scalar field. In the Boulware state, both the energy density and flux are negative divergent when the observer is dropped at the horizon, and asymptotically vanish. In the Unruh state, the energy density is also negative divergent at the horizon while it is positive finite asymptotically. The flux in the Unruh state is always positive and divergent at the horizon. In the Israel-Hartle-Hawking state, the energy density depends on the angular motion of free fall, and fluxes vanish at the horizon and the spatial infinity. Finally, we discuss the role of the negative energy density near the horizon in the evaporating black hole.
