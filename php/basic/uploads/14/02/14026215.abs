Title: Instability of rotating black holes: large D analysis
Authors: Roberto Emparan and Ryotaku Suzuki and Kentaro Tanabe
Abstract: We study the stability of odd-dimensional rotating black holes with equal angular momenta by performing an expansion in the inverse of the number of dimensions D. Universality at large $D$ allows us to calculate analytically the complex frequency of quasinormal modes to next-to-leading order in the expansion. We identify the onset of non-axisymmetric, bar-mode instabilities at a specific finite rotation, and axisymmetric instabilities at larger rotation. The former occur at the threshold where the modes become superradiant, and before the ultraspinning regime is reached. Our results fully confirm the picture found in numerical studies, with very good quantitative agreement. We extend the analysis to the same class of black holes in Anti-deSitter space, and find the same qualitative features. We also discuss the appearance at high frequencies of the universal set of (stable) quasinormal modes.
