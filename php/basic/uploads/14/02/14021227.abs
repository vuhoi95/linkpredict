Abstract: In this paper we will illustrate how to constrain unavoidable K\"ahler corrections for ${\cal N}=1$ supergravity (SUGRA) inflation from the recent Planck data. We will show that the non-renormalizable K\"ahler operators will induce in general non-minimal kinetic term for the inflaton field, and two types of SUGRA corrections in the potential - the Hubble-induced mass ($c_{H}$), and the Hubble-induced A-term ($a_{H}$) correction. The entire SUGRA inflationary framework can now be constrained from (i) the speed of sound, $c_s$, and (ii) from the upper bound on the tensor to scalar ratio, $r_{\star}$. We will illustrate this by considering a heavy scalar degree of freedom at a scale, $M_s$, and a light inflationary field which is responsible for a slow-roll inflation. We will compute the corrections to the kinetic term and the potential for the light field explicitly. As an example, we will consider a visible sector inflationary model of inflation where inflation occurs at the point of inflection, which can match the density perturbations for the cosmic microwave background radiation, and also explain why the universe is filled with the Standard Model degrees of freedom. We will scan the parameter space of the non-renormalizable K\"ahler operators, which we find them to be order ${\cal O}(1)$, consistent with physical arguments. While the scale of heavy physics is found to be bounded by the tensor-to scalar ratio, and the speed of sound, $ {\cal O}(10^{11}\leq M_s\leq 10^{16}) $GeV, for $0.02\leq c_s\leq 1$ and $10^{-22}\leq r_\star \leq 0.12$.
