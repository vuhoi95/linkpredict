Title: N=2 supersymmetric radiation damping problem on a noncommutative plane
Authors: Everton M. C. Abreu and Albert C. R. Mendes and Wilson Oliveira
Abstract: It is well known that a direct Lagrangian description of radiation damping is still missing. In this paper a specific approach of this problem was used, which is the standard way to treat the radiation damping problem. A $N=2$ supersymmetric extension for the model describing the radiation damping on the noncommutative plane with electric and magnetic interactions was obtained. The entire supercharge algebra and the total Hamiltonian for the system were analyzed. Finally, noncommutativity features were introduced and its consequences were explored..
