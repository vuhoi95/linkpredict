Title: Symmetries of mesons after unbreaking of chiral symmetry and their  string interpretation
Authors: M. Denissenya and L. Ya. Glozman and C. B. Lang
Abstract: Using the chirally invariant overlap Dirac operator we remove its lowest-lying quasizero modes from the valence quark propagators and study evolution of isovector mesons with J=1. At the truncation level about 50 MeV SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R and U(1)_A symmetries get restored. However, we observe a degeneracy not only within the chiral and U(1)_A multiplets, but also a degeneracy of all possible chiral multiplets, i.e., the observed quantum levels have a symmetry larger than U(2)_L \times U(2)_R and their energy does not depend on the spin orientation of quarks and their parities. We offer a possible interpretation of these energy levels as the quantum levels of the dynamical QCD string. The structure of the radial J=1 spectrum is compatible with E =(n_r +1)\hbar\omega with \hbar\omega = 900 \pm 70 MeV.
