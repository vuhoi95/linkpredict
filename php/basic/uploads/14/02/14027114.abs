Title: Universe acceleration in modified gravities: $F(R)$ and $F(T)$ cases
Authors: Kazuharu Bamba and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: We review recent progress on cosmological issues and theoretical properties of modified gravity theories. In particular, we explicitly explore the conformal transformation, the Starobinsky inflation, and a unified scenario of inflation and late time acceleration in $F(R)$ gravity and $F(T)$ gravity (extended teleparallel gravity). Furthermore, we examine neutron stars and the hyperon problem in $F(R)$ gravity. Moreover, for loop quantum cosmology (LQC), the natures of finite-time future singularities in $F(T)$ gravity are presented. In addition, we investigate $F(T)$ gravity theories from the Kaluza-Klein (KK) and Randall-Sundrum (RS) theories.
