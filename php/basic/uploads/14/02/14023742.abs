Title: Geometrical Approximation to the AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: Miguel Angel Martin Contreras and Jose Maria Rolando Roldan
Abstract: In this paper an analysis of the geometrical construction of the AdS/CFT Correspondence is made. A geometrical definition of the configuration manifold and the boundary manifold in terms of the conformal compactification scheme is given. As a conclusion, it was obtained that the usual definition of the correspondence is strongly dependent of the unicity of the conformal class of metrics on the boundary. Finally, a summary of some of the geometrical issues of the correspondence is made, along with a possible way to avoid them.
