Title: Central Charge Extended Supersymmetric Structures for Fundamental  Fermions Around non-Abelian Vortices
Authors: K. Kleidis and V. K. Oikonomou
Abstract: Fermionic zero modes around non-abelian vortices are shown that they constitute two $N=2$, $d=1$ supersymmetric quantum mechanics algebras. These two algebras can be combined under certain circumstances to form a central charge extended $N=4$ supersymmetric quantum algebra. We thoroughly discuss the implications of the existence of supersymmetric quantum mechanics algebras, in the quantum Hilbert space of the fermionic zero modes.
