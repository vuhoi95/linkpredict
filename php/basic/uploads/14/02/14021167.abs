Title: Covariant Approaches to Superconformal Blocks
Authors: A. Liam Fitzpatrick and Jared Kaplan and Zuhair U. Khandker and Daliang Li and David Poland and David Simmons-Duffin
Abstract: We develop techniques for computing superconformal blocks in 4d superconformal field theories. First we study the super-Casimir differential equation, deriving simple new expressions for superconformal blocks for 4-point functions containing chiral operators in theories with N-extended supersymmetry. We also reproduce these results by extending the "shadow formalism" of Ferrara, Gatto, Grillo, and Parisi to supersymmetric theories, where superconformal blocks can be represented as superspace integrals of three-point functions multiplied by shadow three-point functions.
