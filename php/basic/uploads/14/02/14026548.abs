Title: How quantizable matter gravitates: a practitioner's guide
Authors: Frederic P. Schuller and Christof Witte
Abstract: We present the practical step-by-step procedure for constructing canonical gravitational dynamics and kinematics directly from any previously specified quantizable classical matter dynamics, and then illustrate the application of this recipe by way of two completely worked case studies. Following the same procedure, any phenomenological proposal for fundamental matter dynamics must be supplemented with a suitable gravity theory providing the coefficients and kinematical interpretation of the matter equations, before any of the two theories can be meaningfully compared to experimental data.
