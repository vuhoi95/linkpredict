Title: NS-branes, source corrected Bianchi identities, and more on backgrounds  with non-geometric fluxes
Authors: David Andriot and Andre Betz
Abstract: In the first half of the paper, we study in details NS-branes, including the NS5-brane, the Kaluza-Klein monopole and the exotic $5_2^2$- or Q-brane, together with Bianchi identities for NSNS (non)-geometric fluxes. Four-dimensional Bianchi identities are generalized to ten dimensions with non-constant fluxes, and get corrected by a source term in presence of an NS-brane. The latter allows them to reduce to the expected Poisson equation. Without sources, our Bianchi identities are also recovered by squaring a nilpotent $Spin(D,D) \times \mathbb{R}^+$ Dirac operator. Generalized Geometry allows us in addition to express the equations of motion explicitly in terms of fluxes. In the second half, we perform a general analysis of ten-dimensional geometric backgrounds with non-geometric fluxes, in the context of $\beta$-supergravity. We determine a well-defined class of such vacua, that are non-geometric in standard supergravity: they involve $\beta$-transforms, a manifest symmetry of $\beta$-supergravity with isometries. We show as well that these vacua belong to a geometric T-duality orbit.
