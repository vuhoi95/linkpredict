Title: Electric charge is a magnetic dipole when placed in a background  magnetic field
Authors: T. C. Adorno and D. M. Gitman and A. E. Shabad
Abstract: It is demonstrated, owing to the nonlinearity of QED, that a static charge placed in a strong magnetic field\ $B$\ is a magnetic dipole (besides remaining an electric monopole, as well). Its magnetic moment grows linearly with $B$ as long as the latter remains smaller than the characteristic value of $1.2\cdot 10^{13}\unit{G}$ but tends to a constant as $B$ exceeds that value. The force acting on a densely charged object by the dipole magnetic field of a neutron star is estimated.
