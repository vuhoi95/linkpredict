Title: D-brane on Poisson manifold and Generalized Geometry
Authors: T. Asakawa and H. Muraki and S. Watamura
Abstract: The properties of the D-brane fluctuations are investigated using the two types of deformation of the Dirac structure, based on the B-transformation and the beta-transformation, respectively. The former gives the standard gauge theory with 2-form field strength. The latter gives a non-standard gauge theory on the Poisson manifold with bivector field strength and the vector field as a gauge potential, where the gauge symmetry is a diffeomorphism generated by the Hamiltonian vector field. The map between the two gauge theories is also constructed with the help of Moser's Lemma and the Magnus expansion. We also investigate the relation to the gauge theory on the noncommutative D-branes.
