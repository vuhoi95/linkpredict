Title: More on the Abrikosov Strings with Non-Abelian Moduli
Authors: M. Shifman and Gianni Tallarita and A. Yung
Abstract: We continue explorations of deformed Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen (ANO) strings, with non-Abelian moduli on the world sheet. In a simple model with an extra field we find classically stable ANO and non-Abelian strings. The tension of the latter is a few percent lower than the tension of the ANO string. Then we calculate the interpolating field configuration. Once the kink mass $M_k$ and the difference of tensions $\Delta T$ are found we calculate the decay rate of the ANO string with a higher tension ("false vacuum") into the non-Abelian string with the lower tension ("genuine vacuum") through the "bubble" formation in the quasiclassical approximation.
