Title: On the next-to-leading holographic entanglement entropy in  $AdS_{3}/CFT_{2}$
Authors: Matteo Beccaria and Guido Macorini
Abstract: We reconsider the one-loop correction to the holographic entanglement entropy in $AdS_{3}/CFT_{2}$ by analysing the contributions due to a bulk higher spin $s$ current or a scalar field with scaling dimension $\Delta$. We consider the two-interval case and work perturbatively in their small cross ratio $x$. We provide various results for the entanglement entropy due to the so-called CDW elements of the associated Schottky uniformization group. In particular, in the higher spin current case, we obtain a closed formula for all the contributions of the form $\mathcal O(x^{2s+p})$ up to $\mathcal O(x^{4s})$, where 2-CDW elements are relevant. In the scalar field case, we calculate the similar contributions for generic values of $\Delta$. The terms up to $\mathcal O(x^{2\Delta+5})$ are compared with an explicit CFT calculation with full agreement. The analysis exploits various simplifications which are valid in the strict entanglement limit of the R\'enyi entropy. This allows to identify in a clean way the relevant operators that provide the gravity result. The 2-CDW contributions are also analysed and a closed formula for the leading $\mathcal O(x^{4s})$ coefficient is presented as a function of the generic spin $s$. As a specific application, we combine the CDW and 2-CDW calculations and present the complete $\mathcal O(x^{4s+2})$ entanglement entropy for a spin $s=2,3,4$ higher spin current.
