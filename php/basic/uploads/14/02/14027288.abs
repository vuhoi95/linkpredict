Title: Gravitomagnetic currents in the inflationary universe from WIMT
Authors: Jesús Martín Romero and Mauricio Bellini
Abstract: Using the Weitzenb\"ock representation of a Riemann-flat 5D spacetime, we study the possible existence of primordial gravito-magnetic currents from Gravito-electromagnetic Inflation (GEMI). We found that these currents decrease exponentially in the Weitzenb\"ock representation, but they are null in a Levi-Civita representation because we are dealing with a 5D Riemann-flat spacetime without structure or torsion.
