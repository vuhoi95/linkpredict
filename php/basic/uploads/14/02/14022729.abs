Title: DGP with bubble of nothing
Authors: Keisuke Izumi and Tetsuya Shiromizu
Abstract: We construct exact solutions with the bubble of nothing in the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati braneworld model. The configuration with a single brane can be constructed, unlike in the Randall-Sundrum braneworld model. The geometry on the single brane looks like the Einstein-Rosen bridge. We also discuss the junction of multibranes. Surprisingly, even without any artificial matter fields on the branes such as three-dimensional tension of the codimension-two objects, two branes can be connected in certain configurations. We investigate solutions of multibranes too. The presence of solutions may indicate the semiclassical instability of the models.
