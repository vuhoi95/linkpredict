Title: On the Entanglement of Multiple CFTs via Rotating Black Hole Interior
Authors: Norihiro Iizuka and Noriaki Ogawa
Abstract: We study the minimal surfaces between two of the multiple boundaries of 3d maximally extended rotating eternal black hole. Via AdS/CFT, this corresponds to investigating the behavior of entanglements of the boundary CFT with multiple sectors. Non-trivial time evolutions of such entanglements detect the geometry inside the horizon, and behave differently depending on the choice of the two boundaries.
