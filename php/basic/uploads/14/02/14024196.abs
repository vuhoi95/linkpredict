Title: Spontaneous Breaking of Scale Invariance in a d=3 U(N) Model with  Chern-Simons Gauge Field
Authors: William A. Bardeen and Moshe Moshe
Abstract: We study spontaneous breaking of scale invariance in the large N limit of three dimensional $U(N)_\kappa$ Chern-Simons theories coupled to a scalar field in the fundamental representation. When a $\lambda_6(\phi^\dagger\cdot\phi)^3$ self interaction term is added to the action we find a massive phase at a certain critical value for a combination of the $\lambda_6$ and 't Hooft's $\lambda=N/\kappa$ couplings. This model attracted recent attention since at finite $\kappa$ it contains a singlet sector which is conjectured to be dual to Vasiliev's higher spin gravity on $AdS_4$. Our paper concentrates on the massive phase of the 3d boundary theory. We discuss the advantage of introducing masses in the boundary theory through spontaneous breaking of scale invariance.
