Title: Gravitational Collapse, Chaos in CFT Correlators and the Information  Paradox
Authors: Arya Farahi and Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas
Abstract: We consider gravitational collapse of a massless scalar field in asymptotically Anti de Sitter spacetime. Following the AdS/CFT dictionary we further study correlations in the field theory side by way of the Klein-Gordon equation of a probe scalar field in the collapsing background. We present evidence that in a certain regime the probe scalar field behaves chaotically, thus supporting Hawking's argument in the black hole information paradox proposing that although the information can be retrieved in principle, deterministic chaos impairs, in practice, the process of unitary extraction of information from a black hole. We emphasize that quantum chaos will change this picture.
