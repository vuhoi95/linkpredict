Title: Non-Abelian Gauge Symmetry and the Higgs Mechanism in F-theory
Authors: Antonella Grassi and James Halverson and Julius L. Shaneson
Abstract: Singular fiber resolution does not describe the spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry in F-theory, as the corresponding branch of the moduli space does not exist in the theory. Accordingly, even non-abelian gauge theories have not been fully understood in global F-theory compactifications. We present a systematic discussion of using singularity deformation, which does describe the spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry in F-theory, to study non-abelian gauge symmetry. Since this branch of the moduli space also exists in the defining M-theory compactification, it provides the only known description of gauge theory states which exists in both pictures; they are string junctions in F-theory. We discuss how global deformations give rise to local deformations, and also give examples where local deformation can be utilized even in models where a global deformation does not exist. Utilizing deformations, we study a number of new examples, including non-perturbative descriptions of $SU(3)$ and $SU(2)$ gauge theories on seven-branes which do not admit a weakly coupled type IIb description. It may be of phenomenological interest that these non-perturbative descriptions do not exist for higher rank $SU(N)$ theories.
