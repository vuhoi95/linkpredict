Title: Baryon and chiral symmetry breaking
Authors: A. Gorsky and A. Krikun
Abstract: We briefly review the generalized Skyrmion model for the baryon recently suggested by us. It takes into account the tower of vector and axial mesons as well as the chiral symmetry breaking. The generalized Skyrmion model provides the qualitative explanation of the Ioffe's formula for the baryon mass.
