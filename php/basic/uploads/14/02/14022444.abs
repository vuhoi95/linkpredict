Title: A Complete Spectral Analysis of the Jackiw-Rebbi Model, Including its  Zero Mode
Authors: Farid Charmchi and Siamak S. Gousheh
Abstract: In this paper we present a complete and exact spectral analysis of the $(1+1)$-dimensional model that Jackiw and Rebbi considered to show that the half-integral fermion numbers are possible due to the presence of an isolated self charge conjugate zero mode. The model possesses the charge and particle conjugation symmetries. These symmetries mandate the reflection symmetry of the spectrum about the line $E=0$. We obtain the bound state energies and wave functions of the fermion in this model using two different methods, analytically and exactly, for every arbitrary choice of the parameters of the kink, i.e. its value at spatial infinity ($\theta_0$) and its scale of variations ($\mu$). Then, we plot the bound state energies of the fermion as a function of $\theta_0$. This graph enables us to consider a process of building up the kink from the trivial vacuum. We can then determine the origin and evolution of the bound state energy levels during this process. We see that the model has a dynamical mass generation process at the first quantized level and the zero-energy fermionic mode responsible for the fractional fermion number, is always present during the construction of the kink and its origin is very peculiar, indeed. We also observe that, as expected, none of the energy levels crosses each other. Moreover, we obtain analytically the continuum scattering wave functions of the fermion and then calculate the phase shifts of these wave functions. Using the information contained in the graphs of the phase shifts and the bound states, we show that our phase shifts are consistent with the weak and strong forms of the Levinson theorem. Finally, using the weak form of the Levinson theorem, we confirm that the number of the zero-energy fermionic modes is exactly one.
