Title: Rational Top and its Classical R-matrix
Authors: G. Aminov and S. Arthamonov and A. Smirnov and A. Zotov
Abstract: We construct a rational integrable system (the rational top) on a coadjoint orbit of ${\rm SL}_N$ Lie group. It is described by the Lax operator with spectral parameter and classical non-dynamical skew-symmetric $r$-matrix. In the case of the orbit of minimal dimension the model is gauge equivalent to the rational Calogero-Moser (CM) system. To obtain the results we represent the Lax operator of the CM model in two different factorized forms -- without spectral parameter (related to spinless case) and another one with the spectral parameter. The latter gives rise to the rational top while the first one is related to generalized Cremmer-Gervais $r$-matrices. The gauge transformation relating the rational top and CM model provides a classical rational version of the IRF-Vertex correspondence. From a geometrical point of view it describes the modification of ${\rm SL}(N,\mathbb C)$-bundles over degenerated elliptic curve. In view of Symplectic Hecke Correspondence the rational top is related to the rational spin CM model. Possible applications and generalizations of the suggested construction are discussed. In particular, the obtained $r$-matrix defines a class of KZB equations.
