Title: Lobotomy of Flux Compactifications
Authors: Giuseppe Dibitetto and Adolfo Guarino and Diederik Roest
Abstract: We provide the dictionary between four-dimensional gauged supergravity and type II compactifications on $\mathbb{T}^6$ with metric and gauge fluxes in the absence of supersymmetry breaking sources, such as branes and orientifold planes. Secondly, we prove that there is a unique isotropic compactification allowing for critical points. It corresponds to a type IIA background given by a product of two 3-tori with SO(3) twists and results in a unique theory (gauging) with a non-semisimple gauge algebra. Besides the known four AdS solutions surviving the orientifold projection to $\mathcal{N}=4$ induced by O6-planes, this theory contains a novel AdS solution that requires non-trivial orientifold-odd fluxes, hence being a genuine critical point of the $\mathcal{N}=8$ theory.
