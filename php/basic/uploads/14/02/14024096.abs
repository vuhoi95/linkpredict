Title: Hypercharge flux in F-theory and the stable Sen limit
Authors: Andreas P. Braun and Andres Collinucci and Roberto Valandro
Abstract: IIB compactifications enjoy the possibility to break GUT groups via fluxes without giving mass to the hypercharge gauge field. Although this important advantage has greatly motivated F-theory constructions, no such fluxes have been constructed directly in terms of the M-theory $G_4$-form. In this note, we give a general prescription for constructing hypercharge G-fluxes. By using a stable version of Sen's weak coupling limit, we verify their connection with IIB fluxes. We illustrate the lift of fluxes in a number of examples, including a compact ${\rm SU}(5) \times {\rm U}(1)$ model with explicit realization of doublet-triplet splitting. Finally, we prove an equivalence conjectured in an earlier work as a by-product.
