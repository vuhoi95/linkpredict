Title: Weyl symmetric Abelian Decomposition and Monopole Condensation in SU(3)  QCD
Authors: Y. M. Cho and Kyoungtae Kimm
Abstract: We generalize the previous result of SU(2) QCD and demonstrate the monopole condensation in SU(3) QCD. We present the gauge independent and Weyl symmetric Abelian (Cho-Duan-Ge) decomposition of the SU(3) QCD, and obtain an infra-red finite and gauge invariant integral expression of the one-loop effective action. Integrating it gauge invariantly imposing the color reflection invariance (``the C-projection'') we show that the effective potential generates the stable monopole condensation which generates the mass gap.
