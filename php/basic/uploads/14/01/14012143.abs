Title: Drinfeld J presentation of Twisted Yangians
Authors: Samuel Belliard and Vidas Regelskis
Abstract: We present a quantization of the Lie ideal structure for twisted half-loop algebras of finite dimensional simple complex Lie algebras. We obtain algebra closure relations of twisted Yangians in Drinfeld~J presentation for all symmetric pairs of simple Lie algebras and for simple twisted even half-loop Lie algebras. We also give the explicit form of twisted Yangians in Drinfeld J presentation for the sl(3) Lie algebra.
