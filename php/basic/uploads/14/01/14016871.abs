Title: Stability analysis of black holes in massive gravity: a unified  treatment
Authors: Eugeny Babichev and Alessandro Fabbri
Abstract: We consider the analytic solutions of massive (bi)gravity which can be written in a simple form using advanced Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates. We analyse the stability of these solutions against radial perturbations. First we recover the previously obtained result on the instability of the bidiagonal bi-Schwarzschild solutions. In the non-bidiagonal case (which contains, in particular, the Schwarzschild solution with Minkowski fiducial metric) we show that generically there are physical spherically symmetric perturbations, but no unstable modes.
