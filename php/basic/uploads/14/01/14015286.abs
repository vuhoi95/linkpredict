Title: If the spin of gravitational field depends on spacetime dimension
Authors: K. Kaviani and F. Atyabi
Abstract: In this manuscript a different perspective on gravitational field has been proposed, suggesting different features of gravity depending on spacetime dimension, which can explain preventing the formation of singularity inside blackholes and also suggest interpreting spin-1 fields emerged in theories with dimensional reduction mechanism, as different aspects of gravitational field.
