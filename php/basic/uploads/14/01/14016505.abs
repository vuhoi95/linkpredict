Title: Holographic entanglement entropy in insulator/superconductor transition  with Born-Infeld electrodynamics
Authors: Weiping Yao and Jiliang Jing
Abstract: We investigate the holographic entanglement entropy in the insulator/superconductor phase transition for the Born-Infeld electrodynamics with full backreaction in five-dimensional AdS soliton spacetime. We note that the holographic entanglement entropy is a good probe to study the properties of the phase transition, and the Born-Infeld factor $b$ has no effect on the critical chemical potential $\mu_c$. We find that both in the half space and the belt one, the non-monotonic behavior of the entanglement entropy versus the chemical potential is a general property, and the entanglement entropy increases with the increase of the Born-Infeld factor in the superconductor phase. Particularly, there exists confinement/deconfinement phase transition in the strip geometry and the critical width $\ell_c$ is dependent of the Born-Infeld parameter.
