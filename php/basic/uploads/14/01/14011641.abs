Title: Comments on the role of field redefinition on renormalisation of  $N=\frac{1}{2}$ supersymmetric pure gauge theory
Authors: A. F. Kord and M. Haddadi Moghaddam
Abstract: We study one loop corrections to $N=\frac{1}{2}$ supersymmetric $SU(N)\times U(1)$ pure gauge theory. We calculate divergent contributions of the 1PI graphs contain the non-anti-commutative parameter $C$ up to one loop corrections. We find the disagreement between component formalism and superspace formalism is because of the field redefinition in component case. We modify gaugino field redefinition and lagrangian. We show extra terms of lagrangian have been generated by $\lambda$ redefinition and are necessary for the renormalisation of the theory. Finally we prove $N = \frac{1}{2}$ supersymmetric gauge theory is renormalisable up one loop corrections using standard method of renormalisation
