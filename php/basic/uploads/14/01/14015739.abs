Title: LSZ reduction formula in many-dimensional theory with space-space  noncommutativity
Authors: K. V. Antipin and M. N. Mnatsakanova and Yu. S. Vernov
Abstract: An analogue of the Lehmann-Symanzik-Zimmermann reduction formula is obtained for the case of noncommutative space-space theory. Some consequences of the reduction formula and Haag's theorem are discussed.
