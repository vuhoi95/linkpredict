Title: Fermion zero modes in a chromomagnetic vortex lattice
Authors: M. N. Chernodub and Tigran Kalaydzhyan and Jos Van Doorsselaere and Henri Verschelde
Abstract: We prove the existence of zero modes of massless quarks in a background of spaghetti vacuum of chromomagnetic vortices in QCD. We find a general solution for the zero modes and show that the modes can be localized at pairs of vortices.
