Title: Inflationary Baryogenesis in a Model with Gauged Baryon Number
Authors: Neil D. Barrie and Archil Kobakhidze
Abstract: We argue that inflationary dynamics may support a scenario where significant matter-antimatter asymmetry is generated from initially small-scale quantum fluctuations that are subsequently stretched out over large scales. This scenario can be realised in extensions of the Standard Model with an extra gauge symmetry having mixed anomalies with the electroweak gauge symmetry. Inflationary baryogenesis in a model with gauged baryon number is considered in detail.
