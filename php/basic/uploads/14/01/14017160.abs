Title: Causality and momentum conservation from relative locality
Authors: Giovanni Amelino-Camelia and Stefano Bianco and Francesco Brighenti and Riccardo Junior Buonocore
Abstract: Theories with a curved momentum space, which became recently of interest in the quantum-gravity literature, can in general violate many apparently robust aspects of our current description of the laws of physics, including relativistic invariance, locality, causality and global momentum conservation. We here explore some aspects of the particularly severe pathologies arising in generic theories with curved momentum space for what concerns causality and momentum conservation. However, we also report results suggesting that when momentum space is maximally symmetric, and the theory is formulated (DSR-)relativistically, with the associated relativity of spacetime locality, momentum is globally conserved and there is no violation of causality.
