Abstract: The gravity dual geometry of the plane wave matrix model is given by the bubbling geometry in the type IIA supergravity, which is described by an axially symmetric electrostatic system. We study a quarter BPS sector of the plane wave matrix model in terms of the localization method and show that this sector can be mapped to a one-dimensional interacting Fermi gas system. We find that the mean-field density of the Fermi gas can be identified with the charge density in the electrostatic system in the gravity side. We also find that the scaling limits in which the dual geometry reduces to the D2-brane or NS5-brane geometry are given as the free limit or the strongly coupled limit of the Fermi gas system, respectively. We reproduce the radii of $S^5$'s in these geometries by solving the Fermi gas model in the corresponding limits.
