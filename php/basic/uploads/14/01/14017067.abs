Title: Two-Dimensional Sigma Models Related to Non-Abelian Strings in  Super-Yang-Mills
Authors: M. Shifman and A. Yung
Abstract: We review diverse two-dimensional models emerging on the world sheet of non-Abelian strings in the low-energy limit. Non-Abelian strings are supported in a class of four-dimensional bulk theories with or without supersymmetry. In supersymmetric bulk theories we are mostly interested in BPS-saturated strings. Some of these two-dimensional models, in particular, heterotic models, were scarcely studied in the past, if at all. Our main emphasis is on the heterotic N=(0,2) models. We describe their large-N solution. We briefly comment on N=(0,1) models although so far they are not obtained on the the world sheet of non-Abelian strings.
