Title: (2+1)-dimensional supergravity invariant under the AdS-Lorentz  superalgebra
Authors: O. Fierro and F. Izaurieta and P. Salgado and O. Valdivia
Abstract: It is shown that the semi-simple extended Poincare superalgebra can be obtained from the orthosymplectic algebra OSp(N,4) (Anti-de-Sitter superalgebra) using the S-expansion procedure. The S-expansion mechanism is used to obtain the (i) Casimir operators for the semi-simple extended Poincare superalgebra and (ii) the corresponding invariant tensors which allows us the construction of a (2+1)-dimensional Lagrangian for Chern-Simons supergravity.
