Title: Flux Compactifications on $(S_2)^N$
Authors: Adam R. Brown and Alex Dahlen and Ali Masoumi
Abstract: We investigate a simple extra-dimensional model and its four-dimensional vacua. This model has a two-form flux and a positive cosmological constant, and the extra dimensions are compactified as the product of $N$ two-spheres. The theory is an interesting laboratory because it is at once simple enough to be soluble but rich enough to exhibit many features not present in previous model landscapes.
