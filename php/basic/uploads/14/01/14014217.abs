Title: Quantum Influence of Topological Defects in GÃ¶del-type Space-times
Authors: Josevi Carvalho and Alexandre M. de M. Carvalho and Claudio Furtado
Abstract: In this contribution, some solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation in the G\"odel-type metrics with an embedded cosmic string are considered. The quantum dynamics of a scalar particle in three spaces whose metric is described by different classes of G\"odel solution, with a cosmic string passing through the spaces, is found. The energy levels and eigenfunctions of the Klein-Gordon operator are obtained. We show that these eigenvalues and eigenfunctions depend on the parameter characterizing the presence of a cosmic string in the space-time. We note that the presence of topological defects breaks the degeneracy of energy levels.
