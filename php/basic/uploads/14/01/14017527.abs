Title: VSR symmetries in the DKP algebra: the interplay between Dirac and Elko  spinor fields
Authors: R. T. Cavalcanti and J. M. Hoff da Silva and Roldao da Rocha
Abstract: VSR symmetries are here naturally incorporated in the DKP algebra on the spin-0 and the spin-1 DKP sectors. We show that the Elko (dark) spinor fields structure plays an essential role on accomplishing this aim, unravelling hidden symmetries on the bosonic DKP fields under the action of discrete symmetries.
