Title: Noncommutative ${\cal N}=2$ Chern-Simons-matter model
Authors: L. Ibiapina Bevilaqua and A. C. Lehum
Abstract: In this work we study the three-dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric Chern-Simons-matter model in a noncommutative space-time. We construct the action of the noncommutative $U(N)$ non-Abelian model in terms of explicit ${\cal N}=2$ supervariables by dimensionally reducing a four-dimensional ${\cal N}=1$ supermultiplet. We also obtain the on-shell ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric model writing it in terms of ${\cal N}=1$ superfields. In the noncommutative Abelian case, we show that linear UV divergences are cancelled in Feynman diagrams and logarithmic divergences are absent up to one-loop order, stating that our model is free of UV/IR mixing.
