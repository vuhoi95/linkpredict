Abstract: We consider the semiclassical Einstein equations (SEE) in the presence of a quantum scalar field with self-interaction $\lambda\phi^4$. Working in the Hartree truncation of the two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective action, we compute the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor of the scalar field, which act as a source of the SEE. We obtain the renormalized SEE by implementing a consistent renormalization procedure. We apply our results to find self-consistent de Sitter solutions to the SEE in situations with or without spontaneous breaking of the $Z_2$-symmetry.
