Title: Perturbative Description of the Fermionic Projector: Normalization,  Causality and Furry's Theorem
Authors: Felix Finster and JÃ¼rgen Tolksdorf
Abstract: The causal perturbation expansion of the fermionic projector is performed with a contour integral method. Different normalization conditions are analyzed. It is shown that the corresponding light-cone expansions are causal in the sense that they only involve bounded line integrals. For the resulting loop diagrams we prove a generalized Furry theorem.
