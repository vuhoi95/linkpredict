Abstract: A twisted ${\mathcal C}^\star $- algebra of the extended (noncommutative) Heisenberg-Weyl group has been constructed which takes into account the Uncertainty Principle for coordinates in the Planck length regime. This general construction is then used to generate an appropriate Hilbert space and observables for the noncommutative theory which, when applied to the Bianchi I Cosmology, leads to a new set of equations that describe the quantum evolution of the universe. We find that this formulation matches theories based on a reticular Heisenberg-Weyl algebra in the bouncing and expanding regions of a collapsing Bianchi universe. There is, however, an additional effect introduced by the dynamics generated by the noncommutativity. This is an oscillation in the spectrum of the volume operator of the universe, within the bouncing region of the commutative theories. We show that this effect is generic and produced by the noncommutative momentum exchange between the degrees of freedom in the cosmology. We give asymptotic and numerical solutions which show the above mentioned effects of the noncommutativity.
