Title: Interpreting canonical tensor model in minisuperspace
Authors: Naoki Sasakura and Yuki Sato
Abstract: Canonical tensor model is a theory of dynamical fuzzy spaces in arbitrary space-time dimensions. Examining its simplest case, we find a connection to a minisuperspace model of general relativity in arbitrary dimensions. This is a first step in interpreting variables in canonical tensor model based on the known language of general relativity.
