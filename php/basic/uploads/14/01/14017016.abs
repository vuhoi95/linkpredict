Title: Partition Functions in Even Dimensional AdS via Quasinormal Mode Methods
Authors: Cynthia Keeler and Gim Seng Ng
Abstract: In this note, we calculate the one-loop determinant for a massive scalar (with conformal dimension $\Delta$) in even-dimensional AdS$_{d+1}$ space, using the quasinormal mode method developed in arXiv:0908.2657 by Denef, Hartnoll, and Sachdev. Working first in two dimensions on the related Euclidean hyperbolic plane $H_2$, we find a series of zero modes for negative real values of $\Delta$ whose presence indicates a series of poles in the one-loop partition function $Z(\Delta)$ in the $\Delta$ complex plane; these poles contribute temperature-independent terms to the thermal AdS partition function computed in arXiv:0908.2657. Our results match those in a series of papers by Camporesi and Higuchi, as well as Gopakumar et.al. in arXiv:1103.3627 and Banerjee et.al. in arXiv:1005.3044. We additionally examine the meaning of these zero modes, finding that they Wick-rotate to quasinormal modes of the AdS$_2$ black hole. They are also interpretable as matrix elements of the discrete series representations of $SO(2,1)$ in the space of smooth functions on $S^1$. We generalize our results to general even dimensional AdS$_{2n}$, again finding a series of zero modes which are related to discrete series representations of $SO(2n,1)$, the motion group of $H_{2n}$.
