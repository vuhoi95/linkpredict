Title: Multi-particle Processes and Tamed Ultraviolet Divergences
Authors: Victor Kim and Grigorii Pivovarov
Abstract: New approach to computing the amplitudes of multi-particle processes in renormalizable quantum field theories is presented. Its major feature is a separation of the renormalization from the computation. Within the suggested approach new computational rules are formulated. According to the new rules, the amplitudes under computation are expressed as a sum of effective Feynman amplitudes whose vertexes are the complete amplitudes of the processes involving not more than four particles, and the lines are the complete two-point functions. The new rules include prescriptions for computing the combinatorial factors by each amplitude. It is demonstrated that due to these prescriptions the combinatorial factors by the amplitudes that are divergent in the ultraviolet in four space-time dimensions vanish. Because of this, the computations within the new approach do not involve the ultraviolet renormalization. It is observed that the combinatorics of the new rules determines the dimension of the space-time.
