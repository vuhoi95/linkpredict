Authors: D. V. Artamonov and V. A. Golubeva
Abstract: The key role in the derivation of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations in the $WZW$-theory is played by the energy-momentum tensor, that is constructed from a central Casimir element of the second order in a universal enveloping algebra of a corresponding Lie algebra. In the paper a possibility of construction of analogs of Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations using higher order central elements is investigated. The Gelfand elements of the third order for a simple Lie algebra of series $A$ and Capelli elements of the fourth order for the a simple Lie algebra of series $B$, $D$ are considered. In the first case the construction is not possible a the second case the desired equation is derived.
