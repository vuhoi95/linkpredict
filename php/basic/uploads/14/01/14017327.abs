Title: The Higgs Mass and the Stueckelberg Mechanism in Supersymmetry
Authors: Pavel Fileviez Perez and Sogee Spinner
Abstract: We investigate a class of theories where the mass of the lightest Higgs boson of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) can be larger than the Z gauge boson mass at tree level. In this context the MSSM fields feel a new force, whose corresponding gauge boson attains its mass through the Stueckelberg mechanism. We show how one can achieve a Higgs mass around 126 GeV without assuming a heavy stop spectrum or a large stop trilinear term. The application of this class of models to the conservation of R-parity is also discussed.
