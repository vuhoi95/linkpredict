Title: Wormholes and Entanglement
Authors: John C. Baez and Jamie Vicary
Abstract: Maldacena and Susskind have proposed a correspondence between wormholes and entanglement, dubbed ER=EPR. We study this in the context of 3d topological quantum field theory, where we show that the formation of a wormhole is the same process as creating a particle-antiparticle pair. A key feature of the ER=EPR proposal is that certain apparently entangled degrees of freedom turn out to be the same. We name this phenomenon "fake entanglement", and show how it arises in our topological quantum field theory model.
