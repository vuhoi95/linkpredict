Title: Global aspects of double geometry
Authors: David S. Berman and Martin Cederwall and Malcolm J. Perry
Abstract: We consider the concept of a generalised manifold in the O(d,d) setting, i.e., in double geometry. The conjecture by Hohm and Zwiebach for the form of finite generalised diffeomorphisms is shown to hold. Transition functions on overlaps are defined. Triple overlaps are trivial concerning their action on coordinates, but non-trivial on fields, including the generalised metric. A generalised manifold is an ordinary manifold, but the generalised metric on the manifold carries a gerbe structure. We show how the abelian behaviour of the gerbe is embedded in the non-abelian T-duality group. We also comment on possibilities and difficulties in the U-duality setting.
