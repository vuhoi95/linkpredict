Title: Light-cone gravity in AdS$_{4}$
Authors: Y. S. Akshay and Sudarshan Ananth and Mahendra Mali
Abstract: We obtain a closed form expression for the Action describing pure gravity, in light-cone gauge, in a four-dimensional Anti de Sitter background. We perform a perturbative expansion of this closed form result to extract the cubic interaction vertex in this gauge.
