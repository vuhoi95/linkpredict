Title: The Abelian Higgs model and a minimal length in an un-particle scenario
Authors: Patricio Gaete and Euro Spallucci
Abstract: We consider both the Abelian Higgs model and the impact of a minimal length in the un-particle sector. It is shown that even if the Higgs field takes a non-vanishing v.e.v., gauge interaction keeps its long range character leading to an effective gauge symmetry restoration. The effect of a quantum gravity induced minimal length on a physical observable is then estimated by using a physically-based alternative to the usual Wilson loop approach. Interestingly, we obtain an ultraviolet finite interaction energy described by a confluent hyper-geometric function, which shows a remarkable richness of behavior.
