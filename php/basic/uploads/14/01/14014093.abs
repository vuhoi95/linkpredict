Title: Comment on `Critical scalar field collapse in AdS$_3$: an analytical  approach'
Authors: Gerard Clement and Alessandro Fabbri
Abstract: We comment on the derivation of an analytical solution presented in arXiv:1309.1629, show that it belongs to a family of separable solutions previously constructed in arXiv:gr-qc/0109002, and question its relevance to critical collapse.
