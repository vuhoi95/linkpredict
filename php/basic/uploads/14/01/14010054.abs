Title: Eguchi-Kawai reduction with one flavor of adjoint Moebius fermion
Authors: William Cunningham and Joel Giedt
Abstract: We study the single site lattice gauge theory of SU(N) coupled to one Dirac flavor of fermion in the adjoint representation. We utilize M\"obius fermions for this study, and accelerate the calculation with graphics processing units (GPUs). Our Monte Carlo simulations indicate that for sufficiently large inverse 't Hooft coupling b = 1/g^2 N, and for N \leq 10 the distribution of traced Polyakov loops has "fingers" that extend from the origin. However, in the massless case the distribution of eigenvalues of the untraced Polyakov loop becomes uniform at large N, indicating preservation of center symmetry in the thermodynamic limit. By contrast, for a large mass and large b, the distribution is highly nonuniform in the same limit, indicating spontaneous center symmetry breaking. These conclusions are confirmed by comparing to the quenched case, as well as by examining another observable based on the average value of the modulus of the traced Polyakov loop. The result of this investigation is that with massless adjoint fermions center symmetry is stabilized and the Eguchi-Kawai reduction should be successful; this is in agreement with most other studies.
