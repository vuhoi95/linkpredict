Title: Modification of phase structure of black D6 branes in a canonical  ensemble and its origin
Authors: J. X. Lu and J. Ouyang and Shibaji Roy
Abstract: It is well known that charged black $Dp$ branes of type II string theory share a universal phase structure of van der Waals$-$Maxwell liquid-gas type except $D5$ and $D6$ branes. Interestingly, the phase structure of $D5$ and $D6$ branes can be changed to the universal form with the inclusion of particular delocalized charged lower-dimensional branes. For $D5$ branes one needs to introduce delocalized $D1$ branes, and for $D6$ branes, one needs to introduce delocalized $D0$ branes to obtain the universal structure. In a previous paper [J. High Energy Phys. {\bf 04} (2013) 100] Lu with Wei study the phase structure of black $D6$ branes with the introduction of delocalized $D0$ branes in a special case when their charges are equal and the dilaton charge vanishes. In this paper, we look at the phase structure of the black $D6/D0$ system with the generic values of the parameters, which makes the analysis more involved but the structure more rich. We also provide reasons why the respective modifications of the phase structures to the universal form for the black $D5$ and $D6$ branes occur when specific delocalized lower-dimensional branes are introduced.
