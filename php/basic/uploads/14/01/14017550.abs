Title: Stable Exact Cosmological Solutions in Induced Gravity Models
Authors: Ekaterina O. Pozdeeva and Sergey Yu. Vernov
Abstract: We study dynamics of induced gravity cosmological models with sixth degree potential, that have found using the superpotential method. The important property of these models are existence of exact cosmological solutions that tend to fixed points. The stability of these cosmological solutions have been obtained. In particular, we find conditions under which solutions with a non-monotonic Hubble parameter that tend to a fixed point are attractors.
