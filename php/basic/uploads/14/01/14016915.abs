Title: Spin chains and classical strings in rotating Rindler-AdS space
Authors: Shou-Huang Dai and Shogo Kuwakino and Wen-Yu Wen
Abstract: In this paper, we study the spin chain and string excitation in the rotating Rindler-$AdS_3$ proposed in [12]. We obtain a one-parameter deformed $SL(2)$ spin chain at the fast spin limit. Two-spin GKP-like solutions are studied at short and long string limits. General ansatz for the giant magnons and the spiky strings are analyzed in detail for various $\beta$. At last, we explore its counterpart in analytic continuation and pp-wave limit.
