Title: Selfacceleration with Quasidilaton
Authors: Gregory Gabadadze and Rampei Kimura and David Pirtskhalava
Abstract: Quasidilaton massive gravity is an extension of massive General Relativity to a theory with additional scale invariance and approximate internal Galilean symmetry. The theory has a novel self-accelerated solution with the metric indistinguishable (in the decoupling limit) from the de Sitter space, its curvature set by the graviton mass. The spectra of tensor, vector, and scalar perturbations on this solution contain neither ghosts, nor gradient instabilities or superluminal modes, for a range of the parameter space. This represents an example of a self-accelerated solution with viable perturbations, attainable within a low energy effective field theory.
