Title: A holographic superconductor model in a spatially anisotropic background
Authors: Jun-ichirou Koga and Kengo Maeda and Kentaro Tomoda
Abstract: We investigate an anisotropic model of superconductors in the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory with a charged scalar field. It is found that the critical temperature decreases as the anisotropy becomes large. We then estimate the energy gap of the superconductor, and find that the ratio of the energy gap to the critical temperature increases as the anisotropy increases and so it is larger than that in the isotropic case. We also find that peudogap appears due to the anisotropy.
