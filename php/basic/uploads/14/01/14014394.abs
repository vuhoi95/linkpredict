Title: On the 2D zero modes' algebra of the SU(n) WZNW model
Authors: Ludmil Hadjiivanov and Paolo Furlan
Abstract: A quantum group covariant extension of the chiral parts of the Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model on a compact Lie group G gives rise to two matrix algebras with non-commutative entries. These are generated by "chiral zero modes" which combine in the 2D model into "Q-operators" which encode information about the internal symmetry and the fusion ring. We review earlier results about the SU(n) WZNW Q-algebra and its Fock representation for n=2 and display the first steps towards their generalization to higher n.
