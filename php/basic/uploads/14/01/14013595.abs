Title: Holography of Wrapped M5-branes and Chern-Simons theory
Authors: Dongmin Gang and Nakwoo Kim and Sangmin Lee
Abstract: We study three-dimensional superconformal field theories on wrapped M5-branes. Applying the gauge/gravity duality and the recently proposed 3d-3d relation, we deduce quantitative predictions for the perturbative free energy of a Chern-Simons theory on hyperbolic 3-space. Remarkably, the perturbative expansion is expected to terminate at two-loops in the large N limit. We check the correspondence numerically in a number of examples, and confirm the N^3 scaling with precise coefficients.
