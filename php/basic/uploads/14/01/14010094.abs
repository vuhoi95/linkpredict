Title: The Scale-invariant Power Spectrum of Primordial Curvature Perturbation  in CSTB Cosmos
Authors: Changhong Li and Yeuk-Kwan E. Cheung
Abstract: We investigate the spectrum of cosmological perturbations in a bounce cosmos modeled by a scalar field coupled to the string tachyon field (CSTB cosmos). By explicit computation of its primordial spectral index we show the power spectrum of curvature perturbations, generated during the tachyon matter dominated contraction phase, to be nearly scale invariant. We propose a unified space of parameters for a systematic study of inflationary/bouncing cosmologies. We find that CSTB cosmos is dual--in Wands's sense--to the slow-roll inflation model as can be easily seen from this unified parameter space. Guaranteed by the dynamical attractor behavior of CSTB Cosmos, this scale invariance is free of the fine-tuning problem, in contrast to the slow-roll inflation model.
