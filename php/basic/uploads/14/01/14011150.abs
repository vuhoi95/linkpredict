Title: Multi-indexed Extensions of Soliton Potential and Extended Integer  Solitons of KdV Equation
Authors: Choon-Lin Ho and Jen-Chi Lee
Abstract: We calculate infinite set of initial profiles of higher integer KdV solitons, which are both exactly solvable for the Schrodinger equation and for the Gel'fand-Levitan-Marchenko equation in the inverse scattering transform method of KdV equation. The calculation of these higher integer soliton solutions is based on the recently developed multi-indexed extensions of the reflectionless soliton potential.
