Title: Predictions from High Scale Mixing Unification Hypothesis
Authors: Gauhar Abbas and Saurabh Gupta and G. Rajasekaran and Rahul Srivastava
Abstract: We investigate the renormalization group evolution of masses and mixing angles of Majorana neutrinos under the `High Scale Mixing Unification' hypothesis. Assuming the unification of quark-lepton mixing angles at a high scale, we show that all the experimentally observed neutrino oscillation parameters can be obtained, within 3-$\sigma$ range, through the running of corresponding renormalization group equations provided neutrinos have same CP parity and are quasi-degenerate. One of the novel results of our analysis is that $\theta_{23}$ turns out to be non-maximal and lies in the second octant. Furthermore, we derive new constraints on the allowed parameter space for the unification scale, SUSY breaking scale and $\tan \beta$, for which the `High Scale Mixing Unification' hypothesis works.
