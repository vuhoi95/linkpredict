Title: Tunable circular dichroism due to the chiral anomaly in Weyl semimetals
Authors: Pavan Hosur and Xiao-Liang Qi
Abstract: Weyl semimetals are a three dimensional gapless topological phase in which bands intersect at arbitrary points -- the Weyl nodes -- in the Brillouin zone. These points carry a topological quantum number known as the \emph{chirality} and always appear in pairs of opposite chiralities. The notion of chirality leads to anomalous non-conservation of chiral charge, known as the \emph{chiral anomaly}, according to which charge can be pumped between Weyl nodes of opposite chiralities by an electromagnetic field with non-zero $\boldsymbol{E}\cdot\boldsymbol{B}$. Here, we propose probing the chiral anomaly by measuring the optical activity of Weyl semimetals via circular dichroism. In particular, we observe that applying such an electromagnetic field on this state gives it a non-zero gyrotropic coefficient or a Hall-like conductivity, which may be detectable by routine circular dichroism experiments. This method also serves as a diagnostic tool to discriminate between Weyl and Dirac semimetals; the latter will give a null result. More generally, any experiment that probes a bulk correlation function that has the same symmetries as the gyrotropic coefficient can detect the chiral anomaly as well as differentiate between Dirac and Weyl semimetals.
