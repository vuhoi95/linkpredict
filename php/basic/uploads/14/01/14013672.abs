Title: Large N phase transitions in supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory with  massive matter
Authors: Alejandro Barranco and Jorge G. Russo
Abstract: We study three-dimensional {\cal N}=2 U(N) Chern-Simons theory on S^3 coupled to 2N_f chiral multiplets deformed by mass terms. The partition function localizes to a matrix integral, which can be exactly computed in the large N limit. In a specific decompactification limit, the theory exhibits quantum (third-order) phase transitions at finite critical values of the coupling. The theory presents three phases when 0 < N_f < N and two phases when N_f\geq N. The vacuum expectation value of the supersymmetric circular Wilson loop has a discontinuity in the first derivative.
