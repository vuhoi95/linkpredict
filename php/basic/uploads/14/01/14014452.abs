Title: Black holes within Asymptotic Safety
Authors: Benjamin Koch and Frank Saueressig
Abstract: Black holes are probably among the most fascinating objects populating our universe. Their characteristic features found within general relativity, encompassing spacetime singularities, event horizons, and black hole thermodynamics, provide a rich testing ground for quantum gravity ideas. We review the status of black holes within a particular proposal for quantum gravity, Weinberg's asymptotic safety program. Starting from a brief survey of the effective average action and scale setting procedures, an improved quantum picture of the black hole is developed. The Schwarzschild black hole and its generalizations including angular momenta, higher-derivative corrections and the implications of extra dimensions are discussed in detail. In addition, the quantum singularity emerging for the inclusion of a cosmological constant is elucidated and linked to the phenomenon of a dynamical dimensional reduction of spacetime.
