Title: Mapping de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley bigravity into braneworld setup
Authors: Yasuho Yamashita and Takahiro Tanaka
Abstract: We discuss whether or not bigravity theory can be embedded into the braneworld setup. As a candidate, we consider Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati two-brane model with the Goldberger-Wise radion stabilization. We will show that we can construct a ghost free model whose low energy spectrum is composed of a massless graviton and a massive graviton with a small mass. As is expected, the behavior of this effective theory is shown to be identical to de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley bigravity. Unfortunately, this correspondence breaks down at a relatively low energy due to the limitation of the adopted stabilization mechanism.
