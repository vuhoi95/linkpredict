Authors: S. Pakuliak and E. Ragoucy and N. A. Slavnov
Abstract: We study quantum integrable models with $GL(3)$ trigonometric $R$-matrix solvable by the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz. We analyze scalar products of generic Bethe vectors and obtain an explicit representation for them in terms of a sum with respect to partitions of Bethe parameters. This representation generalizes known formula for the scalar products in the models with $GL(3)$-invariant $R$-matrix.
