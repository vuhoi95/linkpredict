Title: Pomeron in the N=4 SYM at strong couplings
Authors: A. V. Kotikov and L. N. Lipatov
Abstract: We show the result for the BFKL Pomeron intercept at N=4 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills model in the form of the inverse coupling expansion j0=2-2 lambda**(-1/2)- lambda**(-1) + 1/4 lambda**(-3/2) + 2(1+3zeta3) lambda**(-2) + O(lambda**(-5/2)), which has been calculated recently in [1] with the use of the AdS/CFT correspondence.
