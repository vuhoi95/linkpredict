Title: Extension of Grimus-Stockinger formula from operator expansion of free  Green function
Authors: S. E. Korenblit and D. V. Taychenachev
Abstract: The operator expansion of free Green function of Helmholtz equation for arbitrary N- dimension space leads to asymptotic extension of 3- dimension Grimus-Stockinger formula closely related to multipole expansion. Analytical examples inspired by neutrino oscillation and neutrino deficit problems are considered for relevant class of wave packets
