Title: Einstein Static Universe in Braneworld Scenario
Authors: K. Atazadeh and Y. Heydarzade and F. Darabi
Abstract: The stability of Einstein static universe against homogeneous scalar perturbations in the context of braneworld scenario is investigated. The stability regions are obtained in terms of the constant geometric linear equation of state parameter $\omega_{extr}=p_{extr}/\rho_{extr}$ and are studied for each evolutionary era of the universe. The results are discussed for the case of closed, open or flat universe in each era under the obtained restricting conditions. We also briefly investigate the stability against vector and tensor perturbations. Contrary to the classical general relativity, it is found that a stable Einstein static universe may exist in a braneworld theory of gravity against scalar, vector and tensor perturbations for some suitable values and ranges of the cosmological parameters.
