Title: Magnetic Moment of Electrons near Cosmic Strings
Authors: Takuya Maki and Kiyoshi Shiraishi
Abstract: We study the effect of background geometry generated by a thin cosmic string on the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron. We find that the magnitude of the quantum correction to the magnetic moment depends on the distance from the cosmic string as well as on the deficit angle.
