Title: Spacetime correlators of perturbations in slow-roll de Sitter inflation
Authors: Adrian del Rio and Jose Navarro-Salas
Abstract: Two-point correlators and self-correlators of primordial perturbations in quasi-de Sitter spacetime backgrounds are considered. For large separations two-point correlators exhibit nearly scale invariance, while for short distances self-correlators need standard renormalization. We study the deformation of two-point correlators to smoothly match the self-correlators at coincidence. The corresponding angular power spectrum is evaluated in the Sachs-Wolfe regime of low multipoles. Scale invariance is maintained, but the amplitude of $C_{\ell}$ could change in a non-trivial way.
