Title: The role of potential in the ghost-condensate dark energy model
Authors: Gour Bhattacharya and Pradip Mukherjee and Anirban Saha and Amit Singha Roy
Abstract: We consider the ghost-condensate model of dark energy with a generic potential term. The inclusion of the potential is shown to give greater freedom in realising the phantom regime. The self-consistency of the analysis is demonstrated using WMAP7+BAO+Hubble data.
