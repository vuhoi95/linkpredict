Title: Non-perturbative procedure for stable $K$-brane
Authors: Yuan Zhong and Yu-Xiao Liu and Zhen-Hua Zhao
Abstract: We propose a novel first-order formalism for a type of $K$-brane systems. An example solution is presented and studied. We illustrate how the noncanonical kinetic term can affect the properties of the model, such as the stability of the solutions, the localization of fermion and graviton. We argue that our solution is stable against linear perturbations. The tensor zero mode of graviton can be localized while the scalar zero mode cannot. The localization condition for fermion is also discussed.
