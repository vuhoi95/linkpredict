Title: A photon propagator on de Sitter in covariant gauges
Authors: Silvije Domazet and Tomislav Prokopec
Abstract: We construct a de Sitter invariant photon propagator in general covariant gauges. Our result is a natural generalization of the Allen-Jacobson photon propagator in Feynman gauge. Our propagator reproduces the correct response to a point static charge and the one-loop electromagnetic stress-energy tensor, strongly suggesting that it is suitable for perturbative calculations on de Sitter.
