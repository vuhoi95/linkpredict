Abstract: We consider the black hole qubit correspondence (BHQC) from quantum circuits, taking into account the use of gate operations with base in the formulation of wrapped brane qubits. We interpret these quantum circuits with base on the BHQC classification of entanglement classes and apply in specific examples as the generation of Bell, GHZ states, quantum circuit teleportation and consider the implementation of interchanges in SUSY, black hole configurations, Freudenthal and rank system constructions. These results are discussed from the superstring viewpoint showing that the importance of the construction of the physical states formed by the entanglement of geometrical entities by cohomological operations automatically allows the preservation of different amounts of SUSY in the compactification process given an alternative to the case when fluxes are introduced in the game: the generalized Calabi-Yau of Hitchin.
