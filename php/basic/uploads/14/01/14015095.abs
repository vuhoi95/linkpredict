Title: Knot Invariants from Topological Recursion on Augmentation Varieties
Authors: Jie Gu and Hans Jockers and Albrecht Klemm and Masoud Soroush
Abstract: Using the duality between Wilson loop expectation values of SU(N) Chern-Simons theory on $S^3$ and topological open-string amplitudes on the local mirror of the resolved conifold, we study knots on $S^3$ and their invariants encoded in colored HOMFLY polynomials by means of topological recursion. In the context of the local mirror Calabi-Yau threefold of the resolved conifold, we generalize the topological recursion of the remodelled B-model in order to study branes beyond the class of toric Harvey-Lawson special Lagrangians -- as required for analyzing non-trivial knots on $S^3$. The basic ingredients for the proposed recursion are the spectral curve, given by the augmentation variety of the knot, and the calibrated annulus kernel, encoding the topological annulus amplitudes associated to the knot. We present an explicit construction of the calibrated annulus kernel for torus knots and demonstrate the validity of the topological recursion. We further argue that -- if an explicit form of the calibrated annulus kernel is provided for any other knot -- the proposed topological recursion should still be applicable. We study the implications of our proposal for knot theory, which exhibit interesting consequences for colored HOMFLY polynomials of mutant knots.
