Title: Three-Dimensional Superconformal Field Theory on Conic Space as Hologram  of Charged Topological Black Hole
Authors: Xing Huang and Soo-Jong Rey and Yang Zhou
Abstract: We construct three-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric conformal field theories on conic spaces. Built upon the fact that the partition function depends solely on the Reeb vector of the Killing vector, we propose that holographic dual of these theories are four-dimensional, supersymmetric charged topological black holes. With the supersymmetry localization technique, we study conserved supercharges, free energy, and Renyi entropy. At planar large N limit, we demonstrate perfect agreement between the superconformal field theories and the supersymmetric charged topological black holes.
