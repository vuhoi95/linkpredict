Title: Time-like reductions of five-dimensional supergravity
Authors: Vicente Cort√©s and Paul Dempster and Thomas Mohaupt
Abstract: In this paper we study the scalar geometries occurring in the dimensional reduction of minimal five-dimensional supergravity to three Euclidean dimensions, and find that these depend on whether one first reduces over space or over time. In both cases the scalar manifold of the reduced theory is described as an eight-dimensional Lie group $L$ (the Iwasawa subgroup of $G_{2(2)}$) with a left-invariant para-quaternionic-K\"ahler structure. We show that depending on whether one reduces first over space or over time, the group $L$ is mapped to two different open $L$-orbits on the pseudo-Riemannian symmetric space $G_{2(2)}/(SL(2) \cdot SL(2))$. These two orbits are inequivalent in the sense that they are distinguished by the existence of integrable $L$-invariant complex or para-complex structures.
