Title: Exact analytical solutions of second-order conformal hydrodynamics
Authors: Yoshitaka Hatta and Jorge Noronha and Bo-Wen Xiao
Abstract: We present some exact solutions of relativistic second-order hydrodynamic equations in theories with conformal symmetry. Starting from a spherically expanding solution in ideal hydrodynamics, we take into account general conformal second-order corrections, and construct, for the first time, fully analytical axisymmetric exact solutions including the case with nonzero vorticity. These solutions are time-reversible despite having a nonvanishing shear stress tensor and provide a useful quantitative measure of the second-order effects in relativistic hydrodynamics.
