Title: Spheres, generalised parallelisability and consistent truncations
Authors: Kanghoon Lee and Charles Strickland-Constable and Daniel Waldram
Abstract: We show that generalised geometry gives a unified description of maximally supersymmetric consistent truncations of ten- and eleven-dimensional supergravity. In all cases the reduction manifold admits a "generalised parallelisation" with a frame algebra with constant coefficients. The consistent truncation then arises as a generalised version of a conventional Scherk-Schwarz reduction with the frame algebra encoding the embedding tensor of the reduced theory. The key new result is that all round-sphere $S^d$ geometries admit such generalised parallelisations with an $SO(d+1)$ frame algebra. Thus we show that the remarkable consistent truncations on $S^3$, $S^4$, $S^5$ and $S^7$ are in fact simply generalised Scherk-Schwarz reductions. This description leads directly to the standard non-linear scalar-field ansatze and as an application we give the full scalar-field ansatz for the type IIB truncation on $S^5$.
