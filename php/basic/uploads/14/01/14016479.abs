Title: Charged black holes in Horava gravity
Authors: Stefan Janiszewski and Andreas Karch and Brandon Robinson and David Sommer
Abstract: We explore static spherically symmetric black hole solutions allowing a bulk U(1) vector field in the khronometric formulation of Horava gravity by way of Einstein-Aether. We examine analytic solutions and study numerical results in the limit that the khronon does not backreact on the metric.
