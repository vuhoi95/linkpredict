Title: Casimir effect due to a slowly rotating source in the weak field  approximation
Authors: V. B. Bezerra and H. F. Mota and C. R. Muniz
Abstract: We calculate the renormalized vacuum energy density for a massless scalar field confined between two nearby parallel plates formed by ideal uncharged conductors, placed very close to the surface of a rotating spherical gravitational source with mass $M$, radius $R$ and momentum angular $J$, at the equatorial region. We consider that the source rotates slowly and that the gravitational field is weak. Corrections to the Casimir energy density induced by the gravitational field generated by this source are calculated up to $M/R^2$ order. The obtained results show us that there is an important modification in the Casimir energy only in this order of approximation, which depends on the surface gravity as well as on the rotation of the source. Thermal corrections to the Casimir energy found also are calculated in all these orders.
