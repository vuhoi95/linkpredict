Title: Universal chiral conductivities for low temperature holographic  superfluids
Authors: Irene Amado and Nir Lisker and Amos Yarom
Abstract: We argue that the chiral conductivities of generic s-wave holographic superfluids, whose broken U(1) symmetry is anomalous, exhibit universal behavior at low temperatures. The universal behavior we argue for is independent of the details of the bulk action and on the emergent geometry deep in the bulk interior at low temperatures. Our results are contrasted against general expectations based on an analysis of the entropy current in superfluids.
