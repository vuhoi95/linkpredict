Title: Building a St√ºckelberg Portal
Authors: Wan-Zhe Feng and Gary Shiu and Pablo Soler and Fang Ye
Abstract: We construct explicit string theory models realizing the recently proposed "St\"uckelberg Portal" scenario, a framework for building Z' mediation models without the need to introduce unwanted exotic matter charged under the Standard Model. This scenario can be viewed purely field-theoretically, although it is particularly well motivated from string theory. By analyzing carefully the St\"uckelberg couplings between the Abelian gauge bosons and the RR axions, we construct the first global intersecting brane models which extend the Standard Model with a genuine hidden sector, to which it is nonetheless connected via U(1) mass mixings. Utilizing the explicit models we construct, we discuss some broad phenomenological properties and experimental implications of this scenario such as Z-Z' mixings, dark matter stability and relic density, and supersymmetry mediation. With an appropriate confining hidden sector, our setup also provides a minimal realization of the hidden valley scenario. We further explore the possibility of obtaining small Z' masses from a large ensemble of U(1) bosons. Related to the St\"uckelberg portal are two mechanisms that connect the visible and the hidden sectors, namely mediation by non-perturbative operators and the hidden photon scenario, on which we briefly comment.
