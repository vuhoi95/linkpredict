Title: Bulk scalar field in warped extra dimensional models
Authors: Sumanta Chakraborty and Soumitra SenGupta
Abstract: This work presents a general formalism to analyze a generic bulk scalar field in a multiple warped extra-dimensional model with arbitrary number of extra dimensions. The Kaluza-Klein mass modes along with the self-interaction couplings are determined and the possibility of having lowest lying KK mode masses near TeV scale are discussed. Also some numerical values for low-lying KK modes has been presented showing explicit localization around TeV scale. It is argued that the appearance of large number of closely spaced KK modes with enhanced coupling may prompt possible new signatures in collider physics.
