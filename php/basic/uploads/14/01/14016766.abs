Title: Integral Reduction by Unitarity Method for Two-loop Amplitudes: A Case  Study
Authors: Bo Feng and Jun Zhen and Rijun Huang and Kang Zhou
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the unitarity method to two-loop diagrams and use it to discuss the integral bases of reduction. To test out method, we focus on the four-point double-box diagram as well as its related daughter diagrams, i.e., the double-triangle diagram and the triangle-box diagram. For later two kinds of diagrams, we have given complete analytical results in general (4-2\eps)-dimension.
