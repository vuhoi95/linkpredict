Abstract: We consider the string-net model on the honeycomb lattice for Ising anyons in the presence of a string tension. This competing term induces a nontrivial dynamics of the non-Abelian anyonic quasiparticles and may lead to a breakdown of the topological phase. Using high-order series expansions and exact diagonalizations, we determine the robustness of this doubled Ising phase which is found to be separated from two gapped phases. An effective quantum dimer model emerges in the large tension limit giving rise to two different translation symmetry-broken phases. Consequently, we obtain four transition points, two of which are associated with first-order transitions whereas the two others are found to be continuous and provide examples of recently proposed Bose condensation for anyons.
