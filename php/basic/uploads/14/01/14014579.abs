Title: Poisson equations, higher derivative automorphic forms and string  parameter limits
Authors: Finn Gubay and Peter West
Abstract: This paper considers the higher derivative terms in the effective action of type II string theory and in particular the behaviour of the automorphic forms they contain in all the different possible limits of the string parameters. The automorphic forms are thought to obey Poisson equations which contain the Laplacian defined on the coset space to which the scalars fields belong and we compute this Laplacian in all the possible string theory limits. We also consider these Poisson equations in the decompactification limit of a single dimension and by making two assumptions, one on the generic form of this equation and the other on the behaviour of the automorphic forms in this limit, we find strong constraints on the allowed form of this differential equation. We show that these constraints allow one to recover much of what was previously known about the automorphic forms corresponding to terms in the effective action that have fourteen or fewer space-time derivatives in a simple way.
