Title: Spontaneous parity breaking with broken supersymmetry : cosmological  constraint

Abstract: Unified models incorporating the right handed neutrino in a symmetric way generically possess parity symmetry. If this is broken spontaneously it results in the formation of domain walls in the early Universe, whose persistence is unwanted. A generic mechanism for destabilisation of such walls is a small pressure difference signalled by difference in the free energy across the walls. It is interesting to explore the possibility of such effects in conjunction with the effects that break supersymmetry in a phenomenologically acceptable way. Realising this possibility in the context of several scenarios of supersymmetry breaking results in an upper bound on the scale of spontaneous parity breaking, often much lower than the GUT scale. In the left-right symmetric models studied, the upper bound is no higher than $10^{11}$GeV but a scale as low as $10^5$GeV is acceptable.
