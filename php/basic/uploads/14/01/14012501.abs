Title: Algebraic Form of M3-Brane Action
Authors: Hossein Ghadjari and Zahra Rezaei
Abstract: We reformulate the bosonic action of unstable M3-brane to manifest its algebraic representation. It is seen that in contrast with string and M2-brane actions that are represented only in terms of two and three dimensional Lie-algebras respectively, the algebraic form of M3-brane action is a combination of four, three and two dimensional Lie-algebras. Corresponding brackets appear as mixtures of tachyon field, space-time coordinates, $X$, two-form field, $\hat{\omega}^{(2)}$, and Born-Infeld one-form, $\hat{b}_\mu$.
