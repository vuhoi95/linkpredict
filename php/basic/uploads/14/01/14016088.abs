Abstract: A Vaidya type geometry describing gravitation collapse in asymptotically Lifshitz spacetime with hyperscaling violation provides a simple holographic model for thermalization near a quantum critical point with non-trivial dynamic and hyperscaling violation exponents. The allowed parameter regions are constrained by requiring that the matter energy momentum tensor satisfies the null energy condition. We present a combination of analytic and numerical results on the time evolution of holographic entanglement entropy in such backgrounds for different shaped boundary regions and study various scaling regimes, generalizing previous work by Liu and Suh.
