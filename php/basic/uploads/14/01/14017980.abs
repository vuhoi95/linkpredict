Title: Ising model conformal boundary conditions from open string field theory
Authors: Matej Kudrna and Miroslav Rapcak and Martin Schnabl
Abstract: Given a consistent choice of conformally invariant boundary conditions in a two dimensional conformal field theory, one can construct new consistent boundary conditions by deforming with a relevant boundary operator and flowing to the infrared, or by a marginal deformation. Open string field theory provides a very universal tool to discover and study such new boundary theories. Surprisingly, it also allows one to go in the reverse direction and to uncover solutions with higher boundary entropy. We will illustrate our results on the well studied example of Ising model.
