Title: Towards an Effective Field Theory on the Light-Shell
Authors: Howard Georgi and Greg Kestin and Aqil Sajjad
Abstract: We discuss our work toward the construction of a light-shell effective theory (LSET), an effective field theory for describing the matter emerging from high-energy collisions and the accompanying radiation. We work in the highly simplified venue of 0-flavor scalar quantum electrodynamics, with a gauge invariant product of scalar fields at the origin of space-time as the source of high-energy charged particles. Working in this simple gauge theory allows us to focus on the essential features of LSET. We describe how the effective theory is constructed and argue that it can reproduce the full theory tree-level amplitude. We study the 1-loop radiative corrections in the LSET and suggest how the leading double-logs in the full theory at 1-loop order can be reproduced by a purely angular integral in the LSET.
