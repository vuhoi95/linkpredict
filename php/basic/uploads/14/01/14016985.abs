Title: Regular Bulk Solutions and Black Strings from Dynamical Braneworlds with  Variable Tension
Authors: D. Bazeia and J. M. Hoff da Silva and Roldao da Rocha
Abstract: Regular black strings solutions associated to a dynamical Friedmann-Robertson-Walker braneworld are obtained as a particular case of a regular bulk metric, in the context of a variable brane tension. By analyzing the 5D Kretschmann invariants, we show that the variable brane tension is capable to remove bulk singularities, along some eras of the evolution of the Universe. In particular, the black string time-dependent profile in the bulk is analyzed in the context of the McVittie metric on an E\"otv\"os fluid braneworld, wherein the fluid dynamical brane tension depends on the brane temperature. The whole bulk is shown to be regular for a Universe dominated by non-relativistic matter or by relativistic matter/radiation, as the cosmological time elapses. In a particular case the associated black strings are shown to have finite extension along the extra dimension, what prominently modify the higher-dimensional physical singularities. For a Universe dominated by matter or radiation, we show that the brane singularities are removed along the extra dimension, as an effect of the variable brane tension, corresponding also to the vanishing of the black string horizon. In this case there is a regular solution in the bulk. We show further that no additional physical singularity is introduced in the bulk when the Universe is dominated by a cosmological constant.
