Title: Correlating correlation functions of primordial perturbations
Authors: Jinn-Ouk Gong and Koenraad Schalm and Gary Shiu
Abstract: We explore the correlations between correlation functions of the primordial curvature perturbation produced during inflation. We find that for general single field inflation, other than the source terms which depend on the model details, higher order correlation functions are characterized by the power spectrum, its spectral index and running. The correlation between the bispectrum and power spectrum is presented as an explicit example of our systematic approach.
