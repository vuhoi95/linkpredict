Abstract: We formulate a generic $\mathcal{N}=2$ three-dimensional superfield higher-derivative gauge theory coupled to the matter, which, in certain cases reduces to the $\mathcal{N}=2$ three-dimensional scalar super-QED, or supersymmetric Maxwell-Chern-Simons or Chern-Simons theories with matter. For this theory, we explicitly calculate the one-loop effective potential.
