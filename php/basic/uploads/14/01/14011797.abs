Title: Black hole for the Einstein-Chern-Simons gravity
Authors: Cristian Quinzacara and Patricio Salgado
Abstract: We consider a 5-dimensional action which is composed of a gravitational sector and a sector of matter, where the gravitational sector is given by a Einstein-Chern-Simons gravity action instead of the Einstein-Hilbert action. We obtain the Einstein-Chern-Simons (EChS) field equations together with its spherically sym- metric solution, which leads, in certain limit, to the standard five dimensional solution of the Einstein-Cartan field equations. It is found the conditions under which the EChS field equations admits black hole type solutions. The maximal extension and conformal compactification are also studied
