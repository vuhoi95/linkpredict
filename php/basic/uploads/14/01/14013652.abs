Title: On noncommutative spherically symmetric spaces
Authors: Maja Buric and John Madore
Abstract: Two families of noncommutative extensions are given of a general space-time metric with spherical symmetry, both based on the matrix truncation of the functions on the sphere of symmetry. The first family uses the truncation to foliate space as an infinite set of spheres, is of dimension four and necessarily time-dependent; the second can be time-dependent or static, is of dimension five and uses the truncation to foliate the internal space.
