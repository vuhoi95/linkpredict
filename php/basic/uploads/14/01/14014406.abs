Title: Anisotropic Inflation with the non-Vacuum Initial State
Authors: Razieh Emami and Hassan Firouzjahi and Moslem Zarei
Abstract: In this work we study models of anisotropic inflation with the generalized non-vacuum initial states for the inflaton field and the gauge field. The effects of non Bunch-Davies initial condition on the anisotropic power spectrum and bispectrum are calculated. We show that the non Bunch-Davies initial state can help to reduce the fine-tuning on the anisotropic power spectrum while reducing the level of anisotropic bispectrum.
