Title: Modified Anti-de-Sitter Metric, Light-Front Quantized QCD, and Conformal  Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Hans Gunter Dosch and Stanley J. Brodsky and Guy F. de Teramond
Abstract: We briefly review the remarkable connections between light-front QCD, gravity in AdS space, and conformal quantum mechanics. We discuss, in particular, the group theoretical and geometrical aspects of the underlying one-dimensional quantum field theory. The resulting effective theory leads to a phenomenologically successful confining interaction potential in the relativistic light-front wave equation which incorporates relevant non-perturbative dynamical aspects of hadron physics.
