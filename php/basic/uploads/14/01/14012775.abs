Title: Suppression of Quantum Corrections by Classical Backgrounds
Authors: Nikolaos Brouzakis and Nikolaos Tetradis
Abstract: We use heat-kernel techniques in order to compute the one-loop effective action in the cubic Galileon theory for a background that realizes the Vainshtein mechanism. We find that the UV divergences are suppressed relative to the predictions of standard perturbation theory at length scales below the Vainshtein radius.
