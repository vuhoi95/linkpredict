Title: Twistor Theory of the Airy Equation
Authors: Michael Cole and Maciej Dunajski
Abstract: We demonstrate how the complex integral formula for the Airy functions arises from Penrose's twistor contour integral formula. We then use the Lax formulation of the isomonodromy problem with one irregular singularity of order four to show that the Airy equation arises from the anti-self-duality equations for conformal structures of neutral signature invariant under the isometric action of the Bianchi II group. This conformal structure admits a null-K\"ahler metric in its conformal class which we construct explicitly.
