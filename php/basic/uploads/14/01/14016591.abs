Title: Non-renormalization theorems and N=2 supersymmetric backgrounds
Authors: Daniel Butter and Bernard de Wit and Ivano Lodato
Abstract: The conditions for fully supersymmetric backgrounds of general N=2 locally supersymmetric theories are derived based on the off-shell superconformal multiplet calculus. This enables the derivation of a non-renormalization theorem for a large class of supersymmetric invariants with higher-derivative couplings. The theorem implies that the invariant and its first order variation must vanish in a fully supersymmetric background. The conjectured relation of one particular higher-derivative invariant with a specific five-dimensional invariant containing the mixed gauge-gravitational Chern-Simons term is confirmed.
