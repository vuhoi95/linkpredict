Title: Modified Bose-Einstein Condensate Black Holes in d Dimensions
Authors: Florian Kuhnel and Bo Sundborg
Abstract: [Remark: Much more natural and important models are studied in arXiv:1405.2083. Furthermore, the physical picture given there is much more complete.] The quantum N-portrait -- black holes pictured as Bose-Einstein condensates -- is studied for a special class of models in arbitrary dimensions. In the presence of extra dimensions, the depletion rate is shown to be significantly enhanced in these models as compared to standard semi-classical results. Consequences for large as well as micro condensates are discussed. Speculations are made on a possible connection of higher-dimensional graviton condensates, strings and branes.
