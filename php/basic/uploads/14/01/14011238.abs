Title: Where-When-What: the general relativity of space-time-property
Authors: Robert Delbourgo and Paul D Stack
Abstract: We develop the general relativity of extended spacetime-property for describing events including their properties. The anticommuting nature of property coordinates, augmenting space-time $({\bf x},t)$, allows for the natural emergence of generations and for the simple incorporation of gauge fields in the spacetime-property sector. With one electric property this results in a geometrical unification of gravity and electromagnetism, leading to a Maxwell-Einstein Lagrangian plus a cosmological term. Addition of one neutrinic and three chromic properties should lead to unification of gravity with electroweak and strong interactions.
