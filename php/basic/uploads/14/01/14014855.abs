Title: Jordanian deformations of the AdS_5xS^5 superstring
Authors: Io Kawaguchi and Takuya Matsumoto and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We consider Jordanian deformations of the AdS_5xS^5 superstring action. The deformations correspond to non-standard q-deformation. In particular, it is possible to perform partial deformations, for example, only for the S^5 part. Then the classical action and the Lax pair are constructed with a linear, twisted and extended R operator. It is shown that the action preserves the kappa-symmetry.
