Title: Thermodynamical properties of graphene in noncommutative phase-space
Authors: Victor Santos and R. V. Maluf and C. A. S. Almeida
Abstract: We investigated the thermodynamic properties of graphene in a noncommutative phase-space in the presence of a constant magnetic field. In particular, we determined the behaviour of the main thermodynamical functions: the Helmholtz free energy, the mean energy, the entropy and the specific heat. The high temperature limit is worked out and the thermodynamic quantities, such as mean energy and specific heat, exhibit the same features as the commutative case. Possible connections with the results already established in the literature are discussed briefly.
