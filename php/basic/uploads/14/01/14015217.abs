Title: A cosmological bound on $e^+ e^-$ mass difference
Authors: A. D. Dolgov and V. A. Novikov
Abstract: We demonstrate that CPT-violation due to $e^+ e^-$ mass difference generates a non-zero photon mass. As a result the cosmological bounds on the photon mass lead to the bounds on $e^+ e^-$ mass difference which are at least by 10 orders of magnitude stronger than the direct experimental bound.
