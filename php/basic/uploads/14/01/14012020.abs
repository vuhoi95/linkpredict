Title: An extended standard model and its Higgs geometry from the matrix model
Authors: Harold C. Steinacker and Jochen Zahn
Abstract: We find a simple brane configuration in the IKKT matrix model which resembles the standard model at low energies, with a second Higgs doublet and right-handed neutrinos. The electroweak sector is realized geometrically in terms of two minimal fuzzy ellipsoids, which can be interpreted in terms of four point-branes in the extra dimensions. The electroweak Higgs connects these branes and is an indispensable part of the geometry. Fermionic would-be zero modes arise at the intersections with two larger branes, leading precisely to the correct chiral matter fields at low energy, along with right-handed neutrinos which can acquire a Majorana mass due to a Higgs singlet. The larger branes give rise to $SU(3)_c$, extended by $U(1)_B$ and another $U(1)$ which are anomalous at low energies and expected to disappear. At higher energies, mirror fermions and additional fields arise, completing the full ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetry. The brane configuration is a solution of the model, assuming a suitable effective potential and a non-linear stabilization of the singlet Higgs. The basic results can be carried over to ${\cal N}=4$ $SU(N)$ super-Yang-Mills on ordinary Minkowski space with sufficiently large $N$.
