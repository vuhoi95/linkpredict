Title: The universal R-matrix and factorization of the L-operators related to  the Baxter Q-operators
Authors: Sergey Khoroshkin and Zengo Tsuboi
Abstract: We consider the `universal monodrimy operators' for the Baxter Q-operators. They are given as images of the universal R-matrix in oscillator representation. We find related universal factorization formulas in $U_{q}(\hat{sl}(2))$ case.
