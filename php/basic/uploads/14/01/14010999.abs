Title: Localization of gauge fields in a tachyonic de Sitter thick braneworld
Authors: Alfredo Herrera-Aguilar and Alma D. Rojas and Eli Santos-Rodriguez
Abstract: In this work we show that universal gauge vector fields can be localized on the recently proposed 5D thick tachyonic braneworld which involves a de Sitter cosmological background induced on the 3-brane. Namely, by performing a suitable decomposition of the vector field, the resulting 4D effective action corresponds to a massive gauge field, while the profile along the extra dimension obeys a Schroedinger-like equation with a Poeschl-Teller potential. It turns out that the massless zero mode of the gauge field is bound to the expanding 3-brane and allows us to recover the standard 4D electromagnetic phenomena of our world. Moreover, this zero mode is separated from the continuum of Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes by a mass gap determined by the scale of the expansion parameter. We also were able to analytically solve the corresponding Schroedinger-like equation for arbitrary mass, showing that KK massive modes asymptotically behave like plane waves as expected.
