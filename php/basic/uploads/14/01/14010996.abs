Title: Gauged Q-balls in the Affleck-Dine mechanism
Authors: Takashi Tamaki and Nobuyuki Sakai
Abstract: We consider gauged Q-balls in the gravity-mediation-type model in the Affleck-Dine mechanism, which is described by the potential $V_{\rm grav.}(\phi):=(m_{\rm grav.}^2/2)\phi^2\left[1+K\ln(\phi/M)^2\right]$ with $K<0$. In many models of gauged Q-balls, which were studied in the literature, there are upper limits for charge and size of Q-balls due to repulsive Coulomb force. In the present model, by contrast, our numerical calculation strongly suggests that stable solutions with any amount of charge and size exist. As the electric charge $Q$ increases, the field configuration of the scalar field becomes shell-like; because the charge is concentrated on the surface, the Coulomb force does not destroy the Q-ball configuration. These properties are analogous to those in the V-shaped model, which was studied by Arod\'z and Lis. We also find that for each $K$ there is another sequence of unstable solutions, which is separated from the other sequence of the stable solutions. As $|K|$ increases, the two sequences approach; eventually at some point in $-1.07<K<-1.06$, the "recombination" of the two sequences takes place.
