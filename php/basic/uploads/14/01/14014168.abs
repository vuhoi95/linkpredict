Title: Exceptional N=1 Duality
Authors: David Kutasov and Jennifer Lin
Abstract: Four dimensional N=1 supersymmetric gauge theory with gauge group SU(N_c) and matter in the adjoint and fundamental representations gives rise to a series of fixed points with an ADE classification. The A and D series exhibit generalizations of Seiberg duality. We propose a similar duality for the E7 theory.
