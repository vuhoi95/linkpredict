Abstract: We present an analytic solution of a Vaidya-charged black hole with a hyperscaling violating factor in an Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model, where the scalar potential plays a key role in the existence of the solution. By making use of this result, we study the process of thermalization after a global quench in a theory which its gravitational description is provided by the resultant solution in the case of zero charge. In particular, we probe the system by entanglement entropy and show that it exhibits certain scaling behaviors during the process.
