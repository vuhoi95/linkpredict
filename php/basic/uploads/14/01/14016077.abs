Abstract: These reports present the results of the 2013 Community Summer Study of the APS Division of Particles and Fields ("Snowmass 2013") on the future program of particle physics in the U.S. Chapter 2, on the Intensity Frontier, discusses the program of research with high-intensity beams and rare processes. This area includes experiments on neutrinos, proton decay, charged-lepton and quark weak interactions, atomic and nuclear probes of fundamental symmetries, and searches for new, light, weakly-interacting particles.
