Title: On the Higgs-like Quintessence for Dark Energy
Authors: Sergei V. Ketov and N. Watanabe
Abstract: We propose a dynamical (quintessence) model of dark energy in the current universe with a renormalizable (Higgs-like) scalar potential. We prove the viability of our model (after fine tuning) for the certain range of the average scalar curvature values, and study the cosmological signatures distinguishing our model from the standard description of dark energy in terms of a cosmological constant.
