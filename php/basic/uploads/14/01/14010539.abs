Title: Quantum Entanglement of Local Operators in Conformal Field Theories
Authors: Masahiro Nozaki and Tokiro Numasawa and Tadashi Takayanagi
Abstract: We introduce a series of quantities which characterizes a given local operator in conformal field theories from the viewpoint of quantum entanglement. It is defined by the increased amount of (Renyi) entanglement entropy at late time for an excited state defined by acting the local operator on the vacuum. We consider a conformal field theory on an infinite space and take the subsystem in the definition of the entanglement entropy to be its half. We calculate these quantities for a free massless scalar field theory in 2, 4 and 6 dimensions. We find that these results are interpreted in terms of quantum entanglement of finite number states, including EPR states. They agree with a heuristic picture of propagations of entangled particles.
