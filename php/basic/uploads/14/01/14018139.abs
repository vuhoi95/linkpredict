Title: Noncommuting Momenta of Topological Solitons
Authors: Haruki Watanabe and Hitoshi Murayama
Abstract: We show that momentum operators of a topological soliton may not commute among themselves when the soliton is associated with the second cohomology $H^2$ of the target space. The commutation relation is proportional to the winding number, taking a constant value within each topological sector. The noncommutativity makes it impossible to specify the momentum of a topological soliton, and induces a Magnus force.
