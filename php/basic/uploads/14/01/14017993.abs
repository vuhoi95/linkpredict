Title: Scale-invariant hyperscaling-violating holographic theories and the  resistivity of strange metals with random-field disorder
Authors: Andrew Lucas and Subir Sachdev and Koenraad Schalm
Abstract: We compute the direct current resistivity of a scale-invariant, $d$-dimensional strange metal with dynamic critical exponent $z$ and hyperscaling-violating exponent $\theta$, weakly perturbed by a scalar operator coupled to random-field disorder that locally breaks a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Independent calculations via Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton holography and memory matrix methods lead to the same results. We show that random field disorder has a strong effect on resistivity: charge carriers in the infrared are easily depleted, as the relaxation time for momentum is surprisingly small. In the course of our holographic calculation we use a non-trivial dilaton coupling to the disordered scalar, allowing us to study a strongly-coupled scale invariant theory with $\theta \ne 0$. Using holography, we are also able to determine the disorder strength at which perturbation theory breaks down. Curiously, for locally critical theories this breakdown occurs when the resistivity is proportional to the entropy density, up to a possible logarithmic correction.
