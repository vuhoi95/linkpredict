Title: 1/N and Loop Corrections in Higher Spin AdS_4/CFT_3 Duality
Authors: Antal Jevicki and Kewang Jin and Junggi Yoon
Abstract: We consider the question of loop corrections (i.e. 1/N) in the vector model/higher spin duality following the recent work of Giombi and Klebanov. The purpose of this paper is to gain further more precise comparison between the two sides of the duality. For CFTs given by 3d O(N) or U(N) vector models we evaluate the leading and one loop partition functions in a variety of geometries. Our calculations are performed in the scheme of collective field theory which was seen in earlier studies to represent a bulk description of Vasiliev higher spin theory. The calculations presented provide data for comparison of small fluctuation determinants giving further evidence for the one-to-one bulk identification between the bi-local and the AdS picture. They also offer insight into the identification of coupling constants G and 1/N of the two descriptions for models based on O(N) symmetry.
