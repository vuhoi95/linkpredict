Title: Noninertial effects on the ground state energy of a massive scalar field  in the cosmic string spacetime
Authors: H. F. Mota and K. Bakke
Abstract: We investigate the influence of noninertial effects on the ground state energy of a massive scalar field in the cosmic string spacetime. We generalize the results obtained by Khusnutdinov and Bordag [N. R. Khusnutdinov and M. Bordag, Phys. Rev. D 59, 064017 (1999)] to a noninertial reference frame and show, by contrast, that a non-vanishing contribution to the ground state energy stems from the noninertial effects. Moreover, we show that there is no influence of the curvature of the spacetime on this non-vanishing contribution to the ground state energy of a massive scalar field.
