Title: The small and large D limit of Parikh-Wilczek tunneling model for  Hawking radiation
Authors: June-Yu Wei and Wen-Yu Wen
Abstract: In this note, we study both the small and large dimension $D$ limit of the tunneling model of Hwaking radiation proposed by Parikh and Wilczek\cite{Parikh:1999mf}. We confirm that the result $\Gamma \sim e^{\Delta S}$ is still valid for arbitrary $D>3$. The sensible large $D$ limit is given by $\sqrt{D} \ll r_0$ in order to have nonzero radiation. On the other hand, the sensible small $D$ limit is given by taking $D=3+\epsilon$ as a continuous parameter. We also explicitly show the leading order correction to the thermal radiation and discuss its connection to the two-dimensional dilaton gravity.
