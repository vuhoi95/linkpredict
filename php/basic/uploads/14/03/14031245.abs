Title: Domain wall Skyrmions
Authors: Sven Bjarke Gudnason and Muneto Nitta
Abstract: Skyrmions of different dimensions are related by domain walls. We obtain explicit full numerical solutions of various Skyrmion configurations trapped inside a domain wall. We find for the quadratic mass-term that multi-Skyrmions are ring-shaped, and conjecture for the linear mass-term, that the lowest-energy state of multi-Skyrmions will consist of charge-2 rings accommodated in a lattice.
