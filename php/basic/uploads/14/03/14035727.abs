Authors: Yoshiaki Maeda and Akifumi Sako and Toshiya Suzuki and Hiroshi Umetsu
Abstract: We construct a gauge theory on a noncommutative homogeneous K\"ahler manifold, where we employ the deformation quantization with separation of variables for K\"ahler manifolds formulated by Karabegov. A key point in this construction is to obtaining vector fields which act as inner derivations for the deformation quantization. We show that these vector fields are the only Killing vector fields. We give an explicit construction of this gauge theory on noncommutative ${\mathbb C}P^N$ and noncommutative ${\mathbb C}H^N$.
