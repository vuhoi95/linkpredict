Title: Semiclassical Strings in Supergravity PFT
Authors: Aritra Banerjee and Sagar Biswas and Kamal L. Panigrahi
Abstract: Puff Field Theory (PFT) is an example of a non-local field theory which arises from a novel embedding of D-branes in Melvin universe. We study several rotating and pulsating string solutions of the F-string equations of motion in the supergravity dual of the PFT. Further, we find a PP-wave geometry from this nonlocal spacetime by applying a Penrose limit and comment on its similarity with the maximally supersymmetric PP-wave background.
