Title: Entanglement Entropy in 2D Non-abelian Pure Gauge Theory
Authors: Andrey Gromov and Raul A. Santos
Abstract: We compute the Entanglement Entropy (EE) of a bipartition in 2D pure non-abelian $U(N)$ gauge theory. We obtain a general expression for EE on an arbitrary Riemann surface. We find that due to area-preserving diffeomorphism symmetry EE does not depend on the size of the subsystem, but only on the number of disjoint intervals defining the bipartition. In the strong coupling limit on a torus we find that the scaling of the EE at small temperature is given by $S(T) - S(0) = O\left(\frac{m_{gap}}{T}e^{-\frac{m_{gap}}{T}}\right)$, which is similar to the scaling for the matter fields recently derived in literature. In the large $N$ limit we compute all of the Renyi entropies and identify the Douglas-Kazakov phase transition.
