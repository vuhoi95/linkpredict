Title: Higgs mass in Noncommutative Geometry
Authors: Agostino Devastato and Fedele Lizzi and Pierre Martinetti
Abstract: In the noncommutative geometry approach to the standard model, an extra scalar field - initially suggested by particle physicist to stabilize the electroweak vacuum - makes the computation of the Higgs mass compatible with the 126 GeV experimental value. We give a brief account on how to generate this field from the Majorana mass of the neutrino, following the principles of noncommutative geometry.
