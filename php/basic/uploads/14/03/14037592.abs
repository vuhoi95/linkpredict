Abstract: At finite N the number of restricted Schur polynomials is greater than or equal to the number of generalized restricted Schur polynomials. In this note we study this discrepancy and explain its origin. We conclude that, for quiver gauge theories, in general, the generalized restricted Schur polynomials correctly account for the complete set of finite N constraints and they provide a basis, while the restricted Schur polynomials only account for a subset of the finite N constraints and are thus overcomplete. We identify several situations in which the restricted Schur polynomials do in fact account for the complete set of finite N constraints. In these situations the restricted Schur polynomials and the generalized restricted Schur polynomials both provide good bases for the quiver gauge theory. Finally, we demonstrate situations in which the generalized restricted Schur polynomials reduce to the restricted Schur polynomials.
