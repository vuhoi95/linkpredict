Title: Holographic Superconductors in a Rotating Spacetime
Authors: Kai Lin and Elcio Abdalla
Abstract: We consider holographic superconductors in a rotating black string spacetime. In view of the mandatory introduction of the $A_\varphi$ component of the vector potential we are left with three equations to be solved. Their solutions show that the effect of the rotating parameter $a$ influences the critical temperature $T_c$ and the conductivity $\sigma$ in a simple but not trivial way.
