Title: Quiver mutation loops and partition q-series
Authors: Akishi Kato and Yuji Terashima
Abstract: A quiver mutation loop is a sequence of mutations and vertex relabelings, along which a quiver transforms back to the original form. For a given mutation loop, we introduce a quantity called a partition q-series. The partition q-series are invariant under pentagon moves. If the quivers are of Dynkin type or square products thereof, they reproduce so-called parafermionic or quasi-particle character formulas of certain modules associated with affine Lie algebras. They enjoy nice modular properties as expected from the conformal field theory point of view.
