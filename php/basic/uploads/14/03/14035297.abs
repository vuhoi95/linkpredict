Title: Unitarity in three-dimensional flat space higher spin theories
Authors: D. Grumiller and M. Riegler and J. Rosseel
Abstract: We investigate generic flat-space higher spin theories in three dimensions and find a no-go result, given certain assumptions that we spell out. Namely, it is only possible to have at most two out of the following three properties: unitarity, flat space, non-trivial higher spin states. Interestingly, unitarity provides an (algebra-dependent) upper bound on the central charge, like c=42 for the Galilean $W_4^{(2-1-1)}$ algebra. We extend this no-go result to rule out unitary "multi-graviton" theories in flat space. We also provide an example circumventing the no-go result: Vasiliev-type flat space higher spin theory based on hs(1) can be unitary and simultaneously allow for non-trivial higher-spin states in the dual field theory.
