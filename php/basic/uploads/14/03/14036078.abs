Title: Higgs inflation at the critical point
Authors: Fedor Bezrukov and Mikhail Shaposhnikov
Abstract: Higgs inflation can occur if the Standard Model (SM) is a self-consistent effective field theory up to inflationary scale. This leads to a lower bound on the Higgs boson mass, $M_h \geq M_{\text{crit}}$. If $M_h$ is more than a few hundreds of MeV above the critical value, the Higgs inflation predicts the universal values of inflationary indexes, $r\simeq 0.003$ and $n_s\simeq 0.97$, independently on the Standard Model parameters. We show that in the vicinity of the critical point $M_{\text{crit}}$ the inflationary indexes acquire an essential dependence on the mass of the top quark $m_t$ and $M_h$. In particular, the amplitude of the gravitational waves can exceed considerably the universal value.
