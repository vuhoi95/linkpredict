Title: Unification of Galileon Dualities
Authors: Karol Kampf and Jiri Novotny
Abstract: We study dualities of the general Galileon theory in d dimensions in terms of coordinate transformations on the coset space corresponding to the spontaneously broken Galileon group. The most general duality transformation is found to be determined uniquely up to four free parameters and under compositions these transformations form a group which can be identified with GL(2,R). This group represents a unified framework for all the up to now known Galileon dualities. We discuss a representation of this group on the Galileon theory space and using concrete examples we illustrate its applicability both on the classical and quantum level.
