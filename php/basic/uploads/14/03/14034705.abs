Title: One-Loop Renormalizable Wess-Zumino Model on Bosonic-Fermionic  Noncommutative Superspace
Authors: Yan-Gang Miao and Xu-Dong Wang
Abstract: We construct a deformed Wess-Zumino model on the noncommutative superspace where the Bosonic and Fermionic coordinates are no longer commutative with each other. Using the background field method, we calculate the primary one-loop effective action based on the deformed action. By comparing the two actions, we find that the deformed Wess-Zumino model is not renormalizable. To obtain a renormalizable model, we combine the primary one-loop effective action with the deformed action, and then calculate the secondary one-loop effective action based on the combined action. After repeating this process to the third time, we finally give the one-loop renormalizable action up to the second order of Bosonic-Fermionic noncommutative parameters by using our specific techniques of calculation.
