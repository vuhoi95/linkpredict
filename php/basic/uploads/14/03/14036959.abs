Authors: Huiquan Li and Cong Yu and Jiancheng Wang and Zhaoyi Xu
Abstract: We study force-free magnetospheres in the Blandford-Znajek process from rapidly rotating black holes by adopting the near-horizon geometry of near-extreme Kerr black holes (near-NHEK). It is shown that the Znajek regularity condition on the horizon can be directly derived from the resulting stream equation. In terms of the condition, we split the full stream equation into two separate equations. Approximate solutions around the rotation axis are derived. They are found to be consistent with previous solutions obtained in the asymptotic region. The solutions indicate energy and angular-momentum extraction from the hole.
