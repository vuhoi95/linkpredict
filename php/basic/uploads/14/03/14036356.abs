Abstract: We calculate the logarithmic contributions to the massive Wilson coefficients for deep-inelastic scattering in the asymptotic region $Q^2 \gg m^2$ to 3-loop order in the fixed-flavor number scheme and present the corresponding expressions for the massive operator matrix elements needed in the variable flavor number scheme. Explicit expressions are given both in Mellin-$N$ space and $z$-space.
