Title: Note on symmetric BCJ numerator
Authors: Chih-Hao Fu and Yi-Jian Du and Bo Feng
Abstract: We present an algorithm that leads to BCJ numerators satisfying manifestly the three properties proposed by Broedel and Carrasco in [35]. We explicitly calculate the numerators at 4, 5 and 6-points and show that the relabeling property is generically satisfied.
