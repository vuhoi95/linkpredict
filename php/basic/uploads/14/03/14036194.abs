Title: Gaugeon formalism in the framework of generalized BRST symmetry
Authors: Sudhaker Upadhyay and Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: We consider gaugeon formulations which discuss the quantum gauge freedom covariantly in the framework of generalized BRST transformation for the Yang-Mills theory as well as the BRST invariant Higgs model. We generalize the BRST symmetries of both the Yang-Mills theory and the Higgs model by making the transformation parameter finite and field-dependent. Remarkably, we observe that the gaugeon Lagrangian which describe the quantum gauge freedom appear automatically in the effective theories along with the natural shift in gauge parameters under specific finite field-dependent parameters.
