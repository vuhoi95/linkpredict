Title: A quantum mechanical model of "dark matter"
Authors: V. V. Belokurov and E. T. Shavgulidze
Abstract: The role of singular solutions in some simple quantum mechanical models is studied. The space of the states of two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator is shown to be separated into sets of states with different properties.
