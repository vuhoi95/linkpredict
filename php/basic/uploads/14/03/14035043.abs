Title: Higgs inflation still alive

Abstract: The observed value of the Higgs mass indicates that the Higgs potential becomes small and flat at the scale around $10^{17}$GeV. Having this fact in mind, we reconsider the Higgs inflation scenario proposed by Bezrukov and Shaposhnikov. It turns out that the non-minimal coupling $\xi$ of the Higgs-squared to the Ricci scalar can be smaller than ten. For example, $\xi=7$ corresponds to the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r\simeq0.2$, which is consistent with the recent observation by BICEP2.
