Abstract: The magnitude of primordial tensor perturbations reported by the BICEP2 experiment is consistent with simple models of chaotic inflation driven by a single scalar field with a power-law potential \propto \phi^n: n \simeq 2, in contrast to the WMAP and Planck results, which favored models resembling the Starobinsky R + R^2 model if running of the scalar spectral index could be neglected. While models of inflation with a quadratic potential may be constructed in simple N=1 supergravity, these constructions are more challenging in no-scale supergravity. We discuss here how quadratic inflation can be accommodated within supergravity, focussing primarily on the no-scale case. We also argue that the quadratic inflaton may be identified with the supersymmetric partner of a singlet (right-handed) neutrino, whose subsequent decay could have generated the baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis.
