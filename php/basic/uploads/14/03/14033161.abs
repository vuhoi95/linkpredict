Title: Teleparallel Gravity in Five Dimensional Theories
Authors: Chao-Qiang Geng and Ling-Wei Luo and Huan-Hsin Tseng
Abstract: We study teleparallel gravity in five-dimensional spacetime with particular discussions on Kaluza-Klein (KK) and braneworld theories. We directly perform the dimensional reduction by differential forms. In the braneworld theory, the teleparallel gravity formalism in the Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker cosmology is equivalent to GR due to the same Friedmann equation, whereas in the KK case the reduction of our formulation does not recover the effect as GR of 4-dimensional spacetime.
