Title: Gravity Waves from Extreme-Mass-Ratio Plunges into Kerr Black Holes
Authors: Shahar Hadar and Achilleas P. Porfyriadis and Andrew Strominger
Abstract: Massive objects orbiting a near-extreme Kerr black hole quickly plunge into the horizon after passing the innermost stable circular orbit. The plunge trajectory is shown to be related by a conformal map to a circular orbit. Conformal symmetry of the near-horizon region is then used to compute the gravitational radiation produced during the plunge phase.
