Abstract: Bianchi black branes (black brane solutions with homogeneous but anisotropic horizons classified by the Bianchi type) provide a simple holographic setting with lattice structures taken into account. In the case of holographic superconductor, we have a persistent current with lattices. Accordingly, we expect that in the dual gravity side, a black brane should carry some momentum along a direction of lattice structure, where translational invariance is broken. Motivated by this expectation, we consider whether---and if possible, in what circumstances---a Bianchi black brane can have momentum along a direction of no-translational invariance. First, we show that this {\it cannot} be the case for a certain class of stationary Bianchi black brane solutions in the Einstein-Maxwell-dilation theory. Then we also show that this {\it can} be the case for some Bianchi VII$_0$ black branes by numerically constructing such a solution in the Einstein-Maxwell theory with an additional vector field having a source term. The horizon of this solution admits a translational invariance on the horizon and conveys momentum (and is "rotating" when compactified). However this translational invariance is broken just outside the horizon. This indicates the existence of a black brane solution which is regular but non-analytic at the horizon, thereby evading the black hole rigidity theorem.
