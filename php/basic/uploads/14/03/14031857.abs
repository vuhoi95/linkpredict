Title: Gauge Theory on Twisted $Îº$-Minkowski: Old Problems and Possible  Solutions
Authors: Marija Dimitrijevic and Larisa Jonke and Anna Pachol
Abstract: We review the application of twist deformation formalism and the construction of noncommutative gauge theory on $\kappa$-Minkowski space-time. We compare two different types of twists: the Abelian and the Jordanian one. In each case we provide the twisted differential calculus and consider ${U}(1)$ gauge theory. Different methods of obtaining a&nbsp;gauge invariant action and related problems are thoroughly discussed.
