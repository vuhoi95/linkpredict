Title: A systematic study of exact solutions in second-order conformal  hydrodynamics
Authors: Yoshitaka Hatta and Jorge Noronha and Bo-Wen Xiao
Abstract: In this paper we present the details of our previous work on exact solutions in second-order conformal hydrodynamics together with a number of new solutions found by mapping Minkowski space onto various curved spacetimes such as anti-de Sitter space and hyperbolic space. We analytically show how the solutions of ideal hydrodynamics are modified by the second-order effects including vorticity. We also find novel boost-invariant exact solutions which exist only in second-order hydrodynamics and have an unusual dependence on the proper time.
