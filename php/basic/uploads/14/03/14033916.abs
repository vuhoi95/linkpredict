Title: Gravity and induced matter on Nearly Kahler Manifolds
Authors: F. Naderi and A. Rezaei-Aghdam and F. Darabi
Abstract: We show that the conservation of energy-momentum tensor of a gravitational model with Einstein-Hilbert like action on a nearly Kahler manifold with the scalar curvature of a curvature-like tensor, is consistent with the nearly Kahler properties. In this way, the nearly Kahler structure is automatically manifested in the action as a induced matter field. As an example of nearly Kahler manifold, we consider the group manifold of R x II x S3 x S3 on which we identify a nearly Kahler structure and solve the Einstein equations to interpret the model. It is shown that the nearly Kahler structure in this example is capable of alleviating the well known fine tuning problem of the cosmological constant. Moreover, this structure may be considered as a potential candidate for dark energy.
