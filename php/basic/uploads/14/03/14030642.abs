Title: Grassmann Tensor Renormalization Group Approach to One-Flavor Lattice  Schwinger Model
Authors: Yuya Shimizu and Yoshinobu Kuramashi
Abstract: We apply the Grassmann tensor renormalization group to the lattice regularized Schwinger model with one-flavor of the Wilson fermion. We study the phase diagram in the $(\beta,\kappa)$ plane performing a detailed analysis of the scaling behavior of the Lee-Yang zeros and the peak height of the chiral susceptibility. Our results strongly indicate that the whole range of the phase transition line starting from $(\beta,\kappa)=(0.0,0.380665(59))$ and ending at $(\infty,0.25)$ belongs to the two-dimensional Ising universality class similarly to the free fermion case.
