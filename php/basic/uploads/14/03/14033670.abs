Title: A dictionary between R-operators, on-shell graphs and Yangian algebras
Authors: Johannes Broedel and Marius de Leeuw and Matteo Rosso
Abstract: We translate between different formulations of Yangian invariants relevant for the computation of tree-level scattering amplitudes in N=4 super-Yang--Mills theory. While the R-operator formulation allows to relate scattering amplitudes to structures well known from integrability, it can equally well be connected to the permutations encoded by on-shell graphs.
