Title: Entanglement of Identical Particles
Authors: F. Benatti and R. Floreanini and K. Titimbo
Abstract: Unlike for bipartite states consisting of distinguishable particles, in the case of identical parties the notion of entanglement is still under debate. In the following, we review two different approaches to the entanglement of systems consisting of two Bosons or Fermions; the first approach is based on the particle aspect typical of first quantization and identifies separable pure states as those that allow to assign two orthogonal single particle vector states to both parties. The second approach makes full use of the mode aspect of second quantization whereby separability can be formulated as absence of non-local correlation among two different sets of modes. While the first approach applies to pure states only, the second one is more general and characterizes generic entangled states. In the following, we shall show that the mode-based approach indeed contains the particle-based one.
