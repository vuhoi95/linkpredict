Title: Spectral flow as a map between N=(2,0)-models
Authors: P. Athanasopoulos and A. E. Faraggi and D. Gepner
Abstract: The space of $(2,0)$ models is of particular interest among all heterotic-string models because it includes the models with the minimal $SO(10)$ unification structure, which is well motivated by the Standard Model of particle physics data. The fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ heterotic-string models revealed the existence of a new symmetry in the space of string configurations under the exchange of spinors and vectors of the $SO(10)$ GUT group, dubbed spinor-vector duality. Such symmetries are important for the understanding of the landscape of string vacua and ultimately for the possible operation of a dynamical vacuum selection mechanism in string theory. In this paper we generalize this idea to arbitrary internal rational Conformal Field Theories (RCFTs). We explain how the spectral flow operator normally acting within a general $(2,2)$ theory can be used as a map between $(2,0)$ models. We describe the details, give an example and propose more simple currents that can be used in a similar way.
