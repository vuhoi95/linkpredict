Title: Vacuum contribution of photons in the theory with Lorentz and  CPT-violating terms
Authors: Tiberio de Paula Netto and Ilya L. Shapiro
Abstract: The photon contribution to the divergences and conformal anomaly in the theory with Lorentz and CPT-violating terms is evaluated. We calculate one-loop counterterms coming from the integration over electromagnetic field and check that they possess local conformal invariance. Furthermore, conformal anomaly and anomaly-induced effective action are calculated. It turns out that the new terms do not affect the dynamics of conformal factor in the anomaly-driven inflation (Starobinsky model) and its extensions. At the same time, one can expect these terms to affect gravitational wave equation and, in general, cosmic perturbations.
