Title: A class of hermitian generalized Jordan triple systems and Chern-Simons  gauge theory
Authors: Noriaki Kamiya and Matsuo Sato
Abstract: We find a class of hermitian generalized Jordan triple systems (HGJTSs) and hermitian $(\epsilon, \delta)$-Freudenthal-Kantor triple systems (HFKTSs). We apply one of the most simple HGJTSs which we find to a field theory, and obtain a typical u(N) Chern-Simons gauge theory with a fundamental matter.
