Title: Quantization of classical curves
Authors: Xiaojun Liu and Albert Schwarz
Abstract: We discuss the relation between quantum curves (defined as solutions of equation $[P,Q]=\hbar$, where $P,Q$ are ordinary differential operators) and classical curves. We illustrate this relation for the case of quantum curve that corresponds to the $(p,q)$-minimal model coupled to 2D gravity.
