Title: (0,2) SCFTs from the Leigh-Strassler Fixed Point
Authors: Nikolay Bobev and Krzysztof Pilch and Orestis Vasilakis
Abstract: We show that there is a family of two-dimensional $(0,2)$ SCFTs associated with twisted compactifications of the four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ Leigh-Strassler fixed point on a closed hyperbolic Riemann surface. We calculate the central charges for this class of theories using anomalies and $c$-extremization. In a suitable truncation of the five-dimensional maximal supergravity, we construct supersymmetric $AdS_3$ solutions that are holographic duals of those two-dimensional $(0,2)$ SCFTs. We also exhibit supersymmetric domain wall solutions that are holographically dual to the RG flows between the four-dimensional and two-dimensional theories.
