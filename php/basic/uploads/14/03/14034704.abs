Title: The first law of thermodynamics in Lifshitz black holes revisited
Authors: Yongwan Gim and Wontae Kim and Sang-Heon Yi
Abstract: We obtain the mass expression of the three- and five-dimensional Lifshitz black holes by em- ploying the recently proposed quasilocal formulation of conserved charges, which is based on the off-shell extension of the ADT formalism. Our result is consistent with the first law of black hole thermodynamics and resolves the reported discrepancy between the ADT formalism and the other conventional methods. The same mass expression of Lifshitz black holes is obtained by using an- other quasilocal method by Padmanabhan. We also discuss the reported discrepancy in the context of the extended first law of black hole thermodynamics by allowing the pressure term.
