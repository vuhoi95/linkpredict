Title: S-dual Inflation: BICEP2 data without unlikeliness
Authors: Luis A. Anchordoqui and Vernon Barger and Haim Goldberg and Xing Huang and Danny Marfatia
Abstract: We show that S-dual inflationary potentials solve the unlikeliness problem manifested in Planck data and explain the excess B-mode power observed by the BICEP2 experiment as arising from primordial tensor fluctuations.
