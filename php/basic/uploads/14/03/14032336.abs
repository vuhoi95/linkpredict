Title: Wilson loops in N=6 superspace for ABJM theory
Authors: Matteo Rosso and Cristian Vergu
Abstract: In this paper we construct a light-like polygonal Wilson loop in N=6 superspace for ABJM theory. We then use it to obtain constraints on its two- and three-loop bosonic version, by focusing on higher order terms in the $\theta$ expansion. The Grassmann expansion of the three-loop answer contains integrals which may be elliptic polylogarithms. Our results take their simplest form when expressed in terms of OSp(6|4) supertwistors.
