Title: Abelian-Higgs model from Cho-Faddeev-Niemi decomposition
Authors: Ahmad Mohamadnejad and Sedigheh Deldar
Abstract: Applying Cho-Faddeev-Niemi decomposition for SU(2) Yang-Mills field, we obtain the Abelian-Higgs Lagrangian by some approximation. Abelian-Higgs Lagrangian with a spontaneous symmetry breaking potential has vortex solutions known as Nielsen-Olesen solutions. We conclude that vortices as well as magnetic monopoles can exist in Cho-Faddeev-Niemi decomposition of SU(2) Yang-Mills field.
