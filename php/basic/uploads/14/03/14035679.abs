Title: FRW Cosmological Perturbations in Massive Bigravity
Authors: D. Comelli and M. Crisostomi and L. Pilo
Abstract: Cosmological perturbations of FRW solutions in ghost free massive bigravity, including also a second matter sector, are studied in detail. At early time, we find that sub horizon exponential instabilities are unavoidable and they lead to a premature departure from the perturbative regime of cosmological perturbations.
