Title: An exact representation isotropic and anisotropic noncommutative phase  spaces, and their relations
Authors: H. Kakuhata and M. Nakamura
Abstract: Noncommutative phase space of an arbitrary dimension is considered. The both of operators coordinates and momenta in noncommutative phase space may be noncommutative. In this paper, we introduce momentum-momentum noncommutativity in addition to coordinate-coordinate noncommutativity. We find an exact form for the linear coordinate transformation which relates a noncommutative phase space to the corresponding ordinary one. As an example, the Hamiltonian of a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator is examined.
