Title: Towards large r from [p,q]-inflation
Authors: Eran Palti and Timo Weigand
Abstract: The recent discovery of B-mode polarizations in the CMB by the BICEP2 collaboration motivates the study of large-field inflation models which can naturally lead to significant tensor-to-scalar ratios. A class of such models in string theory are axion monodromy models, where the shift symmetry of an axion is broken by some branes. In type IIB string theory such models so far utilized NS5 branes which lead to a linear potential with an induced tensor-to-scalar ratio of $r \sim 0.07$. In this short note we study a modification of the scenario to include [p,q] 7-branes and show that this leads to an enhanced tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \sim 0.14$. Unlike 5-branes, 7-branes are in-principle compatible with supersymmetry, however we find that an implementation of the inflationary scenario requires an explicit breaking of supersymmetry by the 7-branes during inflation. This leads to similar challenges as in 5-brane models. We discuss the relation to high-scale supersymmetry breaking after inflation.
