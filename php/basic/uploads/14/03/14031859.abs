Title: The Quantum Spectral Curve of the ABJM theory
Authors: Andrea Cavagli√† and Davide Fioravanti and Nikolay Gromov and Roberto Tateo
Abstract: Recently, it was shown that the spectrum of anomalous dimensions and other important observables in N = 4 SYM are encoded into a simple nonlinear Riemann-Hilbert problem: the P\mu-system or Quantum Spectral Curve. In this letter we present the P\mu-system for the spectrum of the ABJM theory. This may be an important step towards the exact determination of the interpolating function h(\lambda) characterising the integrability of the ABJM model. We also discuss a surprising symmetry between the P\mu-system equations for N = 4 SYM and ABJM.
