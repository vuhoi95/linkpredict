Title: Remarks on the spin-one Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau equation in the presence of  nonminimal vector interactions in (3+1) dimensions
Authors: Luis B. Castro and Luiz P. de Oliveira
Abstract: We point out a misleading treatment in the recent literature regarding analytical solutions for nonminimal vector interaction for spin-one particles in the context of the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) formalism. In those papers, the authors use improperly the nonminimal vector interaction endangering in their main conclusions. We present a few properties of the nonminimal vector interactions and also present the correct equations to this problem. We show that the solution can be easily found by solving Schr\"{o}dinger-like equations. As an application of this procedure, we consider spin-one particles in presence of a nonminimal vector linear potential.
