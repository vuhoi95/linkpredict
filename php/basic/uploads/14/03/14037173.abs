Title: Constraints on the cosmological parameters from BICEP2, Planck and WMAP
Authors: Cheng Cheng and Qing-Guo Huang
Abstract: In this paper we constrain the cosmological parameters, in particular the tilt of tensor power spectrum, by adopting Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization (B2), Planck released in 2013 (P13) and Wilkinson Microwaves Anisotropy Probe 9-year Polarization (WP) data. We find that a blue tilted tensor power spectrum is preferred at more than $3\sigma$ confidence level if the data from B2 are assumed to be totally interpreted as the relic gravitational waves, but a scale invariant tensor power spectrum is consistent with the data once the polarized dust is taken into account. The recent Planck 353 GHz HFI dust polarization data imply that the B2 data are perfectly consistent with there being no gravitational wave signal.
