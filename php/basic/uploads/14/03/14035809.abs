Title: Density-curvature response and gravitational anomaly
Authors: Andrey Gromov and Alexander G. Abanov
Abstract: We study constraints imposed by the Galilean invariance on linear electromagnetic and elastic responses of two-dimensional gapped systems in background magnetic field. Exact relations between response functions following from the Ward identities are derived. In addition to viscosity-conductivity relations known in literature we find new relations between the density-curvature response and the chiral central charge.
