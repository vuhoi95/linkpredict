Title: The Imaginary Starobinsky Model
Authors: Sergio Ferrara and Alex Kehagias and Antonio Riotto
Abstract: The recent detection by the BICEP2 collaboration of a high level of tensor modes seems to exclude the Starobinsky model of inflation. In this paper we show that this conclusion can be avoided: one can embed the Starobinsky model in supergravity and identify the inflaton field with the imaginary (instead of the real) part of the chiral scalaron multiplet in its formulation. Once coupled to matter, the Starobinsky model may then become the chaotic quadratic model with shift symmetry during inflation and is in good agreement with the current data.
