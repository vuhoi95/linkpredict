Title: The solution of an open XXZ chain with arbitrary spin revisited
Authors: Rajan Murgan and Christopher Silverthorn
Abstract: The Bethe ansatz solutions for an open XXZ spin chain with arbitrary spin with N sites and nondiagonal boundary terms are revisited. The anisotropy parameter, for cases considered here, has values \eta = i \pi r/q, where r and q are positive integers with q restricted to odd integers. Numerical results are presented to support the solutions.
