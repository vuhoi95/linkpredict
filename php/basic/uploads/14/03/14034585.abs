Title: Reconstructing the Local Potential of Inflation with BICEP2 data
Authors: Yin-Zhe Ma and Yi Wang
Abstract: We locally reconstruct the inflationary potential by using the current constraints on $r$ and $n_{\rm s}$ from BICEP2 data. Assuming small and negligible $\alpha_{\rm s}$, the inflationary potential is approximately linear in $\Delta\phi\sim M_{\rm pl}$ range but becomes non-linear in $\Delta\phi\sim 10 M_{\rm pl}$ range. However if we vary the value of $\alpha_{\rm s}$ within the range given by constraints from {\it Planck} measurement, the local reconstruction is only valid in the range of $\Delta\phi\sim 0.4 M_{\rm pl}$, which challenges the inflationary background from the point of view of effective field theory. We show that, within the range of $\Delta \phi \sim 0.4 M_{\rm pl}$, the inflation potential can be precisely reconstructed. With the current reconstruction, we show that $V(\phi) \sim \phi^{2}$ and $\phi^{3}$ are consistent, while $\phi$ model is ruled out by $95\%$ confidence level of the reconstructed range of potential. This sets up a strong limit of large-field inflation models.
