Authors: Xiao-Long Du and Ke Yang and Xin-He Meng and Yu-Xiao Liu
Abstract: We study the large scale structure formation in Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity. It is found that the linear growth of scalar perturbations in EiBI gravity deviates from that in general relativity for modes with large wave numbers ($k$), but the deviation is largely suppressed with the expansion of the Universe. We investigate the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect in EiBI gravity, and find that its effect on the angular power spectrum of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is almost the same as that in the Lambda-cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. We further calculate the linear matter power spectrum in EiBI gravity and compare it with that in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Deviation is found on small scales ($k\gtrsim 0.1 h$ Mpc$^{-1}$), which can be tested in the future by observations from galaxy surveys.
