Title: Calculation of the transverse parton distribution functions at  next-to-next-to-leading order
Authors: Thomas Gehrmann and Thomas Luebbert and Li Lin Yang
Abstract: We describe the perturbative calculation of the transverse parton distribution functions in all partonic channels up to next-to-next-to-leading order based on a gauge invariant operator definition. We demonstrate the cancellation of light-cone divergences and show that universal process-independent transverse parton distribution functions can be obtained through a refactorization. Our results serve as the first explicit higher-order calculation of these functions starting from first principles, and can be used to perform next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic $q_T$ resummation for a large class of processes at hadron colliders.
