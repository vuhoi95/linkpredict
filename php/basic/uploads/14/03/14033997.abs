Title: Fluctuations of cosmological birefringence and the effect on CMB B-mode  polarization
Authors: Wen Zhao and Mingzhe Li
Abstract: The cosmological birefringence caused by the coupling between the cosmic scalar field and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons through the Chern-Simons term can rotate the polarization planes of the photons, and mix the CMB E-mode and B-mode polarizations. The rotation angle induced by the dynamical scalar field can be separated into the isotropic background part and the anisotropic fluctuations. The effect of the background part has been be studied in the previous work (Zhao & Li, arXiv:1402.4324). In this paper, we focus on the influence of the anisotropies of the rotation angle. We first assume that the cosmic scalar field is massless, consistent with other works, we find that the rotation spectrum can be quite large, which may be detected by the potential CMB observations. However, if the scalar field is identified as the quintessence field, by detailed discussing both the entropy and adiabatic perturbation modes for the first time, we find that the anisotropies of the rotation angle are always too small to be detectable.In addition, as the main goal of this paper, we investigate the effect of rotated polarization power spectrum on the detection of relic gravitational waves. we find that, the rotated B-mode polarization could be fairly large, and comparable with those generated by the gravitational waves. This forms a new contamination for the detection of relic gravitational waves in the CMB. In particular, we also propose the method to reconstruct and subtract the rotated B-mode polarization, by which the residuals become negligible for the gravitational-wave detection.
