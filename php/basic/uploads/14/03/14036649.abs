Abstract: We explore conformal-anomaly driven inflation in $F(R)$ gravity without invoking the scalar-tensor representation. We derive the stress-energy tensor of the quantum anomaly in the flat homogeneous and isotropic universe. We investigate a suitable toy model of exponential gravity plus the quantum contribution due to the conformal anomaly, which leads to the de Sitter solution. It is shown that in $F(R)$ gravity model, the curvature perturbations with its enough amplitude consistent with the observations are generated during inflation. We also evaluate the number of $e$-folds at the inflationary stage and the spectral index $n_\mathrm{s}$ of scalar modes of the curvature perturbations by analogy with scalar tensor theories, and compare them with the observational data. As a result, it is found that the Ricci scalar decreases during inflation and the standard evolution history of the universe is recovered at the small curvature regime. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that in our model, the tensor-to-scalar ratio of the curvature perturbations can be a finite value within the $68\%\,\mathrm{CL}$ error of the very recent result found by the BICEP2 experiment.
