Title: Two scalar field cosmology from coupled one-field models
Authors: P. H. R. S. Moraes and J. R. L. Santos
Abstract: One possible description for the current accelerated expansion of the universe is quintessence dynamics. The basic idea of quintessence consists of analyzing cosmological scenarios driven by scalar fields. In this work we present some interesting features on the cosmological scenario obtained from the solutions of an effective two scalar field model in a flat space-time. This effective model was constructed by coupling two single scalar field systems in a nontrivial way via an extension method. The solutions related to the fields allowed us to compute analytical cosmological parameters. The behavior of these parameters are highlighted, as well as the different epochs obtained from them.
