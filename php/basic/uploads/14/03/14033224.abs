Title: A Quantum Bound-State Description of Black Holes
Authors: Stefan Hofmann and Tehseen Rug
Abstract: A relativistic framework for the description of bound states consisting of a large number of quantum constituents is presented, and applied to black-hole interiors. At the parton level, the constituent distribution, number and energy density inside black holes are calculated, and gauge corrections are discussed. A simple scaling relation between the black hole mass and constituent number is established.
