Title: N=1 Duality in the Chiral Limit from N=2 Duality
Authors: M. Shifman and A. Yung
Abstract: We study a deformation of N=2 supersymmetric QCD with U(N) gauge group and N_f quark flavors induced by the mass term \mu for the adjoint matter which breaks supersymmetry down to N=1 QCD. Recently this deformation was shown to lead to a weakly coupled dual theory only in two particular sets of vacua: the r=N vacuum and the so-called zero vacua which can be found at r< N_f-N, where r is the number of condensed quarks. For small quark masses and intermediate values of \mu the gauge group of the dual theory is U(N_f-N)\times U(1)^{2N-N_f} where the Abelian sector is heavy and can be integrated out. However, at larger values of \mu the Abelian sector enters the strong coupling regime. We show that the 't Hooft matching conditions in the chiral limit require the Seiberg neutral meson field M from this sector to become light. In the r=N vacuum M is constructed of a monopole and antimonopole connected by a confining magnetic strings while in the zero vacua it is built of a quark and antiquark connected by a confining electric strings.
