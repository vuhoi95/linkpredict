Title: Power-law Solutions from Heterotic Strings
Authors: Tibra Ali and S. Shajidul Haque
Abstract: In this paper we search for accelerating power-law and ekpyrotic solutions in heterotic string theory with NS-NS fluxes compactified on half-flat and generalized half-flat manifolds. We restrict our searches to the STZ sector of the theory and include linear order $\alpha'$ corrections when looking for accelerating solutions. We find two ekpyrotic solutions in the case when the heterotic string theory is compactified on generalized half-flat manifolds. We do not find accelerating solutions in any of the models.
