Title: Down the rabbit hole with theories of class S
Authors: Shlomo S. Razamat and Brian Willett
Abstract: We review some of the properties of 3d N=4 theories obtained by dimensionally reducing theories of class S. We study 3d partition functions, and certain limits thereof, for such theories, and the properties implied for these by 3d mirror symmetry.
