Title: Quadratic thermal terms in the deconfined phase from holography
Authors: Fen Zuo and Yi-Hong Gao
Abstract: Recent lattice simulation has uncovered many interesting properties of SU(N) gauge theory at finite temperature. Especially, above the deconfinement phase transition all the thermodynamics quantities acquire significant quadratic contributions in inverse temperature. Such a term is also found to dominate the logarithmic of the renormalized Polyakov loop. Using the Hawking-Page transition in Anti-de Sitter space as an example, we show how such contributions can be naturally generated in the holographic approach.
