Title: A Shortcut to General Tree-level Scattering Amplitudes in N=4 SYM via  Integrability
Authors: Nils Kanning and Tomasz Lukowski and Matthias Staudacher
Abstract: We combine recent applications of the two-dimensional quantum inverse scattering method to the scattering amplitude problem in four-dimensional N=4 Super Yang-Mills theory. Integrability allows us to obtain a general, explicit method for the derivation of the Yangian invariants relevant for tree-level scattering amplitudes in the N=4 model.
