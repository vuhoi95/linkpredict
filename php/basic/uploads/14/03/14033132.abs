Title: Probing features of the Lee-Wick quantum electrodynamics
Authors: R. Turcati and M. J. Neves
Abstract: In this paper we discuss some aspects concerning the electromagnetic sector of the abelian Lee-Wick (LW) quantum electrodynamics (QED). Using the Dirac's theory of constrained systems, the higher-order canonical quantization of the LW electromagnetism is performed. A quantum bound on the LW heavy mass is also estimated using the best known measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron. Finally it is shown that magnetic monopoles can coexist peacefully in the LW scenario.
