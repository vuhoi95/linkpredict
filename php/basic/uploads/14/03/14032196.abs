Title: Quasi-local charges and asymptotic symmetry generators
Authors: Seungjoon Hyun and Sang-A Park and Sang-Heon Yi
Abstract: The quasi-local formulation of conserved charges through the off-shell approach is extended to cover the asymptotic symmetry generators. By introducing identically conserved currents which are appropriate for asymptotic Killing vectors, we show that the asymptotic symmetry generators can be understood as quasi-local charges. We also show that this construction is completely consistent with the on-shell method.
