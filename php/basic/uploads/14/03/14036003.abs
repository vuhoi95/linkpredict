Title: Critical exponents of the 3d Ising and related models from Conformal  Bootstrap
Authors: Ferdinando Gliozzi and Antonio Rago
Abstract: The constraints of conformal bootstrap are applied to investigate a set of conformal field theories in various dimensions. The prescriptions can be applied to both unitary and non unitary theories allowing for the study of the spectrum of low-lying primary operators of the theory. We evaluate the lowest scaling dimensions of the local operators associated with the Yang-Lee edge singularity for $2 \le D \le 6$. Likewise we obtain the scaling dimensions of six scalars and four spinning operators for the 3d critical Ising model. Our findings are in agreement with existing results to a per mill precision and estimate several new exponents.
