Title: Spacetime singularity resolution in Snyder noncommutative space
Authors: M. A. Gorji and K. Nozari and B. Vakili
Abstract: Inspired by quantum gravity proposal, we construct a deformed phase space which supports the UV and IR cutoffs. We show that the Liouville theorem is satisfied in the deformed phase space which allows us to formulate the thermodynamics of the early Universe in the semiclassical regime. Applying the proposed method to the Snyder noncommutative space, we find a temperature dependent equation of state which opens a new window for natural realization of inflation as a phase transition from quantum gravity regime to the standard radiation dominated era. Also we obtain finite energy and entropy densities for the Universe, when at least the Weak Energy Condition is satisfied. We show that there is a minimum size for the Universe which is proportional to the Planck length and consequently the Big Bang singularity is removed.
