Title: Algebraically special solutions in AdS/CFT
Authors: Gabriel Bernardi de Freitas and Harvey S. Reall
Abstract: We investigate the AdS/CFT interpretation of the class of algebraically special solutions of Einstein gravity with a negative cosmological constant. Such solutions describe a CFT living in a 2+1 dimensional time-dependent geometry that, generically, has no isometries. The algebraically special condition implies that the expectation value of the CFT energy-momentum tensor is a local function of the boundary metric. When such a spacetime is slowly varying, the fluid/gravity approximation is valid and one can read off the values of certain higher order transport coefficients. To do this, we introduce a formalism for studying conformal, relativistic fluids in 2+1 dimensions that reduces everything to the manipulation of scalar quantities.
