Title: Cosmology of the proxy theory to massive gravity
Authors: Lavinia Heisenberg and Rampei Kimura and Kazuhiro Yamamoto
Abstract: In this paper, we scrutinize very closely the cosmology in the proxy theory to massive gravity obtained in Phys. Rev. D84 (2011) 043503. This proxy theory was constructed by covariantizing the decoupling limit Lagrangian of massive gravity and represents a subclass of Horndeski scalar-tensor theory. Thus, this covariantization unifies two important classes of modified gravity theories, namely massive gravity and Horndeski theories. We go beyond the regime which was studied in Phys. Rev. D84 (2011) 043503 and show that the theory does not admit any homogeneous and isotropic self-accelerated solutions. We illustrate that the only attractor solution is flat Minkowski solution, hence this theory is less appealing as a dark energy model. We also show that the absence of de Sitter solutions is tightly related to the presence of shift symmetry breaking interactions.
