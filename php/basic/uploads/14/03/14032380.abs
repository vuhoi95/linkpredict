Title: Torus partition functions and spectra of gauged linear sigma models
Authors: Stefan Groot Nibbelink and Fabian Ruehle
Abstract: Worldsheet (0,2) gauged linear sigma models are often used to study supersymmetric heterotic string compactifications with non-trivial vector bundles. We make use of supersymmetric localization techniques to determine their one-loop partition functions. In particular we derive conditions which ensure that the full partition function is modular invariant and we propose a method to determine the massless and massive target space matter spectrum.
