Title: Topology of crystalline insulators and superconductors
Authors: Ken Shiozaki and Masatoshi Sato
Abstract: We complete a classification of topological phases and their topological defects in crystalline insulators and superconductors. We consider topological phases and defects described by non-interacting Bloch and Bogoliubov de Gennes Hamiltonians that support additional order-two spatial symmetry, besides any of ten classes of symmetries defined by time-reversal symmetry and particle-hole symmetry. The additional order-two spatial symmetry we consider is general and it includes $Z_2$ global symmetry, mirror reflection, two-fold rotation, inversion, and their magnetic point group symmetries. We find that the topological periodic table shows a novel periodicity in the number of flipped coordinates under the order-two spatial symmetry, in addition to the Bott-periodicity in the space dimensions. Various symmetry protected topological phases and gapless modes will be identified and discussed in a unified framework. We also present topological classification of symmetry protected Fermi points. The bulk classification and the surface Fermi point classification provide a novel realization of the bulk-boundary correspondence in terms of the K-theory.
