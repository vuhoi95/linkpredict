Title: BICEP2, the Higgs Mass and the SUSY-breaking Scale
Authors: Luis E. Ibanez and Irene Valenzuela
Abstract: Recent BICEP2 results on CMB polarisation B-modes suggest a high value for the inflation scale $V_0^{1/4} \simeq 10^{16}$ GeV, giving experimental evidence for a physical scale in between the EW scale and the Planck mass. We propose that this new high scale could be interpreted as evidence for a high SUSY breaking scale $M_{ss}\simeq 10^{12}-10^{13}$ GeV. We show that such a large value for $M_{ss}$ is consistent with a Higgs mass around 126 GeV. We briefly discuss some possible particle physics implications of this assumption.
