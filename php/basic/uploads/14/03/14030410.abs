Title: Multi-Natural Inflation in Supergravity
Authors: Michael Czerny and Tetsutaro Higaki and Fuminobu Takahashi
Abstract: We show that the recently proposed multi-natural inflation can be realized within the framework of 4D ${\cal N}=1$ supergravity. The inflaton potential mainly consists of two sinusoidal potentials that are comparable in size, but have different periodicity with a possible non-zero relative phase. For a sub-Planckian decay constant, the multi-natural inflation model is reduced to axion hilltop inflation. We show that, taking into account the effect of the relative phase, the spectral index can be increased to give a better fit to the Planck results, with respect to the hilltop quartic inflation. We also consider a possible UV completion based on a string-inspired model. Interestingly, the Hubble parameter during inflation is necessarily smaller than the gravitino mass, avoiding possible moduli destabilization. Reheating processes as well as non-thermal leptogenesis are also discussed.
