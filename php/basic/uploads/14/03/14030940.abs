Title: NS-NS Sector of Closed Superstring Field Theory
Authors: Theodore Erler and Sebastian Konopka and Ivo Sachs
Abstract: We give a construction for a general class of vertices in superstring field theory which include integration over bosonic moduli as well as the required picture changing insertions. We apply this procedure to find a covariant action for the NS-NS sector of Type II closed superstring field theory.
