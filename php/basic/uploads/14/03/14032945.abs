Title: Gluing Nekrasov partition functions
Authors: Jian Qiu and Luigi Tizzano and Jacob Winding and Maxim Zabzine
Abstract: In this paper we summarise the localisation calculation of 5D super Yang-Mills on simply connected toric Sasaki-Einstein (SE) manifolds. We show how various aspects of the computation, including the equivariant index, the asymptotic behaviour and the factorisation property are governed by the combinatorial data of the toric geometry. We prove that the full perturbative partition function on a simply connected SE manifold corresponding to an n-gon toric diagram factorises to n copies of perturbative Nekrasov partition function. This leads us to conjecture the full partition function as gluing n copies of full Nekrasov partition function. This work is a generalisation of some earlier computation carried out on $Y^{p,q}$ manifolds, whose moment map cone has a quadrangle and our result is valid for manifolds whose moment map cones have pentagon base, hexagon base, etc. The algorithm we used for dealing with general cones may also be of independent interest.
