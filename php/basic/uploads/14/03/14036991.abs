Title: Stable static structures in models with higher-order derivatives
Authors: D. Bazeia and A. S. Lobao Jr and R. Menezes
Abstract: We investigate the presence of static solutions in generalized models described by a real scalar field in four-dimensional space-time. We study models in which the scalar field engenders higher-order derivatives and spontaneous symmetry breaking, inducing the presence of domain walls. Despite the presence of higher-order derivatives, the models keep to equations of motion second-order differential equations, so we focus on the presence of first-order equations that help us to obtain analytical solutions and investigate linear stability on general grounds. We then illustrate the general results with some specific examples, showing that the domain wall may become compact and that the zero mode may split. Moreover, if the model is further generalized to include k-field behavior, it may contribute to split the static structure itself.
