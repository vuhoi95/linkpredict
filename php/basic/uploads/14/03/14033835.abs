Title: Holographic positive energy theorems in three-dimensional gravity
Authors: Glenn Barnich and Blagoje Oblak
Abstract: The covariant phase space of three-dimensional asymptotically flat and anti-de Sitter gravity is controlled by well-understood coadjoint orbits of the Virasoro group. Detailed knowledge on the behavior of the energy functional on these orbits can be used to discuss positive energy theorems.
