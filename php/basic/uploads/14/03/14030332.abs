Title: Scalar-Tensor Gravity Cosmology: Noether symmetries and analytical  solutions
Authors: A. Paliathanasis and M. Tsamparlis and S. Basilakos and S. Capozziello
Abstract: In this paper, we present a complete Noether Symmetry analysis in the framework of scalar-tensor cosmology. Specifically, we consider a non-minimally coupled scalar field action embedded in the FLRW spacetime and provide a full set of Noether symmetries for related minisuperspaces. The presence of symmetries implies that the dynamical system becomes integrable and then we can compute cosmological analytical solutions for specific functional forms of coupling and potential functions selected by the Noether Approach.
