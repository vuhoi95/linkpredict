Title: Special Killing forms on toric Sasaki-Einstein manifolds
Authors: Vladimir Slesar and Mihai Visinescu and Gabriel Eduard Vilcu
Abstract: In this paper we study the interplay between complex coordinates on the Calabi-Yau metric cone and the special Killing forms on the toric Sasaki-Einstein manifold. In the general case we give a procedure to locally construct the special Killing forms. In the final part we exemplify the general scheme in the case of the $5-$dimensional $Y^{p,q}$ spaces, identifying the additional special Killing 2-forms which were previously obtained by the second author of the present paper, but with a different method, in [Mod. Phys. Lett. A 27 (2012) 1250217].
