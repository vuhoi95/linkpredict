Title: Three-dimensional Lorentz-violating action
Authors: J. R. Nascimento and A. Yu. Petrov and C. Wotzasek and C. A. D. Zarro
Abstract: We demonstrate the generation of the three-dimensional Chern-Simons-like Lorentz-breaking ``mixed" quadratic action via an appropriate Lorentz-breaking coupling of vector and scalar fields to the spinor field and study some features of the scalar QED with such a term. We show that the same term emerges through a nonpertubative method, namely the Julia-Toulouse approach of condensation of charges and defects.
