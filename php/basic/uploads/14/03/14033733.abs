Title: Entanglement Entropy: A Perturbative Calculation
Authors: Vladimir Rosenhaus and Michael Smolkin
Abstract: We provide a framework for a perturbative evaluation of the reduced density matrix. The method is based on a path integral in the analytically continued spacetime. It suggests an alternative to the holographic and `standard' replica trick calculations of entanglement entropy. We implement this method within solvable field theory examples to evaluate leading order corrections induced by small perturbations in the geometry of the background and entangling surface. Our findings are in accord with Solodukhin's formula for the universal term of entanglement entropy for four dimensional CFTs.
