Title: Emergent Lorentz Signature, Fermions, and the Standard Model
Authors: John Kehayias and Shinji Mukohyama and Jean-Philippe Uzan
Abstract: This article investigates the construction of fermions and the formulation of the Standard Model of particle physics in a theory in which the Lorentz signature emerges from an underlying microscopic purely Euclidean $SO(4)$ theory. Couplings to a clock field are responsible for triggering the change of signature of the effective metric in which the standard fields propagate. We demonstrate that Weyl and Majorana fermions can be constructed in this framework. This construction differs from other studies of Euclidean fermions, as the coupling to the clock field allows us to write down an action which flows to the usual action in Minkowski spacetime. We then show how the Standard Model can be obtained in this theory and consider the constraints on non-Standard-Model operators which can appear in the QED sector due to CPT and Lorentz violation.
