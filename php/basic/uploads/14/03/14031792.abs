Title: Reply to Comment on "Inflation with a graceful exit and entrance driven  by Hawking radiation"
Authors: Sujoy K Modak and Douglas Singleton
Abstract: The comment [1, arXiv:1308.5573] raises two points in regard to our work [2, arXiv:1207.0230]. The first is that one cannot use the tunneling picture to obtain the temperature and particle production rate in the Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) space-time. The second comment raised by [1] is that the Hawking-like radiation model for inflation presented in [2,3] is inconsistent with the observed scalar and tensor perturbation spectrum. We show that the first comment is beside the point -- we do not use the tunneling method in our works [2,3]. The second criticism in [1] comes from the author evaluating quantities at different times -- he evaluates the parameters of our model at the ``beginning'' of inflation and then compares this with the scalar and tensor perturbations evaluated at ``the horizon exit'' point.
