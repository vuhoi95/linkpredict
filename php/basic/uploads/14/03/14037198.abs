Title: Strings and Branes are Waves
Authors: Joel Berkeley and David S. Berman and Felix J. Rudolph
Abstract: We examine the equations of motion of double field theory and the duality manifest form of M-theory. We show the solutions of the equations of motion corresponding to null pp-waves correspond to strings or membranes from the usual spacetime perspective. A Goldstone mode analysis of the null wave solution in double field theory produces the equations of motion of the duality manifest string.
