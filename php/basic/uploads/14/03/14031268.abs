Title: Extremal Bundles on Calabi-Yau Threefolds
Authors: Peng Gao and Yang-Hui He and Shing-Tung Yau
Abstract: We study constructions of stable holomorphic vector bundles on Calabi-Yau threefolds, especially those with exact anomaly cancellation which we call extremal. By going through the known databases we find that such examples are rare in general and can be ruled out for the spectral cover construction for all elliptic threefolds. We then introduce a generalized version of Hartshorne-Serre construction and use it to yield extremal bundles of general ranks and study their geometry. In light of this probing the geometry of the space of stable vector bundles, we revisit the DRY conjecture on stable reflexive sheaves while focusing on the distribution of Chern numbers to use both theoretical and statistical ideas to provide evidence for DRY.
