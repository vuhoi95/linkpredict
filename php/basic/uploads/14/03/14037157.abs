Title: Conformal inflation from the Higgs
Authors: Renato Costa and Horatiu Nastase
Abstract: We modify the conformal inflation set-up of \cite{Kallosh:2013hoa}, with a local Weyl invariance, a dynamical Planck scale and an $SO(1,1)$ invariance at high energies, in order to be able to identify the physical scalar with the physical Higgs at low energies, similar to the cyclic Higgs models of \cite{Bars:2013vba}. We obtain a general class of exponentially-corrected potentials that gives a generalized Starobinsky model with an infinite series of $R^p$ corrections, tracing a line in the $(r,n_s)$ plane for CMB fluctuations, with an $r$ that can be made to agree with the recent BICEP2 measurement. Introducing a coupling different from the conformal value, thus breaking the local Weyl symmetry, leads nevertheless to a very strong attractor motion towards the generalized Starobinsky line.
