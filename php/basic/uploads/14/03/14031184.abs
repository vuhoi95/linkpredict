Title: The Boltzmann Equation in Classical Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: V. Mathieu and A. H. Mueller and D. N. Triantafyllopoulos
Abstract: We give a detailed derivation of the Boltzmann equation, and in particular its collision integral, in classical field theory. We first carry this out in a scalar theory with both cubic and quartic interactions and subsequently in a Yang-Mills theory. Our method is not relied on a doubling of the fields, rather it is based on a diagrammatic approach representing the classical solution to the problem.
