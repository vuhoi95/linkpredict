Title: Remarks about the Tensor Mode Detection by the BICEP2 Collaboration and  the Super-Planckian Excursions of the Inflaton Field
Authors: Alex Kehagias and Antonio Riotto
Abstract: The recent detection by the BICEP2 collaboration of a high level of tensor modes has relevant implications which we briefly discuss in this short note. In particular, the large angle CMB B- mode polarisation seems to imply problematic super-Planckian excursions of the inflaton field. We provide some comments about this point and in particular we stress a natural resolution to it: given our current (and probably future) observational ignorance about the true source of the scalar perturbations, one should abandon the theoretical prejudice that they are associated to the inflaton fluctuations.
