Title: Heavy tetraquark confining potential in Coulomb gauge QCD
Authors: Carina Popovici and Christian S. Fischer
Abstract: We present an analytic nonperturbative solution of the Yakubovsky equation for tetraquark states in the case of equal separations and energies, and demonstrate a direct connection between the tetraquark confinement potential and the temporal gluon propagator. To this end we employ a leading-order heavy quark mass expansion of the Coulomb gauge QCD action, and use the dressed two-point functions of the Yang-Mills sector only. As a result we find a bound state energy that rises linear with distance and a string tension twice as large as in a $q\bar{q}$-system.
