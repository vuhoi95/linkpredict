Title: Cosmology with Ricci-type dark energy
Authors: W. Zimdahl and J. C. Fabris and S. del Campo and R. Herrera
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of a cosmological substratum of pressureless matter and holographic dark energy with a cutoff length proportional to the Ricci scale. Stability requirements for the matter perturbations are shown to single out a model with a fixed relation between the present matter fraction $\Omega_{m0}$ and the present value $\omega_{0}$ of the equation-of-state parameter of the dark energy. This model has the same number of free parameters as the $\Lambda$CDM model but it has no $\Lambda$CDM limit. We discuss the consistency between background observations and the mentioned stability-guaranteeing parameter combination.
