Abstract: We analyze the fermionic wigging of 1/2-BPS (electric) extremal black hole attractors in N=2, D=5 ungauged Maxwell-Einstein supergravity theories, by exploiting anti-Killing spinors supersymmetry transformations. Regardless of the specific data of the real special geometry of the manifold defining the scalars of the vector multiplets, and differently from the D=4 case, we find that there are no corrections for the near--horizon attractor value of the scalar fields; an analogous result also holds for 1/2-BPS (magnetic) extremal black string. Thus, the attractor mechanism receives no fermionic corrections in D=5 (at least in the BPS sector).
