Title: Deformations with Maximal Supersymmetries Part 1: On-shell Formulation
Authors: Chi-Ming Chang and Ying-Hsuan Lin and Yifan Wang and Xi Yin
Abstract: We study deformations of maximally supersymmetric gauge theories by higher dimensional operators in various spacetime dimensions. We classify infinitesimal deformations that preserve all 16 supersymmetries, while allowing the possibility of breaking either Lorentz or R-symmetry, using an on-shell algebraic method developed by Movshev and Schwarz. We also consider the problem of extending the deformation beyond the first order.
