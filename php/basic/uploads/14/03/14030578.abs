Title: Universal Thermal Corrections to Single Interval Entanglement Entropy  for Conformal Field Theories
Authors: John Cardy and Christopher P. Herzog
Abstract: We consider single interval R\'enyi and entanglement entropies for a two dimensional conformal field theory on a circle at nonzero temperature. Assuming that the finite size of the system introduces a unique ground state with a nonzero mass gap, we calculate the leading corrections to the R\'enyi and entanglement entropy in a low temperature expansion. These corrections have a universal form for any two dimensional conformal field theory that depends only on the size of the mass gap and its degeneracy. We analyze the limits where the size of the interval becomes small and where it becomes close to the size of the spatial circle.
