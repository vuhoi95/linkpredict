Title: The supersymmetric Ruijsenaars-Schneider model
Authors: Olivier Blondeau-Fournier and Patrick Desrosiers and Pierre Mathieu
Abstract: An integrable supersymmetric generalization of the trigonometric Ruijsenaars-Schneider model is presented whose symmetry algebra includes the super Poincar\'e algebra. Moreover, its Hamiltonian is showed to be diagonalized by the recently introduced Macdonald superpolynomials. Somewhat surprisingly, the consistency of the scalar product forces the discreteness of the Hilbert space.
