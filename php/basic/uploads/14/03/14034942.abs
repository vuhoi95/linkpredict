Title: Geometrical hierarchies in classical supergravity
Authors: Hui Luo and Fabio Zwirner
Abstract: We introduce a $N=1$ supergravity model with a very simple hidden sector coupled to the electroweak gauge and Higgs sectors of the MSSM. At the classical level, supersymmetry and $SU(2)\times U(1)$ are both spontaneously broken, with vanishing vacuum energy. Two real flat directions control the two symmetry-breaking scales $m_{3/2}$ and $m_Z$. The two massless scalars are a gauge singlet and the standard Higgs boson. All other unobserved particles have masses of order $m_{3/2}$. This may be a new starting point for studying the compatibility of naturalness with the observed mass hierarchies.
