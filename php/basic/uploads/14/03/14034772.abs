Title: Lattice energy-momentum tensor from the Yang-Mills gradient flow --  inclusion of fermion fields
Authors: Hiroki Makino and Hiroshi Suzuki
Abstract: Local products of fields deformed by the so-called Yang--Mills gradient flow become renormalized composite operators. This fact has been utilized to construct a correctly normalized conserved energy--momentum tensor in the lattice formulation of the pure Yang--Mills theory. In the present paper, this construction is further generalized for vector-like gauge theories containing fermions.
