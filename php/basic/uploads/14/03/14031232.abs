Title: Global Flows in Quantum Gravity
Authors: Nicolai Christiansen and Benjamin Knorr and Jan M. Pawlowski and Andreas Rodigast
Abstract: We study four-dimensional quantum gravity using non-perturbative renormalization group methods. We solve the corresponding equations for the fully momentum-dependent propagator, Newton's coupling and the cosmological constant. For the first time, we obtain a global phase diagram where the non-Gaussian ultraviolet fixed point of asymptotic safety is connected via smooth trajectories to a classical infrared fixed point. The theory is therefore ultraviolet complete and deforms smoothly into classical gravity as the infrared limit is approached.
