Title: Separable Hilbert space for loop quantization
Authors: J. Fernando Barbero G. and Tomasz Pawłowski and Eduardo J. S. Villaseñor
Abstract: We discuss, within the simplified context provided by the polymeric harmonic oscillator, a construction leading to a separable Hilbert space that preserves some of the most important features of the spectrum of the Hamiltonian operator. This construction may be applied to other polymer quantum mechanical systems, including those of loop quantum cosmology, and is likely generalizable to certain formulations of full loop quantum gravity. It is helpful to sidestep some of the physically relevant issues that appear in that context, in particular those related to superselection and the definition of suitable ensembles for the statistical mechanics of these types of systems.
