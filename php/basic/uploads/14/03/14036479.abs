Title: Black holes in New Massive Gravity dressed by a (non)minimally coupled  scalar field
Authors: Francisco Correa and Mokhtar Hassaine and Julio Oliva
Abstract: We consider a self-interacting, massive scalar field (non)minimally coupled to new massive gravity in three dimensions. For this model, we first derive a family of black hole solutions depending on a unique integration constant and parameterized in terms of the nonminimal coupling parameter. Imposing the absence of naked singularities restricts the parameters in such a way that the field vanishes at infinity and fixes the metric to be asymptotically AdS. Within this family of solutions it is possible to find a black hole supported by a minimally coupled scalar field and therefore the existence of these solutions is not inherent to the presence of the nonminimal coupling. The Wald formula for the entropy, being proportional to the lapse function evaluated at the horizon, yields a zero entropy in spite of the fact that the solution has a non zero temperature. As a consequence, the unique integration constant may be interpreted as a sort of gravitational hair. As in the source free case, we show that the same field equations admit as well asymptotically Lifshitz black hole solutions in a different region of the space of parameters. These Lifshitz solutions are divided in three families for which all the parameters entering in the action may be expressed in term of the dynamical exponent.
