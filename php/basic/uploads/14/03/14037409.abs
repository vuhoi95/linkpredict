Abstract: Motivated by the properties of matter quantum fields in curved space-times, we work out a gravity theory that combines the Born-Infeld gravity Lagrangian with an $f(R)$ piece. To avoid ghost-like instabilities, the theory is formulated within the Palatini approach. This construction provides more freedom to address a number of important questions such as the dynamics of the early universe and the cosmic accelerated expansion, among others. In particular, we consider the effect that adding an $f(R)=a R^2$ term has on the early-time cosmology. We find that bouncing solutions are robust against these modifications of the Lagrangian whereas the solutions with {\it loitering} behavior of the original Born-Infeld theory are very sensitive to the $R^2$ term. In fact, these solutions are modified in such a way that a plateau in the $H^2$ function may arise yielding a period of (approximately) de Sitter inflationary expansion. This inflationary behavior may be found even in a radiation dominated universe.
