Abstract: Quantum Hall Effects (QHEs) on the complex Grassmann manifolds $\mathbf{Gr}_2(\mathbb{C}^N)$ are formulated. We set up the Landau problem in $\mathbf{Gr}_2(\mathbb{C}^N)$ and solve it using group theoretical techniques and provide the energy spectrum and the eigenstates in terms of the $SU(N)$ Wigner ${\cal D}$-functions for charged particles on $\mathbf{Gr}_2(\mathbb{C}^N)$ under the influence of abelian and non-abelian background magnetic monopoles or a combination of these thereof. In particular, for the simplest case of $\mathbf{Gr}_2(\mathbb{C}^4)$ we explicitly write down the $U(1)$ background gauge field as well as the single and many-particle eigenstates by introducing the Pl\"{u}cker coordinates and show by calculating the two-point correlation function that the Lowest Landau Level (LLL) at filling factor $\nu =1$ forms an incompressible fluid. Our results are in agreement with the previous results in the literature for QHE on ${\mathbb C}P^N$ and generalize them to all $\mathbf{Gr}_2(\mathbb{C}^N)$ in a suitable manner. Finally, we heuristically identify a relation between the $U(1)$ Hall effect on $\mathbf{Gr}_2(\mathbb{C}^4)$ and the Hall effect on the odd sphere $S^5$, which is yet to be investigated in detail, by appealing to the already known analogous relations between the Hall effects on ${\mathbb C}P^3$ and ${\mathbb C}P^7$ and those on the spheres $S^4$ and $S^8$, respectively.
