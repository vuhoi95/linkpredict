Title: Langevin diffusion in holographic backgrounds with hyperscaling  violation
Authors: Jafar Sadeghi and Fatemeh Pourasadollah
Abstract: In this note we consider a relativistic heavy quark which moves in the quark-gluon plasmas. By using the holographic methods, we analyze the Langevin diffusion process of this relativistic heavy quark. This heavy quark is described by a trailing string attached to a flavor brane and moving at constant velocity. The fluctuations of this string are related to the thermal correlators and the correlation functions are precisely the kinds of objects that we compute in the gravity dual picture. We obtain the action of the trailing string in hyperscaling violation backgrounds and we then find the equations of motion. These equations lead us to construct the Langevin correlator which helps us to obtain the Langevin constants. Using the Langevin correlators we derive the densities spectral and simple analytic expressions in the small and large frequency limits. We examine our works for planar and $R$-charged black holes with hyperscaling violation and find new constraints on $\theta$ in the presence of velocity $v$.
