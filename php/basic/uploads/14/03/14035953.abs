Title: Field sources in a Lorentz symmetry breaking scenario with a single  background vector
Authors: L. H. C. Borges and F. A. Barone and J. A. Helayel-Neto
Abstract: This paper is devoted to investigating the interactions between stationary sources of the electromagnetic field, in a model which exhibits explicit Lorentz-symmetry breaking due to the presence of a single background vector. We focus on physical phenomena that emerge from this kind of breaking and which have no counterpart in Maxwell Electrodynamics.
