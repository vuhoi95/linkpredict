Title: Brane Induced Gravity in the Curved Bulk
Authors: Keiichi Akama and Takashi Hattori
Abstract: Starting with the Nambu-Goto action of the braneworld embedded in a curved bulk, we derive the precise expressions for the quantum induced effects due to small fluctuations of the brane. To define the brane fluctuations invariantly, we introduce the Riemannian coordinate system for the subspace normal to the braneworld. It will turn out that we can systematically incorporate the effects of bulk curvature, and that the induced effects depend on the extrinsic curvature and the normal-connection gauge field as well as on bulk curvature components at the brane.
