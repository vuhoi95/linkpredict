Title: Cosmological Scaling Solutions for Multiple Scalar Fields
Authors: Takeshi Chiba and Antonio De Felice and Shinji Tsujikawa
Abstract: The general k-essence Lagrangian for the existence of cosmological scaling solutions is derived in the presence of multiple scalar fields coupled to a barotropic perfect fluid. In addition to the scaling fixed point associated with the dynamics during the radiation and matter eras, we also obtain a scalar-field dominated solution relevant to dark energy and discuss the stability of them in the two-field set-up. We apply our general results to a model of two canonical fields with coupled exponential potentials arising in string theory. Depending on model parameters and initial conditions, we show that the scaling matter-dominated epochs followed by an attractor with cosmic acceleration can be realized with/without the couplings to scalar fields. The different types of scaling solutions can be distinguished from each other by the evolution of the dark energy equation of state from high-redshifts to today.
