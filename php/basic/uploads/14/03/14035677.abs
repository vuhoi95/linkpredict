Title: Spin-Charge Soldering from Tensor Higgs mechanism
Authors: M. C. Diamantini and C. A. Trugenberger
Abstract: Spin-charge separation, a crucial ingredient in 2D models of strongly correlated systems, in mostly considered in condensed matter applications. In this paper we present a relativistic field-theoretic model in which charged particles of spin 1/2 emerge by soldering spinless charges and magnetic vortices in a confinement quantum phase transition modelled as a tensor Higgs mechanism. The model involves two gauge fields, a vector one and a two-form gauge field interacting by the topological BF term. When this tensor gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken charges are soldered to the ends of magnetic vortices and thus confined by a linear potential. If the vector potential has a topological $\theta $-term with value $\theta = \pi$, the constituents of this "meson" acquire spin 1/2 in this transition.
