Title: The Cremmer-Scherk Mechanism in F-theory Compactifications on K3  Manifolds
Authors: Michael R. Douglas and Daniel S. Park and Christian Schnell
Abstract: It is well understood --- through string dualities --- that there are 20 massless vector fields in the spectrum of eight-dimensional F-theory compactifications on smooth elliptically fibered K3 surfaces at a generic point in the K3 moduli space. Such F-theory vacua, which do not have any enhanced gauge symmetries, can be thought of as supersymmetric type IIB compactifications on P1 with 24 (p,q) seven-branes. Naively, one might expect there to be 24 massless vector fields in the eight-dimensional effective theory coming from world-volume gauge fields of the 24 branes. In this paper, we show how the vector field spectrum of the eight-dimensional effective theory can be obtained from the point of view of type IIB supergravity coupled to the world-volume theory of the seven-branes. In particular, we first show that the two-forms of the type IIB theory absorb the seven-brane world-volume gauge fields via the Cremmer-Scherk mechanism. We then proceed to show that the massless vector fields of the eight-dimensional theory come from KK-reducing the SL(2,Z) doublet two-forms of type IIB theory along SL(2,Z) doublet one-forms on the P1. We also discuss the relation between these vector fields and the "eaten" world-volume vector fields of the seven-branes.
