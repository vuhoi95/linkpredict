Title: Casimir energy of smooth compact surfaces
Authors: Joseph P. Straley and Eugene B. Kolomeisky
Abstract: We discuss the formalism of Balian and Duplantier for the calculation of the Casimir energy for an arbitrary smooth compact surface, and use it to give some examples: a finite cylinder with hemispherical caps, the torus, ellipsoid of revolution, a "cube" with rounded corners and edges, and a "drum" made of disks and part of a torus. We propose a model function which approximately captures the shape dependence of the Casimir energy.
