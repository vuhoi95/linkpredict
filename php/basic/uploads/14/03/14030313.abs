Title: Fine-grained uncertainty relation under the relativistic motion
Authors: Jun Feng and Yao-Zhong Zhang and Mark D. Gould and Heng Fan
Abstract: One of the most important features of quantum theory is the uncertainty principle. Amount various uncertainty relations, the profound Fine-Grained Uncertainty Relation (FGUR) is used to distinguish the uncertainty inherent in obtaining any combination of outcomes for different measurements. In this paper, we explore this uncertainty relation in relativistic regime. For observer undergoes an uniform acceleration who immersed in an Unruh thermal bath, we show that the uncertainty bound is dependent on the acceleration parameter and choice of Unruh modes. Dramatically, we find that the measurements in Mutually Unbiased Bases (MUBs), sharing same uncertainty bound in inertial frame, could be distinguished from each other for a noninertial observer. On the other hand, once the Unruh decoherence is prevented by utilizing the cavity, the entanglement could be generated from nonuniform motion. We show that, for the observer restricted in a single rigid cavity, the uncertainty exhibits a periodic evolution with respect to the duration of the acceleration and the uncertainty bounds can be degraded by the entanglement generation during particular epoch. With properly chosen cavity parameters, the uncertainty bounds could be protected. Otherwise, the measurements in different MUBs could be distinguished due to the relativistic motion of cavity. Implications of our results for gravitation and thermodynamics are discussed.
