Title: Group Momentum Space and Hopf Algebra Symmetries of Point Particles  Coupled to 2+1 Gravity
Authors: Michele Arzano and Danilo Latini and Matteo Lotito
Abstract: We present an in-depth investigation of the ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ momentum space describing point particles coupled to Einstein gravity in three space-time dimensions. We introduce different sets of coordinates on the group manifold and discuss their properties under Lorentz transformations. In particular we show how a certain set of coordinates exhibits an upper bound on the energy under deformed Lorentz boosts which saturate at the Planck energy. We discuss how this deformed symmetry framework is generally described by a quantum deformation of the Poincar\'e group: the quantum double of ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. We then illustrate how the space of functions on the group manifold momentum space has a dual representation on a non-commutative space of coordinates via a (quantum) group Fourier transform. In this context we explore the connection between Weyl maps and different notions of (quantum) group Fourier transform appeared in the literature in the past years and establish relations between them.
