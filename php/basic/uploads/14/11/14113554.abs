Authors: Hui-Hua Zhao and Li-Chun Zhang and Meng-Sen Ma and Ren Zhao
Abstract: By Maxwell equal area law we study the phase transition in higher dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS) Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) black hole and Kerr black hole in this paper. The coexisting region of the two phases involved in the phase transition is found and the coexisting curves are shown in $P-T$ figures. We also analytically investigate the parameters which affect the coexisting curves. To better compare with ordinary thermodynamic systems, the Clapeyon equation is derived for higher dimensional AdS black holes. This paper can help to deepen the understanding of the phase transition and phase structure of AdS black holes.
