Title: On Classical Solutions of 4d Supersymmetric Higher Spin Theory
Authors: Jun Bourdier and Nadav Drukker
Abstract: We present a simple construction of solutions to the supersymmetric higher spin theory based on solutions to bosonic theories. We illustrate this for the case of the Didenko-Vasiliev solution in arXiv:0906.3898, for which we have found a striking simplification where the higher-spin connection takes the vacuum value. Studying these solutions further, we check under which conditions they preserve some supersymmetry in the bulk, and when they are compatible with the boundary conditions conjectured to be dual to certain 3d SUSY Chern-Simons-matter theories. We perform the analysis for a variety of theories with $\mathcal{N}$ = 2, $\mathcal{N}$ = 3, $\mathcal{N}$ = 4 and $\mathcal{N}$ = 6 and find a rich spectrum of $1/4$, $1/3$ and $1/2$-BPS solutions.
