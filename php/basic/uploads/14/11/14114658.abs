Title: Vacuum Polarization of STU Black Holes and their Subtracted Geometry  Limit
Authors: Mirjam Cvetic and Gary W. Gibbons and Zain H. Saleem and Alejandro Satz
Abstract: We study the vacuum polarization of a massless minimally coupled scalar field at the horizon of four-charge STU black holes. We compare the results for the standard asymptotically flat black holes and for the black holes obtained in the "subtracted limit", both in the general static case and at the horizon pole for the general rotating case. The original and the subtracted results are identical only in the BPS limit, and have opposite sign in the extremal Kerr limit. We also compute the vacuum polarization on the static solutions that interpolate between both the original and the subtracted case through a solution-generating transformation and show that the vacuum polarization stays positive throughout the interpolating solution. In the Appendix we provide a closed-form solution for the Green's function on general (static or rotating) subtracted black hole geometries.
