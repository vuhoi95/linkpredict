Title: Ramond-Ramond gauge fields in superspace with manifest T-duality
Authors: Machiko Hatsuda and Kiyoshi Kamimura and Warren Siegel
Abstract: A superspace with manifest T-duality including Ramond-Ramond gauge fields is presented. The superspace is defined by the double nondegenerate super-Poincare algebras where Ramond-Ramond charges are introduced by central extension. This formalism allows a simple treatment that all the supergravity multiplets are in a vielbein superfield and all torsions with dimension 1 and less are trivial. A Green-Schwarz superstring action is also presented where the Wess-Zumino term is given in a bilinear form of local currents. Equations of motion are separated into left and right modes in a suitable gauge.
