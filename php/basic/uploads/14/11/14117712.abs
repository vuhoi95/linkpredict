Title: Evidence for Asymptotic Safety from Dimensional Reduction in Causal  Dynamical Triangulations
Authors: D. N. Coumbe and J. Jurkiewicz
Abstract: We calculate the spectral dimension for a nonperturbative lattice approach to quantum gravity, known as causal dynamical triangulations (CDT), showing that the dimension of spacetime smoothly decreases from approximately 4 on large distance scales to approximately 3/2 on small distance scales. This novel result may provide a possible resolution to a long-standing argument against the asymptotic safety scenario. A method for determining the relative lattice spacing within the physical phase of the CDT parameter space is also outlined, which might prove useful when studying renormalization group flow in models of lattice quantum gravity.
