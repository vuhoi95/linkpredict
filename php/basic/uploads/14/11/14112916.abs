Title: Entanglement Entropy and Quantum Phase Transition in the $O(N)$  $Ïƒ$-model
Authors: Jiunn-Wei Chen and Shou-Huang Dai and Jin-Yi Pang
Abstract: We investigate how entanglement entropy behaves in a system with a quantum phase transition. We study the $\sigma$-model which has an $O(N)$ symmetry when the mass squared parameter $\mu^2$ is positive, and when $\mu^2$ is negative, this symmetry is broken spontaneously. The area law and the leading divergence of entanglement entropy are preserved in both the symmetric and the broken phases. In 3+1 dimensions, the spontaneous symmetry breaking changes the subleading divergence from a log to log squared, while in 2+1 dimensions the subleading divergent structure is unchanged. At the leading order of the coupling constant expansion, the entanglement entropy reaches its local maximum with a cusp at the quantum phase transition point $\mu^2=0$ and decreases while $|\mu^2|$ is increased. We also find novel scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy near the transition point.
