Abstract: We study the quasinormal modes (QNM) of electromagnetic perturbations for rotating black hole with a nonminimally coupled scalar field hair and Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes. We find that the imaginary parts of quasinormal frequencies of dynamical perturbations can reflect the properties of thermodynamical stability disclosed by examining the free energy. In addition, we observe that the imaginary part of QNM frequencies can also determine the dynamically preferred stable configuration, which agrees with the study of the thermodynamically stability. This dramatic relation between dynamics and thermodynamics is also disclosed in three-dimensional static black hole backgrounds. The obtained results further support that the QNM can be a dynamic probe of the thermodynamic properties in black holes.
