Title: Harmonic Analysis and Free Field Realization of the Takiff Supergroup of  GL(1|1)
Authors: Andrei Babichenko and Thomas Creutzig
Abstract: Takiff superalgebras are a family of non semi-simple Lie superalgebras that are believed to give rise to a rich structure of indecomposable representations of associated conformal field theories. We consider the Takiff superalgebra of gl(1|1), especially we perform harmonic analysis for the corresponding supergroup. We find that every simple module appears as submodule of an infinite-dimensional indecomposable but reducible module. We lift our results to two free field realizations for the corresponding conformal field theory and construct some modules.
