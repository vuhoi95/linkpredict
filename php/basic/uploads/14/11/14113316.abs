Title: Lowest Landau Level Stress Tensor and Structure Factor of Trial Quantum  Hall Wave Functions
Authors: Dung Xuan Nguyen and Dam Thanh Son and Chaolun Wu
Abstract: We show that for a class of model Hamiltonians for which certain trial quantum Hall wavefunctions are exact ground states, there is a single spectral density function which controls all two-point correlation functions of density, current and stress tensor components. From this we show that the static structure factors of these wavefunctions behaves at long wavelengths as $s_4 k^4$ where the coefficient $s_4$ is directly related to the shift: $s_4=(\mathcal S-1)/8$.
