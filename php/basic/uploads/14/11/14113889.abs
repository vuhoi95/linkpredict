Abstract: The leading singularities encode important information of the scattering amplitudes and can be used in the construction of loop-level amplitudes. In this paper we study systematically the on-shell diagrams for the leading singularities of nonplanar amplitudes in N=4 super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory. In particular we prove that a nonplanar leading singularity can be constructed by employing Britto--Cachazo--Feng--Witten (BCFW) bridges together with the U(1) decoupling relations of three and four point tree-level amplitudes. Accordingly we obtain the BCFW-bridge decomposition chain and permutation rules for any nonplanar leading singularities, leading in a straightforward way to the "dlog form." The BCFW decomposition chain encodes the geometrical information in the Grassmannian submanifolds corresponding to each nonplanar on-shell diagram. The integrands of nonplanar "top-forms" can also be obtained from the BCFW data. To calculate the leading singularities explicitly, we introduce a canonical ordering of BCFW-bridge decompositions and obtain the recursion relations for all poles, arriving at the \textit{BCFW-constructed form} for the amplitude. We, inspired by the BCFW recursion relation for the underlying tree-level diagrams, extend it to the loop level and non-planarity. Utilizing all three forms of nonplanar amplitudes constructed by us, one can fully decompose a nonplanar leading singularity, obtain the geometrical data, and explicitly calculate the amplitudes in an extremely efficient manner.
