Title: Renormalization group analysis of reggeon field theory: flow equations
Authors: J. Bartels and C. Contreras and G. P. Vacca
Abstract: Can large distance high energy QCD be described by Reggeon Field Theory as an effective emergent theory? We start to investigate the issue employing functional renormalisation group techniques.
