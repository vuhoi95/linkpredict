Title: Van Der Waals Black Holes in $d$ dimensions
Authors: Terence Delsate and Robert Mann
Abstract: We generalize the recent solution proposed by Rajagopal et al. to arbitrary number of dimensions and horizon topologies. We comment on the regime of validity of these solution. Among our main results, we argue that the Van Der Waals (VDW) black hole (BH) metric is to be interpreted as a near horizon metric. This is supported by inspecting the energy conditions. We analyze the limiting cases of a perfect fluid, interacting points and non interacting balls gas equation of state and map them to known black holes. Finally, we provide a case study by comparing the Reissner-Nordstr\"om and VDW BH close to the horizon and show that they are qualitatively similar for some range of the horizon radius.
