Title: Theory of Classical Higgs Fields. II. Lagrangians
Authors: G. Sardanashvily and A. Kurov
Abstract: We consider classical gauge theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking on a principal bundle $P\to X$ whose structure group $G$ is reducible to a closed subgroup $H$, and sections of the quotient bundle $P/H\to X$ are treated as classical Higgs fields. In this theory, matter fields with an exact symmetry group $H$ are described by sections of a composite bundle $Y\to P/H\to X$. We show that their gauge $G$-invariant Lagrangian necessarily factorizes through a vertical covariant differential on $Y$ defined by a principal connection on an $H$-principal bundle $P\to P/H$.
