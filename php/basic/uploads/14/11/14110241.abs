Title: Effect of GUP on the Kepler problem and a variable minimal length
Authors: Fatemeh Ahmadi and Jafar Khodagholizadeh
Abstract: Various approaches to quantum gravity, such as string theory, predict a minimal measurable length and a modification of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle near the Plank scale, known as the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). Here we study the effects of GUP which preserves the rotational symmetry of the spacetime, on the Kepler problem. By comparing the value of the perihelion shift of the planet Mercury in Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime with the resulted value of GUP, we find a relation between the minimal measurable length and the cosmological constant of the spacetime. Now, if the cosmological constant varies with time, we have a variable minimal length in the spacetime. Finally, we investigate the effects of GUP on the stability of circular orbits
