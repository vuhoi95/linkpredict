Title: Non-SUSY fractional branes
Authors: Stanislav Kuperstein and Brecht Truijen and Thomas Van Riet
Abstract: We consider a simplified Ansatz for supergravity solutions describing fractional p-brane solutions (throat geometries supported by fluxes) for various p. For p=3 the Ansatz captures the Klebanov-Tseytlin (KT) solution. The equations of motion can be derived from an effective action by performing a dimensional reduction to a flat domain wall geometry in p+2 dimensions. We find an interesting deformation of the known superpotential defining the SUSY domain wall flow. The deformation parameter breaks supersymmetry but still preserves the property that a test Dp brane feels no force inside the throat. The new solutions come in two classes. Both classes have the same UV asymptotics as the KT solution and one class has also similar IR behavior, which makes them potentially interesting holographic backgrounds for studying cascading gauge theories with broken SUSY. We explain furthermore how the curved domain wall solutions of the same (p+2)-dimensional theories are expected to lift to new AdS compactifications of type IIA/B supergravity.
