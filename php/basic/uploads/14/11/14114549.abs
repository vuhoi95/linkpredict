Title: Unitarity and non-relativistic potential energy in a higher-order  Lorentz symmetry breaking electromagnetic model
Authors: Eslley Scatena and Rodrigo Turcati
Abstract: The Lorentz-violating model proposed by Myers and Pospelov suffers from a higher-derivative pathology due to a dimension-5 operator. In particular, its electromagnetic sector exhibits an spectrum which contains, in addition to an expected massless photon, ghost contributions that could (in principle) spoil the unitarity of the model. We find that unitarity at tree-level can be assured for pure spacelike, timelike and lightlike background four-vectors (the last two under restrictions upon the allowed momenta). We then analyze the non-relativistic interparticle potential energy behavior for different background four-vectors and compare to the usual Coulomb potential.
