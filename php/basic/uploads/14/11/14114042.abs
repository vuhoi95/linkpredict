Title: GUP-Corrected Thermodynamics for all Black Objects and the Existence of  Remnants
Authors: Mir Faizal and Mohammed M. Khalil
Abstract: Based on the universality of the entropy-area relation of a black hole, and the fact that the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) adds a logarithmic correction term to the entropy in accordance with most approaches to quantum gravity, we argue that the GUP-corrected entropy-area relation is universal for all black objects. This correction to the entropy produces corrections to the thermodynamics. We explicitly calculate these corrections for three types of black holes: Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m, Kerr, and charged AdS black holes, in addition to spinning black rings. In all cases we find that they produce a remnant. Even though the GUP-corrected entropy-area relation produces the logarithmic term in the series expansion, we need to use the full form of the GUP-corrected entropy-area relation to get remnants for these black holes.
