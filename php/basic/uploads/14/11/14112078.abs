Title: Ramanujan Identities and Quasi-Modularity in Gromov-Witten Theory
Authors: Yefeng Shen and Jie Zhou
Abstract: A celebrated folklore conjecture asserts that the generating functions of Gromov-Witten invariants of compact Calabi-Yau orbifolds are quasi-modular forms or their generalizations. So far, the main strategy in proving this conjecture is to use mirror symmetry and B-model techniques. Unfortunately, not every interesting Calabi-Yau orbifold has a known higher genus B-model mirror. A well-known example is $\mathbb{P}^1_{2,2,2,2}$, the elliptic orbifold curve with four $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-orbifold points. In this article, we introduce a purely A-model approach. In this approach, we show that genus zero modularity is obtained from a surprising phenomenon that the system of WDVV equations is equivalent to the set of Ramanujan identities satisfied by the generators of the ring of quasi-modular forms for certain modular group. Higher genus modularity is then proved by using tautological relations. This approach works perfectly for all one-dimensional compact Calabi-Yau orbifolds, including $\mathbb{P}^1_{2,2,2,2}$ which can not yet be handled by Milanov-Ruan's B-model technique \cite{Milanov:2011}.
