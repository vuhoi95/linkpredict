Title: Dynamics of Two-Dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ Supersymmetric Theories  with Semichiral Superfields I
Authors: Jun Nian and Xinyu Zhang
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of a general two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ gauged linear sigma model with semichiral superfields. By computing the elliptic genera, we study the vacuum structure of the model. The result coincides with the model without using semichiral superfields. We also show that the low energy effective twisted superpotential contributed by semichiral superfields vanishes, whether we turn on twisted masses or not.
