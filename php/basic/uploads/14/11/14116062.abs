Title: Evaluation of state integrals at rational points
Authors: Stavros Garoufalidis and Rinat Kashaev
Abstract: Multi-dimensional state-integrals of products of Faddeev's quantum dilogarithms arise frequently in Quantum Topology, quantum Teichm\"uller theory and complex Chern--Simons theory. Using the quasi-periodicity property of the quantum dilogarithm, we evaluate 1-dimensional state-integrals at rational points and express the answer in terms of the Rogers dilogarithm, the cyclic (quantum) dilogarithm and finite state-sums at roots of unity. We illustrate our results with the evaluation of the state-integrals of the $4_1$, $5_2$ and $(-2,3,7)$ pretzel knots at rational points.
