Title: Hawking radiation from z=3 and z=1-Lifshitz black holes
Authors: Samuel Lepe and Bruno Merello
Abstract: The Hawking radiation considered as a tunneling process, by using a Hamilton-Jacobi prescription, is discussed for both z=3 and z=1-Lifshitz black holes. We have found that the tunneling rate (which is not thermal but related to the change of entropy) for the z=3-Lifshitz black hole (which does not satisfy the Area/4-law) does not yield (give us) the ecpected tunneling rate: $\Gamma\simeq exp(\Delta S)$, where $\Delta S$ is the change of black hole entropy, if we compare with the z=1-Lifshitz black hole (BTZ black hole, which satisfies the Area/4-law).
