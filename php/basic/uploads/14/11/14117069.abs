Title: Expansion of Infinite Series Containing Modified Bessel Functions of the  Second Kind
Authors: Guglielmo Fucci and Klaus Kirsten
Abstract: The aim of this work is to analyze general infinite sums containing modified Bessel functions of the second kind. In particular we present a method for the construction of a proper asymptotic expansion for such series valid when one of the parameters in the argument of the modified Bessel function of the second kind is small compared to the others. We apply the results obtained for the asymptotic expansion to specific problems that arise in the ambit of quantum field theory.
