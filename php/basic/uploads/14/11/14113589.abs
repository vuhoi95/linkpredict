Title: Projective Limits of State Spaces I. Classical Formalism
Authors: Suzanne Lan√©ry and Thomas Thiemann
Abstract: In this series of papers, we investigate the projective framework initiated by Jerzy Kijowski and Andrzej Oko{\l}\'ow, which describes the states of a quantum (field) theory as projective families of density matrices. The present first paper aims at clarifying the classical structures that underlies this formalism, namely projective limits of symplectic manifolds. In particular, this allows us to discuss accurately the issues hindering an easy implementation of the dynamics in this context, and to formulate a strategy for overcoming them.
