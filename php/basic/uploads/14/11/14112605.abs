Title: On sgoldstino-less supergravity models of inflation
Authors: Gianguido Dall'Agata and Fabio Zwirner
Abstract: We go a step further in the search for a consistent and realistic supergravity model of large-field inflation by building a class of models with the following features: during slow-roll, all the scalar fields other than the inflaton are frozen by large inflaton-dependent masses or removed from the spectrum; at the end of inflation, supersymmetry is spontaneously broken with naturally vanishing classical vacuum energy. We achieve this by combining some geometrical properties of the Kaehler potential with the consistent use of a single nilpotent chiral superfield, in one-to-one correspondence with the supersymmetry-breaking direction in field space at the vacuum.
