Title: Topological String Correlators from Matrix Models
Authors: Robert de Mello Koch and Lwazi Nkumane
Abstract: We discuss how to compute connected matrix model correlators for operators related to the gravitational descendants of the puncture operator, for the topological A model on P^1. The relevant correlators are determined by recursion relations that follow from a systematic 1/N expansion of well chosen Schwinger-Dyson equations. Our results provide further compelling evidence for Gopakumar's proposed "simplest gauge string duality" between the Gaussian matrix model and the topological A model on P^1.
