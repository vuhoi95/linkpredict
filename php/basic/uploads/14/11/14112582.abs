Authors: Seyed Ali Hosseini Mansoori and Behrouz Mirza and Mohamadreza Fazel
Abstract: As an extension to our earlier work \cite{Mirza2}, we employ the Nambu brackets to prove that the divergences of heat capacities correspond to their counterparts in thermodynamic geometry. We also obtain a simple representation for the conformal transformations that connect different thermodynamics metrics to each other. Using our bracket approach, we obtain interesting exact relations between the Hessian matrix with any number of parameters and specific heat capacities. Finally, we employ this approach to investigate some thermodynamic properties of the Meyers-Perry black holes with three spins.
