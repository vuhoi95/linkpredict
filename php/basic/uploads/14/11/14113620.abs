Title: Collective coordinate approximation to the scattering of solitons in  modified NLS and sine-Gordon models
Authors: Wojtek Zakrzewski and Helen Baron
Abstract: We investigate the validity of collective coordinate approaximations to the scattering of solitons in several classes of models in (1+1) dimensional field theory models. We look at models which are deformations of the sine-Gordon (SG) or the nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) model as they posses solitons which are topological (SG) or non-topological (NLS). Our deformations preserve their topology (SG), but changes their integrability properties, either completely or partially (models become `quasi-integrable'). As our collective coordinate approximation does not allow for the radiation of energy out the system we look also, in some detail, at how good this approximation is for models which are `quasi-integrable'. Our results are based on the studies of the interactions and scatterings in two soliton systems. Our results show that a well chosen approximation, based on geodesic motion etc, works amazingly well in all cases where it is expected to work. This is true for the trajectories of the solitons and even for their quasi-conserved (or not) charges. The only time the approximation is not very reliable (and even then the qualitative features are reasonable, but some details are not reproduced well) involves the processes when the solitons, during their scattering, can come very close together (within one width of each other).
