Title: Super-Entropic Black Holes
Authors: Robie A. Hennigar and David Kubiznak and Robert B. Mann
Abstract: We construct a new class of rotating AdS black hole solutions with non-compact event horizons of finite area in any dimension and study their thermodynamics. In four dimensions these black holes are solutions to gauged supergravity. We find that their entropy exceeds the maximum implied from the conjectured Reverse Isoperimetric Inequality, which states that for a given thermodynamic volume, the black hole entropy is maximized for Schwarzschild-AdS. We use this result to suggest more stringent conditions under which this conjecture may hold.
