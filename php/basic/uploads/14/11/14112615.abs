Title: Complete Intersection Fibers in F-Theory
Authors: Volker Braun and Thomas W. Grimm and Jan Keitel
Abstract: Global F-theory compactifications whose fibers are realized as complete intersections form a richer set of models than just hypersurfaces. The detailed study of the physics associated with such geometries depends crucially on being able to put the elliptic fiber into Weierstrass form. While such a transformation is always guaranteed to exist, its explicit form is only known in a few special cases. We present a general algorithm for computing the Weierstrass form of elliptic curves defined as complete intersections of different codimensions and use it to solve all cases of complete intersections of two equations in an ambient toric variety. Using this result, we determine the toric Mordell-Weil groups of all 3134 nef partitions obtained from the 4319 three-dimensional reflexive polytopes and find new groups that do not exist for toric hypersurfaces. As an application, we construct several models that cannot be realized as toric hypersurfaces, such as the first toric SU(5) GUT model in the literature with distinctly charged 10 representations and an F-theory model with discrete gauge group Z_4 whose dual fiber has a Mordell-Weil group with Z_4 torsion.
