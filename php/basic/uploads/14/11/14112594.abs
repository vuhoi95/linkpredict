Title: The Bethe Roots of Regge Cuts in Strongly Coupled N=4 SYM Theory
Authors: J. Bartels and V. Schomerus and M. Sprenger
Abstract: We describe a general algorithm for the computation of the remainder function for n-gluon scattering in multi-Regge kinematics for strongly coupled planar N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. This regime is accessible through the infrared physics of an auxiliary quantum integrable system describing strings in AdS5xS5. Explicit formulas are presented for n=6 and n=7 external gluons. Our results are consistent with expectations from perturbative gauge theory. This paper comprises the technical details for the results announced in arXiv:1405.3658 .
