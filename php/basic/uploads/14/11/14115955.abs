Authors: A. M. Gavrilik and Yu. A. Mishchenko
Abstract: In the recently proposed two-parameter $\tilde{\mu},q$-deformed Bose gas model [Ukr. J. Phys. {\bf 58}, 1171 (2013), arXiv:1312.1573] aimed to take effectively into account both compositeness of particles and their interaction, the $\tilde{\mu},q$-deformed virial expansion of the equation of state (EOS) was obtained. In this paper we further explore the $\tilde{\mu},q$-deformation, namely the version of $\tilde{\mu},q$-Bose gas model involving deformed distributions and correlation functions. In the model, we explicitly derive the one- and two-particle deformed distribution functions and the intercept of two-particle momentum correlation function. The results are illustrated by plots, and the comparison with known experimental data on two-pion correlation function intercepts extracted in RHIC/STAR experiments is given.
