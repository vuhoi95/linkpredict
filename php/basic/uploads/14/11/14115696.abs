Title: Heterotic Effective Action and Duality Symmetries Revisited
Authors: Olaf Hohm and Ashoke Sen and Barton Zwiebach
Abstract: The dimensional reduction of heterotic supergravity with gauge fields truncated to the Cartan subalgebra exhibits a continuous O(d,d+16;R) global symmetry, related to the O(d,d+16;Z) T-duality of heterotic strings on a d-torus. The O(d,d+16;R) symmetry is not present, however, if the supergravity reduction is done including the full set of E_8 x E_8 or SO(32) gauge fields. We analyze which duality symmetries are realized to all orders in $\alpha'$ in the proper effective field theories for the massless string states. We find a universal O(d,d;R) symmetry, also predicted by double field theory. We confirm this by giving a novel formulation of the dimensionally reduced supergravity in terms of O(d,d) multiplets, and we discuss cases of symmetry enhancement.
