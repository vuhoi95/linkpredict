Authors: Souvik Pramanik and Mir Faizal and Mohamed Moussa and Ahmed Farag Ali
Abstract: In this paper, the deformation of the Heisenberg algebra, consistent with both the generalized uncertainty principle and doubly special relativity, has been analyzed. It has been observed that, though this algebra can give rise to fractional derivative terms in the corresponding quantum mechanical Hamiltonian, a formal meaning can be given to them by using the theory of harmonic extensions of function. Depending on this argument, the expression of the propagator of the path integral corresponding to the deformed Heisenberg algebra, has been obtained. In particular, the consistent expression of the one dimensional free particle propagator has been evaluated explicitly. With this propagator in hand, it has been shown that, even in free particle case, normal generalized uncertainty principle and doubly special relativity shows very much different result.
