Abstract: We determine the couplings of the graviscalar radion in Randall-Sundrum models to Standard Model fields propagating in the bulk of the space, taking into account effects arising from the dynamics of the Goldberger-Wise scalar that stabilizes the size of the extra dimension. The leading corrections to the radion couplings are shown to arise from direct contact interactions between the Goldberger-Wise scalar and the Standard Model fields. We obtain a detailed interpretation of the results in terms of the holographic dual of the radion, the dilaton. In doing so, we determine how the familiar identification of the parameters on the two sides of the AdS/CFT correspondence is modified in the presence of couplings of the bulk Standard Model fields to the Goldberger-Wise scalar. We find that corrections to the form of the dilaton couplings from effects associated with the stabilization of the extra dimension are suppressed by the square of the ratio of the dilaton mass to the Kaluza-Klein scale, in good agreement with results from the CFT side of the correspondence.
