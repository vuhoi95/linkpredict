Title: Torsional instanton effects in quantum gravity
Authors: Romesh K. Kaul and Sandipan Sengupta
Abstract: We show that, in the first order gravity theory coupled to axions, the instanton number of the Giddings-Strominger wormhole can be interpreted as the Nieh-Yan topological index. The axion charge of the baby universes is quantized in terms of the Nieh-Yan integers. Tunneling between universes of different Nieh-Yan charges implies a nonperturbative vacuum state. The associated topological vacuum angle can be identified with the Barbero-Immirzi parameter.
