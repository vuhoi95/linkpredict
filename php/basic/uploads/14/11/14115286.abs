Title: Dynamical symmetry enhancement near massive IIA horizons
Authors: U. Gran and J. Gutowski and U. Kayani and G. Papadopoulos
Abstract: We prove that Killing horizons in massive IIA supergravity preserve an even number of supersymmetries, and that their symmetry algebra contains an $\mathfrak{sl}(2, R)$ subalgebra, confirming the conjecture of [5]. We also prove a new class of Lichnerowicz type theorems for connections of the spin bundle whose holonomy is contained in a general linear group.
