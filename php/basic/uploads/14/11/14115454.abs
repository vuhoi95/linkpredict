Title: Negative tension branes as stable thin shell wormholes
Authors: Takafumi Kokubu and Tomohiro Harada
Abstract: We investigate negative tension branes as stable thin shell wormholes in Reissner-Nordstrom-(anti) de Sitter spacetimes in $d$ dimensional Einstein gravity. Imposing Z2 symmetry, we construct and classify traversable static thin shell wormholes in spherical, planar (or cylindrical) and hyperbolic symmetries. In spherical geometry, we find the higher dimensional counterpart of Barcelo and Visser's wormholes, which are stable against spherically symmetric perturbations. We also find the classes of thin shell wormholes in planar and hyperbolic symmetries with a negative cosmological constant, which are stable against perturbations preserving symmetries. In most cases, stable wormholes are found with the combination of an electric charge and a negative cosmological constant. However, as special cases, we find stable wormholes even with vanishing cosmological constant in spherical symmetry and with vanishing electric charge in hyperbolic symmetry.
