Title: A geometric method of constructing exact solutions in modified  f(R,T)-gravity with Yang-Mills and Higgs interactions
Authors: Sergiu I. Vacaru and Elsen Veli Veliev and Enis Yazici
Abstract: We show that a geometric techniques can be elaborated and applied for constructing generic off-diagonal exact solutions in $f(R,T)$--modified gravity for systems of gravitational-Yang-Mills-Higgs equations. The corresponding classes of metrics and generalized connections are determined by generating and integration functions which depend, in general, on all space and time coordinates and may possess, or not, Killing symmetries. For nonholonomic constraints resulting in Levi-Civita configurations, we can extract solutions of the Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs equations. We show that the constructions simplify substantially for metrics with at least one Killing vector. There are provided and analyzed some examples of exact solutions describing generic off-diagonal modifications to black hole/ellipsoid and solitonic configurations.
