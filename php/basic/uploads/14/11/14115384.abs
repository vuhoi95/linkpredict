Title: Holographic Fermi surfaces at finite temperature in top-down  constructions
Authors: Charles Cosnier-Horeau and Steven S. Gubser
Abstract: We calculate the two-point Green's functions of operators dual to fermions of maximal gauged supergravity in four and five dimensions, in finite temperature backgrounds with finite charge density. The numerical method used in these calculations is based on differential equations for bilinears of the supergravity fermions rather than the equations of motion for the fermions themselves. The backgrounds we study have vanishing entropy density in appropriate extremal limits. Holographic Fermi surfaces are observed when the scalar field participating in the dual field theory operator has an expectation value, which makes sense from the point of view that the quasi-particles near the Fermi surfaces observed carry non-singlet gauge quantum numbers in the dual field theory.
