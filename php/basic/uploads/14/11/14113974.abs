Title: CMB probes on the correlated axion isocurvature perturbation
Authors: Kenji Kadota and Jinn-Ouk Gong and Kiyotomo Ichiki and Takahiko Matsubara
Abstract: We explore the possible cosmological consequence of the gravitational coupling between the inflaton and axion-like fields. In view of the forthcoming cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization and lensing data, we study the sensitivity of the CMB data on the cross-correlation between the curvature and axion isocurvature perturbations. Through a concrete example, we illustrate the explicit dependence of the scale dependent cross-correlation power spectrum on the axion parameters.
