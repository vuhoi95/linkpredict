Title: Comments on N=2 Born-Infeld Attractors
Authors: S. Bellucci and S. Krivonos and A. Sutulin
Abstract: We demonstrated that the new N=2 Born-Infeld action with two N=1 vector supermultiplets, i.e. n=2 case considered as the example in the recent paper by S. Ferrara, M. Porrati and A. Sagnotti, is some sort of complexification of J. Bagger and A. Galperin construction of N=2 Born-Infeld action. Thus, novel features could be expected only for n>2 cases, if the standard action is considered.
