Abstract: We show that the $(2+1)$-dimensional Dirac-Moshinsky oscillator coupled to an external magnetic field can be treated algebraically with the $SU(1,1)$ group theory and its group basis. We use the $su(1,1)$ irreducible representation theory to find the energy spectrum and the eigenfunctions. Also, with the $su(1,1)$ group basis we construct the relativistic coherent states in a closed form for this problem.
