Title: Chiral symmetry breaking in continuum QCD
Authors: Mario Mitter and Jan M. Pawlowski and Nils Strodthoff
Abstract: We present a quantitative analysis of chiral symmetry breaking in two-flavour continuum QCD in the quenched limit. The theory is set-up at perturbative momenta, where asymptotic freedom leads to precise results. The evolution of QCD towards the hadronic phase is achieved by means of dynamical hadronisation in the non-perturbative functional renormalisation group approach. We use a vertex expansion scheme based on gauge-invariant operators and discuss its convergence properties and the remaining systematic errors. In particular we present results for the quark propagator, the full tensor structure and momentum dependence of the quark-gluon vertex, and the four-fermi scatterings.
