Title: N=2 Born-Infeld Attractors
Authors: S. Ferrara and M. Porrati and A. Sagnotti
Abstract: We derive new types of $U(1)^n$ Born-Infeld actions based on N=2 special geometry in four dimensions. As in the single vector multiplet (n=1) case, the non--linear actions originate, in a particular limit, from quadratic expressions in the Maxwell fields. The dynamics is encoded in a set of coefficients $d_{ABC}$ related to the third derivative of the holomorphic prepotential and in an SU(2) triplet of N=2 Fayet-Iliopoulos charges, which must be suitably chosen to preserve a residual N=1 supersymmetry.
