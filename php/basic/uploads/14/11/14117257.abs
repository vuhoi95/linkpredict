Title: Gravity's Rainbow: a bridge towards Horava-Lifshitz gravity
Authors: Remo Garattini and Emmanuel N. Saridakis
Abstract: We investigate the connection between Gravity's Rainbow and Horava-Lifshitz gravity, since both theories incorporate a modification in the UltraViolet regime which improves their quantum behavior at the cost of the Lorentz invariance loss. In particular, extracting the Wheeler-De Witt equations of the two theories in the case of Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker and spherically symmetric geometries, we establish a correspondence that bridges them.
