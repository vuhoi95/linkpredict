Title: Statistics of thermalization in Bjorken Flow
Authors: Jakub Jankowski and Grzegorz Plewa and Michal Spalinski
Abstract: The apparent early thermalization of quark-gluon plasma produced at RHIC and LHC has motivated a number of studies of strongly coupled ${\mathcal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory using the AdS/CFT correspondence. Here we present the results of numerical simulations of Bjorken flow aimed at establishing typical features of the dynamics. This is done by evolving a large number of far from equilibrium initial states well into the hydrodynamic regime. The results strongly suggest that early thermalization is generic in this theory, taking place at proper times around $0.6$ in units of inverse local temperature. We also find that the scale which determines the rate of hydrodynamic cooling is linearly correlated with the entropy of initial states defined by the area of the apparent horizon in the dual geometry. Our results also suggest that entropy production during the hydrodynamic stage of evolution is not negligible despite the low value of $\eta/s$.
