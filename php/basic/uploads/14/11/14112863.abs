Title: Axial current generation by P-odd domains in QCD matter
Authors: Ioannis Iatrakis and Shu Lin and Yi Yin
Abstract: The dynamics of topological domains which break parity (${\cal P}$) and charge-parity (${\cal CP}$) symmetry of QCD are studied. We derive in a general setting that those local domains will generate an axial current and quantify the strength of the induced axial current. Our findings are verified in a top-down holographic model. The relation between the real time dynamics of those local domains and chiral magnetic effect is also elucidated. We finally argue that such an induced axial current would be phenomenologically important if topological domains are created in heavy-ion collisions experiment.
