Title: Noether Symmetry Approach for Dirac-Born-Infeld Cosmology
Authors: Salvatore Capozziello and Mariafelicia De Laurentis and Ratbay Myrzakulov
Abstract: We consider the Noether Symmetry Approach for a cosmological model derived from a tachyon scalar field $T$ with a Dirac-Born-Infeld Lagrangian and a potential $V(T)$. Furthermore, we assume a coupled canonical scalar field $\phi$ with an arbitrary interaction potential $B(T,\phi)$. Exact solutions are derived consistent with the accelerated behavior of cosmic fluid.
