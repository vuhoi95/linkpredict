Title: A generalized bag-like boundary condition for fields with arbitrary spin
Authors: Adam Stokes and Robert Bennett
Abstract: Boundary conditions for the Maxwell and Dirac fields at material surfaces are widely-used and physically well-motivated, but do not appear to have been generalised to deal with higher spin fields. As a result there is no clear prescription as to which boundary conditions should be selected in order to obtain physically-relevant results pertaining to confined higher spin fields. This lack of understanding is significant given that boundary-dependent phenomena are ubiquitous across physics, a prominent example being the Casimir effect. Here, we use the two-spinor calculus formalism to present a unified treatment of boundary conditions routinely employed in the treatment of spin-1/2 and spin-1 fields. We then use this unification to obtain a boundary condition that can be applied to massless fields of any spin, including the spin-2 graviton, and its supersymmetric partner the spin-3/2 gravitino.
