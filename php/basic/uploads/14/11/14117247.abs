Title: Weak Gravitational lensing from regular Bardeen black holes
Authors: Hossein Ghaffarnejad and Hassan Niad
Abstract: In this article we study weak gravitational lensing of regular Bardeen black hole which has scalar charge $g$ and mass $m.$ We investigate the angular position and magnification of non-relativistic images in two cases depending on the presence or absence of photon sphere. Defining dimensionless charge parameter $q=\frac{g}{2m}$ we seek to disappear photon sphere in the case of $|q|>{24\sqrt5}/{125}$ for which the space time metric encounters strongly with naked singularities. We specify the basic parameters of lensing in terms of scalar charge by using the perturbative method and found that the parity of images is different in two cases: (a) The strongly naked singularities is present in the space time. (b) singularity of space time is weak or is eliminated (the black hole lens).
