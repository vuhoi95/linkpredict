Abstract: We develop a self-consistent $Spin(4,4)$-invariant model of the unification of gravity with weak $SU(2)$ gauge and Higgs fields in the visible and invisible sectors of our Universe. We consider a general case of the graviweak unification, including the higher-derivative super-renormalizable theory of gravity, which is a unitary, asymptotically-free and perturbatively consistent theory of the quantum gravity.
