Title: Form factors of descendant operators: Resonance identities in the  sinh-Gordon model
Authors: Michael Lashkevich and Yaroslav Pugai
Abstract: We study the space of local operators in the sinh-Gordon model in the framework of the bootstrap form factor approach. Our final goal is to identify the operators obtained by solving bootstrap equations with those defined in terms of the Lagrangian field. Here we try to identify operators at some very particular points, where the phenomenon of operator resonance takes place. The operator resonance phenomenon being perturbative, nevertheless, results in exact identities between some local operators. By applying an algebraic approach developed earlier for form factors we derive an infinite set of identities between particular descendant and exponential operators in the sinh-Gordon theory, which generalize the quantum equation of motion. We identify the corresponding descendant operators by comparing them with the result of perturbation theory.
