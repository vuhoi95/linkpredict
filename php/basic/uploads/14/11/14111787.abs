Title: Holographic Schwinger effect in de Sitter space
Authors: Willy Fischler and Phuc H. Nguyen and Juan F. Pedraza and Walter Tangarife
Abstract: Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we construct the holographic dual of a tunneling instanton describing Schwinger pair creation in de Sitter space. Our approach allows us to extract the critical value of the electric field for which the potential barrier disappears, rendering the vacuum unstable. In addition, we compute the large-$\lambda$, large-$N_c$ corrections to the nucleation rate and we find that it agrees with previous expectations based on perturbative computations. As a by-product of this investigation, we study the causal structure of the string dual to the nucleated pair as seen by different static observers and we show that it can be interpreted as a dynamical creation of a `gluonic' wormhole. We explain how this result provides further evidence for the ER=EPR conjecture as an equivalence between two descriptions of the same physical phenomenon.
