Title: Kink Collisions in Curved Field Space
Authors: Pontus Ahlqvist and Kate Eckerle and Brian Greene
Abstract: We study bubble universe collisions in the ultrarelativistic limit with the new feature of allowing for nontrivial curvature in field space. We establish a simple geometrical interpretation of such collisions in terms of a double family of field profiles whose tangent vector fields stand in mutual parallel transport. This provides a generalization of the well-known flat field space limit of the free passage approximation. We investigate the limits of this approximation and illustrate our analytical results with a numerical simulations.
