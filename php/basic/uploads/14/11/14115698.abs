Title: Matrix integral expansion of colored Jones polynomials for figure-eight  knot
Authors: Alexander Alexandrov and Dmitry Melnikov
Abstract: In this note we examine a possible extension of the matrix integral representation of knot invariants beyond the class of torus knots. In particular, we study a representation of the SU(2) quantum Racah coefficients by double matrix integrals. We find that the Racah coefficients are mapped to expansion coefficients in some basis of double integrals. The transformed coefficients have a number of interesting algebraic properties.
