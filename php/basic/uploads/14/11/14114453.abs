Title: Virasoro irregular conformal block and beta deformed random matrix model
Authors: Sang Kwan Choi and Chaiho Rim and Hong Zhang
Abstract: Virasoro irregular conformal block is presented as the expectation value of Jack-polynomials of the beta-deformed Penner-type matrix model and is compared with the inner product of Gaiotto states with arbitrary rank. It is confirmed that there are non-trivial modifications of the Gaiotto states due to the normalization of the states. The relation between the two is explicitly checked for rank 2 irregular conformal block.
