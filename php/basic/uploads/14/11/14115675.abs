Title: Discreteness of time in the evolution of the universe
Authors: Mir Faizal and Ahmed Farag Ali and Saurya Das
Abstract: In this paper, we use a deformed second quantized commutation relation to quantize the Hamiltonian constraint of general relativity. The deformed Wheeler-DeWitt equation thus constructed is solved in the minisuperspace approximation. We demonstrate that in this model, the universe evolves by taking discrete jumps rather than in a continuous manner. Thus, the deformation of the second quantized commutation relation naturally gives rise to time crystals in our universe.
