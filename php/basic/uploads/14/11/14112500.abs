Title: On bounds and boundary conditions in the continuum Landau gauge
Authors: D. Dudal and M. S. Guimaraes and I. F. Justo and S. P. Sorella
Abstract: In this note, we consider the Landau gauge in the continuum formulation. Our purposes are twofold. Firstly, we try to work out the consequences of the recently derived Cucchieri-Mendes bounds on the inverse Faddeev-Popov operator at the level of the path integral quantization. Secondly, we give an explicit renormalizable prescription to implement the so-called Landau B-gauges as introduced by Maas.
