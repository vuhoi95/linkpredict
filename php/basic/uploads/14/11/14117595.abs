Title: From Principal Series to Finite-Dimensional Solutions of the Yang-Baxter  Equation
Authors: Dmitry Chicherin and Sergey E. Derkachov and Vyacheslav P. Spiridonov
Abstract: We start from known solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation with a spectral parameter defined on the tensor product of two infinite-dimensional principal series representations of the group $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ or Faddeev's modular double. Then we describe its restriction to an irreducible finite-dimensional representation in one or both spaces. In this way we obtain very simple explicit formulas embracing rational and trigonometric finite-dimensional solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Finally, we construct these finite-dimensional solutions by means of the fusion procedure and find a nice agreement between two approaches.
