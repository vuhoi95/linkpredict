Title: The General Relativity of Two Properties
Authors: P. D. Stack and R. Delbourgo
Abstract: We demonstrate that the extension of the space-time metric to incorporate two anticommuting property coordinates automatically leads to the unification of gravity with nonabelian gauge theory, as well as producing a cosmological term.
