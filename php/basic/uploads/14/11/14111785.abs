Title: The operator product expansion converges in massless  $\varphi_4^4$-theory
Authors: Jan Holland and Stefan Hollands and Christoph Kopper
Abstract: It has been shown recently that the mathematical status of the operator product expansion (OPE) is better than was expected before: namely considering massive Euclidean $\varphi^4$-theory in the perturbative loop expansion, the OPE converges at any loop order when considering (as is usually done) composite operator insertions into correlation functions. In the present paper we prove the same result for the massless theory. While the short-distance properties of massive and massless theories may be expected to be similar on physical grounds, the proof in the massless case requires entirely new techniques. In our inductive construction we have to control with sufficient precision the exceptional momentum singularities of the massless correlation functions. In fact the bounds we state are expressed in terms of weight factors associated to certain tree graphs. Our proof is again based on the flow equations of the renormalisation group.
