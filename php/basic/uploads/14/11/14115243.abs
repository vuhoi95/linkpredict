Title: Baryon Spectrum from Superconformal Quantum Mechanics and its  Light-Front Holographic Embedding
Authors: Guy F. de Teramond and Hans Gunter Dosch and Stanley J. Brodsky
Abstract: We describe the observed light-baryon spectrum by extending superconformal quantum mechanics to the light front and its embedding in AdS space. This procedure uniquely determines the confinement potential for arbitrary half-integer spin. To this end, we show that fermionic wave equations in AdS space are dual to light-front supersymmetric quantum mechanical bound-state equations in physical space-time. The specific breaking of conformal invariance explains hadronic properties common to light mesons and baryons, such as the observed mass pattern in the radial and orbital excitations, from the spectrum generating algebra. The holographic embedding in AdS also explains distinctive and systematic features, such as the spin-$J$ degeneracy for states with the same orbital angular momentum, observed in the light baryon spectrum.
