Title: TEK twisted gradient flow running coupling
Authors: Margarita García Pérez and Antonio González-Arroyo and Liam Keegan and Masanori Okawa
Abstract: We measure the running of the twisted gradient flow coupling in the Twisted Eguchi-Kawai (TEK) model, the SU(N) gauge theory on a single site lattice with twisted boundary conditions in the large N limit.
