Title: Induced QCD with two auxiliary bosonic fields
Authors: Bastian B. Brandt and Tilo Wettig
Abstract: Following a proposal of Budczies and Zirnbauer, we investigate an alternative lattice discretization of continuum ${\rm SU}(N_c)$ Yang-Mills theory in which the self-interactions of the gauge field are induced by a path integral over $N_b\ge N_c-1$ auxiliary bosonic fields which are coupled linearly to the gauge field. In two dimensions there exists an analytic proof that the new discretization reproduces Yang-Mills theory in its non-perturbative continuum limit. We provide numerical evidence that this is also the case in three and four dimensions and that, after a suitable matching of the free parameters, the results of the induced theory agree with results from the ordinary plaquette action up to lattice artifacts. The new discretization is ideally suited to change the order of integration in the QCD path integral to arrive at formulations in which the gauge fields have been integrated out. The resulting theories might be amenable to methods previously used in the infinite-coupling limit, and we briefly discuss possibilities to arrive at dual representations of lattice QCD.
