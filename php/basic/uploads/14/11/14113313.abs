Title: On spectrum of ILW hierarchy in conformal field theory II: coset CFT's
Authors: M. N. Alfimov and A. V. Litvinov
Abstract: We study integrable structure of the coset conformal field theory and define the system of Integrals of Motion which depends on external parameters. This system can be viewed as a quantization of the ILW type hierarchy. We propose a set of Bethe anzatz equations for its spectrum.
