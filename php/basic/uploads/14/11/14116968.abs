Title: Cho-Duan-Ge decomposition of QCD in the constraintless Clairaut-type  formalism
Authors: Michael L. Walker and Steven Duplij
Abstract: We apply the recently derived constraintless Clairaut-type formalism to the Cho-Duan-Ge decomposition in SU(2) QCD. We find nontrivial corrections to the physical equations of motion and that the contribution of the topological degrees of freedom is qualitatively different from that found by treating the monopole potential as though it were dynamic. We also find alterations to the field commutation relations that undermine the particle interpretation in the presence of the chromomonopole condensate.
