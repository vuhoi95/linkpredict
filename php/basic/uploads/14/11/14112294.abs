Authors: Jochen Bartels and Andrey Kormilitzin and Lev N. Lipatov
Abstract: In this second part of our investigation of the analytic structure of the $2\to5$ scattering amplitude in the planar limit of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM in multi-Regge kinematics we compute, in all kinematic regions, the Regge cut contributions in leading order. The results are infrared finite and conformally invariant.
