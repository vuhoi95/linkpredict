Title: Two-phase equilibrium properties in charged topological dilaton AdS  black holes
Authors: Hui-Hua Zhao and Li-Chun Zhang and Ren Zhao
Abstract: In this paper we discuss phase transition of the charged topological dilaton AdS black holes by Maxwell equal area law. The two phases involved in the phase transition could be coexist and we depict the coexistence region in $P-v$ diagrams. The two-phase equilibrium curves in $P-T$ diagrams are plotted, the Clapeyron equation for the black hole is derived, and the latent heat of isothermal phase transition is investigated. We also analyze of the parameters of the black hole that have an effect on the two phases coexistence. The results show that the black hole may go through a small-large phase transition similar to those of usual non-gravity thermodynamic systems.
