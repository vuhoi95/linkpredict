Abstract: The $D$-colored version of tensor models has been shown to admit a large $N$-limit expansion. The leading contributions result from so-called melonic graphs which are dual to the $D$-sphere. This is a note about the Schwinger-Dyson equations of the tensorial $\varphi^{4}_{5}$-model (with propagator $1/{\bf p}^{2}$) and their melonic approximation. We derive the master equations for two- and four-point correlation functions and discuss their solution.
