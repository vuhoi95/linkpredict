Title: A Geometric Approach to Modulus Stabilization
Authors: Sampurn Anand and Debajyoti Choudhury and Anjan A. Sen and Soumitra SenGupta
Abstract: Modulus stabilization, a must for explaining the hierarchy problem in the context of the Randall-Sundrum (RS) scenario, is traditionally achieved through the introduction of an extra field with {\em ad hoc} couplings. We point out that the stabilization can, instead, be achieved in a purely geometrodynamical way, with plausible quantum corrections in the gravity sector playing the key role. The size of the corrections that lead to acceptable phenomenology is also delineated.
