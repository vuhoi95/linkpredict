Title: Black holes as particle detectors: evolution of superradiant  instabilities
Authors: Richard Brito and Vitor Cardoso and Paolo Pani
Abstract: Superradiant instabilities of spinning black holes can be used to impose strong constraints on ultralight bosons, thus turning black holes into effective particle detectors. However, very little is known about the development of the instability and whether its nonlinear time evolution accords to the linear intuition. For the first time, we attack this problem by studying the impact of gravitational-wave emission and gas accretion on the evolution of the instability. Our quasi-adiabatic, fully-relativistic analysis shows that: (i) gravitational-wave emission does not have a significant effect on the evolution of the black hole, (ii) accretion plays an important role and (iii) although the mass of the scalar cloud developed through superradiance can be a sizeable fraction of the black-hole mass, its energy-density is very low and backreaction is negligible. Thus, massive black holes are well described by the Kerr geometry even if they develop bosonic clouds through superradiance. Using Monte Carlo methods and very conservative assumptions, we provide strong support to the validity of the linearized analysis and to the bounds of previous studies.
