Title: Brane structure from a scalar field in general covariant Horava-Lifshitz  gravity
Authors: D. Bazeia and F. A. Brito and F. G. Costa
Abstract: In this paper we have considered the structure of the non-projectable Horava-Melby-Thompson (HMT) gravity to find braneworld scenarios. A relativistic scalar field is considered in the matter sector and we have shown how to reduce the equations of motion to first-order differential equations. In particular, we have studied thick brane solutions of both the dilatonic and Randall-Sundrum types.
