Title: On shape dependence of holographic mutual information in AdS4
Authors: Piermarco Fonda and Luca Giomi and Alberto Salvio and Erik Tonni
Abstract: We study the holographic mutual information in AdS4 of disjoint spatial domains in the boundary which are delimited by smooth closed curves. A numerical method which approximates a local minimum of the area functional through triangulated surfaces is employed. After some checks of the method against existing analytic results for the holographic entanglement entropy, we compute the holographic mutual information of equal domains delimited by ellipses, superellipses or the boundaries of two dimensional spherocylinders, finding also the corresponding transition curves along which the holographic mutual information vanishes.
