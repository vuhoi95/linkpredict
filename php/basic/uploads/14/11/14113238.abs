Title: Noether Theorem of Relativistic-Electromagnetic Ideal Hydrodynamics
Authors: J. H. Gaspar Elsas and T. Koide and T. Kodama
Abstract: We present a variational approach for relativistic ideal hydrodynamics interacting with electromagnetic fields. The momentum of fluid is introduced as the canonical conjugate variable of the position of a fluid element, which coincides with the conserved quantity derived from the Noether theorem. We further show that our formulation can reproduce the usual electromagnetic hydrodynamics which is obtained so as to satisfy the conservation of the inertia of fluid motion.
