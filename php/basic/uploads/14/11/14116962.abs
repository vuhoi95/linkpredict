Abstract: In this paper we present two different solutions to the problem of zero mode localization of ELKO spinor. In a recent paper the present authors reopened this problem since the solution presented before did not satisfy the boundary condition at the origin. The first solution is given by the introduction of a mass term and by coupling the spinor with the brane through a delta function. The second solution is reached by a Yukawa geometrical coupling with the Ricci scalar. This two models changes consistently the the boundary condition at infinity and at the origin. For the case of Geometrical coupling we are able to show that the zero mode is localized for any smooth version of the RS model.
