Title: Projective Limits of State Spaces III. Toy-Models
Authors: Suzanne Lan√©ry and Thomas Thiemann
Abstract: In this series of papers, we investigate the projective framework initiated by Jerzy Kijowski and Andrzej Oko{\l}\'ow, which describes the states of a quantum theory as projective families of density matrices. A strategy to implement the dynamics in this formalism was presented in our first paper, which we now test in two simple toy-models. The first one is a very basic linear model, meant as an illustration of the general procedure, and we will only discuss it at the classical level. In the second one, we reformulate the Schr\"odinger equation, treated as a classical field theory, within this projective framework, and proceed to its (non-relativistic) second quantization. We are then able to reproduce the physical content of the usual Fock quantization.
