Title: Effect of cosmic string on spin dynamics
Authors: Debashree Chowdhury and B. Basu
Abstract: In the present paper, we have investigated the role of cosmic string on spin current and Hall electric field. Due to the background cosmic string, the modified electric field of the system generates renormalized spin orbit coupling, which induces a modified non-Abelian gauge field. The defect causes a change in the AB and AC phases appearing due to the modified electromagnetic field. In addition, for a time varying electric field we perform explicit analytic calculations to derive the exact form of spin electric field and spin current, which is defect parameter dependent and of oscillating type. Furthermore, in an asymmetric crystal within the Drude model approach we investigate the dependence of the cosmic string parameters on cosmic string induced Hall electric field.
