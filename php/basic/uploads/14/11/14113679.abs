Abstract: We study the low energy effective theory of two sets of D3-branes overlapping in 1+1 dimensions, recently considered by Mintun, Polchinski, and Sun. In the original treatment by MPS, by studying the properties of magnetic solitons, the low energy effective field theory was found to require some ultraviolet completion, possibly involving full string dynamics. Recently in a companion paper, it was shown that by scaling the angle between the D3-branes and the D3'-branes in the zero slope limit in specific way, one can find simpler effective field theory which consists of a single tower of Regge trajectory states and yet is ultraviolet complete and non-singular. In this article, we study this model by further studying a limit which recovers the MPS dynamics from this non-singular construction. We approach this issue from a holographic perspective, where we consider a stack of $N$ D3-branes overlapping with a single D3'-brane, and treat that D3'-brane as a probe in the $AdS_5 \times S^5$ dual. In general, the D3'-brane probe supports a magnetic monopole as a non-singular soliton configuration, but in the limit where the MPS dynamics is recovered, the soliton degenerates. This is consistent with the idea that the effective dynamics in the MPS setup is incomplete, but that it can be completed with a single tower of Regge trajectory states.
