Title: Modular properties of characters of the W3 algebra
Authors: Nicholas J. Iles and GÃ©rard M. T. Watts
Abstract: In a previous work, exact formulae and differential equations were found for traces of powers of the zero mode in the W3 algebra. In this paper we investigate their modular properties, in particular we find the exact result for the modular transformations of traces of $W_0^n$ for n = 1, 2, 3, solving exactly the problem studied approximately by Gaberdiel, Hartman and Jin. We also find modular differential equations satisfied by traces with a single $W_0$ inserted, and relate them to differential equations studied by Mathur et al. We find that, remarkably, these all seem to be related to weight 0 modular forms with expansions with non-negative integer coefficients.
