Abstract: The large N dynamics of a subsector of d=0 interacting complex multi matrix systems, which is naturally parametrized by a matrix valued radial coordinate, and which embodies the canonical AdS/CFT relationship between 't Hooft's coupling constant and radius, is obtained. Unlike the case of the single complex matrix, for two or more complex matrices a new repulsive logarithmic potential is present, as a result of which the density of radial eigenvalues has support on an hyper annulus. For the single complex matrix, the integral over the angular degrees of freedom of the Yang-Mills interaction can be carried out exactly, and in the presence of an harmonic potential, the density of radial eigenvalues is shown to be of the Wigner type.
