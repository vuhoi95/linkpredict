Abstract: We elaborate the possibility for a deformed extra space to be considered as the dark matter candidate. To perform calculations a class of two-dimensional extra metrics was considered in the framework of the multidimensional gravity. It was shown that there exists a family of stationary metrics of the extra space possessing point-like defect. Estimation of cross section of scattering of a particle of the ordinary matter on a spatial domain with deformed extra space is in agreement with the observational constraints.
