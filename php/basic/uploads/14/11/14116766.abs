Title: Wilson-Loop Symmetry Breaking Reexamined
Authors: Atsushi Nakamula and Kiyoshi Shiraishi
Abstract: The splitting in energy of gauge field vacua on the non-simply connected space $S^3/Z_2$ is reconsidered. We show the calculation to the one-loop level for a Yang-Mills vector with a ghost field. We confirm our previous result and give a solution to the question posed by Freire, Rom\~ao and Barroso.
