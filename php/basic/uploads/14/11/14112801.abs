Title: On the Elliptic Genus of Three E-strings and Heterotic Strings
Authors: Wenhe Cai and Min-xin Huang and Kaiwen Sun
Abstract: A precise formula for the elliptic genus of three E-strings is presented. The related refined free energy coincides with the result calculated from topological string on local half K3 Calabi-Yau threefold up to genus twelve. The elliptic genus of three heterotic strings computed from M9 domain walls matches with the result from orbifold formula to high orders. This confirms the n=3 case of the recent conjecture that n pairs of E-strings can recombine into n heterotic strings.
