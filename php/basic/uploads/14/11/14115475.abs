Title: IR Dualities in General 3d Supersymmetric SU(N) QCD Theories
Authors: Ofer Aharony and Daniel Fleischer
Abstract: In the last twenty years, low-energy (IR) dualities have been found for many pairs of supersymmetric gauge theories with four supercharges, both in four space-time dimensions and in three space-time dimensions. In particular, duals have been found for 3d N=2 supersymmetric QCD theories with gauge group U(N), with F chiral multiplets in the fundamental representation, with F' chiral multiplets in the anti-fundamental representation, and with Chern-Simons level k, for all values of N, F, F' and k for which the theory preserves supersymmetry. For SU(N) theories the duals have been found in some cases, such as F=F' and F'=0, but not in the general case. In this note we find the IR dual for SU(N) SQCD theories with general values of N, F, F' and a non-zero k, which preserve supersymmetry.
