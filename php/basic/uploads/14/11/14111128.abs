Title: Non-renormalization theorem and cyclic Leibniz rule in lattice  supersymmetry
Authors: Mitsuhiro Kato and Makoto Sakamoto and Hiroto So
Abstract: We propose a lattice model of supersymmetric complex quantum mechanics which realizes the non-renormalization theorem on a lattice. In our lattice model, the Leibniz rule in the continuum, which cannot hold on a lattice due to a no-go theorem, is replaced by the cyclic Leibniz rule (CLR) for difference operators. It is shown that CLR allows two of four supercharges of the continuum theory to preserve while a naive lattice model can realize one supercharge at the most. A striking feature of our lattice model is that there are no quantum corrections to potential terms in any finite order of perturbation theory. This is one of characteristic properties of supersymmetric theories in the continuum. It turns out that CLR plays a crucial role in the proof of the non-renormalization theorem. This result suggests that CLR grasps an essence of supersymmetry on a lattice.
