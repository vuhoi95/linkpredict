Title: One-loop effective actions and 2D hydrodynamics with anomalies
Authors: Gim Seng Ng and Piotr Sur√≥wka
Abstract: We revisit the study of a 2D quantum field theory in the hydrodynamic regime and develop a formalism based on Euclidean one-loop partition functions that is suitable to analyze transport properties due to gauge and gravitational anomalies. To do so, we generalize the method of a modified Dirac operator developed for zero-temperature anomalies to finite temperature, chemical potentials and rotations.
