Title: Critical phenomena of static charged AdS black holes in conformal  gravity
Authors: Wei Xu and Liu Zhao
Abstract: The extended thermodynamics of static charged AdS black holes in conformal gravity is analyzed. The $P-V$ criticality of these black holes has some unusual features. There exists a single critical point with critical temperature $T_c$ and critical pressure $P_c$. At fixed $T>T_c$ (or at fixed $P>P_c$), there are two zeroth order phase transition points but no first order phase transition points. The systems favors large pressure states at constant $T$, or high temperature states at constant $P$.
