Title: The two-loop sunrise graph in two space-time dimensions with arbitrary  masses in terms of elliptic dilogarithms
Authors: Luise Adams and Christian Bogner and Stefan Weinzierl
Abstract: We present the two-loop sunrise integral with arbitrary non-zero masses in two space-time dimensions in terms of elliptic dilogarithms. We find that the structure of the result is as simple and elegant as in the equal mass case, only the arguments of the elliptic dilogarithms are modified. These arguments have a nice geometric interpretation.
