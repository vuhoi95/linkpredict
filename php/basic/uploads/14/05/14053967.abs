Title: Towards an effective action for relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics
Authors: Pavel Kovtun and Guy D. Moore and Paul Romatschke
Abstract: We propose an effective action for first order relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics that can be used to evaluate n-point symmetrized correlation functions, taking into account thermal fluctuations of the hydrodynamic variables.
