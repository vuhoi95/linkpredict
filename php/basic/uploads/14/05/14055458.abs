Title: Orbit based procedure for doublets of scalar fields and the emergence of  triple kinks and other defects
Authors: G. P. de Brito and A. de Souza Dutra
Abstract: In this work we offer an approach to enlarge the number of exactly solvable models with two real scalar fields in (1+1)D. We build some new two-field models, and obtain their exact orbits and exact or numerical field configurations. It is noteworthy that a model presenting triple-kinks and double-flat-top lumps is among those new models.
