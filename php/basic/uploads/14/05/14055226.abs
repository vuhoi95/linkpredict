Title: Intersecting Branes, Domain Walls and Superpotentials in 3d Gauge  Theories
Authors: Daniele Dorigoni and David Tong
Abstract: We revisit the Hanany-Witten brane construction of 3d gauge theories with N=2 supersymmetry. Instantons are known to generate a superpotential on the Coulomb branch of the theory. We show that this superpotential can be viewed as arising from the classical scattering of domain wall solitons. The domain walls live on the worldvolume of the fivebranes and their existence relies on the recent observation that the charged hypermultiplet at the intersection of perpendicular D-branes has non-canonical kinetic terms. We further show how Dp branes may be absorbed at the intersection of perpendicular D(p+4)-branes where they appear as BPS sigma-model lumps.
