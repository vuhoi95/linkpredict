Title: Quantum Channels in Quantum Gravity
Authors: Mukund Rangamani and Massimiliano Rota
Abstract: The black hole final state proposal implements manifest unitarity in the process of black hole formation and evaporation in quantum gravity, by postulating a unique final state boundary condition at the singularity. We argue that this proposal can be embedded in the gauge/gravity context by invoking a path integral formalism inspired by the Schwinger-Keldysh like thermo-field double construction in the dual field theory. This allows us to realize the gravitational quantum channels for information retrieval to specific deformations of the field theory path integrals and opens up new connections between geometry and information theory.
