Title: The 126 GeV Higgs boson mass and naturalness in (deflected) mirage  mediation
Authors: Hiroyuki Abe and Junichiro Kawamura
Abstract: We study the mass of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson in the deflected mirage mediation that is a quite general framework of the mediation of supersymmetry breaking, incorporating the case where all of the modulus-, the anomaly- and the gauge-mediated contributions to the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters become sizable. We evaluate the degree of tuning the so-called mu parameter required for realizing a correct electroweak symmetry breaking and study how to accomplish both the observed Higgs boson mass and the relaxed fine-tuning. We identify the parameter space favored from such a perspective and show the superparticle mass spectrum with some input parameters inside the indicated region. The results here would be useful when we aim to prove the communication between the visible and the hidden sectors in supergravity and superstring models based on the recent observations.
