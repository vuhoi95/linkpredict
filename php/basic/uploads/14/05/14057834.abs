Title: Entanglement inside the cosmological apparent horizon
Authors: S. Capozziello and O. Luongo
Abstract: Possible connections between quantum entanglement and cosmological eras are considered. In particular, assuming that two epochs are each other entangled, by measuring the entanglement degree, it is possible to recover dynamical properties of the universe. In particular, the effects of dark energy could be due to the entanglement between states, since a negative pressure arises at late times. In this process, we choose as ruler to quantify the entanglement weight, the so called negativity of entanglement. It follows that a natural anti-gravitational effect occurs when the cosmological eras are entangled. Thus, dark energy could be seen as a straightforward consequence of entanglement. Specifically, our results can be compared with observational data. In doing so, it is possible to show that a pressureless term is recovered at a certain epoch dominating over dark energy and ruling the structure formation.
