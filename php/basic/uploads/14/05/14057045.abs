Title: An axial gauge ansatz for higher spin theories
Authors: Steven S. Gubser and Wei Song
Abstract: We present an ansatz which makes the equations of motion more tractable for the simplest of Vasiliev's four-dimensional higher spin theories. The ansatz is similar to axial gauge in electromagnetism. We present a broad class of solutions in the gauge where the spatial connection vanishes, and we discuss the lift of one of these solutions to a full spacetime solution via a gauge transformation.
