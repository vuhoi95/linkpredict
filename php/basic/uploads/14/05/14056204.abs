Title: Neutrino Masses and Conformal Electro-Weak Symmetry Breaking
Authors: Manfred Lindner and Steffen Schmidt and Juri Smirnov
Abstract: Dimensional transmutation in classically conformal invariant theories may explain the electro-weak scale and the fact that so far nothing but the Standard Model (SM) particles have been observed. We discuss in this paper implications of this type of symmetry breaking for neutrino mass generation.
