Abstract: Recently, a family of interesting analytical brane solutions were found in $f(R)$ gravity with $f(R)=R+\alpha R^2$ in Ref. [Phys. Lett. B 729, 127 (2014)]. In these solutions, inner brane structure can be turned on by tuning the value of the parameter $\alpha$. In this paper, we investigate how the parameter $\alpha$ affects the localization and the quasilocalization of the tensorial gravitons around these solutions. It is found that, in a range of $\alpha$, despite the brane has an inner structure, there is no graviton resonance. However, in some other regions of the parameter space, although the brane has no internal structure, the effective potential for the graviton KK modes has a singular structure, and there exists a series of graviton resonant modes. The contribution of the massive graviton KK modes to the Newton's law of gravity is discussed shortly.
