Title: Kerr Black string flow
Authors: Meng Sun and Yong-Chang Huang
Abstract: We give a general theory of a rotated black string stream into a rotational horizon in dimension D=5. It is a configuration about one smooth intersection between these two objects when the spacetime is axisymmetric and in the limit that the thickness of the black hole is much larger than the thickness of the black string. Following this configuration we extend to a more general situation, the rotational charged flows.
