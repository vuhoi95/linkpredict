Title: Generalized geometry and nonlinear realization of generalized  diffeomorphism on D-brane effective action
Authors: T. Asakawa and H. Muraki and S. Sasa and S. Watamura
Abstract: The characterization of the DBI action of a Dp-brane using the generalized geometry is discussed. It is shown that the DBI action is invariant under the diffeomorphism and B-transformation of the generalized tangent bundle of the target space. The symmetry is realized non-linearly on the fluctuation of the D-brane.
