Title: Lattice String Field Theory: The linear dilaton in one dimension
Authors: Francis Bursa and Michael Kroyter
Abstract: We propose the use of lattice field theory for the study of string field theory at the non-perturbative quantum level. We identify many potential obstacles and examine possible resolutions thereof. We then experiment with our approach in the particularly simple case of a one-dimensional linear dilaton and analyse the results.
