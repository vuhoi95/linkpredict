Title: Electric-magnetic duality implies (global) conformal invariance
Authors: Sung-Pil Moon and Sang-Jin Lee and Ji-Hye Lee and Jae-Hyuk Oh
Abstract: We have examined quantum theories of electric magnetic duality invariant vector fields enjoying classical conformal invariance in 4-dimensional flat spacetime. We extend Dirac's argument about "the conditions for a quantum field theory to be relativistic" to "those for a quantum theory to be conformal". We realize that electric magnetic duality invariant vector theories together with classical conformal invariance defined in 4-$d$ flat spacetime are still conformally invariant theories when they are quantized in a way that electric magnetic duality is manifest.
