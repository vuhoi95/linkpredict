Title: Quantum Resource Theory for Charge-Parity-Time Inversion
Authors: Michael Skotiniotis and Borzu Toloui and Ian T. Durham and Barry C. Sanders
Abstract: We develop a complete resource theory of charge-parity-time (CPT) inversion symmetry for both massive and massless relativistic particles of arbitrary spin. We show that a unitary representation of CPT can be consistently constructed for all spins and develop the resource theory associated with CPT super-selection, thereby identifying and quantifying the resources required to lift the super-selection rule.
