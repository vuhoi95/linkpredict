Title: Giant Magnon on Deformed AdS(3)xS(3)
Authors: Malak Khouchen and Josef Kluson
Abstract: We study giant magnon solutions for strings moving on a deformed AdS(3)xS(3) background. We impose a conformal gauge on the Polyakov action and proceed with solving the Virasoro constraints. The expressions of the conserved charge J and the energy of a single magnon excitation are then computed. Then we determine the dispersion relation in the infinite J limit configuration and we find that it reduces to celebrated Hofman-Maldacena dispersion relation when the deformation parameter goes to zero.
