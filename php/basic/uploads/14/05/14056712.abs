Title: A piece of cake: the ground-state energies in gamma_i-deformed N=4 SYM  theory
Authors: Jan Fokken and Christoph Sieg and Matthias Wilhelm
Abstract: In the non-supersymmetric gamma_i-deformed N=4 SYM theory, the scaling dimensions of the operators tr[Z^L] composed of L scalar fields Z receive finite-size wrapping and prewrapping corrections in the 't Hooft limit. In this paper, we calculate these scaling dimensions to leading wrapping order directly from Feynman diagrams. For L>=3, the result is proportional to the maximally transcendental `cake' integral. It matches with an earlier result obtained from the integrability-based Luescher corrections, TBA and Y-system equations. At L=2, where the integrability-based equations yield infinity, we find a finite rational result. This result is renormalization-scheme dependent due to the non-vanishing beta-function of an induced quartic scalar double-trace coupling, on which we have reported earlier. This explicitly shows that conformal invariance is broken - even in the 't Hooft limit.
