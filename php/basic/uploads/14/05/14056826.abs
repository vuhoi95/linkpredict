Title: Modulus stabilization in higher curvature dilaton gravity
Authors: Sayantan Choudhury and Joydip Mitra and Soumitra SenGupta
Abstract: We propose a framework of modulus stabilization in two brane warped geometry scenario in presence of higher curvature gravity and dilaton in bulk space-time. In the prescribed setup we study various features of the stabilized potential for the modulus field, generated by a bulk scalar degrees of freedom with quartic interactions localized on the two 3-branes placed at the orbifold fixed points. We determine the parameter space for the gravidilaton and Gauss-Bonnet required to stabilize the modulus in such higher curvature dilaton gravity setup.
