Title: Effective String Theory Simplified
Authors: Simeon Hellerman and Shunsuke Maeda and Jonathan Maltz and Ian Swanson
Abstract: In this set of notes we simplify the formulation of the Poincare'-invariant effective string theory in D dimensions by adding an intrinsic metric and embedding its dynamics into the Polyakov formalism. We use this formalism to construct operators order by order in the inverse physical length of the string, in a fully gauge-invariant framework. We use this construction to discuss universality and nonuniversality of observables up to and including next-to-next-to-leading order in the long string expansion.
