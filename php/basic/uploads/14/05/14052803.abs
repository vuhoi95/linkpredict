Title: Instability of Rotating Anti-de Sitter Black Holes
Authors: Bogeun Gwak and Bum-Hoon Lee
Abstract: We study the instability of higher-dimensional rotating anti-de Sitter black holes through fragmentation. Fragmentation occurs when black holes rotate too fast to sustain their horizon, and then the black holes are broken into small pieces. Using this process, we test the stability of AdS black holes and discover the dynamical upper bounds of the angular momentum and the cosmological constant. We show that AdS black holes can exist stably within limited parameter ranges in the general dimensions. The parameter ranges are obtained numerically in terms of angular momentum and cosmological constant.
