Title: Extended phase space thermodynamics for third order Lovelock black holes  in diverse dimensions
Authors: Hao Xu and Wei Xu and Liu Zhao
Abstract: Treating the cosmological constant as thermodynamic pressure and its conjugate as thermodynamic volume, we investigate the critical behavior of the third order Lovelock black holes in diverse dimensions. For black hole horizons with different normalized sectional curvature $k=0,\pm1$, the corresponding critical behaviors differ drastically. For $k=0$, there is no critical point in the extended thermodynamic phase space. For $k=-1$, there is a single critical point in any dimension $d\geq 7$, and for $k=+1$, there is a single critical point in $7$ dimension and two critical points in $8,9,10,11$ dimensions. We studied the corresponding phase structures in all possible cases.
