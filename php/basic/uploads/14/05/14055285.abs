Title: Secularly growing loop corrections in strong electric fields
Authors: E. T. Akhmedov and N. Astrakhantsev and F. K. Popov
Abstract: We calculate one--loop corrections to the vertexes and propagators of photons and charged particles in the strong electric field backgrounds. We use the Schwinger--Keldysh diagrammatic technique. We observe that photon's Keldysh propagator receives growing with time infrared contribution. As the result, loop corrections are not suppressed in comparison with tree--level contribution. This effect substantially changes the standard picture of the pair production. To sum up leading IR corrections from all loops we consider the infrared limit of the Dyson--Schwinger equations and reduce them to a single kinetic equation.
