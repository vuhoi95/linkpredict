Title: Charge rotating black string in gravitating nonlinear electromagnetic  fields
Authors: Seyed Hossein Hendi and Ahmad Sheykhi
Abstract: We construct a new class of charged rotating black string solutions coupled to a nonlinear electromagnetic field in the background of anti-de Sitter spaces. We consider two types of nonlinear electromagnetic field namely, logarithmic and exponential forms. We investigate the geometric effects of nonlinearity parameter and find that for large $r$, these solutions recover the rotating back string solutions of Einstein-Maxwell theory. We calculate the conserved and thermodynamic quantities of the rotating black string. We also analyze thermodynamics of the spacetime and verify the validity of the first law of thermodynamics for the obtained solutions.
