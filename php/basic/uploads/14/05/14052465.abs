Title: Some remarks about non-minimally coupled scalar field models
Authors: Carlos R. Fadragas and Genly Leon
Abstract: Several results related to flat Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker models in the conformal (Einstein) frame of scalar-tensor gravity theories are extended. Scalar fields with arbitrary (positive) potentials and arbitrary coupling functions are considered. Mild assumptions under such functions (differentiable class, number of singular points, asymptotes, etc) are introduced in a straightforward manner in order to characterize the asymptotic structure on a phase space. We pay special attention to the possible scaling solutions. Numerical evidence confirming our results is presented.
