Title: The holographic dual of a Hawking pair has a wormhole
Authors: Kristan Jensen and Andreas Karch and Brandon Robinson
Abstract: In previous work, two of us constructed the holographic dual of a single Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Here we extend that work in two directions. First, we use a Randall-Sundrum brane to couple the entangled pair to dynamical gravity. Second, we consider the entangled pair in the background of a black hole with the particles on opposite sides of the horizon, turning the EPR pair into a Hawking pair. We give general arguments that ER=EPR should be understood as a duality between two equivalent descriptions of the same physical reality.
