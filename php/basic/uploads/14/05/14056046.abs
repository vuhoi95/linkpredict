Title: Bethe/Gauge correspondence on curved spaces
Authors: Nikita A. Nekrasov and Samson L. Shatashvili
Abstract: Bethe/gauge correspondence identifies supersymmetric vacua of massive gauge theories invariant under the two dimensional N=2 Poincare supersymmetry with the stationary states of some quantum integrable system. The supersymmetric theory can be twisted in a number of ways, producing a topological field theory. For these theories we compute the handle gluing operator H. We also discuss the Gaudin conjecture on the norm of Bethe states and its connection to H.
