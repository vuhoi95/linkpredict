Title: Quantum Gravity, Dynamical Phase Space and String Theory
Authors: Laurent Freidel and Robert G. Leigh and Djordje Minic
Abstract: In a natural extension of the relativity principle we argue that a quantum theory of gravity involves two fundamental scales associated with both dynamical space-time as well as dynamical momentum space. This view of quantum gravity is explicitly realized in a new formulation of string theory which involves dynamical phase space and in which space-time is a derived concept. This formulation naturally unifies symplectic geometry of Hamiltonian dynamics, complex geometry of quantum theory and real geometry of general relativity. The space-time and momentum space dynamics, and thus dynamical phase space, is governed by a new version of the Renormalization Group.
