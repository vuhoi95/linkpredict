Title: Inflaton fluctuations in the presence of cosmological defects
Authors: Hing-Tong Cho and Kin-Wang Ng and I-Chin Wang
Abstract: We study quantum fluctuations of a free massless scalar field during inflation in the presence of a point, line, or plane defect such as a black hole, cosmic string, or domain wall, using a perturbative expansion in powers of small defect parameters. We provide results for the scalar two-point correlation functions that show explicitly a small violation of translational invariance during inflation.
