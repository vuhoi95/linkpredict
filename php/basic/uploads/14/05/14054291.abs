Title: Topological Model for Domain Walls in (Super-)Yang-Mills Theories
Authors: Markus Dierigl and Alexander Pritzel
Abstract: We derive a topological action that describes the confining phase of (Super-)Yang-Mills theories with gauge group $SU(N)$, similar to the work recently carried out by Seiberg and collaborators. It encodes all the Aharonov-Bohm phases of the possible non-local operators and phases generated by the intersection of flux tubes. Within this topological framework we show that the worldvolume theory of domain walls contains a Chern-Simons term at level $N$ also seen in string theory constructions. The discussion can also illuminate dynamical differences of domain walls in the supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric framework. Two further analogies, to string theory and the fractional quantum Hall effect might lead to additional possibilities to investigate the dynamics.
