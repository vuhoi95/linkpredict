Title: Regge behavior in effective field theory
Authors: John F. Donoghue and Basem Kamal El-Menoufi and Grigory Ovanesyan
Abstract: We derive the Regge behavior for the forward scattering amplitude in scalar field theory using the method of regions. We find that the leading Regge behavior to all orders can be obtained. Regge physics emerges from a kinematic region that involves the overlap of several modes, so that a careful treatment of the overlap regions is important. The most consistent and efficient approach utilizes graphs containing collinear, anti-collinear and Glauber modes, or modes of SCET_G
