Title: Natural Inflation with Natural Trans-Planckian Axion Decay Constant from  Anomalous $U(1)_X$
Authors: Tianjun Li and Zhijin Li and Dimitri V. Nanopoulos
Abstract: We propose a natural inflation model driven by an imaginary or axionic component of a K\"ahler modulus in string-inspired supergravity. The shift symmetry of the axion is gauged under an anomalous $U(1)_X$ symmetry, which leads to a modulus-dependent Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) term. The matter fields are stabilized by F-terms, and the real component of the modulus is stabilized by the $U(1)_X$ D-term, while its axion remains light. Therefore, the masses of real and imaginary components of the modulus are separated at different scales. The scalar potential for natural inflation is realized by the superpotential from the non-perturbative effects. The trans-Planckian axion decay constant, which is needed to fit with BICEP2 observations, can be obtained naturally in this model.
