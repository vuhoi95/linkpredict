Title: AdS/CFT Correspondence Beyond its Supergravity Approximation
Authors: Mir Faizal and Ahmed Farag Ali and Ali Nassar
Abstract: We will study the AdS/CFT correspondence in an intermediate region between the strong form of this correspondence (string theory on AdS being dual to a boundary CFT), and the weak form of this correspondence (supergravity on AdS being dual to a boundary CFT). We will go beyond the supergravity approximation in the AdS by using the fact that strings have an extended structure. We will also calculate the CFT dual to such string corrections in the bulk, and demonstrate that they are consistent with the strong form of the AdS/CFT correspondence. So, even though the conformal dimensions of both the relevant and the irrelevant operators will receive string corrections, the conformal dimension of marginal operators will not receive any such corrections.
