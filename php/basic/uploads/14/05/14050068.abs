Title: Monodromy Inflation in SUSY QCD
Authors: Michael Dine and Patrick Draper and Angelo Monteux
Abstract: The discovery of a large tensor-to-scalar ratio by the BICEP2 experiment points to large field excursions during inflation. One framework that predicts large $r$ is monodromy inflation. While discussed mainly in the context of string theory, the phenomenon can be illustrated and studied in the well-understood framework of SUSY QCD with a large number of colors. We discuss the requirements for viable inflation as well as various difficulties for model building, including tunneling, tuning, and the species problem.
