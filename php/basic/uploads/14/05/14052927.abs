Abstract: One problem in the application of the Skyrme model to nuclear physics is that it predicts too large a value for the compression modulus of nuclear matter. Here we investigate the thermodynamics of the BPS Skyrme model at zero temperature and calculate its equation of state. Among other results, we find that classically (i.e. without taking into account quantum corrections) the compressibility of BPS skyrmions is, in fact, infinite, corresponding to a zero compression modulus. This suggests that the inclusion of the BPS submodel into the Skyrme model lagrangian may significantly reduce this too large value, providing further evidence for the claim that the BPS Skyrme model may play an important role in the description of nuclei and nuclear matter.
