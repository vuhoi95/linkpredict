Title: How the quantum emerges from gravity
Authors: Anushrut Sharma and Tejinder P. Singh
Abstract: The dynamics of a massive, relativistic spinning particle could be described either by the Dirac equation or by the Kerr solution of Einstein equations. However, one does not know a priori as to which of the two systems of equations should be used in a given situation, and the choice is dictated by experiments. It is expected that the Dirac equation holds for microscopic masses, and the Kerr solution for macroscopic masses. This suggests that Einstein gravity and the Dirac theory are limiting cases of a common underlying theoretical framework. Here we propose that such a framework is provided by a geometric theory of gravity on a Riemann-Cartan spacetime, which includes torsion. The Dirac equation emerges as the torsion dominated, gravity-free limit of this framework.
