Title: Braneworld setup and embedding in teleparallel gravity
Authors: A. Behboodi and S. Akhshabi and K. Nozari
Abstract: We construct the setup of a five-dimensional braneworld scenario in teleparallel gravity. Both cases of Minkowski and Friedmann-Robertson-Walker branes embedded in Anti de Sitter bulk are studied and the effective 4-D action were studied. 4-dimensional local Lorentz invariance is found to be recovered in both cases. However, due to different junction conditions, the equations governing the 4-D cosmological evolution differ from general relativistic case. Using the results of Ref. [13], we consider a simple inflationary scenario in this setup. The inflation parameters are found to be modified compared to general relativistic case.
