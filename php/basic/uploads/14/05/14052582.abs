Title: From the sine-Gordon field theory to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang growth  equation
Authors: Pasquale Calabrese and Marton Kormos and Pierre Le Doussal
Abstract: We unveil a remarkable connection between the sine-Gordon quantum field theory and the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) growth equation. We find that the non-relativistic limit of the two point correlation function of the sine-Gordon theory is related to the generating function of the height distribution of the KPZ field with droplet initial conditions, i.e. the directed polymer free energy with two endpoints fixed. As shown recently, the latter can be expressed as a Fredholm determinant which in the large time separation limit converges to the GUE Tracy-Widom cumulative distribution. Possible applications and extensions are discussed.
