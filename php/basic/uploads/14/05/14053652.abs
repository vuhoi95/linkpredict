Title: The Powers of Monodromy
Authors: Liam McAllister and Eva Silverstein and Alexander Westphal and Timm Wrase
Abstract: Flux couplings to string theory axions yield super-Planckian field ranges along which the axion potential energy grows. At the same time, other aspects of the physics remain essentially unchanged along these large displacements, respecting a discrete shift symmetry with a sub-Planckian period. After a general overview of this monodromy effect and its application to large-field inflation, we present new classes of specific models of monodromy inflation, with monomial potentials $\mu^{4-p}\phi^p$. A key simplification in these models is that the inflaton potential energy plays a leading role in moduli stabilization during inflation. The resulting inflaton-dependent shifts in the moduli fields lead to an effective flattening of the inflaton potential, i.e. a reduction of the exponent from a fiducial value $p_0$ to $p<p_0$. We focus on examples arising in compactifications of type IIB string theory on products of tori or Riemann surfaces, where the inflaton descends from the NS-NS two-form potential $B_2$, with monodromy induced by a coupling to the R-R field strength $F_1$. In this setting we exhibit models with $p=2/3,4/3,2,$ and $3$, corresponding to predictions for the tensor-to-scalar ratio of $r\approx 0.04, 0.09, 0.13,$ and $0.2$, respectively. Using mirror symmetry, we also motivate a second class of examples with the role of the axions played by the real parts of complex structure moduli, with fluxes inducing monodromy.
