Authors: Da-Zhu Ma and Jian-Pin Wu and Jifang Zhang
Abstract: By the Poincare sections, the dynamical behaviors of the ring string in the AdS-Gauss-Bonnet (AdS-GB) black hole are studied. A threshold value of the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) parameter $\lambda$ are found by the numerical method, below which the behavior of this dynamical system is no-chaotic and above which the behavior becomes gradually chaotic. The chaotic behavior becomes stronger with the increases of GB parameter. It is different from the case in the AdS-Schwarzschild black hole, which is weakly chaotic. Furthermore, we confirm our findings by the Fast Lyapunov indicators.
