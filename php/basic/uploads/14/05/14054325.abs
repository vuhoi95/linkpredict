Title: A bubbling bolt
Authors: Guillaume Bossard and Stefanos Katmadas
Abstract: We present a new solvable system, solving the equations of five-dimensional ungauged N=1 supergravity coupled to vector multiplets, that allows for non-extremal solutions and reduces to a known system when restricted to the floating brane Ansatz. A two-centre globally hyperbolic smooth geometry is obtained as a solution to this system, describing a bubble linking a Gibbons--Hawking centre to a charged bolt. However this solution turns out to violate the BPS bound, and we show that its generalisation to an arbitrary number of Gibbons--Hawking centres never admits a spin structure.
