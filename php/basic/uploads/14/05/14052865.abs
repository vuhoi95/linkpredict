Title: Instabilities in Anisotropic Chiral Plasmas
Authors: Avdhesh Kumar and Jitesh R. Bhatt and P. K. Kaw
Abstract: Using the Berry-curvature modified kinetic equation we study instabilities in anisotropic chiral plasmas. It is demonstrated that even for a very small value of anisotropic parameter the chiral-imbalance instability is strongly modified. The instability is enhanced when the modes propagates in the direction parallel to the anisotropy vector and it is strongly suppressed when the modes propagate in the perpendicular direction. Further the instabilities in the jet-plasma system is also investigated. For the case when the modes are propagating in direction parallel to the stream velocity we find that there exist a new branch of the dispersion relation arising due to the parity odd effects. We also show that the parity-odd interaction can enhance the streaming instability.
