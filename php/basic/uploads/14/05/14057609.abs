Title: Critical behaviors of black hole in an asymptotically safe gravity with  cosmological constant
Authors: Meng-Sen Ma and Ya-Qin Ma
Abstract: We study the $P-V/r_{+}$ criticality and phase transition of quantum-corrected black hole in asymptotic safety (AS) gravity in the extended phase space. For the black hole, the cosmological constant is dependent on the momentum cutoff or energy scale, therefore one can naturally treat it as a variable and connect it with the thermodynamic pressure. We find that for the quantum-corrected black hole there is a similar first-order phase transition to that of the van der Waals liquid/gas system. We also analyze the types of the phase transition at the critical points according to Ehrenfest's classification. It is shown that they are second-order phase transition.
