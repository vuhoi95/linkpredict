Title: A class of charged black hole solutions in massive (bi)gravity
Authors: Eugeny Babichev and Alessandro Fabbri
Abstract: We present a new class of solutions describing charged black holes in massive (bi)gravity. For a generic choice of the parameters of the massive gravity action, the solution is the Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter metric written in the Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates for both metrics. We also study a special case of the parameters, for which the space of solutions contains an extra symmetry.
