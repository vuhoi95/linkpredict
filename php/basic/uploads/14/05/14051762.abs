Title: BICEP2 and the Central Charge of Holographic Inflation
Authors: Finn Larsen and Andrew Strominger
Abstract: Holographic inflation posits that the inflationary deSitter era of our universe is approximately described by a dual three-dimensional Euclidean CFT living on the spatial slice at the end of inflation. We point out that the BICEP2 results determine the central charge of this putative CFT to be given by $C_T=1.2 \times 10^9$.
