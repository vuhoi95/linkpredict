Title: On the collinear limit of scattering amplitudes at strong coupling
Authors: Benjamin Basso and Amit Sever and Pedro Vieira
Abstract: In this letter we consider the collinear limit of gluon scattering amplitudes in planar N=4 SYM theory at strong coupling. We argue that in this limit scattering amplitudes map into correlators of twist fields in the two dimensional non-linear O(6) sigma model, similar to those appearing in recent studies of entanglement entropy. We provide evidence for this assertion by combining the intuition springing from the string worldsheet picture and the predictions coming from the OPE series. One of the main implications of these considerations is that scattering amplitudes receive equally important contributions at strong coupling from both the minimal string area and its fluctuations in the sphere.
