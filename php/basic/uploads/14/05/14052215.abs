Title: Dirac fermions on an anti-de Sitter background
Authors: Victor E. Ambrus and Elizabeth Winstanley
Abstract: Using an exact expression for the bi-spinor of parallel transport, we construct the Feynman propagator for Dirac fermions in the vacuum state on anti-de Sitter space-time. We compute the vacuum expectation value of the stress-energy tensor by removing coincidence-limit divergences using the Hadamard method. We then use the vacuum Feynman propagator to compute thermal expectation values at finite temperature. We end with a discussion of rigidly rotating thermal states.
