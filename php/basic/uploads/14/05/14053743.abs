Title: Nonlinear constraints on gravity from entanglement
Authors: Shamik Banerjee and Apratim Kaviraj and Aninda Sinha
Abstract: Using the positivity of relative entropy arising from the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for spherical entangling surfaces, we obtain constraints at the nonlinear level for the gravitational dual. We calculate the Green's function necessary to compute the first order correction to the entangling surface and use this to find the relative entropy for non-constant stress tensors in a derivative expansion. We show that the Einstein value satisfies the positivity condition while the multi-dimensional parameter space away from it gets constrained.
