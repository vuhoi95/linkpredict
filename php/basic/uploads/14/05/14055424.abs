Title: Casimir Effect in the Horava-Lifshitz Gravity with a Cosmological  Constant
Authors: C. R. Muniz and V. B. Bezerra and M. S. Cunha
Abstract: We calculate the Casimir energy of a massless scalar field confined between two nearby parallel plates formed by ideal uncharged conductors, placed tangentially to the surface of a sphere with mass M and radius R. To this end, we take into account a static and spherically symmetric solution of Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity, with a cosmological constant term, in lower orders of approximation, considering both weak-field and infrared limits. We show that the Casimir energy, just in the second order weak-field approximation, is modified due to the parameter of the HL gravity as well as to the cosmological constant.
