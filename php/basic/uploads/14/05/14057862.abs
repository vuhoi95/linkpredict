Title: Holographic stress tensor at finite coupling
Authors: Kallol Sen and Aninda Sinha
Abstract: We calculate one, two and three point functions of the holographic stress tensor for any bulk Lagrangian of the form ${\mathcal{L}}(g^{ab}, R_{abcd}, \nabla_e R_{abcd})$. Using the first law of entanglement, a simple method has recently been proposed to compute the holographic stress tensor arising from a higher derivative gravity dual. The stress tensor is proportional to a dimension dependent factor which depends on the higher derivative couplings. In this paper, we identify this proportionality constant with a B-type trace anomaly in even dimensions for any bulk Lagrangian of the above form. This in turn relates to ${\mathcal{C}}_T$, the coefficient appearing in the two point function of stress tensors. We use a background field method to compute the two and three point function of stress tensors for any bulk Lagrangian of the above form in arbitrary dimensions. As an application we consider general situations where $\eta/s$ for holographic plasmas is less than the KSS bound.
