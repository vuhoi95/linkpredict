Title: Greybody factors for Myers-Perry black holes
Authors: Petarpa Boonserm and Auttakit Chatrabhuti and Tritos Ngampitipan and Matt Visser
Abstract: The Myers-Perry black holes are higher-dimensional generalizations of the usual (3+1)-dimensional rotating Kerr black hole. They are of considerable interest in Kaluza-Klein models, specifically within the context of brane-world versions thereof. In the present article we shall consider the greybody factors associated with scalar field excitations of the Myers-Perry spacetimes, and develop some rigorous bounds on these greybody factors. These bounds are of relevance for characterizing both the higher-dimensional Hawking radiation, and the super-radiance, that is expected for these spacetimes.
