Title: Rotating black holes in three-dimensional Ho≈ôava gravity
Authors: Thomas P. Sotiriou and Ian Vega and Daniele Vernieri
Abstract: We study black holes in the infrared sector of three-dimensional Ho\v{r}ava gravity. It is shown that black hole solutions with anti-de Sitter asymptotics are admissible only in the sector of the theory in which the scalar degree of freedom propagates infinitely fast. We derive the most general class of stationary, circularly symmetric, asymptotically anti-de Sitter black hole solutions. We also show that the theory admits black hole solutions with de Sitter and flat asymptotics, unlike three-dimensional general relativity. For all these cases, universal horizons may or may not exist depending on the choice of parameters. Solutions with de Sitter asymptotics can have universal horizons that lie beyond the de Sitter horizon.
