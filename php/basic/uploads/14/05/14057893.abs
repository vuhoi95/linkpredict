Title: Hairy black holes: stability under odd-parity perturbations and  existence of slowly rotating solutions
Authors: Andres Anabalon and Jiří Bičák and Joel Saavedra
Abstract: We show that, independently of the scalar field potential and of specific asymptotic properties of the spacetime (asymptotically flat, de Sitter or anti-de Sitter), any static, spherically symmetric or planar, black hole or soliton solution of the Einstein theory minimally coupled to a real scalar field with a general potential is mode stable under linear odd-parity perturbations. To this end, we generalize the Regge-Wheeler equation for a generic self-interacting scalar field, and show that the potential of the relevant Schr\"odinger operator can be mapped, by the so-called S-deformation, to a semi-positively defined potential. With these results at hand we study the existence of slowly rotating configurations. The frame dragging effect is compared with the Kerr black hole.
