Title: Explicit boundary form factors: the scaling Lee-Yang model
Authors: L. Hollo and Z. B. Laczko and Z. Bajnok
Abstract: We provide explicit expressions for boundary form factors in the boundary scaling Lee-Yang model for operators with the mildest ultraviolet behavior for all integrable boundary conditions. The form factors of the boundary stress tensor take a determinant form, while the form factors of the boundary primary field contain additional explicit polynomials.
