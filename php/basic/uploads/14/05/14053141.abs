Title: Construction of Gaiotto states with fundamental multiplets through  Degenerate DAHA
Authors: Yutaka Matsuo and Chaiho Rim and Hong Zhang
Abstract: We construct Gaiotto states with fundamental multiplets in $SU(N)$ gauge theories, in terms of the orthonormal basis of spherical degenerate double affine Hecke algebra (SH in short), the representations of which are equivalent to those of $W_n$ algebra with additional $U(1)$ current. The generalized Whittaker conditions are demonstrated under the action of SH, and further rewritten in terms of $W_n$ algebra. Our approach not only consists with the existing literature but also holds for general $SU(N)$ case.
