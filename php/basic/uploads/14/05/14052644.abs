Title: Signature of the Van der Waals like small-large charged AdS black hole  phase transition in quasinormal modes
Authors: Yunqi Liu and De-Cheng Zou and Bin Wang
Abstract: We calculate the quasinormal modes of massless scalar perturbations around small and large four-dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom-Anti de Sitter (RN-AdS) black holes. We find a dramatic change in the slopes of quasinormal frequencies in small and large black holes near the critical point where the Van der Waals like thermodynamic phase transition happens. This further supports that the quasinormal mode can be a dynamic probe of the thermodynamic phase transition.
