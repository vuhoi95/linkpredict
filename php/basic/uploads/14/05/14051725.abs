Title: Planck Data and Ultralight Axions
Authors: Csaba Csaki and Nemanja Kaloper and John Terning
Abstract: We examine the effects of photon-axion mixing on the CMB. We show that if there are very underdense regions between us and the last scattering surface which contain coherent magnetic fields (whose strength can be orders of magnitude weaker than the current bounds), then photon-axion mixing can induce observable deviations in the CMB spectrum. Specifically, we show that the mixing can give rise to non-thermal spots on the CMB sky. As an example we consider the well known CMB cold spot, which according to the Planck data has a weak distortion from a black body spectrum, that can be fit by our model. While this explanation of the non-thermality in the region of the cold spot is quite intriguing, photon-axion oscillation do not explain the temperature of the cold spot itself. Nevertheless we demonstrate the possible sensitivity of the CMB to ultralight axions which could be exploited by observers.
