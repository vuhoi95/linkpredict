Title: Symplectic Deformations of Gauged Maximal Supergravity
Authors: Gianguido Dall'Agata and Gianluca Inverso and Alessio Marrani
Abstract: We identify the space of symplectic deformations of maximal gauged supergravity theories. Coordinates of such space parametrize inequivalent supergravity models with the same gauge group. We apply our procedure to the SO(8) gauging, extending recent analyses. We also study other interesting cases, including Cremmer-Scherk-Schwarz models and gaugings of groups contained in SL(8,R) and in SU*(8).
