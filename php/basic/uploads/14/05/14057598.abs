Title: The NSVZ beta-function in supersymmetric theories with different  regularizations and renormalization prescriptions
Authors: A. L. Kataev and K. V. Stepanyantz
Abstract: We briefly review the calculations of quantum corrections related with the exact NSVZ $\beta$-function in ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric theories, paying especial attention to the scheme dependence of the results. It is explained, how the NSVZ relation is obtained for the renormalization group functions defined in terms of the bare coupling constant if a theory is regularized by higher derivatives. Also we describe, how to construct a special renormalization prescription which gives the NSVZ relation for the renormalization group functions defined in terms of the renormalized coupling constant exactly in all orders for Abelian supersymmetric theories, regularized by higher derivatives. The scheme dependence of the NSVZ $\beta$-function (for the renormalization group functions defined in terms of the renormalized coupling constant) is discussed in the non-Abelian case. It is shown that in this case the NSVZ $\beta$-function leads to a certain scheme-independent equality.
