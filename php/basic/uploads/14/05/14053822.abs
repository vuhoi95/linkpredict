Title: Relativistic Bohmain Mechanics
Authors: Jafar Khodagholizadeh and Javad Kazemi and Alireza Babazadeh
Abstract: In this paper we generalize the ideas of de Broglie and Bohm to the relativistic case which is based on the relativistic Schr\"odinger equation. In this regard, the relativistic forms of the guidance equation and quantum potential are derived. In our formulation of Relativistic Bohmian Mechanic, the quantum equilibrium hypothesis $(\rho=|\psi|^{2})$ and the probabilistic interpretation of the wave function are not an intrinsic feature of the theory as well as expected from the theoretical structure of Bohmian mechanics but still we can extract the statistical predictions of this theory. In fact with assuming the quantum equilibrium hypothesis in non-relativistic case and then acceleration to particles by an external field we go to the relativistic regime. So in this case the quantum equilibrium would not be established and theory will have testable predictions that can be experienced, or this will be compared to the result of relativistic quantum mechanics. In some simple cases such calculations have been done.
