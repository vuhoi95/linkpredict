Title: Algebraic Bethe ansatz for the XXX chain with triangular boundaries and  Gaudin model
Authors: N. Cirilo António and N. Manojlović and I. Salom
Abstract: We implement fully the algebraic Bethe ansatz for the XXX Heisenberg spin chain in the case when both boundary matrices can be brought to the upper-triangular form. We define the Bethe vectors which yield the strikingly simple expression for the off shell action of the transfer matrix, deriving the spectrum and the corresponding Bethe equations. We explore further these results by obtaining the off shell action of the generating function of the Gaudin Hamiltonians on the Bethe vectors through the so-called quasi-classical limit.
