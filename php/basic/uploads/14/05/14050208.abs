Abstract: We show that theories having second-order field equations in the context of higher-dimensional modified gravity are not restricted to the family of Lovelock Lagrangians, but can also be obtained if no a priori assumption on the relation between the metric and affine structures of space-time is made (Palatini approach). We illustrate this fact by considering the case of Palatini $f(R)$ gravities in five dimensions. Our results provide an alternative avenue to explore new domains of the AdS/CFT correspondence without resorting to {\it ad hoc} quasi-topological constructions.
