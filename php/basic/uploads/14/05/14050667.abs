Title: FRW cosmology with the extended Chaplygin gas
Authors: B. Pourhassan and E. O. Kahya
Abstract: In this paper, we propose extended Chaplygin gas equation of state for which it recovers barotropic fluid with quadratic equation of state. We use numerical method to investigate the behavior of some cosmological parameters such as scale factor, Hubble expansion parameter, energy density and deceleration parameter. We also discuss about the resulting effective equation of state parameter. Using density perturbations we investigate the stability of the theory.
