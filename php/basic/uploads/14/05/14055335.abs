Abstract: A Lagrangian formulation is given extending to N = 1 supersymmetry the motion of a charged point particle with spin in a non-abelian external field. The classical formulation is constructed for any external static non-abelian SU(N) gauge potential. As an illustration, a specific gauge is fixed enabling canonical quantization and the study of the supersymmetric non-abelian Landau problem. The spectrum of the quantum Hamiltonian operator follows in accordance with the supersymmetric structure.
