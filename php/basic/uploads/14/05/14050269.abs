Authors: Adel Bouchareb and Chiang-Mei Chen and Gérard Clément and Dmitri Gal'tsov
Abstract: We report on a series of new solutions to five-dimensional minimal supergravity. Our method applies to space-times with two commuting Killing symmetries and consists in combining dimensional reduction on two-spaces of constant curvature with reduction on a two-torus. The first gives rise to various generalized Bertotti-Robinson solutions supported by electric and magnetic fluxes, which presumably describe the near-horizon regions of black holes and black rings (strings). The second provides generating techniques based on U-duality of the corresponding three-dimensional sigma model. We identify duality transformations relating the above solutions to asymptotically flat ones and obtain new globally regular dyonic solitons. Some new extremal asymptotically flat multi-center solutions are constructed too. We also show that geodesic solutions of three-dimensional sigma models passing through the same target space point generically split into disjoint classes which cannot be related by the isotropy subgroup of U-duality.
