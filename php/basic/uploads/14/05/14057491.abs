Title: Evading Lyth bound in models of quintessential inflation
Authors: Md. Wali Hossain and R. Myrzakulov and M. Sami and Emmanuel N. Saridakis
Abstract: Quintessential inflation refers to an attempt to unify inflation and late-time cosmic acceleration using a single scalar field. In this letter we consider two different classes of quintessential inflation, one of which is based upon a Lagrangian with non-canonical kinetic term $k^2(\phi)\partial^\mu \phi \partial_\mu \phi$ and a steep exponential potential while the second class uses the concept of steep brane world inflation. We show that in both cases the Lyth bound can be evaded, despite the large tensor-to-scalar ratio of perturbations. The post-inflationary dynamics is consistent with nucleosynthesis constraint in these cases.
