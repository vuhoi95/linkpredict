Authors: Negin Fatahi and Mohamad Vahid Takook and Mohamad Reza Tanhayi
Abstract: In this paper, we study the conformally invariant field equations for vector-spinor field in de Sitter space-time. The solutions are also obtained in terms of the de Sitter-Dirac plane waves. The related two-point functions are calculated in both de Sitter ambient space formalism and intrinsic de Sitter coordinate. In order to study the conformal invariance, Dirac s six-cone formalism is utilized in which the field equations are expressed in a manifestly conformal way in 4 + 2 dimensional conformal space and then followed by the projection to de Sitter space.
