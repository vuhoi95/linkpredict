Title: Spontaneously Broken Gauge Theories and the Coset Construction
Authors: Garrett Goon and Austin Joyce and Mark Trodden
Abstract: The methods of non-linear realizations have proven to be powerful in studying the low energy physics resulting from spontaneously broken internal and spacetime symmetries. In this paper, we reconsider how these techniques may be applied to the case of spontaneously broken gauge theories, concentrating on Yang-Mills theories. We find that coset methods faithfully reproduce the description of low energy physics in terms of massive gauge bosons and discover that the St\"uckelberg replacement commonly employed when treating massive gauge theories arises in a natural manner. Uses of the methods are considered in various contexts, including generalizations to $p$-form gauge fields. We briefly discuss potential applications of the techniques to theories of massive gravity and their possible interpretation as a Higgs phase of general relativity.
