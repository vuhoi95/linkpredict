Title: The KdV in Cosmology: a useful tool or a distraction?
Authors: A. V. Yaparova and A. V. Yurov and V. A. Yurov
Abstract: The letter is a response to the recent article by J. Lidsey. We demonstrate that the Schwarzian derivative technique developed therein is but a consequence of linearizabiliy of the original cosmological equations. Furthermore, we show the required linearized equation to be nothing else but a Schr\"odinger equation.
