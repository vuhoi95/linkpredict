Title: Spinning strings and minimal surfaces in $AdS_3$ with mixed 3-form  fluxes
Authors: Justin R. David and Abhishake Sadhukhan
Abstract: Motivated by the recent proposal for the S-matrix in $AdS_3\times S^3$ with mixed three form fluxes, we study classical folded string spinning in $AdS_3$ with both Ramond and Neveu-Schwarz three form fluxes. We solve the equations of motion of these strings and obtain their dispersion relation to the leading order in the Neveu-Schwarz flux $b$. We show that dispersion relation for the spinning strings with large spin ${\cal S}$ acquires a term given by $-\frac{\sqrt{\lambda}}{2\pi} b^2\log^2 {\cal S}$ in addition to the usual $\frac{\sqrt\lambda}{\pi} \log {\cal S}$ term where $\sqrt{\lambda}$ is proportional to the square of the radius of $AdS_3$. Using SO(2,2) transformations and re-parmetrizations we show that these spinning strings can be related to light like Wilson loops in $AdS_3$ with Neveu-Schwarz flux $b$. We observe that the logarithmic divergence in the area of the light like Wilson loop is also deformed by precisely the same coefficient of the $ b^2 \log^2 {\cal S}$ term in the dispersion relation of the spinning string. This result indicates that the coefficient of $ b^2 \log^2 {\cal S}$ has a property similar to the coefficient of the $\log {\cal S}$ term, known as cusp-anomalous dimension, and can possibly be determined to all orders in the coupling $\lambda$ using the recent proposal for the S-matrix.
