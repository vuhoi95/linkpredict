Title: A universal correction to higher spin entanglement entropy

Abstract: We consider conformal field theories in 1+1 dimensions with W-algebra symmetries, deformed by a chemical potential \mu for the spin-three current. We show that the order \mu^2 correction to the Re'nyi and entanglement entropies of a single interval in the deformed theory, on the infinite spatial line and at finite temperature, is universal. The correction is completely determined by the operator product expansion of two spin-three currents, and by the expectation values of the stress tensor, its descendants and its composites, evaluated on the n-sheeted Riemann surface branched along the interval. This explains the recently found agreement of the order \mu^2 correction across distinct free field CFTs and higher spin black hole solutions holographically dual to CFTs with W-symmetry.
