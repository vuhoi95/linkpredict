Title: Spiky strings on AdS3 x S3 with NS-NS flux
Authors: Aritra Banerjee and Kamal L. Panigrahi and Pabitra M. Pradhan
Abstract: We study rigidly rotating strings in the background of AdS3 x S3 with Neveu-Schwarz (NS) fluxes. We find two interesting limiting cases corresponding to the known giant magnon and the new single spike solution of strings in the above background and write down the dispersion relations among various conserved charges. We use proper regularization to find the correct relations among them. We further study the circular and infinite spiky strings on AdS and study their properties.
