Title: Quantum Entropy for the Fuzzy Sphere and its Monopoles
Authors: Nirmalendu Acharyya and Nitin Chandra and Sachindeo Vaidya
Abstract: Using generalized bosons, we construct the fuzzy sphere $S_F^2$ and monopoles on $S_F^2$ in a reducible representation of $SU(2)$. The corresponding quantum states are naturally obtained using the GNS-construction. We show that there is an emergent non-abelian unitary gauge symmetry which is in the commutant of the algebra of observables. The quantum states are necessarily mixed and have non-vanishing von Neumann entropy, which increases monotonically under a bistochastic Markov map. The maximum value of the entropy has a simple relation to the degeneracy of the irreps that constitute the reducible representation that underlies the fuzzy sphere.
