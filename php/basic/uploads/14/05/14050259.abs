Title: Effect of the twist operator in the D1D5 CFT
Authors: Zaq Carson and Shaun Hampton and Samir D. Mathur and David Turton
Abstract: The D1D5 CFT has been very useful in the study of black holes. The interaction in this theory involves a twist operator, which links together different copies of a free CFT. For the bosonic fields, we examine the action of this twist when it links together CFT copies with winding numbers M and N to produce a copy with winding M+N. Starting with the vacuum state generates a squeezed state, which we compute. Starting with an initial excitation on one of the copies gives a linear combination of excitations on the final state, which we also compute. These results generalize earlier computations where these quantities were computed for the special case M=N=1. Our results should help in understanding the thermalization process in the D1D5 CFT, which gives the dual of black hole formation in the bulk.
