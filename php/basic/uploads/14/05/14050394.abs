Title: Gribov ambiguity and degenerate systems
Authors: Fabrizio Canfora and Fiorenza de Micheli and Patricio Salgado-Rebolledo and Jorge Zanelli
Abstract: The relation between Gribov ambiguity and degeneracies in the symplectic structure of physical systems is analyzed. It is shown that, in finite-dimensional systems, the presence of Gribov ambiguities in regular constrained systems (those where the constraints are functionally independent) always leads to a degenerate symplectic structure upon Dirac reduction. The implications for the Gribov-Zwanziger approach to QCD are discussed.
