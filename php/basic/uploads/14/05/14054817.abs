Title: Wormholes and entanglement in holography
Authors: Kristan Jensen and Julian Sonner
Abstract: In this essay, we consider highly entangled states in theories with a gravity dual, where the entangled degrees of freedom are causally disconnected from each other. Using the basic rules of holography, we argue that there is a non-traversable wormhole in the gravity dual whose geometry encodes the pattern of the entanglement.
