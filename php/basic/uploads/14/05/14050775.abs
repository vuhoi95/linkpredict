Abstract: We study parameter space in the axion monodromy inflation corrected by dynamically generated terms involving with the axion. The potential has the linear potential with multiple sinusoidal functions, which play a role in generating modulations. We show that this potential leads both to a large tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_T \sim 0.16$ and to a large negative running of spectral index $\alpha_s \sim - (0.02 -0.03)$. To realize these results, a small hierarchy among dynamical scales is required whereas the decay constants in sinusoidal functions remain sub-Planckian in this model. We discuss also reheating process after the inflation in a bottom-up approach.
