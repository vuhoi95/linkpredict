Title: Probing the primordial Universe from the low-multipole CMB data
Authors: Cheng Cheng and Qing-Guo Huang
Abstract: Since the temperature fluctuations in cosmic microwave background (CMB) on large-angular scales probe length scales that were super-horizon sized at photon decoupling and hence insensitive to microphysical processes, the low-multipole CMB data are supposed to be a good probe to the physics of the primordial Universe. In this letter we will constrain the cosmological parameters in the base $\Lambda$CDM model with tensor perturbations by only using low-multipole CMB data, including Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization (B2), Planck released in 2013 (P13) and Wilkinson Microwaves Anisotropy Probe 9-year data (W9). We find that a red tilted power spectrum of relic gravitational waves is compatible with the data, but a blue tilted power spectrum of scalar perturbations on the large scales is preferred at around $2\sigma$ confidence level.
