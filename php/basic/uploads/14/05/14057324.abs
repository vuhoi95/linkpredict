Abstract: The explicit expressions for the one-loop non-perturbative corrections to the gravitational effective action induced by a scalar field on a stationary gravitational background are obtained both at zero and finite temperatures. The perturbative and non-perturbative contributions to the one-loop effective action are explicitly separated. It is proved that, after a suitable renormalization, the perturbative part of the effective action at zero temperature can be expressed in a covariant form solely in terms of the metric and its derivatives. This part coincides with the known large mass expansion of the one-loop effective action. The non-perturbative part of the renormalized one-loop effective action at zero temperature is proved to depend explicitly on the Killing vector defining the vacuum state of quantum fields. This part cannot be expressed in a covariant way through the metric and its derivatives alone. The implications of this result for the structure and symmetries of the effective action for gravity are discussed.
