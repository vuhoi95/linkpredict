Abstract: A geometric torsion dynamics leading to an effective curvature in a second order formalism on a D4-brane is revisited with a renewed interest. We obtain two effective $AdS_4$ brane geometries on a vacuum created pair of $(D{\bar D})_3$-brane. One of them is shown to describe an AdS Schwarzschild spinning black hole and the other is shown to describe a spinning black hole bound state. It is argued that a D-instanton in a vacuum created anti D3-brane within a pair may describe a quintessence. It may seen to incorporate a varying vacuum energy density in a brane universe. We consider the effective curvature scalar on $S^1\times S^1$ to analyze torsion-less geometries on a vacuum created pair of $(D{\bar D})_2$-brane. The emergent $AdS_3$ brane is shown to describe a Schwarzschild and a Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) geometries in presence of extra dimension(s).
