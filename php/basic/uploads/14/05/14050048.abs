Title: Adinkra `Color' Confinement In Exemplary Off-Shell Constructions Of 4D,  ${\cal N}$ = 2 Supersymmetry Representations
Authors: S. James Gates, Jr. and Kory Stiffler
Abstract: Evidence is presented in some examples that an adinkra quantum number, $\chi_{\rm o}$ (arXiv:\ 0902.3830 [hep-th]), seems to play a role with regard to off-shell 4D, $\cal N$ = 2 SUSY similar to the role of color in QCD. The vanishing of this adinkra quantum number appears to be a condition required for when two off-shell 4D, $\cal N$ = 1 supermultiplets form an off-shell 4D, $\cal N$ = 2 supermultiplet. We also explicitly comment on a deformation of the Lie bracket and anti-commutator operators that has been extensively and implicitly used in our work on "Garden Algebras" adinkras, and codes.
