Title: Super-Yang-Mills theories on S4 x R
Authors: Jungmin Kim and Seok Kim and Kimyeong Lee and Jaemo Park
Abstract: We construct super-Yang-Mills theories on S4 x R, S4 x S1 and S4 x interval with the field content of maximal SYM, coupled to boundary degrees in the last case. These theories provide building blocks of the `5d uplifts' of gauge theories on S4, obtained by compactifying the 6d (2,0) theory. We pay special attention to the N=2* theory on S4. We also explain how to construct maximal SYM on S5 x R, and clarify when SYM theories can be put on S^n x R.
