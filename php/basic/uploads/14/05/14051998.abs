Abstract: We perform the perturbative generation of the higher-derivative Chern-Simons contribution to the effective action in the three-dimensional QED at zero and finite temperature. In the latter case, we show that as the temperature goes to infinity this contribution vanishes. However, as expected, as the temperature goes to zero only the covariant part survives. The non-covariant part contributes only in intermediate temperatures where presents a maximum.
