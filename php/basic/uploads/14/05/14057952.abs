Title: Cosmological scenarios in modified gravity with non-dynamical fields
Authors: D. Bazeia and F. A. Brito and F. G. Costa
Abstract: In this paper we address the issue of exploring some cosmological scenarios in modified Einstein gravity through non-dynamical (auxiliary) fields. We found that all scenarios are controlled by a specific parameter associated with an auxiliary field. We explore the emergence of inflationary, radiation, matter and dark energy dominated regimes. Furthermore, an interesting possibility such as the emergence of a self-tuning mechanism to the cosmological constant problem in the radiation dominated era is also discussed.
