Title: A Discussion on Possible Effects of the Barbero-Immirzi Parameter at the  TeV-scale Particle Physics
Authors: Nelson Panza and Hilário Rodrigues and Denis Cocuroci and José Abdala Helayël-Neto
Abstract: In this paper, we analyse a curvature- and torsion-square quantum gravity action with an additional Holst term minimally coupled to a massive Dirac field in four dimensions. The main purpose here is to try to estimate and compare the value of the Barbero-Immirzi (BI) parameter with its currently known results. To do that, we work out the physical mass of the fermion as a function of this parameter in a perturbative one-loop calculation, assuming the scenario of a physics at the TeV-scale.
