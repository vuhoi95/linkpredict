Abstract: Double field theory (DFT) offers a manifest T-duality formulation for massless closed string field theory with both momentum and winding excitation. The gauge symmetry is defined by the generalized Lie derivative which is the extension of the Courant bracket. In this work, we solve and study the properties of FRW (Friedmann- Robertson-Walker) and doubled spherically symmetric metric of DFT.
