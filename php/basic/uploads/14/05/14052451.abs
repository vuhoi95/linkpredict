Title: Light-Front Holography in QCD and Hadronic Physics
Authors: Guy F. de Teramond and Stanley J. Brodsky and Hans Gunter Dosch
Abstract: We describe a procedure to extend the light-front holographic approach to hadronic physics to include light-quark masses. The proposed framework allows us to extend the formalism of de Alfaro, Fubini and Furlan to the frame-independent light-front Hamiltonian theory in the approximation where the dynamics in the invariant transverse variable is unchanged to first order in the quark masses. The confinement potential follows from an effective theory which encodes the fundamental conformality of the classical QCD Lagrangian and leads to a semiclassical relativistic light-front wave equation for arbitrary spin. In particular, the K meson spectrum is successfully described without modifying the emerging confinement scale. The Wilson loop criteria for confinement is maintained, since for light quark masses a harmonic potential and linear Regge trajectories in the light-front form of dynamics corresponds to a linear potential in the usual instant-form.
