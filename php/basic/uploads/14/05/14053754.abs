Title: The Higgs boson mass and SUSY spectra in 10D SYM theory with magnetized  extra dimensions
Authors: Hiroyuki Abe and Junichiro Kawamura and Keigo Sumita
Abstract: We study the Higgs boson mass and the spectrum of supersymmetric (SUSY) particles in the well-motivated particle physics model derived from a ten-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory compactified on three factorizable tori with magnetic fluxes. This model was proposed in a previous work, where the flavor structures of the standard model including the realistic Yukawa hierarchies are obtained from non-hierarchical input parameters on the magnetized background. Assuming moduli- and anomaly-mediated contributions dominate the soft SUSY breaking terms, we study the precise SUSY spectra and analyze the Higgs boson mass in this mode, which are compared with the latest experimental data.
