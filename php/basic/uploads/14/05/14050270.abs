Title: Chaotic Inflation in Supergravity after Planck and BICEP2
Authors: Renata Kallosh and Andrei Linde and Alexander Westphal
Abstract: We discuss the general structure and observational consequences of some of the simplest versions of chaotic inflation in supergravity in relation to the data by Planck 2013 and BICEP2. We show that minimal modifications to the simplest quadratic potential are sufficient to provide a controllable tensor mode signal and a suppression of CMB power at large angular scales.
