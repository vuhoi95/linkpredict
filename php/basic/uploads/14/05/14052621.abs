Title: A systematic study of finite BRST-BV transformations in field-antifield  formalism
Authors: Igor A. Batalin and Peter M. Lavrov and Igor V. Tyutin
Abstract: We study systematically finite BRST- BV transformations in the field-antifield formalism. We present explicitly their Jacobians and the form of a solution to the compensation equation determining the functional field dependence of finite Fermionic parameters, necessary to generate arbitrary finite change of gauge-fixing functions in the path integral.
