Title: Brane worlds in gravity with auxiliary fields
Authors: Bin Guo and Yu-Xiao Liu and Ke Yang
Abstract: Recently, Pani, Sotiriou, and Vernieri explored a new theory of gravity by adding nondynamical fields, i.e., gravity with auxiliary fields [Phys. Rev. D 88, 121502(R) (2013)]. In this gravity theory, higher-order derivatives of matter fields generically appear in the field equations. In this paper we extend this theory to any dimensions and discuss the thick braneworld model in five dimensions. Domain wall solutions are obtained numerically. The stability of the brane system under the tensor perturbation is analyzed. We find that the system is stable under the tensor perturbation and the gravity zero mode is localized on the brane. Therefore, the four-dimensional Newtonian potential can be realized on the brane.
