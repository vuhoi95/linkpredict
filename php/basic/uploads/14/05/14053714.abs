Title: Linear Resistivity from Non-Abelian Black Holes
Authors: Christopher P. Herzog and Kuo-Wei Huang and Ricardo Vaz
Abstract: Starting with the holographic p-wave superconductor, we show how to obtain a finite DC conductivity through a non-abelian gauge transformation. The translational symmetry is preserved. We obtain phenomenological similarities with high temperature cuprate superconductors. Our results suggest that a lattice or impurities are not essential to produce a finite DC resistivity with a linear temperature dependence. An analogous field theory calculation for free fermions, presented in the appendix, indicates our results may be a special feature of strong interactions.
