Title: Geometric quantum phases from Lorentz symmetry breaking effects in the  cosmic string spacetime
Authors: H. Belich and K. Bakke
Abstract: By starting from the modified Maxwell theory coupled to gravity, the arising of geometric quantum phases in the relativistic and nonrelativistic quantum dynamics of a Dirac neutral particle from the effects of the violation of the Lorentz symmetry in the cosmic string spacetime is investigated. It is shown that the Dirac equation can be written in terms of an effective metric and a relativistic geometric phase stems from the topology of the cosmic string spacetime and the Lorentz symmetry breaking effects. Further, the nonrelativistic limit of the Dirac equation is discussed and it is shown that both Lorentz symmetry breaking effects and the topology of the defect yields a phase shift in the wave function of the nonrelativistic spin-1/2 particle.
