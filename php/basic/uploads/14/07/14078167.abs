Title: Quantum cosmology from quantum gravity condensates: cosmological  variables and lattice-refined dynamics
Authors: Steffen Gielen and Daniele Oriti
Abstract: In the context of group field theory condensate cosmology, we clarify the extraction of cosmological variables from the microscopic quantum gravity degrees of freedom. We show that an important implication of the second quantized formalism is the dependence of cosmological variables and equations on the quantum gravitational atomic number N (number of spin network vertices/elementary simplices). We clarify the relation of the effective cosmological equations with loop quantum cosmology, understood as an effective (hydrodynamic-like) approximation of a more fundamental quantum gravity theory. By doing so, we provide a fundamental basis to the idea of lattice refinement, showing the dependence of the effective cosmological connection on N, and hence indirectly on the scale factor. Our results open a new arena for exploring effective cosmological dynamics, as this depends crucially on the new observable N, which is entirely of quantum gravitational origin.
