Title: Hurwitz numbers and BKP hierarchy
Authors: S. M. Natanzon and A. Yu. Orlov
Abstract: We consider special series in ratios of the Schur functions which are defined by integers $\textsc{f}\ge 0$ and $\textsc{e} \le 2$, and also by the set of $3k$ parameters $n_i,q_i,t_i,\,i=1,..., k$. These series may be presented in form of matrix integrals. In case $k=0$ these series generates Hurwitz numbers for the $d$-fold branched covering of connected surfaces with a given Euler characteristic $\textsc{e}$ and arbitrary profiles at $\textsc{f}$ ramification points. If $k>0$ they generate weighted sums of the Hurwitz numbers with additional ramification points which are distributed between color groups indexed by $i=1,...,k$, the weights being written in terms of parameters $n_i,q_i,t_i$. By specifying the parameters we get sums of all Hurwitz numbers with $\textsc{f}$ arbitrary fixed profiles and the additional profiles provided the following condition: both, the sum of profile lengths and the number of ramification points in each color group are given numbers. In case $\textsc{e}=\textsc{f}=1,2$ the series may be identified with BKP tau functions of Kac and van de Leur of a special type called hypergeometric tau functions. Sums of Hurwitz numbers for $d$-fold branched coverings of ${\mathbb{RP}}^2$ are related to the one-component BKP hierarchy. We also present links between sums of Hurwitz numbers and one-matrix model of the fat graphs.
