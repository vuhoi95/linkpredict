Title: Asymptotic symmetries and dynamics of three-dimensional flat  supergravity
Authors: Glenn Barnich and Laura Donnay and Javier Matulich and Ricardo Troncoso
Abstract: A consistent set of asymptotic conditions for the simplest supergravity theory without cosmological constant in three dimensions is proposed. The canonical generators associated to the asymptotic symmetries are shown to span a supersymmetric extension of the BMS$_3$ algebra with an appropriate central charge. The energy is manifestly bounded from below with the ground state given by the null orbifold or Minkowski spacetime for periodic, respectively antiperiodic boundary conditions on the gravitino. These results are related to the corresponding ones in AdS$_3$ supergravity by a suitable flat limit. The analysis is generalized to the case of minimal flat supergravity with additional parity odd terms for which the Poisson algebra of canonical generators form a representation of the super-BMS$_3$ algebra with an additional central charge.
