Title: The Renormalizable Three-Term Polynomial Inflation with Large  Tensor-to-Scalar Ratio
Authors: Tianjun Li and Zheng Sun and Chi Tian and Lina Wu
Abstract: We systematically study the renormalizable three-term polynomial inflation in the supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric models. The supersymmetric inflaton potentials can be realized in supergravity theory, and only have two independent parameters. We show that the general renormalizable supergravity model is equivalent to one kind of our supersymmetric models. We find that the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio can be consistent with the Planck and BICEP2 results, but the running of spectral index is always out of the $2\sigma$ range. If we do not consider the BICEP2 experiment, these inflationary models can be highly consistent with the Planck observations and saturate its upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r \le 0.11$). Thus, our models can be tested at the future Planck and QUBIC experiments.
