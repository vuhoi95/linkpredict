Title: Black hole solutions of gravity theories with nonminimal coupling  between matter and curvature
Authors: Orfeu Bertolami and Mariano Cadoni and Andrea Porru
Abstract: We study black hole solutions in an extension of General Relativity (GR) with an explicit non-minimal coupling between matter and curvature. General black hole solutions satisfying the known energy conditions are derived including the ones with anti-de Sitter background. These solutions differ from those of GR just by a coupling function dependent rescaling of the mass and charge of the black hole and by a "dressing" of the cosmological constant. The existence of black hole solutions of the nonminimally coupled theory as well as the conditions for a suitable weak field limit are considered as a constraint on the coupling function responsible for the nonminimal coupling between matter and curvature. The "dressing" of the cosmological constant is then used to address the cosmological constant problem.
