Title: The role of radiative corrections on an extradimensional SUSY model
Authors: J. D. García-Aguilar and A. Pérez-Lorenzana
Abstract: Theories with extra-dimensional coordinates provide interesting mechanisms to achieve the rupture of symmetries. Here we present a novel alternative to the usual geometric considerations to achieve supersymmetric breaking for an extra-dimensional Wess-Zumino model. A supersymmetric model is constructed where the superpotential contains an effective supersymmetric non renormalizable operator, which generates, after compactification, the explicitly rupture of supersymmetry for the excited Kaluza-Klein excitations. The supersymmetry breaking is, in turn, communicated, by the radiatives corrections, to the zero mode.
