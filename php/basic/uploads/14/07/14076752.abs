Title: Singular connections, WZNW action, and moduli of parabolic bundles on  the sphere
Authors: Claudio Meneses and Leon A. Takhtajan
Abstract: The moduli space of stable parabolic vector bundles of parabolic degree 0 over the Riemann sphere is considered. The vector bundle analog of the Klein's Hauptmodul is defined and the regular locus, a subset of bundles with minimal Birkhoff-Grothendieck decomposition and generic Bruhat type of the constant term at $\infty$, is introduced. For the restriction of the natural Kaehler metric to the regular locus a potential is constructed as the value of the regularized WZNW functional evaluated on singular Hermitian metrics in the corresponding vector bundles. It is shown that this potential is an antiderivative of a (1,0)-form on the regular locus, associated with a solution of the Riemann-Hilbert problem.
