Title: Topological mechanisms as classical spinor fields
Authors: Vincenzo Vitelli and Nitin Upadhyaya and Bryan Gin-ge Chen
Abstract: A mechanism is a zero-energy motion of a mechanical structure that does not stretch or compress any of its components. Here, we focus on a special class of mechanisms that we dub topological because they are insensitive to smooth changes in material parameters. Topological mechanisms do not arise from local under-coordination, but they can be localized to solitons in the underlying structure. In this letter, we exploit supersymmetry to develop a real-space formalism whereby a topological mechanism can be described as a classical spinor whose real components are the soliton-induced displacement and stress fields. Our analytical approach goes beyond topological band theory by addressing the non-linearity and inhomogeneity of the underlying structure key to the very definition of a mechanism. We apply this general method to an activated mechanism, inspired by the organic molecule polyacetylene, that can propagate down an assembly line without deploying the whole structure.
