Title: Isolated critical point from Lovelock gravity
Authors: Brian P. Dolan and Anna Kostouki and David Kubiznak and Robert B. Mann
Abstract: For any K(=2k+1)th-order Lovelock gravity with fine-tuned Lovelock couplings, we demonstrate the existence of a special isolated critical point characterized by non-standard critical exponents in the phase diagram of hyperbolic vacuum black holes. In the Gibbs free energy this corresponds to a place wherefrom two swallowtails emerge, giving rise to two first-order phase transitions between small and large black holes. We believe that this is a first example of a critical point with non-standard critical exponents obtained in a geometric theory of gravity.
