Title: Jet quenching from the lattice
Authors: Marco Panero and Kari Rummukainen and Andreas Sch√§fer
Abstract: We present a lattice study of the momentum broadening experienced by a hard parton in the quark-gluon plasma. In particular, the contributions to this real-time phenomenon from soft modes are extracted from a set of gauge-invariant operators in a dimensionally reduced effective theory (electrostatic QCD), which can be simulated on a Euclidean lattice. At the temperatures accessible to present experiments, the soft contributions to the jet quenching parameter are found to be quite large. We compare our results to phenomenological models and to holographic computations.
