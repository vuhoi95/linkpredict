Title: Quantized rotating Taub-bolt instantons
Authors: Gérard Clément and Dmitri Gal'tsov
Abstract: We argue that previously suggested metrics for rotating Taub-bolt instantons do not satisfy all the necessary regularity conditions, and we present a family of new regular rotating Taub-bolts labelled by an odd integer $k$. There are two types of rotating bolt solutions. The first infinite sequence starts with non-rotating Taub-NUT with positive mass $M_k=N$ for $a=0$ and goes to $(k-2)N$ for $|a|\to \infty$ (or $N$ for $k=1$), where $a$ is the rotation parameter. For the second sequence of rotating Page bolts, the masses $M_k$ go through the value $M_k=5N/4$ for $a=0$ and asymptote to $(k+2)N$ for $|a|\to \infty$.
