Title: Universality classes for models of inflation
Authors: P. Binetruy and E. Kiritsis and J. Mabillard and M. Pieroni and C. Rosset
Abstract: We show that the cosmological evolution of a scalar field in a potential can be obtained from a renormalisation group equation. The slow roll regime of inflation models is understood in this context as the slow evolution close to a fixed point, described by the methods of renormalisation group. This explains in part the universality observed in the predictions of a certain number of inflation models. We illustrate this behavior on a certain number of examples and discuss it in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence.
