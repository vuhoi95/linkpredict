Abstract: We provide an analytical derivation of the thermo-electric transport coefficients of the simplest momentum-dissipating model in gauge/gravity where the lack of momentum conservation is realized by means of explicit graviton mass in the bulk. We rely on the procedure recently described by Donos and Gauntlett in the context of Q-lattices and holographic models where momentum dissipation is realized through non-trivial scalars. The analytical approach confirms the results found previously by means of numerical computations.
