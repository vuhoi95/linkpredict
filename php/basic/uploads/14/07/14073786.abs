Title: Probing non-perturbative effects in M-theory
Authors: Yasuyuki Hatsuda and Kazumi Okuyama
Abstract: The AdS/CFT correspondence enables us to probe M-theory on various backgrounds from the corresponding dual gauge theories. Here we investigate in detail a three-dimensional U(N) N=4 super Yang-Mills theory coupled to one adjoint hypermultiplet and Nf fundamental hypermultiplets, which is large N dual to M-theory on AdS_4xS^7/Z_Nf. Using the localization and the Fermi-gas formulation, we explore non-perturbative corrections to the partition function. As in the ABJM theory, we find that there exists a non-trivial pole cancellation mechanism, which guarantees the theory to be well-defined, between worldsheet instantons and membrane instantons for all rational (in particular, physical or integral) values of Nf.
