Title: Twist operators in higher dimensions
Authors: Ling-Yan Hung and Robert C. Myers and Michael Smolkin
Abstract: We study twist operators in higher dimensional CFT's. In particular, we express their conformal dimension in terms of the energy density for the CFT in a particular thermal ensemble. We construct an expansion of the conformal dimension in power series around n=1, with n being replica parameter. We show that the coefficients in this expansion are determined by higher point correlations of the energy-momentum tensor. In particular, the first and second terms, i.e. the first and second derivatives of the scaling dimension, have a simple universal form. We test these results using holography and free field theory computations, finding agreement in both cases. We also consider the `operator product expansion' of spherical twist operators and finally, we examine the behaviour of correlators of twist operators with other operators in the limit n ->1.
