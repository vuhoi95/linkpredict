Title: A semi perturbative method for QED
Authors: Renata Jora and Joseph Schechter
Abstract: We compute the QED beta function using a new method of functional integration. It turns out that in this procedure the beta function contains only the first two orders coefficients and thus corresponds to a new renormalization scheme, long time supposed to exist.
