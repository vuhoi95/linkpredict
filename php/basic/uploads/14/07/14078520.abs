Title: Generalized Indices for $\mathcal{N}=1$ Theories in Four-Dimensions
Authors: Tatsuma Nishioka and Itamar Yaakov
Abstract: We use localization techniques to calculate the Euclidean partition functions for $\mathcal{N}=1$ theories on four-dimensional manifolds $M$ of the form $S^1 \times M_3$, where $M_3$ is a circle bundle over a Riemann surface. These are generalizations of the $\mathcal{N}=1$ indices in four-dimensions including the lens space index. We show that these generalized indices are holomorphic functions of the complex structure moduli on $M$. We exhibit the deformation by background flat connections.
