Title: Holographic Graphene in a Cavity
Authors: Nick Evans and Peter A. R. Jones
Abstract: The effective strength of EM interactions can be controlled by confining the fields to a cavity and these effects might be used to push graphene into a strongly coupled regime. We study the similar D3/probe D5 system on a compact space and discuss the gravity dual for a cavity between two mirrors. We show that the introduction of a conformal symmetry breaking length scale introduces a mass gap on a single D5 sheet. Bilayer configurations display exciton condensation between the sheets. There is a first order phase transition away from the exciton condensate if a strong enough magnetic field is applied. We finally map out the phase structure of these systems in a cavity with the presence of mirror reflections of the probes - a mass gap may form through exciton condensation with the mirror image.
