Abstract: We propose a simple method to prove non-smoothness of a black hole horizon. The existence of a $C^1$ extension across the horizon implies that there is no $C^{N + 2}$ extension across the horizon if some components of $N$-th covariant derivative of Riemann tensor diverge at the horizon in the coordinates of the $C^1$ extension. In particular, the divergence of a component of the Riemann tensor at the horizon directly indicates the presence of a curvature singularity. By using this method, we can confirm the existence of a curvature singularity for several cases where the scalar invariants constructed from the Riemann tensor, e.g., the Ricci scalar and the Kretschmann invariant, take finite values at the horizon. As a concrete example of the application, we show that the Kaluza-Klein black holes constructed by Myers have a curvature singularity at the horizon if the spacetime dimension is higher than five.
