Title: Spontaneous Breaking of the BRST Symmetry in the ABJM theory
Authors: Mir Faizal and Sudhaker Upadhyay
Abstract: In this paper, we will analyse the ghost condensation in the ABJM theory. We will perform our analysis in ${\cal N}=1$ superspace. We show that in the Delbourgo-Jarvis-Baulieu-Thierry-Mieg gauge the spontaneous breaking of BRST symmetry can occur in the ABJM theory. This spontaneous breaking of BRST symmetry is caused by ghost-anti-ghost condensation. We will also show that in the ABJM theory, the ghost-anti-ghost the condensates remains present in the modified abelian gauge. Thus, the spontaneous breaking of BRST symmetry in ABJM theory can even occur in the modified abelian gauge.
