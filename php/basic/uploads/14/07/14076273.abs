Title: Renormalization group, secular term resummation and AdS (in)stability
Authors: Ben Craps and Oleg Evnin and Joris Vanhoof
Abstract: We revisit the issues of non-linear AdS stability, its relation to growing (secular) terms in naive perturbation theory around the AdS background, and the need and possible strategies for resumming such terms. To this end, we review a powerful and elegant resummation method, which is mathematically identical to the standard renormalization group treatment of ultraviolet divergences in perturbative quantum field theory. We apply this method to non-linear gravitational perturbation theory in the AdS background at first non-trivial order and display the detailed structure of the emerging renormalization flow equations. We prove, in particular, that a majority of secular terms (and the corresponding terms in the renormalization flow equations) that could be present on general grounds given the spectrum of frequencies of linear AdS perturbations, do not in fact arise.
