Title: Effective constraint algebras with structure functions
Authors: Martin Bojowald and Suddhasattwa Brahma
Abstract: This article presents the result that fluctuations and higher moments of a state do not imply quantum corrections in structure functions of constrained systems. Consequences for canonical quantum gravity, whose structure functions encode space-time structure, are discussed. In particular, deformed algebras found in models of loop quantum gravity provide reliable information even in the Planck regime.
