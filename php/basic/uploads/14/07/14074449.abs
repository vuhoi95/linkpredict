Authors: Till Bargheer and Yu-tin Huang and Florian Loebbert and Masahito Yamazaki
Abstract: We study Yangian-invariant deformations of scattering amplitudes in 4d N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and 3d N=6 Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena (ABJM) theory. In particular, we obtain the deformed Grassmannian integral for 4d N=4 super Yang-Mills theory, both in momentum and momentum-twistor space. For 3d ABJM theory, we initiate the study of deformed scattering amplitudes. We investigate general deformations of on-shell diagrams, and find the deformed Grassmannian integral for this theory. We furthermore introduce the algebraic R-matrix construction of deformed Yangian invariants for ABJM theory.
