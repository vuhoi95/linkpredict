Title: Localisation of the Galilean symmetry and dynamical realisation of  Newton-Cartan geometry
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Arpita Mitra and Pradip Mukherjee
Abstract: Newtonian gravity was formulated as a geometrodynamic theory as far back in 1930s by Elie Cartan in what is named aptly as Newton Cartan space time. Though there are several approaches of realizing the algebraic structure of the Newton Cartan geometry from a contraction of the relativistic results, a dynamical (field theoretic) realization of it is lacking. In this paper we present such a realization from the localisation of the Galilean Symmetry of nonrelativistic matter field theories.
