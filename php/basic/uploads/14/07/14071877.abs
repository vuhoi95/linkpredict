Title: Bulk angular momentum and Hall viscosity in chiral superconductors
Authors: Atsuo Shitade and Taro Kimura
Abstract: We establish the Berry-phase formulas for the angular momentum (AM) and the Hall viscosity (HV) to investigate chiral superconductors (SCs) in two and three dimensions. The AM is defined by the temporal integral of the anti-symmetric momentum current induced by an adiabatic deformation, while the HV is defined by the symmetric momentum current induced by the symmetric torsional electric field. Without suffering from the system size or geometry, we obtain the macroscopic AM $L_z = \hbar m N_0/2$ at zero temperature in full-gap chiral SCs, where $m$ is the magnetic quantum number and $N_0$ is the total number of electrons. We also find that the HV is equal to half the AM at zero temperature not only in full-gap chiral SCs as is well-known but also in nodal ones, but its behavior at finite temperature is different in the two cases.
