Title: Holographic thermalization in noncommutative geometry
Authors: Xiao-Xiong Zeng and Xian-Ming Liu and Wen-Biao Liu
Abstract: Gravitational collapse of a shell of dust in noncommutative geometry is probed by the renormalized geodesic length, which is dual to probe the thermalization by the two-point correlation function in the dual conformal field theory. We find that larger the noncommutative parameter is, longer the thermalization time is, which implies that the large noncommutative parameter delays the thermalization process. We also investigate how the noncommutative parameter affects the thermalization velocity and thermalization acceleration.
