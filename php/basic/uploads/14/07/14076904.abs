Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a CPT-even model with a Lorentz-violating mass term. Such kind of models may present very interesting features like superluminal modes of propagation or even instantaneous long-range interactions. The mass term we investigate can be induced at classical or quantum level in a scenario with spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking in a gauge-Higgs model without Lorentz symmetry. We analyze the physical consistency of the model by studying the poles of the propagator. By using the Noether Dualization Method (NDM), we obtain a gauge invariant dual theory for this model. The physical equivalence between the two models is investigated and a general relation between the two propagators is obtained.
