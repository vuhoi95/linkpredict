Title: Is String Interaction the Origin of Quantum Mechanics?
Authors: Itzhak Bars and Dmitry Rychkov
Abstract: String theory developed by demanding consistency with quantum mechanics. In this paper we wish to reverse the reasoning. We pretend open string field theory is a fully consistent definition of the theory - it is at least a self consistent sector. Then we find in its structure that the rules of quantum mechanics emerge from the non-commutative nature of the basic string joining/splitting interactions, thus deriving rather than assuming the quantum commutation rules among the usual canonical quantum variables for all physical systems derivable from open string field theory. Morally we would apply such an argument to M-theory to cover all physics. If string or M-theory really underlies all physics, it seems that the door has been opened to an understanding of the origins of quantum mechanics.
