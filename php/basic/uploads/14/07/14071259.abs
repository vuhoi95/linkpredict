Title: More on "Little Lambda" in Ho≈ôava-Lifshitz Gravity
Authors: R. Loll and L. Pires
Abstract: We analyze different claims on the role of the coupling constant lambda in so-called lambda-R models, a minimal generalization of general relativity inspired by Horava-Lifshitz gravity. The dimensionless parameter lambda appears in the kinetic term of the Einstein-Hilbert action, leading to a one-parameter family of classical theories. Performing a canonical constraint analysis for closed spatial hypersurfaces, we obtain a result analogous to that of Bellorin and Restuccia, who showed that all non-projectable lambda-R models are equivalent to general relativity in the asymptotically flat case. However, the tertiary constraint present for closed boundary conditions assumes a more general form. We juxtapose this with an earlier finding by Giulini and Kiefer, who ruled out a range of lambda-R models by a physical, cosmological argument. We show that their analysis can be interpreted consistently within the projectable sector of Horava-Lifshitz gravity, thus resolving the apparent contradiction.
