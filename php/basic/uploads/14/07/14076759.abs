Title: General Yang-Mills type gauge theories for p-form gauge fields: From  physics-based ideas to a mathematical framework OR From Bianchi identities to  twisted Courant algebroids
Authors: Melchior Grutzmann and Thomas Strobl
Abstract: Starting with minimal requirements from the physical experience with higher gauge theories, i.e. gauge theories for a tower of differential forms of different form degrees, we discover that all the structural identities governing such theories can be concisely recombined into a so-called Q-structure or, equivalently, a Lie infinity algebroid. This has many technical and conceptual advantages: Complicated higher bundles become just bundles in the category of Q-manifolds in this approach (the many structural identities being encoded in the one operator Q squaring to zero), gauge transformations are generated by internal vertical automorphisms in these bundles and even for a relatively intricate field content the gauge algebra can be determined in some lines only and is given by the so-called derived bracket construction. This article aims equally at mathematicians and theoretical physicists; each more physical section is followed by a purely mathematical one. While the considerations are valid for arbitrary highest form-degree p, we pay particular attention to p=2, i.e. 1- and 2-form gauge fields coupled non-linearly to scalar fields (0-form fields). The structural identities of the coupled system correspond to a Lie 2-algebroid in this case and we provide different axiomatic descriptions of those, inspired by the application, including e.g. one as a particular kind of a vector-bundle twisted Courant algebroid.
