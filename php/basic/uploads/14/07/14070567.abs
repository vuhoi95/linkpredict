Title: Causal Structure and Birefringence in Nonlinear Electrodynamics
Authors: C. A. M. de Melo and L. G. Medeiros and P. J. Pompeia
Abstract: We investigate the causal structure of general nonlinear electrodynamics and determine which Lagrangians generate an effective metric conformal to Minkowski. We also proof that there is only one analytic nonlinear electrodynamics presenting no birefringence.
