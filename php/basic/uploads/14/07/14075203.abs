Abstract: We present a class of 3D Black Holes based on flat connections which are polynomials in the BTZ $hs(\lambda) \times hs(\lambda)$-valued connection. We solve analytically the fluctuation equations of matter in their background and find the spectrum of their Quasi Normal Modes. We analyze the bulk to boundary two-point functions. We also relate our results and those arising in other backgrounds discussed recently in the literature on the subject.
