Title: Charged Renyi entropies and holographic superconductors
Authors: Alexandre Belin and Ling-Yan Hung and Alexander Maloney and Shunji Matsuura
Abstract: Charged Renyi entropies were recently introduced as a measure of entanglement between different charge sectors of a theory. We investigate the phase structure of charged Renyi entropies for CFTs with a light, charged scalar operator. The charged Renyi entropies are calculated holographically via areas of charged hyperbolic black holes. These black holes can become unstable to the formation of scalar hair at sufficiently low temperature; this is the holographic superconducting instability in hyperbolic space. This implies that the Renyi entropies can be non-analytic in the Renyi parameter n. We find the onset of this instability as a function of the charge and dimension of the scalar operator. We also comment on the relation between the phase structure of these entropies and the phase structure of a holographic superconductor in flat space.
