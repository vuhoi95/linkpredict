Title: Constraining Monopoles by Topology: an Autonomous System
Authors: Fabrizio Canfora and Gianni Tallarita
Abstract: We find both analytical and numerical solutions of SU(2) Yang-Mills with an adjoint Higgs field within both closed and open tubes whose sections are spherical caps. This geometry admits a smooth limit in which the space-like metric is flat and, moreover, allows one to use analytical tools which in the flat case are not available. Some of the analytic configurations, in the limit of vanishing Higgs coupling, correspond to magnetic monopoles and dyons living within this tube-shaped domain. However, unlike what happens in the standard case, analytical solutions can also be found in the case in which the Higgs coupling is non-vanishing. We further show that the system admits long-lived breathers.
