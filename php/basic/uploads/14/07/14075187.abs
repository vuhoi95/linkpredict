Title: Higher Curvature Supergravity, Supersymmetry Breaking and Inflation
Authors: Sergio Ferrara and Alex Kehagias
Abstract: In these lectures, after a short introduction to cosmology, we discuss the supergravity embedding of higher curvature models of inflation. The supergravity description of such models is presented for the two different formulations of minimal supergravity.
