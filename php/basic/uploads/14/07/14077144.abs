Title: Non-Abelian Moduli on Domain Walls
Authors: Evgeniy Kurianovych and Mikhail Shifman
Abstract: We study a simple model supporting domain walls which possess two orientational moduli in addition to the conventional translational modulus. This model is conceptually close to Witten's cosmic strings. We observe an $O(3)$ sigma model on the wall world volume in the low-energy limit. We solve (numerically) classical static equations of motion and find the wall profile functions and the value of the coupling of the $O(3)$ model in terms of the bulk parameters. In the second part a term describing a spin-orbit interaction in the bulk is added, which gives rise to an entanglement between rotational and translational moduli. The corresponding extra term in the low-energy Lagrangian is calculated.
