Title: Aligned Natural Inflation and Moduli Stabilization from Anomalous $U(1)$  Gauge Symmetries

Abstract: To obtain natural inflation with large tensor-to-scalar ratio in string framework, we need a special moduli stabilization mechanism which can separate the masses of real and imaginary components of K\"ahler moduli at different scales, and achieve a trans-Planckian axion decay constant from sub-Planckian axion decay constants. In this work, we stabilize the matter fields by F-terms and the real components of K\"ahler moduli by D-terms of two anomalous $U(1)_X\times U(1)_A$ symmetries strongly at high scales, while the corresponding axions remain light due to their independence on the Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) term in moduli stabilization. The racetrack-type axion superpotential is obtained from gaugino condensations of the hidden gauge symmetries $SU(n)\times SU(m)$ with massive matter fields in the bi-fundamental respresentations. The axion alignment via Kim-Nilles-Pelroso (KNP) mechanism corresponds to an approximate $S_2$ exchange symmetry of two K\"ahler moduli in our model, and a slightly $S_2$ symmetry breaking leads to the natural inflation with super-Planckian decay constant.
