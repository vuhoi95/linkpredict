Title: Heavy Tails in Calabi-Yau Moduli Spaces
Authors: Cody Long and Liam McAllister and Paul McGuirk
Abstract: We study the statistics of the metric on K\"ahler moduli space in compactifications of string theory on Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties. We find striking hierarchies in the eigenvalues of the metric and of the Riemann curvature contribution to the Hessian matrix: both spectra display heavy tails. The curvature contribution to the Hessian is non-positive, suggesting a reduced probability of metastability compared to cases in which the derivatives of the K\"ahler potential are uncorrelated. To facilitate our analysis, we have developed a novel triangulation algorithm that allows efficient study of hypersurfaces with $h^{1,1}$ as large as 25, which is difficult using algorithms internal to packages such as Sage. Our results serve as input for statistical studies of the vacuum structure in flux compactifications, and of the distribution of axion decay constants in string theory.
