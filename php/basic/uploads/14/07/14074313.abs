Abstract: Symmetries play a crucial role in physics and, in particular, the Noether symmetries are a useful tool both to select models motivated at a fundamental level, and to find exact solutions for specific Lagrangians. In this work, we consider the application of point symmetries in the recently proposed metric-Palatini Hybrid Gravity in order to select the $f({\cal R})$ functional form and to find analytical solutions for the field equations and for the related Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation. We show that, in order to find out integrable $f({\cal R})$ models, conformal transformations in the Lagrangians are extremely useful. In this context, we explore two conformal transformations of the forms $d\tau=N(a) dt$ and $d\tau=N(\phi) dt$. For the former conformal transformation, we found two cases of $f({\cal R})$ functions where the field equations admit Noether symmetries. In the second case, the Lagrangian reduces to a Brans-Dicke-like theory with a general coupling function. For each case, it is possible to transform the field equations by using normal coordinates to simplify the dynamical system and to obtain exact solutions. Furthermore, we perform quantization and derive the WDW equation for the minisuperspace model. The Lie point symmetries for the WDW equation are determined and used to find invariant solutions.
