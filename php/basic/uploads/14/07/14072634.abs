Title: Vortex solutions of an Abelian Higgs model with visible and hidden  sectors
Authors: Paola Arias and Fidel A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We study vortex solutions in a theory with dynamics governed by two weakly coupled Abelian Higgs models, describing a hidden sector and a visible sector. We analyze the radial dependence of the axially symmetric solutions constructed numerically and discuss the stability of vortex configurations for different values of the model parameters, studying in detail vortex decay into lower energy configurations. We find that even in a weak coupling regime vortex solutions strongly depend on the parameters of both the visible and hidden sectors. We also discuss on qualitative grounds possible implications of the existence of a hidden sector in connection with superconductivity.
