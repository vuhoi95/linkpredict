Title: Near Horizon Extremal Geometry Perturbations: Dynamical Field  Perturbations vs. Parametric Variations
Authors: K. Hajian and A. Seraj and M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari
Abstract: In arXiv:1310.3727 we formulated and derived the three universal laws governing Near Horizon Extremal Geometries (NHEG). In this work we focus on the Entropy Perturbation Law (EPL) which, similarly to the first law of black hole thermodynamics, relates perturbations of the charges labeling perturbations around a given NHEG to the corresponding entropy perturbation. We show that field perturbations governed by the linearized equations of motion and symmetry conditions which we carefully specify, satisfy the EPL. We also show that these perturbations are limited to those coming from difference of two NHEG solutions (i.e. variations on the NHEG solution parameter space). Our analysis and discussions shed light on the "no-dynamics" statements of arXiv:0906.2380 and arXiv:0906.2376.
