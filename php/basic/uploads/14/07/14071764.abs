Title: Open strings on D-branes from ABJM
Authors: Carlos Cardona and Horatiu Nastase
Abstract: We study open strings on giant gravitons (D-branes on cycles) in the ABJM/$AdS_4\times \mathbb{CP}^3$ correspondence. We find that their energy spectrum has the same form as the one for closed strings, with a nontrivial function of the coupling, avoiding BMN scaling. A similar, Cuntz oscillator, Hamiltonian description for the string (operators at strong coupling) to the $AdS_5$ case is valid also in this case.
