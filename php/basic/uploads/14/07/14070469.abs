Abstract: Using the attractor mechanism for extremal solutions in ${\cal N}=2$ gauged supergravity, we construct a $c$-function that interpolates between the central charges of theories at ultraviolet and infrared conformal fixed points corresponding to anti-de Sitter geometries. The $c$-function we obtain is couched purely in terms of bulk quantities and connects two different dimensional CFTs at the stable conformal fixed points under the RG flow.
