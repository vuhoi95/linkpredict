Title: Phase Locked Inflation -- Effectively Trans-Planckian Natural Inflation
Authors: Keisuke Harigaya and Masahiro Ibe
Abstract: A model of natural inflation with an effectively trans-Planckian decay constant can be easily achieved by the "phase locking" mechanism while keeping field values in the effective field theory within the Planck scale. We give detailed description of "phase locked" inflation based on this mechanism. We also construct supersymmetric natural inflation based on this mechanism and show that the model is consistent with low scale supersymmetry. We also investigate couplings of the inflaton with the minimal supersymmetric standard model to achieve an appropriate reheating process. Interestingly, in a certain class of models, we find that the inflation scale is related to the mass of the right-handed neutrino in a consistent way with the seesaw mechanism.
