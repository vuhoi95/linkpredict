Title: A Rich Tapestry: Supersymmetric Axions, Dark Radiation, and Inflationary  Reheating
Authors: Farinaldo S. Queiroz and Kuver Sinha and William Wester
Abstract: We exploit the complementarity among supersymmetry, inflation, axions, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB) to constrain supersymmetric axion models in the light of the recent Planck and BICEP results. In particular, we derive BBN bounds coming from altering the light element abundances by taking into account hadronic and electromagnetic energy injection, and CMB constraints from black-body spectrum distortion. Lastly, we outline the viable versus excluded region of these supersymetric models that might account for the mild dark radiation observed.
