Title: Propagating gravitons vs. dark matter in asymptotically safe quantum  gravity
Authors: Daniel Becker and Martin Reuter
Abstract: Within the Asymptotic Safety scenario, we discuss whether Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) can give rise to a semi-classical regime of propagating physical gravitons (gravitational waves) governed by an effective theory which complies with the standard rules of local quantum field theory. According to earlier investigations based on single-metric truncations there is a tension between this requirement and the condition of Asymptotic Safety since the former (latter) requires a positive (negative) anomalous dimension of Newton's constant. We show that the problem disappears using the bi-metric renormalization group flows that became available recently: They admit an asymptotically safe UV limit and, at the same time, a genuine semi-classical regime with a positive anomalous dimension. This brings the gravitons of QEG on a par with arbitrary (standard model, etc.) particles which exist as asymptotic states. We also argue that metric perturbations on almost Planckian scales might not be propagating, and we propose an interpretation as a form of `dark matter'.
