Title: Entanglement entropy of Wilson loops: Holography and matrix models
Authors: Simon A. Gentle and Michael Gutperle
Abstract: A half-BPS circular Wilson loop in $\mathcal{N}=4$ $SU(N)$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in an arbitrary representation is described by a Gaussian matrix model with a particular insertion. The additional entanglement entropy of a spherical region in the presence of such a loop was recently computed by Lewkowycz and Maldacena using exact matrix model results. In this note we utilize the supergravity solutions that are dual to such Wilson loops in a representation with order $N^2$ boxes to calculate this entropy holographically. Employing the matrix model results of Gomis, Matsuura, Okuda and Trancanelli we express this holographic entanglement entropy in a form that can be compared with the calculation of Lewkowycz and Maldacena. We find complete agreement between the matrix model and holographic calculations.
