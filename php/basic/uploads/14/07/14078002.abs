Title: Black hole non-uniqueness via spacetime topology in five dimensions
Authors: Hari K. Kunduri and James Lucietti
Abstract: The domain of outer communication of five-dimensional asymptotically flat stationary spacetimes may possess non-trivial 2-cycles. We discuss how this may lead to a gross violation of black hole uniqueness, beyond the existence of black rings, even for solutions with two commuting rotational symmetries. We illustrate this with a simple example in minimal supergravity; a four parameter family of supersymmetric black hole solutions, with spherical horizon topology and a 2-cycle in the exterior. We show there are black holes in this family with identical conserved changes to the BMPV black hole, thereby demonstrating black hole non-uniqueness in this context. We find a decoupling limit of this family of black holes that yields spacetimes asymptotic to the near-horizon geometry of a BMPV black hole which contain a black hole and an exterior 2-cycle.
