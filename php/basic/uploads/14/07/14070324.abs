Title: Conformal Blocks and Negativity at Large Central Charge
Authors: Manuela Kulaxizi and Andrei Parnachev and Giuseppe Policastro
Abstract: We consider entanglement negativity for two disjoint intervals in 1+1 dimensional CFT in the limit of large central charge. As the two intervals get close, the leading behavior of negativity is given by the logarithm of the conformal block where a set of approximately null descendants appears in the intermediate channel. We compute this quantity numerically and compare with existing analytic methods which provide perturbative expansion in powers of the cross-ratio.
