Title: Non-Gaussian inflationary shapes in $G^3$ theories beyond Horndeski
Authors: Matteo Fasiello and SÃ©bastien Renaux-Petel
Abstract: We consider the possible signatures of a recently introduced class of healthy theories beyond Horndeski models on higher-order correlators of the inflationary curvature fluctuation. Despite the apparent large number and complexity of the cubic interactions, we show that the leading-order bispectrum generated by the Generalized Horndeski (also called $G^3$) interactions can be reduced to a linear combination of two well known $k$-inflationary shapes. We conjecture that said behavior is not an accident of the cubic order but a consequence dictated by the requirements on the absence of Ostrogradski instability, the general covariance and the linear dispersion relation in these theories.
