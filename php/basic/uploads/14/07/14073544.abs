Title: Simple brane-world inflationary models in light of BICEP2
Authors: Nobuchika Okada and Satomi Okada
Abstract: Motivated by the recent CMB $B$-mode observation announced by the BICEP2 collaboration, we study simple inflationary models in the Randall-Sundrum brane-world cosmology. Brane-world cosmological effects alter the inflationary predictions of the spectral index ($n_s$) and the tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) from those obtained in the standard cosmology. In particular, the tensor-to-scalar ratio is enhanced in the presence of the 5th dimension, and simple inflationary models which predict small $r$ values in the standard cosmology can yield $r$ values being compatible with the BICEP2 result, $r=0.2^{+0.07}_{-0.05}$. Confirmation of the BICEP2 result and more precise measurements of $n_s$ and $r$ in the near future allow us to constrain the 5-dimensional Planck mass ($M_5$) of the brane-world scenario. We also discuss the post inflationary scenario, namely, reheating of the universe through inflaton decay to the Standard Model particles. When we require the renormalizability of the inflationary models, the inflaton only couples with the Higgs doublet among the Standard Model fields, through which reheating process occurs. If $M_5$ is as low as $10^6$ GeV, the mass of inflaton becomes of ${\cal O}$(100 GeV), providing the inflationary predictions being consistent with the BICEP2 and Planck results. Such a light inflaton has some impacts on phenomenology at the electroweak scale through the coupling with the Higgs doublet.
