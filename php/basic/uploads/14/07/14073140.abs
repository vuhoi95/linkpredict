Title: Baby Skyrme Model, Near-BPS Approximations and Supersymmetric Extensions
Authors: S. Bolognesi and W. Zakrzewski
Abstract: We study the baby Skyrme model as a theory that interpolates between two distinct BPS systems. For this a near-BPS approximation can be used which, however, involves a small deviation from each of the two BPS limits. We provide analytical explanation and numerical support for the validity of this approximation. We then study the set of all possible supersymmetric extensions of the baby Skyrme model with ${\cal N}=1$ and the particular ones with extended ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetries and relate this to the above mentioned almost-BPS approximation.
