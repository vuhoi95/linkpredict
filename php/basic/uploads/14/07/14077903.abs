Title: Poisson structure and stability analysis of a coupled system arising  from the supersymmetric breaking of Super KdV
Authors: A. Restuccia and A. Sotomayor
Abstract: The Poisson structure of a coupled system arising from a supersymmetric breaking of N=1 Super KdV equations is obtained. The supersymmetric breaking is implemented by introducing a Clifford algebra instead of a Grassmann algebra. The Poisson structure follows from the Dirac brackets obtained by the constraint analysis of the hamiltonian of the system. The coupled system has multisolitonic solutions. We show that the one soliton solutions are Liapunov stable.
