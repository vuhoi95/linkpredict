Title: 6d Conformal Matter

Abstract: A single M5-brane probing G, an ADE-type singularity, leads to a system which has G x G global symmetry and can be viewed as "bifundamental" (G,G) matter. For the A_N series, this leads to the usual notion of bifundamental matter. For the other cases it corresponds to a strongly interacting (1,0) superconformal system in six dimensions. Similarly, an ADE singularity intersecting the Horava-Witten wall leads to a superconformal matter system with E_8 x G global symmetry. Using the F-theory realization of these theories, we elucidate the Coulomb/tensor branch of (G,G') conformal matter. This leads to the notion of fractionalization of an M5-brane on an ADE singularity as well as fractionalization of the intersection point of the ADE singularity with the Horava-Witten wall. Partial Higgsing of these theories leads to new 6d SCFTs in the infrared, which we also characterize. This generalizes the class of (1,0) theories which can be perturbatively realized by suspended branes in IIA string theory. By reducing on a circle, we arrive at novel duals for 5d affine quiver theories. Introducing many M5-branes leads to large N gravity duals.
