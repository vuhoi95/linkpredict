Title: Finite-temperature three-point function in 2D CFT
Authors: Melanie Becker and Yaniel Cabrera and Ning Su
Abstract: We calculate the finite temperature three-point correlation function for primary fields in a 2D conformal field theory in momentum space. This result has applications to any strongly coupled field theory with a 2D CFT dual, as well as to Kerr/CFT.
