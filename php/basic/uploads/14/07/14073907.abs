Title: Noise kernels of stochastic gravity in conformally-flat spacetimes
Authors: H. T. Cho and B. L. Hu
Abstract: The central object in the theory of semiclassical stochastic gravity is the noise kernel which is the symmetric two point correlation function of the stress-energy tensor. Using the corresponding Wightman functions in Minkowski, Einstein and open Einstein spaces, we construct the noise kernels of a conformally coupled scalar field in these spacetimes. From them we show that the noise kernels in conformally-flat spacetimes, including the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universes, can be obtained in closed analytic forms by using a combination of conformal and coordindate transformations.
