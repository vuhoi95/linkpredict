Title: Small deformations of extreme five dimensional Myers-Perry black hole  initial data
Authors: Aghil Alaee and Hari K Kunduri
Abstract: In this note we demonstrate the existence of a one-parameter family of initial data for the vacuum Einstein equations in five dimensions representing small deformations of the extreme Myers-Perry black hole. This initial data set has `$t-\phi^i$' symmetry and preserves the angular momenta and horizon geometry of the extreme solution. Our proof is based upon an earlier result of Dain and Gabach-Clement concerning the existence of $U(1)$-invariant initial data sets which preserve the geometry of extreme Kerr (at least for short times)
