Title: Next to subleading soft-graviton theorem in arbitrary dimensions
Authors: Chrysostomos Kalousios and Francisco Rojas
Abstract: We study the soft graviton theorem recently proposed by Cachazo and Strominger. We employ the Cachazo, He and Yuan formalism to show that the next to subleading order soft factor for gravity is universal at tree level in arbitrary dimensions.
