Title: GÃ¶del solution in the bumblebee gravity
Authors: J. R. Nascimento and A. Yu. Petrov and A. F. Santos and W. D. R. Jesus
Abstract: Here, we consider a gravity theory involving a spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking called the bumblebee model. We show that, at certain values of the bumblebee field, the G\"odel metric is consistent within this theory.
