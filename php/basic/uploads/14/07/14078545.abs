Title: Fake Conformal Symmetry in Conformal Cosmological Models
Authors: R. Jackiw and So-Young Pi
Abstract: We examine the local conformal invariance (Weyl invariance) in tensor-scalar theories used in recently proposed conformal cosmological models. We show that the Noether currents associated with Weyl invariance in these theories vanish. We assert that the corresponding Weyl symmetry does not have any dynamical role.
