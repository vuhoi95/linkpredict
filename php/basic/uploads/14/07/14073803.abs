Title: Double Field Theory at Order $Î±'$
Authors: Olaf Hohm and Barton Zwiebach
Abstract: We investigate $\alpha'$ corrections of bosonic strings in the framework of double field theory. The previously introduced "doubled $\alpha'$-geometry" gives $\alpha'$-deformed gauge transformations arising in the Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism but does not apply to bosonic strings. These require a different deformation of the duality-covariantized Courant bracket which governs the gauge structure. This is revealed by examining the $\alpha'$ corrections in the gauge algebra of closed string field theory. We construct a four-derivative cubic double field theory action invariant under the deformed gauge transformations, giving a first glimpse of the gauge principle underlying bosonic string $\alpha'$ corrections. The usual metric and $b$-field are related to the duality covariant fields by non-covariant field redefinitions.
