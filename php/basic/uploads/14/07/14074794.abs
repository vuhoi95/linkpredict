Title: Supersymmetric $U(N)$ Chern-Simons-matter theory and phase transitions
Authors: Jorge G. Russo and Guillermo A. Silva and Miguel Tierz
Abstract: We study ${\mathcal{N}}=2$ supersymmetric $U(N)$ Chern-Simons with $N_{f}$ fundamental and $N_{f}$ antifundamental chiral multiplets of mass $m$ in the complete parameter space spanned by $(g,\,m,\,N,\,N_{f})$, where $g$ denotes the coupling constant. In particular, we analyze the matrix model description of its partition function, both at finite $N$ using the method of orthogonal polynomials together with Mordell integrals and, at large $N$ with fixed $g$, using the theory of Toeplitz determinants. We show for the massless case that there is an explicit realization of the Giveon-Kutasov duality. For finite $N$, with $N>N_{f}$, three regimes that exactly correspond to the known three large $N$ phases of theory are identified and characterized.
