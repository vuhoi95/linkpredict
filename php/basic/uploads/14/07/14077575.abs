Title: Conformal Higgs Inflation
Authors: Ichiro Oda and Takahiko Tomoyose
Abstract: We investigate a locally scale-invariant (that is, Weyl-invariant) theory which describes the coupling of gravity and the standard model from the viewpont of the Higgs mechanism and inflation. It is shown that this theory exhibits a peculiar feature of a coupling between the gauge field and the inflaton in a large field limit whereas it nicely describes the standard model coupled to general relativity in a small field limit. Moreover, we discuss a possibility that this Weyl invariant theory could explain the recent BICEP2 measurement by deforming the potential term in an appropriate way, and find it to be difficult to do that even if we introduce a non-analytical type of the potential.
