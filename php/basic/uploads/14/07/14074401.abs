Title: Corroborating the equivalence between the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau and the  Klein-Gordon and Proca equations
Authors: L. B. Castro and A. S. de Castro
Abstract: It is shown that the Hamiltonian version of the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau theory with electromagnetic coupling brings about a source term at the current. It is also shown that such a source term disappears from the scenario if one uses the correct physical form for the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau field, regardless the choice for representing the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau matrices. This result is used to fix the ambiguity in the electromagnetic coupling in the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau theory. Moreover, some widespread misconceptions about the Hermiticity in the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau theory are discussed.
