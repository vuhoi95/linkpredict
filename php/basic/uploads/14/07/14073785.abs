Title: Supersymmetry from Typicality
Authors: Yasunori Nomura and Satoshi Shirai
Abstract: We argue that under a set of simple assumptions the multiverse leads to low energy supersymmetry with the spectrum often called spread or mini-split supersymmetry: the gauginos are in the TeV region with the other superpartners two or three orders of magnitude heavier. We present a particularly simple realization of supersymmetric grand unified theory using this idea.
