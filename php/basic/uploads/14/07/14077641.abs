Title: Invariant Solutions to the Strominger System on Complex Lie Groups and  Their Quotients
Authors: Teng Fei and Shing-Tung Yau
Abstract: Using canonical 1-parameter family of Hermitian connections on the tangent bundle, we provide invariant solutions to the Strominger system on complex Lie groups. Both flat and non-flat cases are discussed in detail.
