Title: Matter coupling in 3D "Minimal Massive Gravity"
Authors: Alex S. Arvanitakis and Alasdair J. Routh and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: The "Minimal Massive Gravity" (MMG) model of massive gravity in three spacetime dimensions (which has the same anti-de Sitter (AdS) bulk properties as "Topologically Massive Gravity" but improved boundary properties) is coupled to matter. Consistency requires a particular matter source tensor, which is quadratic in the stress tensor. The consequences are explored for an ideal fluid in the context of asymptotically de-Sitter (dS) cosmological solutions, which bounce smoothly from contraction to expansion. Various vacuum solutions are also found, including warped-(A)dS, and (for special values of parameters) static black holes and an (A)dS2 x S1 vacuum.
