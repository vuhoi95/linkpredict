Title: Covariant Noether Charge for Higher Dimensional Chern-Simons Terms
Authors: Tatsuo Azeyanagi and R. Loganayagam and Gim Seng Ng and Maria J. Rodriguez
Abstract: We construct a manifestly covariant differential Noether charge for theories with Chern-Simons terms in higher dimensional spacetimes. This is in contrast to Tachikawa's extension of the standard Lee-Iyer-Wald formalism which results in a non-covariant differential Noether charge for Chern-Simons terms. On a bifurcation surface, our differential Noether charge integrates to the Wald-like entropy formula proposed by Tachikawa in arXiv:hep-th/0611141.
