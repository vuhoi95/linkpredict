Title: $δ-δ^\prime$ generalized Robin boundary conditions and quantum  vacuum fluctuations
Authors: J. M. Munoz-Castaneda and J. Mateos Guilarte
Abstract: The effects induced by the quantum vacuum fluctuations of one massless real scalar field on a configuration of two partially transparent plates are investigated. The physical properties of the infinitely thin plates are simulated by means of Dirac-$\delta-\delta^\prime$ point interactions. It is shown that the distortion caused on the fluctuations by this external background gives rise to a generalization of Robin boundary conditions. The $T$-operator for potentials concentrated on points with non defined parity is computed with total generality. The quantum vacuum interaction energy between the two plates is computed using the $TGTG$ formula to find positive, negative, and zero Casimir energies. The parity properties of the $\delta-\delta^\prime$ potential allow repulsive quantum vacuum force between identical plates.
