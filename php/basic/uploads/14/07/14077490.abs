Title: Casimir Interactions between Magnetic Flux Tubes in a Dense Lattice
Authors: Dan Mazur and Jeremy S. Heyl
Abstract: We use the worldline numerics technique to study a cylindrically symmetric model of magnetic flux tubes in a dense lattice and the non-local Casimir forces acting between regions of magnetic flux. Within a superconductor the magnetic field is constrained within magnetic flux tubes and if the background magnetic field is on the order the quantum critical field strength, $B_k = \frac{m^2}{e} = 4.4 \times 10^{13}$ Gauss, the magnetic field is likely to vary rapidly on the scales where \acs{QED} effects are important. In this paper, we construct a cylindrically symmetric toy model of a flux tube lattice in which the non-local influence of \acs{QED} on neighbouring flux tubes is taken into account. We compute the effective action densities using the worldline numerics technique. The numerics predict a greater effective energy density in the region of the flux tube, but a smaller energy density in the regions between the flux tubes compared to a locally-constant-field approximation. We also compute the interaction energy between a flux tube and its neighbours as the lattice spacing is reduced from infinity. Because our flux tubes exhibit compact support, this energy is entirely non-local and predicted to be zero in local approximations such as the derivative expansion. This Casimir-Polder energy can take positive or negative values depending on the distance between the flux tubes, and it may cause the flux tubes in neutron stars to form bunches. In addition to the above results we also discuss two important subtleties of determining the statistical uncertainties within the worldline numerics technique and recommend a form of jackknife analysis.
