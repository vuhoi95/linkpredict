Title: Spectral dimension of bosonic string theory
Authors: D. G. Moore and V. H. Satheeshkumar
Abstract: Given that the scale of quantum gravity is not experimentally accessible, one naturally resorts to mathematical consistency as a measure for a good candidate theory to replace General Relativity at high energies. Reproducing the semi-classical results of black hole entropy has become a standard test for any prospective theory of quantum gravity. It is often argued that another such commonality, albeit less known, is the similar fractal behaviour. It is shown that many, if not all, approaches to quantum gravity predict a spectral dimension of 2 in ultraviolet regime. In this paper, by computing the heat kernel, we show that the spectral dimension of closed bosonic string theory is 26. We discuss the implications of this disparity.
