Title: A modulated shear to entropy ratio
Authors: O. Ovdat and A. Yarom
Abstract: We study correlation functions in an equilibrated spatially modulated phase of Einstein-Maxwell two-derivative gravity. We find that the ratio of the appropriate low frequency limit of the stress-stress two point function to the entropy density is modulated. The conductivity, the stress-current and current-stress correlation functions are also modulated. At temperatures close to the phase transition we obtain analytic expressions for some of the correlation functions.
