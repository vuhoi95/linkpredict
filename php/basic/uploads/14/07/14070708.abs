Title: Green-Schwarz mechanism and $Î±'$-deformed Courant brackets
Authors: Olaf Hohm and Barton Zwiebach
Abstract: We establish that the unusual two-form gauge transformations needed in the Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism fit naturally into an $\alpha'$-deformed generalized geometry. The algebra of gauge transformations is a consistent deformation of the Courant bracket and features a nontrivial modification of the diffeomorphism group. This extension of generalized geometry emerged from a `doubled $\alpha'$-geometry', which provides a construction of exactly gauge and T-duality invariant $\alpha'$ corrections to the effective action.
