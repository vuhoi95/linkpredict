Title: Two-point correlation functions of QCD in the Landau gauge
Authors: Marcela Peláez and Matthieu Tissier and Nicolás Wschebor
Abstract: We investigate the gluon, ghost and quark propagators in the Landau gauge with dynamic quarks. We perform a one-loop calculation in a model where the standard Faddeev-Popov Lagrangian is complemented by a mass term for the gluons which is seen as a minimal way of taking into account the effect of the Gribov copies. The analytic results are compared with lattice data obtained in four dimension and for two, three and four quark flavors. The gluon and ghost propagators are reproduced with a few percent accuracy in the whole range of accessible momenta. The scalar part of the quark propagator is found to be in good agreement with the lattice data. However, the quark renormalization is poorly described. We attribute this discrepancy to the fact that the one-loop corrections to this quantity are unusually small so that the two loop contribution can not be discarded. The results are expressed in terms of the coupling, the gluon mass and the light quark mass at 1 GeV.
