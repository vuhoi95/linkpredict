Title: Heterotic $Î±$'-corrections in Double Field Theory
Authors: Oscar A. Bedoya and Diego Marques and Carmen Nunez
Abstract: We extend the generalized flux formulation of Double Field Theory to include all the first order bosonic contributions to the $\alpha '$ expansion of the heterotic string low energy effective theory. The generalized tangent space and duality group are enhanced by $\alpha'$ corrections, and the gauge symmetries are generated by the usual (gauged) generalized Lie derivative in the extended space. The generalized frame receives derivative corrections through the spin connection with torsion, which is incorporated as a new degree of freedom in the extended bein. We compute the generalized fluxes and find the Riemann curvature tensor with torsion as one of their components. All the four-derivative terms of the action, Bianchi identities and equations of motion are reproduced. Using this formalism, we obtain the first order $\alpha'$ corrections to the heterotic Buscher rules. The relation of our results to alternative formulations in the literature is discussed and future research directions are outlined.
