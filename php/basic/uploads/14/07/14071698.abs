Title: Thermodynamic approach to field equations in Lovelock gravity and f(R)  gravity revisited
Authors: Yan-Gang Miao and Fang-Fang Yuan and Zheng-Zheng Zhang
Abstract: The first law of thermodynamics at black hole horizons is known to be obtainable from the gravitational field equations. A recent study claims that the contributions at inner horizons should be considered in order to give the conventional first law of black hole thermodynamics. Following this method, we revisit the thermodynamic aspects of field equations in the Lovelock gravity and f(R) gravity by focusing on two typical classes of charged black holes in the two theories.
