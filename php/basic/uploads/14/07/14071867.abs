Abstract: We present a simple algebraic construction of all the small resolutions for the SU(5) Weierstrass model. Each resolution corresponds to a subchamber on the Coulomb branch of the five-dimensional N=1 SU(5) gauge theory with matter fields in the fundamental and two-index antisymmetric representations. This construction unifies all previous resolutions found in the literature in a single framework.
