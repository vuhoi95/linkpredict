Title: Compact Formulas for the Completed Mock Modular Forms
Authors: Tohru Eguchi and Yuji Sugawara
Abstract: In this paper we present a new compact expression of the elliptic genus of SL(2)/U(1)-supercoset theory by making use of the `spectral flow method' of the path-integral evaluation. This new expression is written in a form like a Poincare series with a non-holomorphic Gaussian damping factor, and manifestly shows the modular and spectral flow properties of a real analytic Jacobi form. As a related problem, we present similar compact formulas for the modular completions of various mock modular forms which appear in the representation theory of N=2,4 superconformal algebras. We further discuss the generalization to the cases of arbitrary spin-structures, that is, the world-sheet fermions with twisted boundary conditions parameterized by a continuous parameter. This parameter is naturally identified with the `u-variable' in the Appell-Lerch sum.
