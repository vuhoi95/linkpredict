Title: Adjoint BFKL at finite coupling: a short-cut from the collinear limit
Authors: Benjamin Basso and Simon Caron-Huot and Amit Sever
Abstract: In the high energy Regge limit, the six gluons scattering amplitude is controlled by the adjoint BFKL eigenvalue and impact factor. In this paper we determine these two building blocks at any value of the 't Hooft coupling in planar $\cal{N}$=4 SYM theory. This is achieved by means of analytic continuations from the collinear limit, where similar all loops expressions were recently established. We check our predictions against all available data at weak and strong coupling.
