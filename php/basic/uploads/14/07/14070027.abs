Title: Towards the One-loop Kahler Metric of Calabi-Yau Orientifolds
Authors: Marcus Berg and Michael Haack and Jin U. Kang and Stefan Sjors
Abstract: We evaluate string one-loop contributions to the Kahler metric of closed string moduli in toroidal minimally supersymmetric (Calabi-Yau) orientifolds with D-branes. We focus on the poorly understood N=1 sectors that receive contributions from all massive string states.
