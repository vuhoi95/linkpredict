Title: Cosmological singleton gravity theory and dS/LCFT correspondence
Authors: Yun Soo Myung and Taeyoon Moon
Abstract: We study the evolution of cosmological perturbations generated during de Sitter inflation in the singleton gravity theory. This theory is composed of a dipole ghost pair in addition to tensor. We obtain the singleton power spectra which show that the de Sitter/logarithmic conformal field theory (dS/LCFT) correspondence works for computing the power spectra in the superhorizon limit. Also we compute the spectral indices for light singleton which contains a logarithmic correction.
