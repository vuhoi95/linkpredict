Title: Probing Wilson Loops in AdS/QCD
Authors: Yizhuang Liu and Ismail Zahed
Abstract: We use AdS/QCD to analyze the quark and gluon scalar and pseudo-scalar condensates around static color sources described by a circular Wilson loop. We also derive the static dipole-dipole interactions between rectangular Wilson loops in AdS/QCD and discuss their relevance for static string interactions in QCD at strong coupling.
