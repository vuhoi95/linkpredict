Title: Universal Bounds on the Time Evolution of Entanglement Entropy
Authors: Steven G. Avery and Miguel F. Paulos
Abstract: Using relative entropy, we derive bounds on the time rate of change of geometric entanglement entropy for any relativistic quantum field theory in any dimension. The bounds apply to both mixed and pure states, and may be extended to curved space. We illustrate the bounds in a few examples and comment on potential applications and future extensions.
