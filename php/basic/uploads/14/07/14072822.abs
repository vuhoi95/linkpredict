Title: Effective field theories on solitons of generic shapes
Authors: Sven Bjarke Gudnason and Muneto Nitta
Abstract: A class of effective field theories for moduli or collective coordinates on solitons of generic shapes is constructed. As an illustration, we consider effective field theories living on solitons in the O(4) non-linear sigma model with higher-derivative terms.
