Title: About the phase space of SL(3) Black Holes
Authors: Alejandro Cabo-Bizet and V. I. Giraldo-Rivera
Abstract: In this note we address some issues of recent interest, related to the asymptotic symmetry algebra of higher spin black holes in $sl(3,\mathbb{R})\times sl(3,\mathbb{R})$ Chern Simons (CS) formulation. We compute the fixed time Dirac bracket algebra that acts on two different phase spaces. Both of these spaces contain black holes as zero modes. The result for one of these phase spaces is explicitly shown to be isomorphic to $W^{(2)}_3\times W^{(2)}_3$ in first order perturbations.
