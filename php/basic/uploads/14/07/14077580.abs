Title: De Sitter Vacua from a D-term Generated Racetrack Uplift
Authors: Markus Rummel and Yoske Sumitomo
Abstract: We propose an uplift mechanism using a structure of multi-K\"ahler moduli dependence in the F-term potential of type IIB string theory compactifications. This mechanism requires a D-term condition that fixes one modulus to be proportional to another modulus, resulting in a trivial D-term potential. De Sitter minima are realized along with an enhancement of the volume in the Large Volume Scenario and no additional suppression of the uplift term such as warping is required. We further show the possibility to realize the uplift mechanism in the presence of more K\"ahler moduli such that we expect the uplift mechanism to work in many other compactifications.
