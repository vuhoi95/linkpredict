Title: Beta-gamma system, pure spinors and Hilbert series of arc spaces
Authors: Chandrasekhar Bhamidipati and Koushik Ray
Abstract: Algorithms are presented for calculating the partition function of constrained beta-gamma systems in terms of the generating functions of the individual fields of the theory, the latter obtained as the Hilbert series of the arc space of the algebraic variety defined by the constraint. Examples of a beta-gamma system on a complex surface with an $A_1$ singularity and pure spinors are worked out and compared with existing results.
