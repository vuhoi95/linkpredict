Title: Unlocking the Axion-Dilaton in 5D Supergravity
Authors: Joris Raeymaekers and Dieter Van den Bleeken
Abstract: We revisit supersymmetric solutions to five dimensional ungauged N=1 supergravity with dynamic hypermultiplets. In particular we focus on a truncation to the axion-dilaton contained in the universal hypermultiplet. The relevant solutions are fibrations over a four-dimensional Kahler base with a holomorphic axion-dilaton. We focus on solutions with additional symmetries and classify Killing vectors which preserve the additional structure imposed by supersymmetry; in particular we extend the existing classification of solutions with a space-like U(1) isometry to the case where the Killing vector is rotational. We elaborate on general geometrical aspects which we illustrate in some simple examples. We especially discuss solutions describing the backreaction of M2-branes, which for example play a role in the black hole deconstruction proposal for microstate geometries.
