Title: The double attractor behavior of induced inflation
Authors: Renata Kallosh and Andrei Linde and Diederik Roest
Abstract: We describe an induced inflation, which refers to a class of inflationary models with a generalized non-minimal coupling $\xi g(\phi) R$ and a specific scalar potential. The defining property of these models is that the scalar field takes a vev in the vacuum and thus induces an effective Planck mass. We study this model as a function of the coupling parameter $\xi$. At large $\xi$, the predictions of the theory are known to have an attractor behavior, converging to a universal result independent on the choice of the function $g(\phi)$. We find that at small $\xi$, the theory approaches a second attractor. The inflationary predictions of this class of theories continuously interpolate between those of the Starobinsky model and the predictions of the simplest chaotic inflation with a quadratic potential.
