Title: Tachyonic matter cosmology with exponential and hyperbolic potentials
Authors: B. Pourhassan and J. Naji
Abstract: In this paper we consider tachyonic matter in spatially at FRW universe, and obtain behavior of some important cosmological parameters for two special cases of potentials. First we assume the exponential potential and then consider hyperbolic cosine type potential. In both cases we obtain behavior of the Hubble, deceleration and EoS parameters. Comparison with observational data suggest the model with hyperbolic cosine type scalar-field potentials has good model to describe universe.
