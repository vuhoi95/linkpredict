Authors: Seiya Nishiyama and Joao da Providencia
Abstract: In this paper we present the induced representation of SO(2N) canonical transformation group and introduce SO(2N)/U(N) coset variables. We give a derivation of the time dependent Hartree-Bogoliubov (TDHB) equation on the Kaehler coset space G/H=SO(2N)/U(N) from the Euler-Lagrange equation of motion for the coset variables. The TDHB wave function represents the TD behavior of Bose condensate of fermion pairs. It is a good approximation for the ground state of the fermion system with a pairing interaction, producing the spontaneous Bose condensation. To describe the classical motion on the coset manifold, we start from the local equation of motion. This equation becomes a Riccati-type equation. After giving a simple two-level model and a solution for a coset variable, we can get successfully a general solution of TDRHB equation for the coset variables. We obtain the Harish-Chandra decomposition for the SO(2N) matrix based on the nonlinear Moebius transformation together with the geodesic flow on the manifold.
