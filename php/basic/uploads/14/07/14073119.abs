Title: Monopoles in Superloop Space
Authors: Mir Faizal and Tsou Sheung Tsun
Abstract: In this paper, we will analyse a four dimensional gauge theory with $\mathcal{N} =1$ supersymmetry in superloop space formalism. We will thus obtain an expression for the connection in the infinite-dimensional superloop space. We will then use this connection to obtain an expression for the curvature of the infinite-dimensional superloop space. We will also show that this curvature is proportional to the Bianchi identity in spacetime. Thus, in absence of a monopole this curvature will vanish. However, it will not vanish if the superloop intersects the world-line of a monopole because the Bianchi will not hold at that point.
