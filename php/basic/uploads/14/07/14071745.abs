Title: First-order framework for flat brane with auxiliary fields
Authors: D. Bazeia and A. S. Lob√£o Jr. and R. Menezes
Abstract: This work deals with braneworld models in the presence of auxiliary fields. We investigate the case where Einstein's equation is modified with the inclusion of extra, non-dynamical terms. We show that the model supports first-order differential equations that solve the equations of motion, but the standard braneworld scenario changes under the presence of the parameter that controls the non-dynamical or auxiliary fields that modifies Einstein's equation.
