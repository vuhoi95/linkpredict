Title: Partition Functions of Superconformal Chern-Simons Theories from Fermi  Gas Approach
Authors: Sanefumi Moriyama and Tomoki Nosaka
Abstract: We study the partition function of three-dimensional ${\mathcal N}=4$ superconformal Chern-Simons theories of the circular quiver type, which are natural generalizations of the ABJM theory, the worldvolume theory of M2-branes. In the ABJM case, it was known that the perturbative part of the partition function sums up to the Airy function as $Z(N)=e^{A}C^{-1/3}\mathrm{Ai}[C^{-1/3}(N-B)]$ with coefficients $C$, $B$ and $A$ and that for the non-perturbative part the divergences coming from the coefficients of worldsheet instantons and membrane instantons cancel among themselves. We find that many of the interesting properties in the ABJM theory are extended to the general superconformal Chern-Simons theories. Especially, we find an explicit expression of $B$ for general ${\mathcal N}=4$ theories, a conjectural form of $A$ for a special class of theories, and cancellation in the non-perturbative coefficients for the simplest theory next to the ABJM theory.
