Title: Jeans Instability in Superfluids
Authors: Itamar Hason and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We analyze the effect of a gravitational field on the sound modes of superfluids. We derive an instability condition that generalizes the well known Jeans instability of the sound mode in normal fluids. We discuss potential experimental implications.
