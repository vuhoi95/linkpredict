Title: Near-Hagedorn Thermodynamics and Random Walks - Extensions and Examples
Authors: Thomas G. Mertens and Henri Verschelde and Valentin I. Zakharov
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss several explicit examples of the results obtained in JHEP 1402 (2014) 127. We elaborate on the random walk picture in these spacetimes and how it is modified. Firstly we discuss the linear dilaton background. Then we analyze a previously studied toroidally compactified background where we determine the Hagedorn temperature and study the random walk picture. We continue with flat space orbifold models where we discuss boundary conditions for the thermal scalar. Finally, we study the general link between the quantum numbers in the fundamental domain and the strip and their role in thermodynamics.
