Title: $K$-field kinks: stability, exact solutions and new features
Authors: Yuan Zhong and Yu-Xiao Liu
Abstract: We study a class of noncanonical real scalar field models in $(1+1)$-dimensional flat space-time. We first derive the general criterion for the classical linear stability of an arbitrary static soliton solution of these models. Then we construct first-order formalisms for some typical models and derive the corresponding kink solutions. The linear structures of these solutions are also qualitatively analyzed and compared with the canonical kink solutions.
