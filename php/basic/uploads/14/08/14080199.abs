Title: Quantum spectral dimension in quantum field theory
Authors: Gianluca Calcagni and Leonardo Modesto and Giuseppe Nardelli
Abstract: We reinterpret the spectral dimension of spacetimes as the scaling of an effective self-energy transition amplitude in quantum field theory (QFT), when the system is probed at a given resolution. This picture has four main advantages: (a) it dispenses with the usual interpretation (unsatisfactory in covariant approaches) where, instead of a transition amplitude, one has a probability density solving a nonrelativistic diffusion equation in an abstract diffusion time; (b) it solves the problem of negative probabilities known for higher-order and nonlocal dispersion relations in classical and quantum gravity; (c) it clarifies the concept of quantum spectral dimension as opposed to the classical one. We then consider a class of logarithmic dispersion relations associated with quantum particles and show that the spectral dimension $d_s$ of spacetime as felt by these quantum probes can deviate from its classical value, equal to the topological dimension $D$. In particular, in the presence of higher momentum powers it changes with the scale, dropping from $D$ in the infrared (IR) to a value $d_s^{\rm UV}\leq D$ in the ultraviolet (UV). We apply this general result to Stelle theory of renormalizable gravity, which attains the universal value $d_s^{\rm UV}=2$ for any dimension $D$.
