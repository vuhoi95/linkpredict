Title: Vector Meson Spectrum from top-down Holographic QCD
Authors: Keshav Dasgupta and Charles Gale and Mohammed Mia and Michael Richard and Olivier Trottier
Abstract: We elaborate on the brane configuration that gives rise to a QCD-like gauge theory that confines at low energies and becomes scale invariant at the highest energies. In the limit where the rank of the gauge group is large, a gravitational description emerges. For the confined phase, we obtain a vector meson spectrum and demonstrate how certain choice of parameters can lead to quantitative agreement with empirical data.
