Title: Regular black holes with a nonlinear electrodynamics source
Authors: Leonardo Balart and Elias C. Vagenas
Abstract: We construct several charged regular black hole metrics employing mass distribution functions which are inspired by continuous probability distributions. Some of these metrics satisfy the weak energy condition and asymptotically behave as the Reissner--Nordstrom black hole. In each case, the source to the Einstein equations corresponds to a nonlinear electrodynamics model, which in the weak field limit becomes the Maxwell theory (compatible with the Maxwell weak field limit or approximation). Furthermore, we include other regular black hole solutions that satisfy the weak energy condition and some of them correspond to the Maxwell theory in the weak field limit.
