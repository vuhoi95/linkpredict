Title: Triple collinear splitting functions at NLO for scattering processes  with photons
Authors: German F. R. Sborlini and Daniel de Florian and German Rodrigo
Abstract: We present splitting functions in the triple collinear limit at next-to-leading order. The computation was performed in the context of massless QCD+QED, considering only processes which include at least one photon. Through the comparison of the IR divergent structure of splitting amplitudes with the expected known behavior, we were able to check our results. Besides that we implemented some consistency checks based on symmetry arguments and cross-checked the results among them. Studying photon-started processes, we obtained very compact results.
