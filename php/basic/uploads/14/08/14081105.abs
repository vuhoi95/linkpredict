Title: Van der Waals black hole
Authors: Aruna Rajagopal and David Kubiznak and Robert B. Mann
Abstract: In the context of extended phase space, where the negative cosmological constant is treated as a thermodynamic pressure in the first law of black hole thermodynamics, we find an asymptotically AdS metric whose thermodynamics matches exactly that of the Van der Waals fluid. However, we show that as a solution of Einstein's equations, the corresponding stress energy tensor does not obey any of the energy conditions everywhere outside of the horizon.
