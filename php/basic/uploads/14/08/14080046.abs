Title: Hybrid Inflation with Planck Scale Fields
Authors: Michael Dine and Laurel Stephenson-Haskins
Abstract: The BICEP2 observations, if confirmed, point to a high scale of inflation and large field excursions during the inflationary era. Non-compact string moduli spaces are a suggestive setting for these phenomena. While unlikely to be described by weak coupling models, one can write down plausible effective field theories compatible with known features of cosmology. These models can be viewed as generalizations to a large field regime of hybrid inflation. We note close parallels to small and large field axion models. This paper outlines the requirements for successful modular inflation, and gives examples of effective field theories which satisfy them. The required tunings are readily characterized. These models can also be thought of as models of chaotic inflation, in a way we describe. In the modular framework, one would expect that any would-be Peccei-Quinn symmetry would likely be badly broken during inflation, and the axion would have Hubble scale mass; in this situation, isocurvature fluctuations would be suppressed and the initial misalignment angle would be fixed, rather than being a random variable.
