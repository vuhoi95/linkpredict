Title: Excitation of Photons by Inflationary Gravitons
Authors: C. L. Wang and R. P. Woodard
Abstract: We use a recent result for the graviton contribution to the one loop vacuum polarization to solve the effective field equations for dynamical photons on de Sitter background. Our results show that the electric field experiences a secular enhancement proportional to the number of inflationary e-foldings. We discuss the minimum this establishes for primordial inflation to seed cosmic magnetic fields.
