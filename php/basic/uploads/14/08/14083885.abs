Title: Hydrodynamics on non-commutative space --A step toward hydrodynamics of  granular materials--
Authors: Mayumi Saitou and Kazuharu Bamba and Akio Sugamoto
Abstract: Hydrodynamics on non-commutative space is studied based on a formulation of hydrodynamics by Y. Nambu in terms of Poisson and Nambu brackets. Replacing these brackets by Moyal brackets with a parameter $\theta$, a new hydrodynamics on non-commutative space is derived. It may be a step toward to find the hydrodynamics of granular materials whose minimum volume is given by $\theta$. To clarify this minimum volume, path integral quantization and uncertainty relation of Nambu dynamics are examined.
