Title: $K$-theory on arbitrary manifolds and topological insulators
Authors: Koushik Ray and Siddhartha Sen
Abstract: We discuss means to study topological properties of wavefunctions in a time reversal invariant crystalline system through $K$-groups. The well-known methods for calculating $K$-groups of $G$-bundles over spheres are extended using earlier results in order to deal with wavefunctions defined over toroidal Brillouin zones, following a method due to Nash. The recently discovered topological insulator is considered as an illustrative example.
