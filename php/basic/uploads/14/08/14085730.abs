Title: Collective modes in a Dirac insulator with short range interactions
Authors: Xi Luo and Yue Yu and Long Liang
Abstract: We study a Haldane model with nearest neighbor interactions. We find one-dimensional like collective modes arising due to the interplay of pseudo-spin and valley degrees of freedom. In the large band gap or moderate interaction limit, these excitations are low energy modes lying in the band gap. The dispersion relations are qualitatively different in trivial insulator phase and Chern insulator phase, thus can be used to identify the topology of the Haldane model with the bulk property. We also discuss how to detect these modes in cold atom systems. An abelian gauge theory will emerge when a physical current-current interaction is introduced to the Haldane model or the Kane-Mele model.
