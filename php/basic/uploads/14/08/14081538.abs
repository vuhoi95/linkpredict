Title: Comments on HKT supersymmetric sigma models and their Hamiltonian  reduction
Authors: Sergey Fedoruk and Andrei Smilga
Abstract: Using complex notation, we present new simple expressions for two pairs of complex supercharges in HKT supersymmetric sigma models. The second pair of supercharges depends on the holomorphic antisymmetric "hypercomplex structure" tensor which plays the same role for the HKT models as the complex structure tensor for the Kaehler models. When the Hamiltonian and supercharges commute with the momenta conjugate to the imaginary parts of the complex coordinates, one can perform a Hamiltonian reduction. The models thus obtained represent a special class of quasicomplex sigma models introduced recently by Ivanov and Smilga.
