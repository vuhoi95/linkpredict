Title: Canonical formulation of scalar curvature squared action in higher  dimensions
Authors: Subhra Debnath and Soumendranath Ruz and Abhik Kumar Sanyal
Abstract: Canonical formulation for an action containing scalar curvature squared term $(R^2)$ in arbitrary dimension has been performed in maximally symmetric space-time. The quantum dynamics does not alter significantly from the same in $4$-dimension. Classical solution is also at par with the one presented by Starobinsky. WKB approximation peaks around the classical solution.
