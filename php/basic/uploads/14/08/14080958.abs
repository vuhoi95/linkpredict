Title: The SUSY Yang-Mills plasma in a $T$-matrix approach
Authors: G. Lacroix and C. Semay and F. Buisseret
Abstract: The thermodynamic properties of ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with an arbitrary gauge group are investigated. In the confined range, we show that identifying the bound state spectrum with a Hagedorn one coming from non-critical closed superstring theory leads to a prediction for the value of the deconfining temperature $T_c$ that agrees with recent lattice data. The deconfined phase is studied by resorting to a $T$-matrix formulation of statistical mechanics in which the medium under study is seen as a gas of quasigluons and quasigluinos interacting nonperturbatively. Emphasis is put on the temperature range (1-5)~$T_c$, where the interaction are expected to be strong enough to generate bound states. Binary bound states of gluons and gluinos are indeed found to be bound up to 1.4 $T_c$ for any gauge group. The equation of state is then computed numerically for SU($N$) and $G_2$, and discussed in the case of an arbitrary gauge group. It is found to be nearly independent of the gauge group and very close to that of non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills when normalized to the Stefan-Boltzmann pressure and expressed as a function of $T/T_c$.
