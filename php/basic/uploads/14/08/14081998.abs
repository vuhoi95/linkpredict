Title: $(2+1)$-dimensional charged black holes with scalar hair in  Einstein-Power-Maxwell Theory
Authors: Wei Xu and De-Cheng Zou
Abstract: We obtain an exact static solution to Einstein-Power-Maxwell (EPM) theory in $(2+1)$ dimensional AdS spacetime, in which the scalar field couples to gravity in a non-minimal way. After considering the scalar potential, a stable system leads to a constraint on the power parameter $k$ of Maxwell field. The solution contains a curvature singularity at the origin and is non-conformally flat. The horizon structures are identified, which indicates the physically acceptable lower bound of mass in according to the existence of black hole solutions. Especially for the cases with $k>1$, the lower bound is negative, thus there exist scalar black holes with negative mass. The null geodesics in this spacetime are also discussed in detail. They are divided into five models, which are made up of the cases with the following geodesic motions: no-allowed motion, the circular motion, the elliptic motion and the unbounded spiral motion.
