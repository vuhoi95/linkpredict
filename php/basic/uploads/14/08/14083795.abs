Title: Incorporation of Generalized Uncertainty Principle into Lifshitz Field  Theories
Authors: Mir Faizal and Barun Majumder
Abstract: In this paper, we will incorporation the generalized uncertainty principle into field theories with Lifshitz scaling. We will first construct both bososnic and fermionic theories with Lifshitz scaling based on generalized uncertainty principle. After that we will incorporate the generalized uncertainty principle into an non-abelian gauge theory with Lifshitz scaling. We will observe that even though the action for this theory is non-local, it is invariant under local gauge transformations. We will also perform the stochastic quantization of this Lifshitz fermionic theory based generalized uncertainty principle.
