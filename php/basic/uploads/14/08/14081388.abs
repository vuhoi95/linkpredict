Title: Commuting Quantum Matrix Models
Authors: Veselin G. Filev and Denjoe O'Connor
Abstract: We study a quantum system of $p$ commuting matrices and find that such a quantum system requires an explicit curvature dependent potential in its Lagrangian for the system to have a finite energy ground state. In contrast it is possible to avoid such curvature dependence in the Hamiltonian. We study the eigenvalue distribution for such systems in the large matrix size limit. A critical r\^ole is played by $p=4$. For $p\ge4$ the competition between eigenvalue repulsion and the attractive potential forces the eigenvalues to form a sharp spherical shell.
