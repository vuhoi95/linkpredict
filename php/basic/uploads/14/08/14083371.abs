Title: Superconformal index on $\mathbb{RP}^2 \times \mathbb{S}^1$ and mirror  symmetry
Authors: Akinori Tanaka and Hironori Mori and Takeshi Morita
Abstract: We study $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supersymmetric gauge theories on $\mathbb{RP}^2 \times \mathbb{S}^1$ and compute the superconformal index by using the localization technique. We consider not only the round real projective plane $\mathbb{RP}^2$ but also the squashed real projective plane $\mathbb{RP}^2_b$ which turns back to $\mathbb{RP}^2$ by taking a squashing parameter $b$ as $1$. In addition, we found that the result is independent of the squashing parameter $b$. We apply our new superconformal index to the check of the simplest 3d mirror symmetry, i.e. the equivalence between the $\mathcal{N}=2$ SQED and the XYZ model on $\mathbb{RP}^2 \times \mathbb{S}^1$. We prove it by using a mathematical formula called the $q$-binomial theorem. We comment on the $\mathcal{N}=4$ version of mirror symmetry, mirror symmetry via generalized indices, and possibilities of generalizations from mathematical viewpoints.
