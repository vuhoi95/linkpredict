Title: Operator Product Expansion and Conservation Laws in Non-Relativistic  Conformal Field Theories
Authors: Siavash Golkar and Dam T. Son
Abstract: We explore the consequences of conformal symmetry for the operator product expansions in nonrelativistic field theories. Similar to the relativistic case, the OPE coefficients of descendants are related to that of the primary. However, unlike relativistic CFTs the 3-point function of primaries is not completely specified by conformal symmetry. Here, we show that the 3-point function between operators with nonzero particle number, where (at least) one operator has the lowest dimension allowed by unitarity, is determined up to a numerical coefficient. We also look at the structure of the family tree of primaries with zero particle number and discuss the presence of conservation laws in this sector.
