Title: Interactions between delta-like sources and potentials
Authors: G. T. Camilo and F. E. Barone and F. A. Barone
Abstract: The modified scalar boson propagator due to the presence of a hyperplane semi-transparent mirror is computed. From this, the classical interaction between static charges and the mirror is investigated employing delta-like potentials and sources. Although the calculations for hyperplane mirrors are performed in arbitrary dimensions, and in a completely general way, it is shown that the results give rise to the usual image method as a particular case. The interaction between a point-like mirror and a point-like source is also considered in $3+1$ dimensions, where a central $1/R^{2}$ attractive potential is also obtained as a special case.
