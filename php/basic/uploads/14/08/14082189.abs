Title: A new coordinate system for q-deformed AdS_5 x S^5 and classical string  solutions
Authors: Takashi Kameyama and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We study a GKP-like classical string solution on a q-deformed AdS_5 x S^5 background and argue the spacetime structure by using it as a probe. The solution cannot stretch beyond the singularity surface and this result may suggest that the holographic relation is realized inside the singularity surface. This observation leads us to introduce a new coordinate system which describes the spacetime only inside the singularity surface. With the new coordinate system, we study minimal surfaces and derive a deformed Neumann-Rosochatius system with a rigid string ansatz.
