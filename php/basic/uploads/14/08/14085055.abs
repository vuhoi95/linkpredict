Title: Deformed Hamilton-Jacobi Method in Covariant Quantum Gravity Effective  Models
Authors: Mu Benrong and Peng Wang and Haitang Yang
Abstract: We first briefly revisit the original Hamilton-Jacobi method and show that the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the action $I$ of tunnelings of a fermionic particle from a charged black hole can be written in the same form as that of a scalar particle. For the low energy quantum gravity effective models which respect covariance of the curved spacetime, we derive the deformed model-independent KG/Dirac and Hamilton-Jacobi equations using the methods of effective field theory. We then find that, to all orders of the effective theories, the deformed Hamilton-Jacobi equations can be obtained from the original ones by simply replacing the mass of emitted particles $m$ with a parameter $m_{eff}$ that includes all the quantum gravity corrections. Therefore, in this scenario, there will be no corrections to the Hawking temperature of a black hole from the quantum gravity effects if its original Hawking temperature is independent of the mass of emitted particles. As a consequence, our results show that breaking covariance in quantum gravity effective models is a key for a black hole to have the remnant left in the evaporation.
