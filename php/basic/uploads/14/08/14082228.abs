Title: Asymptotic symmetries and subleading soft graviton theorem
Authors: Miguel Campiglia and Alok Laddha
Abstract: Motivated by the equivalence between soft graviton theorem and Ward identities for the supertranslation symmetries belonging to the BMS group, we propose a new extension (different from the so-called extended BMS) of the BMS group which is a semi-direct product of supertranslations and Diff(S^2). We propose a definition for the canonical generators associated to the smooth diffeomorphisms and show that the resulting Ward identities are equivalent to the subleading soft graviton theorem of Cachazo and Strominger.
