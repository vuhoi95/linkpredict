Title: Superpartners at LHC and Future Colliders: Predictions from Constrained  Compactified M-Theory
Authors: Sebastian A. R. Ellis and Gordon L. Kane and Bob Zheng
Abstract: We study a realistic top-down M-theory compactification with low-scale effective Supersymmetry, consistent with phenomenological constraints. A combination of top-down and generic phenomenological constraints fix the spectrum. The gluino mass is predicted to be about 1.5 TeV. Three and only three superpartner channels, $\tilde{g} \tilde{g}$, $\chi_2^0 \chi_1^\pm$ and $\chi_1^+ \chi_1^-$ (where $\chi_2^0, \chi_1^\pm$ are Wino-like), are expected to be observable at LHC-14. We also investigate the prospects of finding heavy squarks and Higgsinos at future colliders. Gluino-stop-top, gluino-sbottom-bottom associated production and first generation squark associated production should be observable at a 100 TeV collider, along with direct production of heavy Higgsinos. Within this framework the discovery of a single sparticle is sufficient to determine uniquely the SUSY spectrum, yielding a number of concrete testable predictions for LHC-14 and future colliders, and determination of $M_{3/2}$ and thereby other fundamental quantities.
