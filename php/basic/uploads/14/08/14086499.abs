Title: On the Horava-Lifshitz-like extensions of supersymmetric theories
Authors: M. Gomes and J. R. Nascimento and A. Yu. Petrov and A. J. da Silva
Abstract: Within the superfield approach, we formulate two different extensions of the Wess-Zumino model and super-QED with Horava-Lifshitz-like additive terms, discuss their quantum properties and calculate lower contributions to the effective action. In the case of the gauge theory, the one-loop effective potential turns out to be gauge independent.
