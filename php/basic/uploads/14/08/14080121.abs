Title: Thermally correlated states in Loop Quantum Gravity
Authors: Goffredo Chirco and Carlo Rovelli and Paola Ruggiero
Abstract: We study a class of loop-quantum-gravity states characterized by (ultra-local) thermal correlations that reproduce some features of the ultraviolet structure of the perturbative quantum field theory vacuum. In particular, they satisfy an analog of the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem. These states are peaked on the intrinsic geometry and admit a semiclassical interpretation. We study how the correlations extend on the spin-network beyond the ultra local limit.
