Title: Representation of quantum field theory in an extended spin space and  fermion mass hierarchy
Authors: J. Besprosvany and R. Romero
Abstract: We consider a matrix space based on the spin degree of freedom, describing both a Hilbert state space, and its corresponding symmetry operators. Under the requirement that the Lorentz symmetry be kept, at given dimension, scalar symmetries, and their representations are determined. Symmetries are flavor or gauge-like, with fixed chirality. After spin 0, 1/2, and 1 fields are obtained in this space, we construct associated interactive gauge-invariant renormalizable terms, showing their equivalence to a Lagrangian formulation, using as example the previously studied (5+1)-dimensional case, with many standard-model connections. At 7+1 dimensions, a pair of Higgs-like scalar Lagrangian is obtained naturally producing mass hierarchy within a fermion flavor doublet.
