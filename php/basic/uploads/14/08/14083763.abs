Title: Generalized Uncertainty Principle: Implications for Black Hole  Complementarity
Authors: Pisin Chen and Yen Chin Ong and Dong-han Yeom
Abstract: At the heart of the black hole information loss paradox and the firewall controversy lies the conflict between quantum mechanics and general relativity. Much has been said about quantum corrections to general relativity, but much less in the opposite direction. It is therefore crucial to examine possible corrections to quantum mechanics due to gravity. Indeed, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is one profound feature of quantum mechanics, which nevertheless may receive correction when gravitational effects become important. Such generalized uncertainty principle [GUP] has been motivated from not only quite general considerations of quantum mechanics and gravity, but also string theoretic arguments. We examine the role of GUP in the context of black hole complementarity. We find that while complementarity can be violated by large N rescaling if one assumes only the Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, the application of GUP may save complementarity, but only if certain N-dependence is also assumed. This raises two important questions beyond the scope of this work, i.e., whether GUP really has the proposed form of N-dependence, and whether black hole complementarity is indeed correct.
