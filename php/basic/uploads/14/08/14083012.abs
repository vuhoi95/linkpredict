Title: Exact solution of the XXX Gaudin model with the generic open boundaries
Authors: Kun Hao and Junpeng Cao and Tao Yang and Wen-Li Yang
Abstract: The XXX Gaudin model with generic integrable boundaries specified by the most general non-diagonal K-matrices is studied by the off-diagonal Bethe ansatz method. The eigenvalues of the associated Gaudin operators and the corresponding Bethe ansatz equations are obtained.
