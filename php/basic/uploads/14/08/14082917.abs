Title: Nonperturbative Aspects of the two-dimensional Massive Gauged Thirring  Model
Authors: R. Bufalo and B. M. Pimentel
Abstract: In this paper we present a study based on the use of functional techniques on the issue of insertions of massive fermionic fields in the two-dimensional massless Gauged Thirring Model. As it will be shown, the fermionic mass contributes to the Green's functions in a surprisingly simple way, leaving therefore the original nonperturbative nature of the massless results still intact in the massive theory. Also, by means of complementarity, we present a second discussion of the massive model, now at its bosonic representation.
