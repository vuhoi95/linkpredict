Title: On colored HOMFLY polynomials for twist knots
Authors: A. Mironov and A. Morozov and An. Morozov
Abstract: Recent results of J.Gu and H.Jockers provide the lacking initial conditions for the evolution method in the case of the first non-trivially colored HOMFLY polynomials H_{[21]} for the family of twist knots. We describe this application of the evolution method, which finally allows one to penetrate through the wall between (anti)symmetric and non-rectangular representations for a whole family. We reveal the necessary deformation of the differential expansion, what, together with the recently suggested matrix model approach gives new opportunities to guess what it could be for a generic representation, at least for the family of twist knots.
