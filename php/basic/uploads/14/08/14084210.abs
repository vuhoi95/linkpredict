Title: Higher Derivative Corrections to Manifestly Supersymmetric Nonlinear  Realizations
Authors: Muneto Nitta and Shin Sasaki
Abstract: When global symmetries are spontaneously broken in supersymmetric vacua, there appear quasi-Nambu-Goldstone (NG) fermions as superpartners of NG bosons. In addition to these, there can appear quasi-NG bosons in general. The quasi-NG bosons and fermions together with the NG bosons are organized into chiral multiplets. K\"ahler potentials of low-energy effective theories were constructed some years ago as supersymmetric nonlinear realizations. It is known that higher derivative terms in the superfield formalism often encounter with the auxiliary field problem; the auxiliary fields are acted by space-time derivatives and cannot be eliminated. In this paper, we construct higher derivative corrections to supersymmetric nonlinear realizations in the off-shell superfield formalism free from the auxiliary field problem. As an example, we present manifestly supersymmetric chiral Lagrangian.
