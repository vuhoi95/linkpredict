Title: A new exact solution of the relativistic Boltzmann equation and its  hydrodynamic limit
Authors: Gabriel S. Denicol and Ulrich W. Heinz and Mauricio Martinez and Jorge Noronha and Michael Strickland
Abstract: We present an exact solution of the relativistic Boltzmann equation for a system undergoing boost-invariant longitudinal and azimuthally symmetric transverse flow ("Gubser flow"). The resulting exact non-equilibrium dynamics is compared to 1st- and 2nd-order relativistic hydrodynamic approximations for various shear viscosity to entropy density ratios. This novel solution can be used to test the validity and accuracy of different hydrodynamic approximations in conditions similar to those generated in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
