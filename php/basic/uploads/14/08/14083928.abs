Title: Thermodynamics of black holes and the symmetric generalized uncertainty  principle
Authors: Abhijit Dutta and Sunandan Gangopadhyay
Abstract: In this paper, we have investigated the thermodynamics of Schwarzschild black holes using the symmetric generalized uncertainty principle which contains correction terms involving momentum and position uncertainty. We obtain the mass-temperature relation and the heat capacity of the black hole using which we compute the critical and remnant masses. The entropy is found to satisfy the area law upto leading order corrections from the symmetric generalized uncertainty principle.
