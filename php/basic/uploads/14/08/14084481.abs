Title: Gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect due to noncommutative BTZ black hole
Authors: M. A. Anacleto and F. A. Brito and E. Passos
Abstract: In this paper we consider the scattering of massless planar scalar waves by a noncommutative BTZ black hole. We compute the differential cross section via the partial wave approach, and we mainly show that the scattering of planar waves leads to a modified Aharonov-Bohm effect due to spacetime noncommutativity
