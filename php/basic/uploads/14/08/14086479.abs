Title: Universal horizons in maximally symmetric spaces
Authors: Jishnu Bhattacharyya and David Mattingly
Abstract: Universal horizons in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity and Einstein-{\ae}ther theory are the equivalent of causal horizons in general relativity and appear to have many of the same properties, including a first law of horizon thermodynamics and thermal radiation. Since universal horizons are infrared solutions of a putative power counting renormalizable quantum gravitational theory, fully understanding their thermodynamics will shed light on the interplay between black hole thermodynamics and quantum gravity. In this paper, we provide a complete classification, including asymptotic charges, of all four dimensional static and spherically symmetric universal horizon solutions with maximally symmetric asymptotics -- the equivalents of the Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild de Sitter or Schwarzschild anti-de Sitter spacetimes. Additionally we derive the associated first laws for the universal horizon solutions. Finally we prove that independent of asymptotic boundary conditions, any spherically symmetric solution in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity with a universal horizon is also a solution of Einstein-{\ae}ther theory, thereby broadening and complementing the known equivalence region of the solution spaces.
