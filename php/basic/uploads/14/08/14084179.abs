Title: Note on Soft Graviton theorem by KLT Relation
Authors: Yi-Jian Du and Bo Feng and Chih-Hao Fu and Yihong Wang
Abstract: Recently, new soft graviton theorem proposed by Cachazo and Strominger has inspired a lot of works. In this note, we use the KLT-formula to investigate the theorem. We have shown how the soft behavior of color ordered Yang-Mills amplitudes can be combined with KLT relation to give the soft behavior of gravity amplitudes. As a byproduct, we find two nontrivial identities of the KLT momentum kernel must hold.
