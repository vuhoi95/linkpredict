Title: Remarks on nonlinear Electrodynamics
Authors: Patricio Gaete and José Helayël-Neto
Abstract: We consider both generalized Born-Infeld and Exponential Electrodynamics. The field-energy of a point-like charge is finite only for Born-Infeld-like Electrodynamics. However, both Born-Infeld-type and Exponential Electrodynamics display the vacuum birefringence phenomenon. Subsequently, we calculate the lowest-order modifications to the interaction energy for both classes of Electrodynamics, within the framework of the gauge-invariant path-dependent variables formalism. These are shown to result in long-range ($1/r^5$- type) corrections to the Coulomb potential. Once again, for their non-commutative versions, the interaction energy is ultraviolet finite.
