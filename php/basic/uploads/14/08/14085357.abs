Title: Integrable approach to simple exclusion processes with boundaries.  Review and progress
Authors: N. Crampe and E. Ragoucy and M. Vanicat
Abstract: We study the matrix ansatz in the quantum group framework, applying integrable systems techniques to statistical physics models. We start by reviewing the two approaches, and then show how one can use the former to get new insight on the latter. We illustrate our method by solving a model of reaction-diffusion. An eigenvector for the transfer matrix for the XXZ spin chain with non-diagonal boundary is also obtained using a matrix ansatz.
