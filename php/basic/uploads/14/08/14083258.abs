Title: Modified light cone condition via vacuum polarization in a time  dependent field
Authors: Huayu Hu and Jie Huang
Abstract: The appearance of unconventional vacuum properties in intense fields has long been an active field of research. In this paper the vacuum polarization effect is investigated via a pump probe scheme of a probe light propagating in the vacuum excited by two counter-propagating laser beams. The modified light cone condition of the probe light is derived analytically for the situation that it passes through the electric/magnetic antinode plane of the pump field. The derivation does not follow the commonly adopted assumption of treating the pump field as a constant field. Differences from the conventional light cone conditions are identified. The implications of the result are discussed with a consideration of the vacuum birefringence measurement.
