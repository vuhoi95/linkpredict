Title: Higgs inflation from Standard Model criticality
Authors: Yuta Hamada and Hikaru Kawai and Kin-ya Oda and Seong Chan Park
Abstract: The observed Higgs mass $M_H=125.9\pm0.4$GeV leads to the criticality of the Standard Model, that is, the Higgs potential becomes flat around the scale $10^{17\text{--}18}$GeV for the top mass $171.3$GeV. Earlier we have proposed a Higgs inflation scenario in which this criticality plays a crucial role. In this paper, we investigate detailed cosmological predictions of this scenario in light of the latest Planck and BICEP2 results. We find that this scenario can be consistent with the constraint from the running index too. We also compute the Higgs one-loop effective potential including the Higgs portal scalar dark matter, with the two-loop renormalization group equations and find a constraint on the coupling between Higgs and dark matter depending on the inflationary parameters.
