Title: Hawking Radiation from Elko Particles Tunnelling across Black Strings  Horizon
Authors: Roldao da Rocha and J. M. Hoff da Silva
Abstract: We apply the tunnelling method for the emission and absorption of Elko particles in the event horizon of a black string solution. We show that Elko particles are emitted at the expected Hawking temperature from black strings, but with a quite different signature with respect to the Dirac particles. We employ the Hamilton-Jacobi technique to black hole tunnelling, by applying the WKB approximation to the coupled system of Dirac-like equations governing the Elko particle dynamics. As a typical signature, different Elko particles are shown to produce the same standard Hawking temperature for black strings. However we prove that they present the same probability irrespective of outgoing or ingoing the black hole horizon. It provides a typical signature for mass dimension one fermions, that is different from the mass dimension three halves fermions inherent to Dirac particles, as different Dirac spinor fields have distinct inward and outward probability of tunnelling.
