Title: N=2* Super-Yang-Mills Theory at Strong Coupling
Authors: Xinyi Chen-Lin and James Gordon and Konstantin Zarembo
Abstract: The planar N=2* Super-Yang-Mills (SYM) theory is solved at large 't Hooft coupling using localization on S(4). The solution permits detailed investigation of the resonance phenomena responsible for quantum phase transitions in infinite volume, and leads to quantitative predictions for the semiclassical string dual of the N=2* theory.
