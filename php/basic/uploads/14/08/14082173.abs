Abstract: In this paper, we carefully investigate the holographic fluids at the finite cutoff surface by considering different boundary conditions in the scenario of gravity/fluid correspondence. For the simplicity, we just perturb the Schwarzschild-AdS black brane. We find that the boundary condition is critical to explicitly express the apparent degeneracy between bulk viscosity and perturbation of the pressure for the holographic fluid, i.e. setting the boundary condition at the finite cutoff surface $h'(r_c)$ as an arbitrary constant (here $h(r)$ is related to the scalar perturbation mode of metric, i.e. $g^{(1)}_{vr}$). In addition, we also find a method to break this apparent degeneracy through studies of the sound velocity. Moreover, we further investigate the more general boundary condition case with $h(r_c)\neq 0$ by using this method. In this more general case, although two parameters $C_{h1}$ and $C_{h2}$ cannot be fixed now and the formula of general stress tensor becomes more complicate, it is surprised that one can still extract the exact information of transport coefficients by using this degeneracy method. In addition, we also obtain that the bulk viscosity is still zero in this more general case, which implicates that the bulk viscosity may be independent on the boundary condition $h(r_c)$.
