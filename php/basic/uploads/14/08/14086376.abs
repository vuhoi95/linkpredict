Title: N-flation in Supergravity
Authors: Kumar Das and Koushik Dutta
Abstract: We have constructed a large field N-flation model in the supergravity framework. In this simple set-up, N fields collectively drive inflation where each field traverses sub-Planckian field values. This has been realised with a generalisation of the single field chaotic inflation in Supergravity. Interestingly, despite of the presence of the field interactions, the dynamics can be described in terms of an effective single field. The observable predictions of our model i.e. tensor to scalar ratio r and scalar spectral index n_s are akin to the chaotic inflation.
