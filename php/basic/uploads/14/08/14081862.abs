Title: Feynman integrals and iterated integrals on moduli spaces of curves of  genus zero
Authors: Christian Bogner and Francis Brown
Abstract: This paper describes algorithms for the exact symbolic computation of period integrals on moduli spaces $\mathcal{M}_{0,n}$ of curves of genus $0$ with $n$ ordered marked points, and applications to the computation of Feynman integrals.
