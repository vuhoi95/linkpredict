Title: Horava-Lifshitz Black Hole Hydrodynamics
Authors: Christopher Eling and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We consider the holographic hydrodynamics of black holes in generally covariant gravity theories with a preferred time foliation. Gravitational perturbations in these theories have spin two and spin zero helicity modes with generically different speeds. The black hole solutions possess a spacelike causal boundary called the universal horizon. We relate the flux of the spin zero perturbation across the universal horizon to the new dissipative transport in Lifshitz field theory hydrodynamics found in arXiv:1304.7481. We construct in detail the hydrodynamics of one such black hole solution, and calculate the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density.
