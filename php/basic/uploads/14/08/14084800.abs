Title: Canonical Formulation of $O(N)$ Vector/Higher Spin Correspondence
Authors: Robert de Mello Koch and Antal Jevicki and Jo√£o P. Rodrigues and Junggi Yoon
Abstract: We discuss the canonical structure of the collective formulation of Vector Model/Higher Spin Duality in AdS$_4$. This involves a construction of bulk AdS Higher Spin fields through a time-like bi-local Map, with a Hamiltonian and canonical structure which are established to all orders in $1/N$.
