Title: A supersymmetric black lens
Authors: Hari K. Kunduri and James Lucietti
Abstract: We present a new supersymmetric, asymptotically flat, black hole solution to five-dimensional supergravity. It is regular on and outside an event horizon of lens space topology L(2,1). It is the first example of an asymptotically flat black hole with lens space topology. The solution is characterised by a charge, two angular momenta and a magnetic flux through a non-contractible disc region ending on the horizon, with one constraint relating these.
