Title: Synthetic versus Dirac monopoles
Authors: Carl M. Bender and Maarten DeKieviet and K. A. Milton
Abstract: In some recent experiments the distinction between synthetic magnetic monopoles and Dirac monopoles has been blurred. A case in point is the work in a letter by Ray {\it et al.} [arXiv:1408.3133] in which a beautiful experiment is reported but claims with regard to Dirac monopoles are misleading.
