Title: Black Holes in AdS/BCFT and Fluid/Gravity Correspondence
Authors: Javier M. Mag√°n and Dmitry Melnikov and Madson R. O. Silva
Abstract: A proposal to describe gravity duals of conformal theories with boundaries (AdS/BCFT correspondence) was put forward by Takayanagi few years ago. However interesting solutions describing field theories at finite temperature and charge density are still lacking. In this paper we describe a class of theories with boundary, which admit black hole type gravity solutions. The theories are specified by stress-energy tensors that reside on the extensions of the boundary to the bulk. From this perspective AdS/BCFT appears analogous to the fluid/gravity correspondence. Among the class of the boundary extensions there is a special (integrable) one, for which the stress-energy tensor is fluid-like. We discuss features of that special solution as well as its thermodynamic properties.
