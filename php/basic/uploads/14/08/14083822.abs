Title: Solitonic traveling waves in Galileon theory
Authors: D. Bazeia and L. Losano and J. L. R. Santos
Abstract: This work deals with traveling waves in the two-dimensional Galileon theory. We use the Hirota procedure to calculate one-Galileon, two-Galileon, three-Galileon and breather-like Galileon solutions in the theory under consideration. The results offer strong evidence that the Galileon traveling waves are solitons, and that the Galileon theory is integrable.
