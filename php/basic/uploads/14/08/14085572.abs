Abstract: We describe a method to determine the anomaly polynomials of general 6d $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ and $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ SCFTs, in terms of the anomaly matching on their tensor branches. This method is almost purely field theoretical, and can be applied to all known 6d SCFTs. We demonstrate our method in many concrete examples, including $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ theories of arbitrary type and the theories on M5 branes on ALE singularities, reproducing the $N^3$ behavior. We check the results against the anomaly polynomials computed M-theoretically via the anomaly inflow.
