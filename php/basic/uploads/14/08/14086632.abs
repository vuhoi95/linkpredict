Abstract: In this paper, the thermalization has been studied holographically. Explicitly in the gravity side, we consider the gravitational collapse of a thin shell of dust in a spacetime dominated by quintessence dark energy. With the thermalization probes such as the normalized geodesic length and minimal area surface, we study the effect of the state parameter for the quintessence dark energy on the thermalization. Our results show that the smaller the state parameter of quintessence is, the harder the plasma to thermalize. We also investigate the thermalization velocity and thermalization acceleration. We hope our results here can shed light on the nature of the quintessence dark energy.
