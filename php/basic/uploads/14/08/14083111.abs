Title: Effect of quintessence on the energy of the Reissner-Nordstrom black  hole
Authors: Ibrar Hussain and Sajid Ali
Abstract: The energy content of the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole surrounded by quintessence is investigated using approximate Lie symmetry methods. It is mainly done by assuming mass and charge of the black hole as small quantities ($\epsilon$), and by retaining its second power in the perturbed geodesic equations for such black hole while neglecting its higher powers. Due to the presence of trivial second-order approximate Lie symmetries of these perturbed geodesic equations, a rescaling of the geodetic parameter gives a rescaling of the energy in this black hole. Interestingly we obtain an explicit relation of the rescaling factor that depends on the square of the charge to mass ratio of the black hole, the normalization factor $\alpha$, which is related to the state parameter of the quintessence matter, and the coordinate $r$. A comparison of this rescaling factor with that of the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole (Hussain et. al SIGMA, 2007), without quintessence is given. It is observed that the presence of the quintessence field reduces the energy in this black hole spacetime. Further it is found that there exists a point outside the event horizon of this black hole where the effect of quintessence balances the energy content in this black hole without quintessence, and where the total energy of the underlying spacetime becomes zero.
