Title: C-metrics in Gauged STU Supergravity and Beyond
Authors: H. Lu and Justin F. Vazquez-Poritz
Abstract: We construct charged generalizations of the dilaton C-metric in various four-dimensional theories, including STU gauged supergravity as well as a one-parameter family of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theories whose scalar potential can be expressed in terms of a superpotential. In addition, we present time-dependent generalizations of the dilaton C-metric and dilaton Ernst solutions, for which the time evolution is driven by the dilaton. These C-metric solutions provide holographic descriptions of a strongly-coupled three-dimensional field theory on the background of a black hole, a gravitational soliton, and a black hole undergoing time evolution.
