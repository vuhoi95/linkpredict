Abstract: The possibility to construct inflationary models for the renormalization-group improved potentials corresponding to scalar electrodynamics and to $SU(2)$ and $SU(5)$ models is investigated. In all cases, the tree-level potential, which corresponds to the cosmological constant in the Einstein frame, is seen to be non-suitable for inflation. Rather than adding the Hilbert-Einstein term to the action, quantum corrections to the potential, coming from to the RG-equation, are included. The inflationary scenario is analyzed with unstable de Sitter solutions which correspond to positive values of the coupling function, only. We show that, for the finite $SU(2)$ model and $SU(2)$ gauge model, there are no de Sitter solutions suitable for inflation, unless exit from it occurs according to some weird, non-standard scenarios. Inflation is realized both for scalar electrodynamics and for $SU(5)$ RG-improved potentials, and the corresponding values of the coupling function are seen to be positive. It is shown that, for quite reasonable values of the parameters, the inflationary models obtained both from scalar electrodynamics and from the $SU(5)$ RG-improved potentials, are in good agreement with the most recent observational data coming from the Planck2013 and BICEP2 collaborations.
