Title: Two scalar field cosmology: Conservation laws and exact solutions
Authors: Andronikos Paliathanasis and Michael Tsamparlis
Abstract: We consider the two scalar field cosmology in a FRW spatially flat spacetime where the scalar fields interact both in the kinetic part and the potential. We apply the Noether point symmetries in order to define the interaction of the scalar fields. We use the point symmetries in order to write the field equations in the normal coordinates and we find that the Lagrangian of the field equations which admits at least three Noether point symmetries describes linear Newtonian systems. Furthermore, by using the corresponding conservation laws we find exact solutions of the field equations. Finally, we generalize our results to the case of N scalar fields interacting both in their potential and their kinematic part in a flat FRW background.
