Title: Journey to the Center of the Fuzzball
Authors: Fang Chen and Ben Michel and Joseph Polchinski and Andrea Puhm
Abstract: We study two-charge fuzzball geometries, with attention to the use of the proper duality frame. For zero angular momentum there is an onion-like structure, and the smooth D1-D5 geometries are not valid for typical states. Rather, they are best approximated by geometries with stringy sources, or by a free CFT. For non-zero angular momentum we find a regime where smooth fuzzball solutions are the correct description. Our analysis rests on the comparison of three radii: the typical fuzzball radius, the entropy radius determined by the microscopic theory, and the breakdown radius where the curvature becomes large. We attempt to draw more general lessons.
