Title: Small Field Coleman-Weinberg Inflation driven by Fermion Condensate
Authors: Satoshi Iso and Kazunori Kohri and Kengo Shimada
Abstract: We revisit the small field Coleman-Weinberg (CW) inflation, which has the following two problems. First, the smallness of the slow roll parameter $\epsilon$ requires the inflation scale to be very low. Second, the spectral index $n_s \approx1+2 \eta$ tends to become smaller compared to the observed value. In this letter, we consider two possible effects on the dynamics of inflation: radiatively generated non-minimal coupling to gravity $\xi \phi^2 {\cal R}$ and condensation of fermions coupled to the inflaton as $\phi \bar\psi \psi$. We show that the fermion condenate can solve the above problems.
