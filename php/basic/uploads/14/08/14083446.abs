Title: Coupling the Sorkin-Johnston State to Gravity
Authors: Nicolás Avilán and Andrés F. Reyes-Lega and Bruno Carneiro da Cunha
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of the Sorkin-Johnston (SJ) state for a massless scalar field in two dimensions. We conduct a study of the renormalized stress-tensor by a subtraction procedure, and compare the results with those of the conformal vacuum, with an important contribution from correction term. We find a large trace anomaly and compute backreaction effects to two dimensional (Liouville) gravity. We find a natural interpretation for the mirror behavior of the SJ state described in previous works.
