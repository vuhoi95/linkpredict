Title: Present accelerated expansion of the universe from new Weyl-Integrable  gravity approach
Authors: Ricardo Aguila and Jos√© Edgar Madriz Aguilar and Claudia Moreno and Mauricio Bellini
Abstract: We investigate if a recently introduced formulation of general relativity on a Weyl-integrable geometry, contains cosmological solutions exhibiting acceleration in the present cosmic expansion. We derive the general conditions to have acceleration in the expansion of the universe and obtain a particular solution for the Weyl scalar field describing a cosmological model for the present time in concordance with the data combination Planck + WP + BAO + SN.
