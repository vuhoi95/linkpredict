Title: Hawking-Page transition in holographic massive gravity
Authors: Allan Adams and Daniel A. Roberts and Omid Saremi
Abstract: We study the Hawking-Page transition in a holographic model of field theories with momentum dissipation. We find that the deconfinement temperature strictly decreases as momentum dissipation is increased. For sufficiently strong momentum dissipation, the critical temperature goes to zero, indicating a zero-temperature deconfinement transition in the dual field theory.
