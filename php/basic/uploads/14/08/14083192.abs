Title: Tachyon field inflation in the light of BICEP2
Authors: Kourosh Nozari and Narges Rashidi
Abstract: We study tachyon field inflation in the light of the Planck+WMAP+BICEP2+BAO joint data. While the minimally coupled tachyon field inflation is consistent with the Planck2013 data, it is not confirmed by the Planck+WMAP+BICEP2+BAO dataset. However, a nonminimally coupled tachyon field inflation is consistent with this joint dataset.
