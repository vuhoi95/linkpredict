Title: Dynamical and Quenched Random Matrices and Homolumo Gap
Authors: Ivan Andric and Larisa Jonke and Danijel Jurman and Holger Bech Nielsen
Abstract: We consider a rather general type of matrix model, in which the fluctuations of the matrix are partly given by some fundamental randomness and partly dynamically, even quantum mechanically. We then study the homolumo-gap effect, which means that we study how the level density gets attenuated near the Fermi surface, while considering the matrix as the Hamiltonian matrix for a single fermion interacting with this matrix. In the case of the quenched randomness (the fundamental one) dominating the quantum mechanical one and not too small coupling to the fermions we calculate the homolumo gap that in the first approximation consists of there being essentially no levels for the a single fermion between two steep gap boundaries. The filled and empty level densities are in this first approximation just pushed, each to its side. In the next approximation these steep drops in the spectral density are smeared out to have an error-function shape. The studied model could be considered as a first step towards the more general case of considering a whole field of matrices - defined say on some phase space - rather than a single matrix.
