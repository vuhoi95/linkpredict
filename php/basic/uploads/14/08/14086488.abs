Title: Petrov type I Condition and Rindler Fluid in Vacuum  Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity
Authors: Rong-Gen Cai and Qing Yang and Yun-Long Zhang
Abstract: Recently the Petrov type I condition is introduced to reduce the degrees of freedom in the extrinsic curvature of a timelike hypersurface to the degrees of freedom in the dual Rindler fluid in Einstein gravity. In this paper we show that the Petrov type I condition holds for the solutions of vacuum Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity up to the second order in the relativistic hydrodynamic expansion. On the other hand, if imposing the Petrov type I condition and Hamiltonian constraint on a finite cutoff hypersurface, the stress tensor of the relativistic Rindler fluid in vacuum Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity can be recovered with correct first order and second order transport coefficients.
