Title: Dynamics of Generalized Tachyon Field in Teleparallel Gravity
Authors: Behnaz Fazlpour and Ali Banijamali
Abstract: We study dynamics of generalized tachyon scalar field in the framework of teleparallel gravity. This model is an extension of tachyonic teleparallel dark energy model which has been proposed in [26]. In contrast with tachyonic teleparallel dark energy model that has no scaling attractors, here we find some scaling attractors which means that the cosmological coincidence problem can be alleviated. Scaling attractors present for both interacting and non-interacting dark energy, dark matter cases.
