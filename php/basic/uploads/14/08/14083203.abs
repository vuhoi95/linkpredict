Title: Quantum Extremal Surfaces: Holographic Entanglement Entropy beyond the  Classical Regime
Authors: Netta Engelhardt and Aron C. Wall
Abstract: We propose that holographic entanglement entropy can be calculated at arbitrary orders in the bulk Planck constant using the concept of a "quantum extremal surface": a surface which extremizes the generalized entropy, i.e. the sum of area and bulk entanglement entropy. At leading order in bulk quantum corrections, our proposal agrees with the formula of Faulkner, Lewkowycz, and Maldacena, which was derived only at this order; beyond leading order corrections, the two conjectures diverge. Quantum extremal surfaces lie outside the causal domain of influence of the boundary region as well as its complement, and in some spacetimes there are barriers preventing them from entering certain regions. We comment on the implications for bulk reconstruction.
