Title: Higher Derivative Corrections and Central Charges from Wrapped M5-branes

Abstract: We compute four-derivative corrections to the AdS supergravity actions arising from the near-horizon geometry of N M5-branes wrapped on either one or two Riemann surfaces. This setup features the novel presence of both gauged isometries as well as nontrivial hypermultiplets. We argue that the 5d Chern-Simons terms receive not only higher-derivative corrections but also contributions from Killing vector parameters, which we find must also be corrected. We check the central charges found by our supergravity methods against the dual field theory results and find perfect agreement at leading and subleading order in N. Along the way, we find higher derivative corrections to general AdS_5 and AdS_3x\Sigma_g geometries.
