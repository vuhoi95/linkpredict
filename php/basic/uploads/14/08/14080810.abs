Title: Galilean Conformal Electrodynamics
Authors: Arjun Bagchi and Rudranil Basu and Aditya Mehra
Abstract: Maxwell's Electrodynamics admits two distinct Galilean limits called the Electric and Magnetic limits. We show that the equations of motion in both these limits are invariant under the Galilean Conformal Algebra in D=4, thereby exhibiting non-relativistic conformal symmetries. Remarkably, the symmetries are infinite dimensional and thus Galilean Electrodynamics give us the first example of an infinitely extended Galilean Conformal Field Theory in D>2. We examine details of the theory by looking at purely non-relativistic conformal methods and also use input from the limit of the relativistic theory.
