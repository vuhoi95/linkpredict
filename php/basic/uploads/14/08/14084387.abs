Title: Dark matter in a bouncing universe
Authors: Yeuk Kwan E. Cheung and Jin U Kang and Changhong Li
Abstract: We investigate a new scenario of dark matter production in a bouncing universe, in which dark matter was produced completely out of equilibrium in the contracting as well as expanding phase. We explore possibilities of using dark matter as a probe of the bouncing universe, focusing on the relationship between a critical temperature of the bouncing universe and the present relic abundance of dark matter.
