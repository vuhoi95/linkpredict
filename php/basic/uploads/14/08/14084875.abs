Title: Illustrating SUSY breaking effects on various inflation mechanisms
Authors: Hiroyuki Abe and Shuntaro Aoki and Fuminori Hasegawa and Yusuke Yamada
Abstract: We consider the supersymmetry breaking effects on typical inflation models with different types of K\"ahler potential. The critical size of supersymmetry-breaking scale, above which the flatness of the inflaton potential is spoiled, drastically changes model by model. We present the universal description of such effects in terms of a field-dependent scaling factor by which gravity-mediated supersymmetry breaking terms are suppressed or enhanced, based on the conformal supergravity framework. Such a description would be useful when we estimate them in constructing supersymmetric models of particle cosmology.
