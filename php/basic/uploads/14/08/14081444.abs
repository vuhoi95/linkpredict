Title: Modelling the Evaporation of Non-singular Black Holes
Authors: Tim Taves and Gabor Kunstatter
Abstract: We present a model for studying the formation and evaporation of non-singular (quantum corrected) black holes. The model is based on a generalized form of the dimensionally reduced, spherically symmetric Einstein--Hilbert action and includes a suitably generalized Polyakov action to provide a mechanism for radiation back-reaction. The equations of motion describing self-gravitating scalar field collapse are derived in local form both in null co--ordinates and in Painleve--Gullstrand (flat slice) co--ordinates. They provide the starting point for numerical studies of complete spacetimes containing dynamical horizons that bound a compact trapped region. Such spacetimes have been proposed in the past as solutions to the information loss problem because they possess neither an event horizon nor a singularity. Since the equations of motion in our model are derived from a diffeomorphism invariant action they preserve the constraint algebra and the resulting energy momentum tensor is manifestly conserved.
