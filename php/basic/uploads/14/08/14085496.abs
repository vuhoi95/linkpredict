Title: $ œÅ$ meson-nucleon coupling constant from the soft-wall AdS/QCD model
Authors: Narmin Huseynova and Shahin Mamedov
Abstract: In the framework of the soft-wall model of AdS/QCD we calculated the $\rho$ meson nucleon coupling constant. Bulk-to boundary propagators for the free vector and spinor fields are presented, whose boundary values correspond to $\rho$ meson and to the nucleon respectively. The interaction Lagrangian between these fields is written in the bulk of AdS space and includes magnetic type interactions as well. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence from the bulk interaction action we derived the $g_{\rho NN}$ coupling constant in the boundary QCD. We found that the soft-wall model result for the $g_{\rho NN}$ constant is more close to empirical values than the one obtained in the hard-wall model.
