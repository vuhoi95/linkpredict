Title: Critical behavior of lattice Schwinger model with topological term at  $θ=π$ using Grassmann tensor renormalization group
Authors: Yuya Shimizu and Yoshinobu Kuramashi
Abstract: Lattice regularized Schwinger model with a so-called $\theta$ term is studied by using the Grassmann tensor renormalization group. We perform the Lee-Yang and Fisher zero analyses in order to investigate the phase structure at $\theta=\pi$. We find a first order phase transition at larger fermion mass. Both of the Lee-Yang zero and Fisher zero analyses indicate that the critical endpoint at which the first order phase transition terminates belongs to the Ising universality class.
