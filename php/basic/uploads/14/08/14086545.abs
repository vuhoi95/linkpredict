Title: New ${\cal N} = 1$ supersymmetric $AdS_5$ backgrounds in Type IIA  supergravity
Authors: Konstadinos Sfetsos and Daniel C. Thompson
Abstract: We present a family of N=1 supersymmetric backgrounds in type-IIA supergravity and their lifts to eleven-dimensional supergravity. These are of the form $AdS_5 \times X^5$ and are characterised by an $SU(2)$ structure. The internal space, $X^5$, is obtained from the known Sasaki-Einstein manifolds, $Y^{p,q}$, via an application of non-Abelian T-duality.
