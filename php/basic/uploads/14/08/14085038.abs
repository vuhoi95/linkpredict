Title: Elementary modes of coupled oscillators with balanced loss and gain
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Pradip Mukherjee
Abstract: We obtain the elementary modes of a system of parity-time reversal ( PT ) - symmetric coupled oscillators with balanced loss and gain . These modes are used to give a physical picture of the phase transition recently reported in experiments with whispering - gallery microresonators.
