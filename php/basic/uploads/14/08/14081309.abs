Title: Infra-red Abelian dominance without Abelian-projection
Authors: Haresh Raval and Urjit A. Yajnik
Abstract: Maximal Abelian gauge has been a particular choice to study dynamical generation of off-diagonal gluon masses in QCD. This gauge is a special case of Abelian projection. Massive off-diagonal gluons are considered a clue to Abelian dominance. Here we propose a gauge condition which is quadratic in fields and which does not fall in the class of Abelian projection. However it does generate off-diagonal gluon masses dynamically thus hinting at Abelian dominance in this gauge too.
