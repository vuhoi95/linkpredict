Title: Gravity dual of spin and charge density waves
Authors: Niko Jokela and Matti Jarvinen and Matthew Lippert
Abstract: At high enough charge density, the homogeneous state of the D3-D7' model is unstable to fluctuations at nonzero momentum. We investigate the end point of this instability, finding a spatially modulated ground state, which is a charge and spin density wave. We analyze the phase structure of the model as a function of chemical potential and magnetic field and find the phase transition from the homogeneous state to be first order, with a second-order critical point at zero magnetic field.
