Title: Schrodinger Holography for z<2
Authors: Tomas Andrade and Cynthia Keeler and Alex Peach and Simon F. Ross
Abstract: We investigate holography for asymptotically Schrodinger spacetimes, using a frame formalism. Our dictionary is based on the anisotropic scaling symmetry. We consider z <2, where the holographic dictionary is cleaner; we make some comments on z=2. We propose a definition of asymptotically locally Schrodinger spacetime where the leading components of the frame fields provide suitable geometric boundary data. We show that an asymptotic expansion exists for generic boundary data satisfying our boundary conditions for z<2.
