Title: Yukawas and discrete symmetries in F-theory compactifications without  section
Authors: Iñaki García-Etxebarria and Thomas W. Grimm and Jan Keitel
Abstract: In the case of F-theory compactifications on genus-one fibrations without section there are naturally appearing discrete symmetries, which we argue to be associated to geometrically massive U(1) gauge symmetries. These discrete symmetries are shown to induce non-trivial selection rules for the allowed Yukawa couplings in SU(N) gauge theories. The general discussion is exemplified using a concrete Calabi-Yau fourfold realizing an SU(5) GUT model. We observe that M2 instanton effects appear to play a key role in the generation of new superpotential terms and in the dynamics close to phase transition loci.
