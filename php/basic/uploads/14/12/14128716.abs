Title: Collective Field Theory for Quantum Hall States
Authors: M. Laskin and T. Can and P. Wiegmann
Abstract: We develop a collective field theory for fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states. We show that in the leading approximation for a large number of particles, the properties of Laughlin states are captured by a Gaussian free field theory with a (filling fraction dependent) background charge. Gradient corrections to the Gaussian field theory arise from ultraviolet regularization. They are the origin of the gravitational anomaly and are described by the Liouville theory of quantum gravity. The field theory simplifies the computation of correlation functions in FQH states and makes manifest the effect of quantum anomalies.
