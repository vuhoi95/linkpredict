Title: Interacting Holographic Extended Chaplygin Gas and Phantom Cosmology in  the Light of BICEP2
Authors: J. Sadeghi and H. Farahani and B. Pourhassan
Abstract: In this paper, we study the holographic dark energy density and interacting extended Chaplygin gas energy density in the Einstein gravity. We reconstruct the scalar field and the scalar potential describing the extended Chaplygin gas. In the special case, we obtain energy density and investigate some cosmological parameters. Assuming interaction between components we find energy density for some different parametrization of total EoS. We analyze tensor to scalar ratio and use recent observational data of BICEP2 to fix the model parameters.
