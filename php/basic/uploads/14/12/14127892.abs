Title: Dyonic non-Abelian vortex strings in supersymmetric and  non-supersymmetric theories: tensions and higher derivative corrections
Authors: Minoru Eto and Yoshihide Murakami
Abstract: Dyonic non-Abelian local/semi-global vortex strings are studied in detail in supersymmetric/non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills-Higgs theories. While the BPS tension formula is known to be the same as that for the BPS dyonic instanton, we find that the non-BPS tension formula is approximated very well by the well-known tension formula of the BPS dyon. We show that this mysterious tension formula for the dyonic non-BPS vortex stings can be understood from the perspective of a low energy effective field theory. Furthermore, we propose an efficient method to obtain an effective theory of a single vortex string, which includes not only lower derivative terms but also all order derivative corrections by making use of the tension formula. We also find a novel dyonic vortex string whose internal orientation vectors rotate in time and spiral along the string axis.
