Title: The sl(N) twisted Yangian: bulk-boundary scattering & defects
Authors: Jean Avan and Anastasia Doikou and Nikos Karaiskos
Abstract: We consider the sl(N) twisted Yangian quantum spin chain. In particular, we study the bulk and boundary scattering of the model via the solution of the Bethe ansatz equations in the thermodynamic limit. Local defects are also implemented in the model and the associated transmission amplitudes are derived through the relevant Bethe ansatz equations.
