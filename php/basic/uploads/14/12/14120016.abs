Title: Towards holographic higher-spin interactions: Four-point functions and  higher-spin exchange
Authors: Xavier Bekaert and Johanna Erdmenger and Dmitry Ponomarev and Charlotte Sleight
Abstract: Within holography, we calculate the contribution of an arbitrary spin-s gauge boson exchange in $AdS_{d+1}$ to the four-point function with scalar operators on the boundary. As an important ingredient, we first compute the complete bulk-to-bulk propagators for massless bosonic higher-spin fields in the metric-like formulation, in any dimension and in various gauges. The split representation of the bulk-to-bulk propagators in terms of bulk-to-boundary propagators allows to present the higher-spin exchange diagram in the form of a conformal partial wave expansion. Our results provide a step towards the larger goal of the holographic reconstruction of bulk interactions, and of clarifying bulk locality.
