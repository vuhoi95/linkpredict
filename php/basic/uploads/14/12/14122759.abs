Title: Permutation orbifolds and holography
Authors: Felix M. Haehl and Mukund Rangamani
Abstract: Two dimensional conformal field theories with large central charge and a sparse low-lying spectrum are expected to admit a classical string holographic dual. We construct a large class of such theories employing permutation orbifold technology. In particular, we describe the group theoretic constraints on permutation groups to ensure a (stringy) holographic CFT. The primary result we uncover is that in order for the degeneracy of states to be finite in the large central charge limit, the groups of interest are the so-called oligomorphic permutation groups. Further requiring that the low-lying spectrum be sparse enough puts a bound on the number of orbits of these groups (on finite element subsets). Along the way we also study familiar cyclic and symmetric orbifolds to build intuition. We also demonstrate how holographic spectral properties are tied to the geometry of covering spaces for permutation orbifolds.
