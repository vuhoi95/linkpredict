Abstract: The spectral dimension $d_s$ for high energies is calculated using the Relativistic Schr\"{o}dinger Equation Analytically Continued (RSEAC) instead of the so-called Telegraph's Equation (TE), in both ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) regimens. Regarding the TE, the recent literature presents difficulties related to its stochastic derivation and interpretation, advocating the use of the RSEAC to properly describe the relativistic diffusion phenomena. Taking into account that the Lorentz symmetry is broken in UV regime at Lifshitz point, we show that there exists a degeneracy in very high energies, meaning that both the RSEAC and the TE correctly describe the diffusion processes at these energy scales, at least under the spectral dimension criterion. In fact, both the equations yield the same result, namely, $d_s = 2$, a dimensional reduction that is compatible with several theories of quantum gravity. This result is reached even when one takes into account a cosmological model - the De Sitter one - for a flat Universe. On the other hand, in the IR regimen, such degeneracy is lifted in favor of the approach via TE, due to the fact that only this equation provides the correct value for $d_s$, which is equal to the actual number of spacetime dimensions, i. e., $d_s = 4$, while RSEAC furnishes $d_s=3$, so that a diffusing particle described by this latter experiences a three-dimensional spacetime.
