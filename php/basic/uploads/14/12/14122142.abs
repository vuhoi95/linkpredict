Abstract: We propose and demonstrate a test of Lorentz symmetry based on new, compact, and reliable quartz oscillator technology. Violations of Lorentz invariance in the matter and photon-sector of the standard model extension (SME) generate anisotropies in particles' inertial masses and the elastic constants, giving rise to measurable anisotopies in the resonance frequencies of acoustic modes in solids. A first realization of such a "phonon-sector" test of Lorentz symmetry using room-temperature SC-cut crystals provides a limit of $\tilde c_Q^{\rm n}=(-1.8 \pm 2.2)\times 10^{-14}$\,GeV on the most weakly constrained neutron-sector $c-$coefficient of the SME. Future experiments with cryogenic oscillators promise significant improvements in accuracy, opening up the potential for improved limits on Lorentz violation in the neutron, proton, electron and photon sector.
