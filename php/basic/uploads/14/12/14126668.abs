Title: A HHL 3-point correlation function in the Î·-deformed AdS_5 x S^5
Authors: Changrim Ahn and Plamen Bozhilov
Abstract: We derive the 3-point correlation function between two giant magnons heavy string states and the light dilaton operator with zero momentum in the \eta-deformed AdS_5 x S^5 valid for any J_1 and \eta in the semiclassical limit. We show that this result satisfies a consistency relation between the 3-point correlation function and the conformal dimension of the giant magnon. We also provide a leading finite J_1 correction explicitly.
