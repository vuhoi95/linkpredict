Title: Conformal field theories in $d=4$ with a helical twist
Authors: Aristomenis Donos and Jerome P. Gauntlett and Christiana Pantelidou
Abstract: Within the context of holography we study the general class of $d=4$ conformal field theories after applying a universal helical deformation. At finite temperature we construct the associated black hole solutions of Einstein gravity, numerically, by exploiting a Bianchi $VII_0$ ansatz for the bulk $D=5$ metric. At $T=0$ we show that they flow in the IR to exactly the same CFT. The deformation gives rise to a finite, non-zero DC thermal conductivity along the axis of the helix, which we determine analytically in terms of black hole horizon data. We also calculate the AC thermal conductivity along this axis and show that it exhibits Drude-like peaks.
