Title: N=1 super sinh-Gordon model with defects revisited
Authors: A. R. Aguirre and J. F. Gomes and N. I. Spano and A. H. Zimerman
Abstract: The Lax pair formalism is considered to discuss the integrability of the N=1 supersymmetric sinh-Gordon model with a defect. We derive associated defect matrix for the model and construct the generating functions of the modified conserved quantities. The corresponding defect contributions for the modified energy and momentum of the model are explicitly computed.
