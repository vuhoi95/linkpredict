Title: Bi-conformal symmetry and static Green functions in the  higher-dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom spacetimes
Authors: Valeri P. Frolov and Andrei Zelnikov
Abstract: We study a static scalar massless field created by a source located near an electrically charged higher dimensional spherically symmetric black hole. We demonstrated that there exist bi-conformal transformations relating static field solutions in the metric with different parameters of the mass M and charge Q. Using this symmetry we obtain the static scalar Green function in the higher dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom spacetimes.
