Title: 3D Gravity, Chern-Simons and Higher Spins: A Mini Introduction
Authors: K. Surya Kiran and Chethan Krishnan and Avinash Raju
Abstract: These are notes of introductory lectures on (a) elements of 2+1 dimensional gravity, (b) some aspects of its relation to Chern-Simons theory, (c) its generalization to couple higher spins, and (d) cosmic singularity resolution as an application in the context of flat space higher spin theory. A knowledge of the Einstein-Hilbert action, classical non-Abelian gauge theory and some (negotiable amount of) maturity are the only pre-requisites.
