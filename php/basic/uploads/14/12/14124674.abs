Title: Torsion gravity with non-minimally coupled fermionic field: some  cosmological models
Authors: Stefano Vignolo and Sante Carloni and Luca Fabbri
Abstract: We investigate some cosmological models arising from a non-minimal coupling of a fermionic field to gravity in the geometrical setting of Einstein-Cartan-Sciama-Kibble gravity. The role played by the non-minimal coupling together with torsion in facing problems such as cosmological singularity, inflation and dark energy is discussed.
