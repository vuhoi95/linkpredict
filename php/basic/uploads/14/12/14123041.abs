Title: Connection between dark matter abundance and primordial tensor  perturbations
Authors: P. S. Bhupal Dev and Anupam Mazumdar and Saleh Qutub
Abstract: Primordial inflation and Dark Matter (DM) could both belong to the hidden sector. It is therefore plausible that the inflaton, which drives inflation, could couple to the DM either directly or indirectly, thus providing a common origin for both luminous and non-luminous matter. We explore this interesting possibility and show that, in certain scenarios, the DM mass can be correlated with the tensor-to-scalar ratio. This correlation might provide us with a window of opportunity for unravelling the properties of DM beyond the standard freeze-out paradigm.
