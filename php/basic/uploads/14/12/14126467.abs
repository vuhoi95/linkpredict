Title: Generalized Uncertainty Principle Corrections to the Simple Harmonic  Oscillator in Phase Space
Authors: Saurya Das and Matthew P. G. Robbins and Mark A. Walton
Abstract: We compute Wigner functions for the harmonic oscillator including corrections from generalized uncertainty principles (GUPs), and study the corresponding marginal probability densities and other properties. We show that the GUP corrections to the Wigner functions can be significant, and comment on their potential measurability in the laboratory.
