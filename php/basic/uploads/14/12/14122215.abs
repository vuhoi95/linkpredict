Title: Saha Equation in an Uniformly Accelerated Reference Frame and Some of  Its Physical Implications
Authors: Sanchari De and Somenath Chakrabarty
Abstract: The Saha equations for the photo-ionization of hydrogen atoms and the electron positron pair production at high temperature are obtained in a reference frame undergoing a uniform accelerated motion in an otherwise flat Minkowski space-time geometry. Some of the physical implications of our findings are discussed.
