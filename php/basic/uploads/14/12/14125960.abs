Title: Auxiliary tensor fields for Sp(2,R) self-duality
Authors: Evgeny A. Ivanov and Olaf Lechtenfeld and Boris M. Zupnik
Abstract: The coset Sp(2,R)/U(1) is parametrized by two real scalar fields. We generalize the formalism of auxiliary tensor (bispinor) fields in U(1) self-dual nonlinear models of abelian gauge fields to the case of Sp(2,R) self-duality. In this new formulation, Sp(2,R) duality of the nonlinear scalar-gauge equations of motion is equivalent to an Sp(2,R) invariance of the auxiliary interaction. We derive this result in two different ways, aiming at its further application to supersymmetric theories. We also consider an extension to interactions with higher derivatives.
