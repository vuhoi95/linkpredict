Title: Higgs criticality in a two-dimensional metal
Authors: Debanjan Chowdhury and Subir Sachdev
Abstract: We analyze a candidate theory for the strange metal near optimal hole-doping in the cuprate superconductors. The theory contains a quantum phase transition between metals with large and small Fermi surfaces of spinless fermions carrying the electromagnetic charge of the electron, but the transition does not directly involve any broken global symmetries. The two metals have emergent SU(2) and U(1) gauge fields respectively, and the transition is driven by the condensation of a real Higgs field, carrying a finite lattice momentum and an adjoint SU(2) gauge charge. This Higgs field measures the local antiferromagnetic correlations in a "rotating reference frame". We propose a global phase diagram around this Higgs transition, and describe its relationship to a variety of recent experiments on the cuprate superconductors.
