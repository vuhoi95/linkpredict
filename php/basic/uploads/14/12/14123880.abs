Title: Thermodynamic Geometry and Phase Transitions of Dyonic Charged AdS Black  Holes
Authors: Pankaj Chaturvedi and Anirban Das and Gautam Sengupta
Abstract: We investigate phase transitions and critical phenomena of four dimensional dyonic charged AdS black holes in the framework of thermodynamic geometry. In a mixed canonical grand canonical ensemble with a fixed electric charge and varying magnetic charge these black holes exhibit liquid gas like first order phase transition culminating in a second order critical point similar to the Van der Waals gas. We show that the thermodynamic scalar curvature R for these black holes follow our proposed geometrical characterization of the R-crossing Method for the first order liquid gas like phase transition and exhibits a divergence at the second order critical point. The pattern of R crossing and divergence exactly corresponds to those of a Van der Waals gas described by us in an earlier work.
