Title: Higher Spin Lifshitz Theory and Integrable Systems
Authors: Michael Gutperle and Yi Li
Abstract: In this note we construct asymptotically Lifshitz spacetimes in the Chern-Simons formulation of three dimensional higher spin gravity and relate the resulting theories to integrable systems which are elements of the KdV hierarchy.
