Title: Properties of Holographic Mesons on Dense Medium
Authors: Bum-Hoon Lee and Chanyong Park and Siyoung Nam
Abstract: We study the energy dispersions of holographic light mesons and their decay constants on dense nuclear medium. As the spatial momenta of mesons along the boundary direction increase, both observables of the mesons not only increase but also split according to the isospin charges. The decay constant of the negative meson is more large than that of the positive meson of the same type due to the chemical potentials of the background nucleons.
