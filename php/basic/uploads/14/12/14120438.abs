Title: Towards realistic models from Higher-Dimensional theories with Fuzzy  extra dimensions
Authors: D. Gavriil and G. Manolakos and G. Zoupanos
Abstract: We briefly review the Coset Space Dimensional Reduction (CSDR) programme and the best model constructed so far and then we present some details of the corresponding programme in the case that the extra dimensions are considered to be fuzzy. In particular, we present a four-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super Yang Mills Theory, orbifolded by $\mathbb{Z}_3$, which mimics the behaviour of a dimensionally reduced $\mathcal{N} = 1$, 10-dimensional gauge theory over a set of fuzzy spheres at intermediate high scales and leads to the trinification GUT $SU(3)^3$ at slightly lower, which in turn can be spontaneously broken to the MSSM in low scales.
