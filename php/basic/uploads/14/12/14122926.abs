Title: Integral pentagon relations for 3d superconformal indices
Authors: Ilmar Gahramanov and Hjalmar Rosengren
Abstract: The superconformal index of a three-dimensional supersymmetric field theory can be expressed in terms of basic hypergeometric integrals. By comparing the indices of dual theories, one can find new integral identities for basic hypergeometric integrals. Some of these integral identities have the form of the pentagon identity which can be interpreted as the 2-3 Pachner move for triangulated 3-manifolds.
