Authors: Qiu-Bo Cheng and Jing He and Su-Peng Kou
Abstract: Recently, Majorana fermions (MFs) have attracted intensive attention because of their possible non-Abelian statistics. This paper points out an approach to verify the non-Abelian statistics of MFs in topological superconductors. We introduce a single particle representation of braiding operators that obey anti-commutating relation of Bogolubov-de Gennes (BdG) states. From the relationship between the braiding operator of MFs and that of BdG states, we verify non-Abelian statistics of MFs in 1D and 2D topological SCs.
