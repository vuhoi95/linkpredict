Title: Tate's Algorithm for F-theory GUTs with two U(1)s
Authors: Craig Lawrie and Damiano Sacco
Abstract: We present a systematic study of elliptic fibrations for F-theory realizations of gauge theories with two U(1) factors. In particular, we determine a new class of SU(5) x U(1)^2 fibrations, which can be used to engineer Grand Unified Theories, with multiple, differently charged, 10 matter representations. To determine these models we apply Tate's algorithm to elliptic fibrations with two U(1) symmetries, which are realized in terms of a cubic in P^2. In the process, we find fibers which are not characterized solely in terms of vanishing orders, but with some additional specialization, which plays a key role in the construction of these novel SU(5) models with multiple 10 matter. We also determine a table of Tate-like forms for Kodaira fibers with two U(1)s.
