Title: No-go for tree level R-symmetry breaking
Authors: Feihu Liu and Muyang Liu and Zheng Sun
Abstract: We show that in gauge mediation models with tree level R-symmetry breaking where supersymmetry and R-symmetries are broken by different fields, the gaugino mass either vanishes or finds contribution from loop level R-symmetry breaking. Thus tree-level R-symmetry breaking is either no-go or redundant for phenomenology model building.
