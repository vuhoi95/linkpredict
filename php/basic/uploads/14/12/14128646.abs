Title: The classical Maxwell-Lorentz electrodynamics aspects of the electron  inertia problem within the Feynman proper time paradigm
Authors: Anatolij K. Prykarpatsky and Nikolai N. Bogolubov Jr
Abstract: The Maxwell electromagnetic and the Lorentz type force equations are derived in the framework of the R. Feynman proper time paradigm and the related vacuum field theory approach. The electron inertia problem is analyzed within the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms and the related pressure-energy compensation principle. The modified Abraham- Lorentz damping radiation force is derived, the electromagnetic electron mass origin is argued.
