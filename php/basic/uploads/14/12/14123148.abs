Title: Coarse Grained Quantum Dynamics
Authors: Cesar Agon and Vijay Balasubramanian and Skyler Kasko and Albion Lawrence
Abstract: We consider coarse graining a quantum system divided between short distance and long distance degrees of freedom, which are coupled by the Hamiltonian. Observations using purely long distance observables can be described by the reduced density matrix that arises from tracing out the short-distance observables. The dynamics of this density matrix is that of an open quantum system, and is nonlocal in time, on the order of some short time scale. We describe these dynamics in a model system with a simple hierarchy of energy gaps $\Delta E_{UV} > \Delta E_{IR}$, in which the coupling between high-and low-energy degrees of freedom is treated to second order in perturbation theory. We then describe the equations of motion under suitable time averaging, reflecting the limited time resolution of actual experiments, and find an expansion of the master equation in powers of $\Delta E_{IR}/\Delta E_{UV}$, in which the failure of the system to be Hamiltonian or even Markovian appears at higher orders in this ratio. We compute the evolution of the density matrix in two specific examples -- coupled spins, and linearly coupled simple harmonic oscillators. Finally, we discuss the evolution of the density matrix using the path integral approach, computing the Feynman-Vernon influence functional for the IR degrees of freedom in perturbation theory, and argue that this influence functional is the correct analog of the Wilsonian effective action for this problem.
