Title: Constraint on noncommutative spacetime from PLANCK data
Authors: Joby P. K. and Pravabati Chingangbam and Subinoy Das
Abstract: We constrain the energy scale of noncommutativity of spacetime using CMB data from PLANCK. We find that PLANCK data puts the lower bound on the noncommutativity energy scale to about 20 TeV, which is about a factor of two larger than a previous constraint that was obtained using data from WMAP, ACBAR and CBI. We further show that inclusion of data of $E$ mode of CMB polarization will not significantly change the constraint.
