Title: A Statistical Analysis of the Minimal SUSY B-L Theory
Authors: Burt A. Ovrut and Austin Purves and Sogee Spinner
Abstract: The structure of the B-L MSSM theory--specifically, the relevant mass scales and soft supersymmetric breaking parameters--is discussed. The space of initial soft parameters is explored at the high scale using random statistical sampling subject to a constraint on the range of dimensionful parameters. For every chosen initial point, the complete set of renormalization group equations is solved. The low energy results are then constrained to be consistent with present experimental data. It is shown that a large set of initial conditions satisfy these constraints and lead to acceptable low energy particle physics. Each such initial point has explicit predictions, such as the exact physical sparticle spectrum--which is presented for two such points. There are also statistical predictions for the masses of the sparticles and the LSP species which are displayed as histograms. Finally, the fine-tuning of the $\mu$ parameter--which is always equivalent to or smaller than in the MSSM--is discussed.
