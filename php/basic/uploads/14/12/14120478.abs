Title: Self-Gravitating Spherical Solutions of the non-minimally coupled  non-Abelian Higgs Model
Authors: Y. Brihaye and Y. Verbin
Abstract: Motivated by the Higgs Inflation scenario, we study static spherically-symmetric solutions of the non-Abelian Higgs model coupled non-minimally to Gravity. We find solutions for the self-gravitating sphaleron as well as monopole-like solutions and study the impact of the non-minimal coupling on their properties. Finally we discuss shortly the possibility that these solutions interact gravitationally with star-like objects like boson stars.
