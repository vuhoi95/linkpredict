Title: Spacetime defects and group momentum space
Authors: Michele Arzano and Tomasz Trzesniewski
Abstract: We study massive and massless conical defects in Minkowski and de Sitter space in various spacetime dimensions. The energy-momentum of such defects, seen as extended relativistic topological objects, is completely characterized by the holonomy of the connection associated with their spacetime metric. These holonomies are given by rotations and null rotations for massive and massless defects respectively. We observe that in the case of a massless conical defect in five dimensional Minkowski space its restricted momentum space can be parametrized by a subgroup of the five-dimensional Lorentz group, the $AN(3)$ group, corresponding to the well known momentum space associated with the deformed $\kappa$-Poincar\'{e} algebra and $\kappa$-Minkowski noncommutative spacetime. We further argue that massless conical defects in four dimensional de Sitter space can be analogously described by holonomies belonging to the same group. We thus provide the first example of how group-valued momenta related to four-dimensional deformations of relativistic symmetries can arise in the description of the motion of spacetime defects.
