Title: Variational Principle of Hydrodynamics and Quantization by Stochastic  Process
Authors: T. Kodama and T. Koide
Abstract: The well-known hydrodynamical representation of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation is reformulated by extending the idea of Nelson-Yasue's stochastic variational method. The fluid flow is composed by the two stochastic processes from the past and the future, which are unified naturally by the principle of maximum entropy. We show that this formulation is easily applicable to the quantization of scalar fields.
