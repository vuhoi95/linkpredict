Title: Testing the tensor-vector-scalar Theory with the latest cosmological  observations
Authors: Xiao-dong Xu and Bin Wang and Pengjie Zhang
Abstract: The tensor-vector-scalar (TeVeS) model is considered a viable theory of gravity. It produces the Milgrom's modified Newtonian dynamics in the nonrelativistic weak field limit and is free from ghosts. This model has been tested against various cosmological observations. Here we investigate whether new observations such as the galaxy velocity power spectrum measured by 6dF and the kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect power spectrum measured by ACT/SPT can put further constraints on the TeVeS model. Furthermore, we perform the test of TeVeS cosmology with a sterile neutrino by confronting to Planck data, and find that it is ruled out by cosmic microwave background measurements from the Planck mission.
