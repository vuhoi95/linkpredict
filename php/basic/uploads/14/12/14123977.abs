Title: Cosmological particle creation in a hadronic fluid
Authors: Neven Bilic and Dijana Tolic
Abstract: Acoustic perturbations in an expanding hadronic fluid at temperatures below the chiral transition point represent massless pions propagating in curved spacetime geometry. In comoving coordinates the corresponding analog metric tensor describes a hyperbolic FRW spacetime. We study the analog cosmological particle creation of pions below the critical point of the chiral phase transition. We compare the cosmological creation spectrum with the spectrum of analog Hawking radiation at the analog trapping horizon.
