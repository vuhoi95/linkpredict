Title: Integrability and MHV diagrams in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Andreas Brandhuber and Brenda Penante and Gabriele Travaglini and Donovan Young
Abstract: We apply MHV diagrams to the derivation of the one-loop dilatation operator of N=4 super Yang-Mills in the SO(6) sector. We find that in this approach the calculation reduces to the evaluation of a single MHV diagram in dimensional regularisation. This provides the first application of MHV diagrams to an off-shell quantity. We also discuss other applications of the method and future directions.
