Title: Towards a $C$-function in 4D quantum gravity
Authors: Daniel Becker and Martin Reuter
Abstract: We develop a generally applicable method for constructing functions, $C$, which have properties similar to Zamolodchikov's $C$-function, and are geometrically natural objects related to the theory space explored by non-perturbative functional renormalization group (RG) equations. Employing the Euclidean framework of the Effective Average Action (EAA), we propose a $C$-function which can be defined for arbitrary systems of gravitational, Yang-Mills, ghost, and bosonic matter fields, and in any number of spacetime dimensions. It becomes stationary both at critical points and in classical regimes, and decreases monotonically along RG trajectories provided the breaking of the split-symmetry which relates background and quantum fields is sufficiently weak. Within the Asymptotic Safety approach we test the proposal for Quantum Einstein Gravity in $d>2$ dimensions, performing detailed numerical investigations in $d=4$. We find that the bi-metric Einstein-Hilbert truncation of theory space introduced recently is general enough to yield perfect monotonicity along the RG trajectories, while its more familiar single-metric analog fails to achieve this behavior which we expect on general grounds. Investigating generalized crossover trajectories connecting a fixed point in the ultraviolet to a classical regime with positive cosmological constant in the infrared, the $C$-function is shown to depend on the choice of the gravitational instanton which constitutes the background spacetime. For de Sitter space in 4 dimensions, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is found to play a role analogous to the central charge in conformal field theory. We also comment on the idea of a `$\Lambda$-$N$ connection' and the `$N$-bound' discussed earlier.
