Title: D-brane solitons in various dimensions
Authors: Sven Bjarke Gudnason and Muneto Nitta
Abstract: We construct a D-brane soliton, a composite topological soliton sharing some properties with a D-brane, in a Skyrme model in 4+1 dimensions, in which Skyrmions are strings ending on a domain wall. We further generalize this D-brane soliton to diverse dimensions. A string, carrying the $\pi_{N-1}$ topological charge, ends on a domain wall in an O(N) model with higher-derivative terms in N+1 dimensions.
