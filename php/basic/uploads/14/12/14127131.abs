Title: The superconformal index of theories of class $\cal S$
Authors: Leonardo Rastelli and Shlomo S. Razamat
Abstract: This is the 8th article in the collection of reviews "Exact results in N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories", ed. J. Teschner. The article reviews the superconformal index. It is often simpler to calculate than instanton partition functions, but nevertheless allows one to perform many nontrivial checks of conjectured dualities. It turns out to admit a representation in terms of a new type of topological field theory associated to the Riemann surfaces $C$ parameterising the class $\cal S$ theories.
