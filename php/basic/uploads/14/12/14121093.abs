Title: Planckian Axions in String Theory
Authors: Thomas C. Bachlechner and Cody Long and Liam McAllister
Abstract: We argue that super-Planckian diameters of axion fundamental domains can naturally arise in Calabi-Yau compactifications of string theory. In a theory with $N$ axions $\theta^i$, the fundamental domain is a polytope defined by the periodicities of the axions, via constraints of the form $-\pi<Q^{i}_{j} \theta^j<\pi$. We compute the diameter of the fundamental domain in terms of the eigenvalues $f_1^2\le\...\le f_N^2$ of the metric on field space, and also, crucially, the largest eigenvalue of $(QQ^{\top})^{-1}$. At large $N$, $QQ^{\top}$ approaches a Wishart matrix, due to universality, and we show that the diameter is at least $N f_{N}$, exceeding the naive Pythagorean range by a factor $>\sqrt{N}$. This result is robust in the presence of $P>N$ constraints, while for $P=N$ the diameter is further enhanced by eigenvector delocalization to $N^{3/2}f_N$. We directly verify our results in explicit Calabi-Yau compactifications of type IIB string theory. In the classic example with $h^{1,1}=51$ where parametrically controlled moduli stabilization was demonstrated by Denef et al. in [1], the largest metric eigenvalue obeys $f_N \approx 0.013 M_{pl}$. The random matrix analysis then predicts, and we exhibit, axion diameters $>M_{pl}$ for the precise vacuum parameters found in [1]. Our results provide a framework for achieving large-field axion inflation in well-understood flux vacua.
