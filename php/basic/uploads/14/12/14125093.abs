Title: Helical Phase Inflation and Monodromy in Supergravity Theory
Authors: Tianjun Li and Zhijin Li and Dimitri V. Nanopoulos
Abstract: We study helical phase inflation in supergravity theory in details. The inflation is driven by the phase component of a complex field along helical trajectory. The helicoid structure originates from the monodromy of superpotential with an singularity at origin. We show that such monodromy can be formed by integrating out heavy fields in supersymmetric field theory. The supergravity corrections to the potential provide strong field stabilizations for the scalars except inflaton, therefore the helical phase inflation accomplishes the "monodromy inflation" within supersymmetric field theory. The phase monodromy can be easily generalized for natural inflation, in which the super-Planckian phase decay constant is realized with consistent field stabilization. The phase-axion alignment is fulfilled indirectly in the process of integrating out the heavy fields. Besides, we show that the helical phase inflation can be naturally realized in no-scale supergravity with $SU(2,1)/SU(2)\times U(1)$ symmetry since the no-scale K\"ahler potential provides symmetry factors of phase monodromy directly. We also demonstrate that the helical phase inflation can reduce to the shift symmetry realization of supergravity inflation. The super-Planckian field excursion is accomplished by the phase component, which admits no dangerous polynomial higher order corrections. The helical phase inflation process is free from the UV-sensitivity problem, and it suggests that inflation can be effectively studied in supersymmetric field theory close to the unification scale in Grand Unified Theory and a UV-completed frame is not prerequisite.
