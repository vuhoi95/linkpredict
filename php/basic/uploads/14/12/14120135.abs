Abstract: We study braneworld models in the presence of auxiliary fields. We use the first-order framework to investigate several distinct possibilities, where the standard braneworld scenario changes under the presence of the parameter that controls the auxiliary fields introduced to modify Einstein's equation. The results add to previous ones, to show that the minimal modification that we investigate contributes to change quantitatively the thick braneworld profile, although no new qualitative effect is capable of being induced by the minimal modification here considered.
