Title: Fermions and Supersymmetry in $\rm E_{6(6)}$ Exceptional Field Theory
Authors: Edvard Musaev and Henning Samtleben
Abstract: We construct the supersymmetric completion of E$_{6(6)}$-covariant exceptional field theory. The theory is based on a $(5+27)$-dimensional generalized space-time subject to a covariant section constraint. The fermions are tensors under the local Lorentz group ${\rm SO}(1,4)\times {\rm USp}(8)$ and transform as weighted scalars under the E$_{6(6)}$ (internal) generalized diffeomorphisms. We present the complete Lagrangian and prove its invariance under supersymmetry. Upon explicit solution of the section constraint the theory embeds full $D=11$ supergravity and IIB supergravity, respectively.
