Title: The $\mathfrak{so}$-Kazama-Suzuki Models at Large Level
Authors: Kevin Ferreira and Matthias R. Gaberdiel
Abstract: The large level limit of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ ${\rm SO}(2N)$ Kazama-Suzuki coset models is argued to be equivalent to the orbifold of $4N$ free fermions and bosons by the Lie group ${\rm SO}(2N) \times {\rm SO}(2)$. In particular, it is shown that the untwisted sector of the continuous orbifold accounts for a certain closed subsector of the coset theory. Furthermore, the ground states of the twisted sectors are identified with specific coset representations, and this identification is checked by various independent arguments.
