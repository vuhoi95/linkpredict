Title: De Sitter Space in Gauge/Gravity Duality
Authors: Lilia Anguelova and Peter Suranyi and L. C. Rohana Wijewardhana
Abstract: We investigate gauge/gravity duality for gauge theories in de Sitter space. More precisely, we study a five-dimensional consistent truncation of type IIB supergravity, which encompasses a wide variety of gravity duals of strongly coupled gauge theories, including the Maldacena-Nunez solution and its walking deformations. We find several solutions of the 5d theory with dS_4 spacetime and nontrivial profiles for (some of) the scalars along the fifth (radial) direction. In the process, we prove that one of the equations of motion becomes dependent on the others, for nontrivial warp factor. This dependence reduces the number of field equations and, thus, turns out to be crucial for the existence of solutions with (A)dS_4 spacetime. Finally, we comment on the implications of our dS_4 solutions for building gravity duals of Glueball Inflation.
