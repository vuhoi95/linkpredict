Title: Holographic description of confinement and screening through brane  cosmology
Authors: F. A. Brito and D. C. Moreira
Abstract: We compute the holographic quark potential in the realm of brane cosmology. We show that under certain conditions the very geometry due to an inflationary 3-brane induces a D3-D7-brane system. The cosmological constant that appears involved in the original geometry is attributed to the D7-brane position itself in its embedding process. We address the issues of confinement at low distances, screening effects at sufficiently large distances, and quark condensate.
