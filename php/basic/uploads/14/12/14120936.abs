Title: Comments on lump solutions in SFT
Authors: Loriano Bonora and Driba D. Tolla
Abstract: We analyze a recently proposed scheme to construct analytic lump solutions in open SFT. We argue that in order for the scheme to be operative and guarantee background independence it must be implemented in the same 2D conformal field theory in which SFT is formulated. We outline and discuss two different possible approaches. Next we reconsider an older proposal for analytic lump solutions and implement a few improvements. In the course of the analysis we formulate a distinction between regular and singular gauge transformations and advocate the necessity of defining a topology in the space of string fields.
