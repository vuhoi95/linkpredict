Title: Quantum space-time of a charged black hole
Authors: Rodolfo Gambini and Esteban Mato Capurro and Jorge Pullin
Abstract: We quantize spherically symmetric electrovacuum gravity. The algebra of Hamiltonian constraints can be made Abelian via a rescaling and linear combination with the diffeomorphism constraint. As a result the constraint algebra is a true Lie algebra. We complete the Dirac quantization procedure using loop quantum gravity techniques. We present explicitly the exact solutions of the physical Hilbert space annihilated by all constraints. The resulting quantum space-times resolve the singularity present in the classical theory inside charged black holes and allows to extend the space-time through where the singularity used to be into new regions. We show that quantum discreteness of space-time may also play a role in stabilizing the Cauchy horizons, though back reaction calculations are needed to confirm this point.
