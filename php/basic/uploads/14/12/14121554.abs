Title: A few more comments on secularly growing loop corrections in strong  electric fields
Authors: E. T. Akhmedov and F. K. Popov
Abstract: We extend the observations of our previous paper JHEP 1409, 071 (2014) [arXiv:1405.5285]. In particular, we show that the secular growth of the loop corrections to the two--point correlation functions is gauge independent: we observe the same growth in the case of the static gauge for the constant background electric field. Furthermore we solve the kinetic equation describing photon production from the background fields, which was derived in our previous paper and allows one to sum up leading secularly growing corrections from all loops. Finally, we show that in the constant electric field background the one--loop correction to the current of the produced pairs is not zero: it also grows with time and violates time translational and reversal invariance of QED on the constant electric field background.
