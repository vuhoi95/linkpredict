Title: WIMT in Gullstränd-Painlevé and Reissner-Nordström metrics:  induced Stable Gravito-magnetic Monopoles
Authors: Jesús Martín Romero and Mauricio Bellini
Abstract: The aim of this work is to apply WIMT to Gullstr\'and-Painlev\'e and Reissner-Nordstr\"om metrics in the framework of Weitzeb\"ock Induced Matter Theory (WIMT). This is a newly developed method that extends Induced Matter Theory from a curved 5D manifold using the Weitzeb\"ock's geometry, using the fact that the Riemann-Weitzeb\"ock curvature tensor is always null. We obtain the presence of currents whose interpretation can lead to the presence of stable gravito-magnetic monopoles.
