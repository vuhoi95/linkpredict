Abstract: The pair production of spinor particles, which can be captured by the solution of the Dirac equation with an appropriate boundary condition, in charged black holes is investigated. We obtain the closed form of the production rate in the near extremal limit of the Reissner-Nordstrom black holes. The cosmic censorship conjecture is seemingly guaranteed by the pair production process. Moreover, the absorption cross section ratio and retarded Green's functions of the spinor fields calculated from the gravity side match well with those of spinor operators in the dual CFT side.
