Title: Post-Newtonian gravitational effects in quantum interferometry

Abstract: We investigate general properties of optical interferometry in stationary spacetimes and apply the obtained results focusing on quantum-optical experiments in near-Earth environments. We provide a rigorous expression for the {gravitationally induced} phase difference and adapt the parametrized post-Newtonian formalism for calculations of polarization rotation. We investigate two optical versions of the Colella-Overhauser-Werner experiment and show that the phase difference is independent of the post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma$, making it a possible candidate for an optical test of the Einstein equivalence principle. Polarization rotation provides an example of the quantum clock variable, and while related to the optical Lense-Thirring effects, shows a qualitatively different behaviour.
