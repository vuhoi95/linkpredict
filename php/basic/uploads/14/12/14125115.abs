Title: Quasilocal conformal Killing horizons: Classical phase space and the  first law
Authors: Ayan Chatterjee and Avirup Ghosh
Abstract: In realistic situations, black hole spacetimes do not admit a global timelike Killing vector field. However, it is possible to describe the horizon in a quasilocal setting by introducing the notion of a quasilocal boundary with certain properties which mimic the properties of a black hole horizon. Isolated horzons and Killing horizons are examples of such kind. In this paper, we construct a boundary of spacetime which is null and admits a conformal Killing vector field. Furthermore we construct the space of solutions (in general theory of relativity) which admits such quasilocal conformal Killing boundaries. We also establish a form of first law for these quasilocal horizons.
