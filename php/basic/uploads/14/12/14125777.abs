Title: Quantum Dilogarithm Identities at Root of Unity
Authors: Ivan Chi-Ho Ip and Masahito Yamazaki
Abstract: We study the root of unity degeneration of cluster algebras and quantum dilogarithm identities. We prove identities for the cyclic dilogarithm associated with a mutation sequence of a quiver, and as a consequence new identities for the non-compact quantum dilogarithm at $b=1$.
