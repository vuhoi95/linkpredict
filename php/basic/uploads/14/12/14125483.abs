Title: The Chiral Condensate of One-Flavor QCD and the Dirac Spectrum at  Î¸=0
Authors: Jacobus Verbaarschot and Tilo Wettig
Abstract: In a sector of fixed topological charge, the chiral condensate has a discontinuity given by the Banks-Casher formula also in the case of one-flavor QCD. However, at fixed \theta-angle, the chiral condensate remains constant when the quark mass crosses zero. To reconcile these contradictory observations, we have evaluated the spectral density of one-flavor QCD at \theta=0. For negative quark mass, it becomes a strongly oscillating function with a period that scales as the inverse space-time volume and an amplitude that increases exponentially with the space-time volume. As we have learned from QCD at nonzero chemical potential, if this is the case, an alternative to the Banks-Casher formula applies, and as we will demonstrate in this talk, for one-flavor QCD this results in a continuous chiral condensate. A special role is played by the topological zero modes which have to be taken into account exactly in order to get a finite chiral condensate in the thermodynamic limit.
