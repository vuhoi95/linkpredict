Title: The Black Hole Interior in Quantum Gravity
Authors: Yasunori Nomura and Fabio Sanches and Sean J. Weinberg
Abstract: We discuss the interior of a black hole in quantum gravity, in which black holes form and evaporate unitarily. The interior spacetime appears in the sense of complementarity because of special features revealed by the microscopic degrees of freedom when viewed from a semiclassical standpoint. The relation between quantum mechanics and the equivalence principle is subtle, but they are still consistent.
