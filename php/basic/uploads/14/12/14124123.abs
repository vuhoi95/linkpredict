Title: The Landscape of M-theory Compactifications on Seven-Manifolds with  $G_2$ Holonomy
Authors: James Halverson and David R. Morrison
Abstract: We study the physics of globally consistent four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric M-theory compactifications on $G_2$ manifolds constructed via twisted connected sum; there are now perhaps fifty million examples of these manifolds. We study a rich example that exhibits $U(1)^3$ gauge symmetry and a spectrum of massive charged particles that includes a trifundamental. Applying recent mathematical results to this example, we compute membrane instanton corrections to the superpotential and spacetime topology change in a compact model; the latter include both the (non-isolated) $G_2$ flop and conifold transitions. The conifold transition spontaneously breaks the gauge symmetry to $U(1)^2$, and associated field theoretic computations of particle charges make correct predictions for the topology of the deformed $G_2$ manifold. We discuss physical aspects of the abelian $G_2$ landscape broadly, including aspects of Higgs and Coulomb branches, membrane instanton corrections, and some general aspects of topology change.
