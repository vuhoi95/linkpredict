Title: The Umbral Moonshine Module for the Unique Unimodular Niemeier Root  System
Authors: John F. R. Duncan and Jeffrey A. Harvey
Abstract: We use canonically-twisted modules for a certain super vertex operator algebra to construct the umbral moonshine module for the unique Niemeier lattice that coincides with its root sublattice. In particular, we give explicit expressions for the vector-valued mock modular forms attached to automorphisms of this lattice by umbral moonshine. We also characterize the vector-valued mock modular forms arising, in which four of Ramanujan's fifth order mock theta functions appear as components.
