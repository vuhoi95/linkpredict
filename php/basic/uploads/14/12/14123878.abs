Abstract: The problem of holographic thermalization in the framework of Einstein gravity coupled to Born-Infeld nonlinear electrodynamics is investigated. We use equal time two-point correlation functions and expectation values of Wilson loop operators in the boundary quantum field theory as probes of thermalization, which have dual gravity descriptions in terms of geodesic lengths and minimal area surfaces in the bulk spacetime. The full range of values of the chemical potential per temperature ratio on the boundary is explored. The numerical results show that the effect of the charge on the thermalization time is similar to the one obtained with Maxwell electrodynamics, namely the larger the charge the later thermalization occurs. The inverse Born-Infeld parameter, on the other hand, has the opposite effect: the more nonlinear the theory is, the sooner it thermalizes. We also study the thermalization velocity and how the parameters affect the phase transition point separating the thermalization process into an accelerating phase and a decelerating phase.
