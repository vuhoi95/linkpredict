Title: QFT on curved spacetimes: axiomatic framework and examples
Authors: Klaus Fredenhagen and Katarzyna Rejzner
Abstract: In this overview article we present a formalism suitable for constructing models of QFT's on curved spacetimes. The leading principle is the emphasis on local properties. It turns out that this requires a reformulation of the standard QFT framework which also yields a new perspective for the theories on Minkowski space. The aim of the present work is to provide an introduction into the framework, which should be accessible for both mathematical physicists and mathematicians.
