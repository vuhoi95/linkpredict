Title: Linking $U(2)\times U(2)$ to $O(4)$ model via decoupling
Authors: Tomomi Sato and Norikazu Yamada
Abstract: The nature of chiral phase transition of massless two flavor QCD depends on the fate of flavor singlet axial symmetry $U_A(1)$ at the critical temperature ($T_c$). Assuming that a finite $U_A(1)$ breaking remains at $T_c$, the corresponding three dimensional effective theory is composed of four massless and four massive scalar fields. We study the renormalization group flow of the effective theory in the $\epsilon$-expansion, using a mass dependent renormalization scheme, and determine the region of the attractive basin flowing into the $O(4)$ fixed point with a focus on its dependence on the size of the $U_A(1)$ breaking. The result is discussed from a perspective of the decoupling of massive fields. It is pointed out that, although the effective theory inside the attractive basin eventually reaches the $O(4)$ fixed point, the approaching rate, one of the universal exponents, is different from that of the standard $O(4)$ model. We present the reason for this peculiarity, and propose a novel possibility for chiral phase transition in two-flavor QCD.
