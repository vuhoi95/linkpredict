Title: Two Wave Functions and dS/CFT on S^1 x S^2
Authors: Gabriele Conti and Thomas Hertog
Abstract: We evaluate the tunneling and Hartle-Hawking wave functions on S^1 x S^2 boundaries in Einstein gravity with a positive cosmological constant. In the large overall volume limit the classical predictions of both wave functions include an ensemble of Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes. We show that the Hartle-Hawking tree level measure on the classical ensemble converges in the small S^1 limit. A divergence in this regime can be identified in the tunneling state. However we trace this to the contribution of an unphysical branch of saddle points associated with negative mass black holes. Using a representation in which all saddle points have an interior Euclidean anti-de Sitter region we also generalise the holographic formulation of the semiclassical Hartle-Hawking wave function to S^1 x S^2 boundaries.
