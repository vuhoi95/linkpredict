Title: From Black Hole to Qubits: Evidence of Fast Scrambling in BMN theory
Authors: Samuel Pramodh and Vatche Sahakian
Abstract: BMN Matrix theory admits vacua in the shape of large spherical membranes. Per- turbing around such vacua, the setup provides for a controlled computational frame- work for testing information evolution in Matrix black holes. The theory realizes excitations in the supergravity multiplet as qubits. These qubits are coupled to matrix degrees of freedom that describe deformations of the spherical shape of the membrane. Arranging the ripples on the membrane into a heat bath, we use the qubit system as a probe and compute the associated Feynman-Vernon density matrix at one loop order. This allows us to trace the evolution of entanglement in the system and extract the characteristic scrambling timescale. We find that our numerical analysis is consistent with this time scaling logarithmically with the entropy of the qubit system, in tune with suggestions by Sekino and Susskind.
