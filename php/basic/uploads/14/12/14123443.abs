Abstract: We investigate the softwall AdS/CFT model. We specifically looked at the Pomeron, leading Regge contribution to a scattering process and used it to fit deep inelastic scattering data from the HERA collaboration. We find that the model fits the data with much more success than the purely conformal case, and find similar success to previous confinement models.
