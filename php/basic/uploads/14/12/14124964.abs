Title: Meson turbulence at quark deconfinement from AdS/CFT

Abstract: Based on the QCD string picture at confining phase, we conjecture that the deconfinement transition always accompanies a condensation of higher meson resonances with a power-law behavior, "meson turbulence". We employ the AdS/CFT correspondence to calculate the meson turbulence for $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric QCD at large $N_c$ and at strong coupling limit, and find that the energy distribution to each meson level $n$ scales as $n^\alpha$ with the universal scaling $\alpha=-5$. The universality is checked for various ways to attain the quark deconfinement: a static electric field below/around the critical value, a time-dependent electric field quench, and a time-dependent quark mass quench, all result in the turbulent meson condensation with the universal power $\alpha=-5$ around the deconfinement.
