Title: n-partite information in Hawking radiation
Authors: Shogo Kuwakino and Wen-Yu Wen
Abstract: We study the entanglement among sequential Hawking radiations in the Parikh-Wilczek tunneling model of Schwarzschild black hole. We identify the part of classical correlation and that of quantum entanglement in bipartite information and point out its imitated relation to quantum gravity correction. Explicit computation of n-partite information shows that it is positive (negative) for even (odd) $n$, which happens to agree with the holographic computation. The fact that entanglement in the mutual information grows with time mimics the second law of thermodynamics. Later we extend our study to the AdS black hole and find the total mutual information which includes the classical correlation is sensible to the Hawking-Page phase transition.
