Authors: Nan Bai and Hui-Huang Chen and Jun-Bao Wu
Abstract: In this paper, minimal surface in $q$-deformed $AdS_5\times S^5$ with boundary a cusp is studied in detail. This minimal surface is dual to cusped Wilson loop in the dual field theory. We found that the area of the minimal surface has both logarithmic squared divergence and logarithmic divergence. The logarithmic squared divergence can not be removed by either Legendre transformation or the usual geometric substraction. We further make analytic continuation to the Minkowski signature %for the case without the jump and take the limit such that the two edges of the cusp become light-like and extract anomalous dimension from the coefficient of the logarithmic divergence. This anomalous dimension goes back smoothly to the results in the undeformed case when we take the limit that the deformation parameter goes to zero.
