Title: Kantowski-Sachs Universes sourced by a Skyrme fluid
Authors: Luca Parisi and Ninfa Radicella and Gaetano Vilasi
Abstract: The Kantowski-Sachs cosmological model sourced by a Skyrme field and a cosmological constant is considered in the framework of General Relativity. Assuming a constant radial profile function for the hedgehog ansatz, the Skyrme contribution to Einstein equations is shown to be equivalent to an anisotropic fluid. Using dynamical system techniques, a qualitative analysis of the cosmological equations is presented. Physically interesting features of the model such as isotropization, bounce and recollapse are discussed.
