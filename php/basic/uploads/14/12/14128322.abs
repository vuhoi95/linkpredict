Abstract: We investigate the statistical behaviors of 3D hairy black holes in the presence of a scalar field. The present study is made in terms of two relevant parameters: rotation parameter a and B parameter related to the scalar field. More precisely, we compute various statistical quantities including the partition function for non-charged and charged black hole solutions. Using a partition function calculation, we show that the probability is independent of a and B parameters.
