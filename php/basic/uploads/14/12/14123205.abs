Authors: Pinaki Patra and Md. Raju and Gargi Manna and Jyoti Prasad Saha
Abstract: The Ostrogradski approach for the Hamiltonian formalism of higher derivative theory is not satisfactory because of the reason that the Lagrangian cannot be viewed as a function on the tangent bundle to coordinate manifold. In this article, we have used an alternative approach which leads directly to the Lagrangian which, being a function on the tangent manifold, gives correct equation of motion; no new coordinate variables need to be added. This approach can be directly used to the singular (in Ostrogradski sense) Lagrangian. We have used this method for the Regge Teitelboim (RT) minisuperspace cosmological model. We have obtained the Hamiltonian of the dynamical equation of the scale factor of RT model.
