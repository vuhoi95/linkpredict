Title: Floating JMaRT
Authors: Guillaume Bossard and Stefanos Katmadas
Abstract: We define a new partially solvable system of equations that parametrises solutions to six-dimensional N=(1,0) ungauged supergravity coupled to tensor multiplets. We obtain this system by applying a series of dualities on the known floating brane system, imposing that it allows for the JMaRT solution. We construct an explicit multi-centre solution generalising the JMaRT solution, with an arbitrary number of additional BPS centres on a line. We describe explicitly the embedding of the JMaRT solution in this system in five dimensions.
