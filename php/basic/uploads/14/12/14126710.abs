Title: RG domain wall for the N=1 minimal superconformal models
Authors: Gabriel Poghosyan and Hasmik Poghosyan
Abstract: We specify Gaiotto's proposal for the RG domain wall between some coset CFT models to the case of two minimal N=1 SCFT models $SM_p$ and $SM_{p-2}$ related by the RG flow initiated by the top component of the Neveu-Schwarz superfield $\Phi_{1,3}$ . We explicitly calculate the mixing coefficients for several classes of fields and compare the results with the already known in literature results obtained through perturbative analysis. Our results exactly match with both leading and next to leading order perturbative calculations.
