Title: Holographic chiral induced W-gravities
Authors: Rohan R. Poojary and Nemani V. Suryanarayana
Abstract: We study boundary conditions for 3-dimensional higher spin gravity that admit asymptotic symmetry algebras expected of 2-dimensional induced higher spin theories in the light cone gauge. For the higher spin theory based on sl(3, R) plus sl(3,R) algebra, our boundary conditions give rise to one copy of classical W3 and a copy of sl(3,R) or su(1,2) Kac-Moody symmetry algebra. We propose that the higher spin theories with these boundary conditions describe appropriate chiral induced W-gravity theories on the boundary. We also consider boundary conditions of spin-3 higher spin gravity that admit u(1) plus u(1) current algebra.
