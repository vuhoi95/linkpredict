Title: Form factors of descendant operators: Reduction to perturbed $M(2,2s+1)$  models
Authors: Michael Lashkevich and Yaroslav Pugai
Abstract: In the framework of the algebraic approach to form factors in two-dimensional integrable models of quantum field theory we consider the reduction of the sine-Gordon model to the $\Phi_{13}$-perturbation of minimal conformal models of the $M(2,2s+1)$ series. We find in an algebraic form the condition of compatibility of local operators with the reduction. We propose a construction that make it possible to obtain reduction compatible local operators in terms of screening currents. As an application we obtain exact multiparticle form factors for the compatible with the reduction conserved currents $T_{\pm2k}$, $\Theta_{\pm(2k-2)}$, which correspond to the spin $\pm(2k-1)$ integrals of motion, for any positive integer~$k$. Furthermore, we obtain all form factors of the operators $T_{2k}T_{-2l}$, which generalize the famous $T\bar T$ operator. The construction is analytic in the $s$ parameter and, therefore, makes sense in the sine-Gordon theory.
