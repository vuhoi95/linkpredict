Title: Inflation without self-reproduction in $F(R)$ gravity
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: We investigate inflation in frames of two classes of $F(R)$ gravity and check its consistency with Planck data. It is shown that $F(R)$ inflation without self-reproduction may be constructed in close analogy with the corresponding scalar example proposed by Mukhanov for the resolution the problems of multiverse, predictability and initial conditions.
