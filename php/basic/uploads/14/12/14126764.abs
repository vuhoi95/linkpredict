Title: Duality invariance in massive theories
Authors: Adel Khoudeir and David Sierra
Abstract: In this work, we show that duality symmetry can be implemented for massive theories at the level of the action, whenever we can formulate appropriates gauge invariant actions. For a massive vectorial field, we use a known gauge invariant description, while for a massive graviton, we introduce a novel gauge invariant action in order to show duality invariance.
