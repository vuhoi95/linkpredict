Title: Multipole moments in scalar-tensor theory of gravity
Authors: George Pappas and Thomas P. Sotiriou
Abstract: Stationary, asymptotically flat spacetimes in general relativity can be characterized by their multipole moments. The moments have proved to be very useful tools for extracting information about the spacetime from various observables and, more recently, for establishing universalities in the structure of neutron stars. As a first step toward extending these methods beyond general relativity, we develop the formalism that allows one to define and calculate the multipole moments in scalar-tensor theories of gravity.
