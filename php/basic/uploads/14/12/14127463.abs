Title: Comments on the Casimir energy in supersymmetric field theories
Authors: Jakob Lorenzen and Dario Martelli
Abstract: We study the Casimir energy of four-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories in the context of the rigid limit of new minimal supergravity. Firstly, revisiting the computation of the localized partition function on $S^1\times S^3$, we recover the supersymmetric Casimir energy. Secondly, we consider the same theories in the Hamiltonian formalism on $\mathbb{R}\times S^3$, focussing on the free limit and including a one-parameter family of background gauge fields along $\mathbb{R}$. We compute the vacuum expectation value of the canonical Hamiltonian using zeta function regularization, and show that this interpolates between the supersymmetric Casimir energy and the ordinary Casimir energy of a supersymmetric free field theory.
