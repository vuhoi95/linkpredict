Title: The Holographic Goldstino
Authors: Riccardo Argurio and Matteo Bertolini and Daniele Musso and Flavio Porri and Diego Redigolo
Abstract: We find the fingerprints of the Goldstino associated to spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in a prototype holographic model for a strongly coupled field theory. The Goldstino massless pole arises in two-point correlators of the supercurrent, due to contact terms in supersymmetry Ward identities. We show how these contact terms are obtained from the holographic renormalization of the gravitino sector, independently of the details of the bulk background solution. For completeness, we provide an example of a family of such solutions in a simple supergravity model.
