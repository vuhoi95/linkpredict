Title: Higher derivative Chern-Simons extension in the noncommutative QED$_{3}$
Authors: M. Ghasemkhani and R. Bufalo
Abstract: The noncommutative (NC) massive quantum electrodynamics in $2+1$ dimensions is considered. We show explicitly that the one-loop effective action arising from the integrating out the fermionic fields leads to the ordinary NC Chern-Simons and NC Maxwell action at the long wavelength limit (large fermion mass). In the next to leading order, the higher-derivative contributions to NC Chern-Simons are obtained. Moreover, the gauge invariance of the outcome action is carefully discussed. We then consider the higher-derivative modification into the pure NC Chern-Simons Lagrangian density and evaluate the one-loop correction to the pole of the photon propagator.
