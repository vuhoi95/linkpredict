Title: Standard Model Fermions and N=8 supergravity
Authors: Krzysztof A. Meissner and Hermann Nicolai
Abstract: In a scheme originally proposed by M. Gell-Mann, and subsequently shown to be realized at the SU(3)xU(1) stationary point of maximal gauged SO(8) supergravity by N. Warner and one of the present authors, the 48 spin 1/2 fermions of the theory remaining after the removal of eight Goldstinos can be identified with the 48 quarks and leptons (including right-chiral neutrinos) of the Standard Model, provided one identifies the residual SU(3) with the diagonal subgroup of the color group SU(3)_c and a family symmetry SU(3)_f. However, there remained a systematic mismatch in the electric charges by a spurion charge of $\pm$1/6. We here identify the `missing' U(1) that rectifies this mismatch, and that takes a surprisingly simple, though unexpected form.
