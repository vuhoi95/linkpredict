Abstract: We use the heavy dense formulation of QCD (HD-QCD) as the basis for an analytic expansion as systematic approximation to QCD at non-zero density, keeping the full Yang-Mills action. We analyse the structure of the baryonic density and other quantities and present data from the complex Langevin equation (CLE) and reweighting (RW) calculations for 2 flavours of Wilson fermions.
