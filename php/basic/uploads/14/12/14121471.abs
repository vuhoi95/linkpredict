Authors: Salvatore Capozziello and Mariafelicia De Laurentis and Ratbay Myrzakulov
Abstract: We consider curvature-teleparallel $F(R,T)$ gravity, where the gravitational Lagrangian density is given by an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar $R$ and the torsion scalar $T$. Using the Noether Symmetry Approach, we show that the functional form of the $F(R, T)$ function, can be determined by the presence of symmetries . Furthermore, we obtain exact solutions through to the presence of conserved quantities and the reduction of cosmological dynamical system. Example of particular cosmological models are considered.
