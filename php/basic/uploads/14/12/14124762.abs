Authors: Christian Marboe and Vitaly Velizhanin and Dmytro Volin
Abstract: We compute the general form of the six-loop anomalous dimension of twist-two operators with arbitrary spin in planar N=4 SYM theory. First we find the contribution from the asymptotic Bethe ansatz. Then we reconstruct the wrapping terms from the first 35 even spin values of the full six-loop anomalous dimension computed using the quantum spectral curve approach. The obtained anomalous dimension satisfies all known constraints coming from the BFKL equation, the generalised double-logarithmic equation, and the small spin expansion.
