Title: Thermodynamics of Asymptotically Conical Geometries
Authors: Mirjam Cvetic and Gary W. Gibbons and Zain H. Saleem
Abstract: We study the thermodynamical properties of a class of asymptotically conical (AC) geometries known as "subtracted geometries". We derive the mass and angular momentum from the regulated Komar Integral and the Hawking-Horowitz prescription and show that they are equivalent. By deriving the asymptotic charges we show that the Smarr formula and the first law of thermodynamics hold. We also propose an analog of Christodulou-Ruffini inequality. The analysis can be generalized to other AC geometries.
