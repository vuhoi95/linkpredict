Abstract: Gribov's observation that global gauge fixing is impossible has led to suggestions that there may be a deep connection between gauge-fixing and confinement. We find an unexpected relation between the topological non-triviality of the gauge bundle and coloured states in $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory, and show that such states are necessarily impure. We approximate QCD by a rectangular matrix model that captures the essential topological features of the gauge bundle, and demonstrate the impure nature of coloured states explicitly. Our matrix model also allows the inclusion of the QCD $\theta$-term, as well as to perform explicit computations of low-lying glueball masses. This mass spectrum is gapped. Since an impure state cannot evolve to a pure one by a unitary transformation, our result shows that the solution to the confinement problem in pure QCD is fundamentally quantum information-theoretic.
