Title: Holographic Entanglement and Causal Shadow in Time-Dependent Janus Black  Hole
Authors: Yuki Nakaguchi and Noriaki Ogawa and Tomonori Ugajin
Abstract: We holographically compute an inter-boundary entanglement entropy in a time-dependent two-sided black hole which was constructed in hep-th/0701108 by applying time-dependent Janus deformation to BTZ black hole. The black hole contains "causal shadow region" which is causally disconnected from both the conformal boundaries. We find that the Janus deformation results in an earlier phase transition between the extremal surfaces and that the phase transition disappears when the causal shadow is sufficiently large.
