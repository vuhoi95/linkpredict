Title: Remnant Symmetry, Propagation and Evolution in f(T) Gravity
Authors: Pisin Chen and Keisuke Izumi and James M. Nester and Yen Chin Ong
Abstract: It was recently argued that f(T) gravity could inherit "remnant symmetry" from the full Lorentz group, despite the fact that the theory is not locally Lorentz invariant. Confusion has arisen regarding the implication of this result for the previous works, which established that f(T) gravity is pathological due to superluminal propagation, local acausality, and non-unique time evolution. We clarify that the existence of the "remnant group" does not rid the theory of these various problems, but instead strongly supports it.
