Title: Perfect Abelian dominance of confinement in quark-antiquark potential in  SU(3) lattice QCD
Authors: Hideo Suganuma and Naoyuki Sakumichi
Abstract: In the context of the dual superconductor picture for the confinement mechanism, we study maximally Abelian (MA) projection of quark confinement in SU(3) quenched lattice QCD with $32^4$ at $\beta$=6.4 (i.e., $a \simeq$ 0.058 fm). We investigate the static quark-antiquark potential $V(r)$, its Abelian part $V_{\rm Abel}(r)$ and its off-diagonal part $V_{\rm off}(r)$, respectively, from the on-axis lattice data. As a remarkable fact, we find almost perfect Abelian dominance for quark confinement, i.e., $\sigma_{\rm Abel} \simeq \sigma$ for the string tension, on the fine and large-volume lattice. We find also a nontrivial summation relation of $V(r) \simeq V_{\rm Abel}(r) + V_{\rm off}(r)$.
