Title: Conserved Higher-Spin Charges in $AdS_4$
Authors: O. A. Gelfond and M. A. Vasiliev
Abstract: Gauge invariant conserved conformal currents built from massless fields of all spins in 4d Minkowski space-time and $AdS_4$ are described within the unfolded dynamics approach. The current cohomology associated with non-zero conserved charges is found. The resulting list of charges is shown to match the space of parameters of the conformal higher-spin symmetry algebra in four dimensions.
