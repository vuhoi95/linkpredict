Title: Colored knot polynomials for Pretzel knots and links of arbitrary genus
Authors: D. Galakhov and D. Melnikov and A. Mironov and A. Morozov and A. Sleptsov
Abstract: A very simple expression is conjectured for arbitrary colored Jones and HOMFLY polynomials of a rich $(g+1)$-parametric family of Pretzel knots and links. The answer for the Jones and HOMFLY polynomials is fully and explicitly expressed through the Racah matrix of U_q(SU_N), and looks related to a modular transformation of toric conformal block.
