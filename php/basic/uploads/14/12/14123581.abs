Title: On the Landau system in noncommutative phase-space
Authors: Sunandan Gangopadhyay and Anirban Saha and Aslam Halder
Abstract: We consider a charged particle moving in a two dimensional plane in the presence of a background magnetic field perpendicular to the plane, i.e. the Landau system in a phase-space where the coordinates and momenta both follow canonical noncommutative algebra. A set of generalized transformations is derived in this paper which maps the NC problem to an equivalent commutative problem. In this set up, we study the Aharonov-Bohm effect and the Landau levels. For the Aharonov-Bohm effect, the phase-shift is found to contain corrections due to phase-space noncommutativity and also depends on the scaling parameter appearing in the generalized transformations. The result agrees with those in the literature upto first order in the noncommutative parameters when proper choice of the scaling parameter is taken. We then obtain the magnetic length and degeneracy of the Landau levels, both are seen to admit NC corrections. The Landau levels are seen to get altered due to phase-space noncommutativity as well. This energy spectrum of the Landau system is computed from two different perspectives, namely the explicit NC variable approach and the commutative-equivalent approach. The results match exactly, solidifying the evidence in favour of the equivalence of the two approaches.
