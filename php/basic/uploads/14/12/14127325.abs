Title: Rholography, Black Holes and Scherk-Schwarz
Authors: Nava Gaddam and Alessandra Gnecchi and Stefan Vandoren and Oscar Varela
Abstract: We present both the macroscopic and microscopic description of a class of near-extremal asymptotically flat black hole solutions in four (or five) dimensional gauged supergravity with R-symmetry gaugings obtained from Scherk-Schwarz reductions on a circle. The entropy of these black holes is counted holographically by the well known MSW (or D1/D5) system, with certain twisted boundary conditions labeled by a twist parameter \rho. We find that the corresponding (0,4) (or (4,4)) superconformal algebras are exactly those studied by Schwimmer and Seiberg, using a twist on the outer automorphism group. The interplay between R-symmetries, \rho-algebras and holography leads us to name our construction "Rholography".
