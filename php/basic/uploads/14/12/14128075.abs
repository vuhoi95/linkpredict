Title: Inflation and dark energy from the Brans-Dicke theory
Authors: Michal Artymowski and Zygmunt Lalak and Marek Lewicki
Abstract: We consider the Brans-Dicke theory motivated by the $f(R) = R + \alpha R^n - \beta R^{2-n}$ model to obtain a stable minimum of the Einstein frame scalar potential of the Brans-Dicke field. As a result we have obtained an inflationary scalar potential with non-zero value of residual vacuum energy, which may be a source of Dark Energy. In addition we discuss the probability of quantum tunnelling from the minimum of the potential. Our results can be easily consistent with PLANCK or BICEP2 data for appropriate choices of the value of $n$ and $\omega$.
