Authors: Ali R. Amani and S. L. Dehneshin
Abstract: In this paper, we have studied $F(R,T)$ gravity as an arbitrary function of curvature and torsion scalars in Friedmann--Lema\^{\i}tre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) background. Then, we have considered interacting model between $F(R,T)$ gravity and modified Chaplygin gas. The novelty of this model is that the Universe includes both cases curvature and torsion, and one dominated by a Chaplygin gas. In order to calculate cosmological solutions, we obtained Friedmann equations and also equation of state (EoS) parameter of dark energy. By employing interacting model we considered the total energy density and the total pressure of Universe as the combination of components of dark energy and Chaplygin gas. Subsequently, we reconstructed the model by an origin of a scalar field entitled quintessence model with a field potential. The field potential has been calculated in terms of free parameters of $F(R,T)$ gravity and modified Chaplygin gas. In what follows, we used a parametrization, and the cosmological parameters have been written in terms of redshift $z$. Next, we plotted cosmological parameters with respect to three variable of cosmic time, redshift $z$ and $e$-folding number $N=ln(a)$, and the figures showed us an accelerated expansion of Universe. Also, we have described the scenario in three status early time, late time and future time by $e$-folding number. Finally, the stability of scenario has been investigated by a useful function named sound speed, and the graph of sound speed versus $e$-folding number has been showed us that there is the stability in late time.
