Title: Logarithmic Corrections to the Entropy of Scalar Field in BTZ Black Hole  Space-time
Authors: Dharm Veer Singh and Shobhit Sachan
Abstract: The entanglement entropy correlates two quantum sub-systems which are the part of the larger system. A logarithmic divergence term present in the entanglement entropy is universal in nature and directly proportional to the conformal anomaly. We study this logarithmic divergence term of entropy for massive scalar field in $(2+1)$ dimension by applying numerical techniques to entanglement entropy approach. This (2+1) dimensional massive theory can be obtained from (3+1) dimensional massless scalar field via dimensional reduction. We also calculated mass corrections to entanglement entropy for scalar field. Finally, we observe that the area law contribution to the entanglement entropy is not affected by this mass term and the universal quantities depends upon the basic properties of the system.
