Title: Kaluza-Klein Theories Without Truncation
Authors: Katrin Becker and Melanie Becker and Daniel Robbins
Abstract: In this note we present a closed expression for the space-time effective action for all bosonic fields (massless and massive) obtained from the compactification of gravity or supergravity theories (such as type II or eleven-dimensional supergravities) from $D$ to $d$ space-time dimensions.
