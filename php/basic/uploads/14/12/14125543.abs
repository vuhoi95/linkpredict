Title: A method for obtaining thick branes models
Authors: A. de Souza Dutra and G. P. de Brito and J. M. Hoff da Silva
Abstract: In this work we present a new class of braneworld models, where the superpotential function may be decomposed in a very specific form, but still embracing, which allows considerable simplifications in the field equations. We exemplify the method with two specific models that are extended versions of superpotentials already considered in the literature. As one can see in the examples, the braneworld scenarios obtained here present very interesting features, such as split brane mechanism and asymmetric warp factor shape, which is essential to address the hierarchy problem in the context of thick brane scenarios.
