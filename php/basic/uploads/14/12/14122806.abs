Title: Non-equilibrium scalar two point functions in AdS/CFT
Authors: Ville Keranen and Philipp Kleinert
Abstract: In the first part of the paper, we discuss different versions of the AdS/CFT dictionary out of equilibrium. We show that the Skenderis - van Rees prescription and the "extrapolate" dictionary are equivalent at the level of "in-in" two point functions of free scalar fields in arbitrary asymptotically AdS spacetimes. In the second part of the paper, we calculate two point correlation functions in dynamical spacetimes using the "extrapolate" dictionary. These calculations are performed for conformally coupled scalar fields in examples of spacetimes undergoing gravitational collapse, the AdS$_2$-Vaidya spacetime and the AdS$_3$-Vaidya spacetime, which allow us to address the problem of thermalization following a quench in the boundary field theory. The computation of the correlators is formulated as an initial value problem in the bulk spacetime. Finally, we compare our results for AdS$_3$-Vaidya to results in the previous literature obtained using the geodesic approximation and we find qualitative agreement.
