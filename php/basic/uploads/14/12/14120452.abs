Title: Entropy discrepancy and total derivatives in trace anomaly
Authors: Amin Faraji Astaneh and Alexander Patrushev and Sergey N. Solodukhin
Abstract: In this note we address the discrepancy found by Hung, Myers and Smolkin between the holographic calculation of entanglement entropy (using the Jacobson-Myers functional for the holographic minimal surface) and the CFT trace anomaly calculation if one uses the Wald prescription to compute the entropy in six dimensions. As anticipated in our previous work [1] the discrepancy originates entirely from a total derivative term present in the trace anomaly in six dimensions.
