Title: On the relation between boundary proposals and hidden symmetries of the  extended pre-big bang quantum cosmology
Authors: S. Jalalzadeh and T. Rostami and P. V. Moniz
Abstract: A framework associating quantum cosmological boundary conditions to minisuperspace hidden symmetries has been introduced in \cite{7}. The scope of the application was, notwithstanding the novelty, restrictive because it lacked a discussion involving realistic matter fields. Therefore, in the herein letter, we extend the framework scope to encompass elements from a scalar-tensor theory in the presence of a cosmological constant. More precisely, it is shown that hidden minisuperspace symmetries present in a pre-big bang model suggest a process from which boundary conditions can be selected.
