Abstract: Rationally extended shape invariant potentials in arbitrary D-dimensions are obtained by using point canonical transformation (PCT) method. The bound-state solutions of these exactly solvable potentials can be written in terms of X_m Laguerre or X_m Jacobi exceptional orthogonal polynomials. These potentials are isospectral to their usual counterparts and possess translationally shape invariance property.
