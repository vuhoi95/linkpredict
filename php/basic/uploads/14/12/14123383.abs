Title: New elliptic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation
Authors: D. Chicherin and S. E. Derkachov and V. P. Spiridonov
Abstract: We consider finite-dimensional reductions of an integral operator with the elliptic hypergeometric kernel describing the most general known solution of the Yang-Baxter equation with a rank 1 symmetry algebra. The reduced R-operators reproduce at their bottom the standard Baxter's R-matrix for the 8-vertex model and Sklyanin's L-operator. The general formula has a remarkably compact form and yields new elliptic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation based on the finite-dimensional representations of the elliptic modular double. The same result is also derived using the fusion formalism.
