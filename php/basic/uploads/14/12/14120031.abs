Title: Schr√∂dinger Holography with $z=2$
Authors: Tomas Andrade and Cynthia Keeler and Alex Peach and Simon F. Ross
Abstract: We investigate holography for asymptotically Schr\"odinger spacetimes, using a frame formalism based on the anisotropic scaling symmetry. We build on our previous work on $z<2$ to propose a dictionary for $z=2$. For $z=2$, the scaling symmetry does not act on the additional null direction, which implies that in our dictionary it does not correspond to one of the field theory directions. This is significantly different from previous analyses based on viewing Schr\"odinger as a deformation of AdS. We study this dictionary in the linearised theory and in an asymptotic expansion. We show that a solution exists in an asymptotic expansion for arbitrary sources for the relevant operators in the stress energy complex.
