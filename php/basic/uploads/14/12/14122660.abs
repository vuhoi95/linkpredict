Title: Moduli Spaces of Lumps on Real Projective Space
Authors: Steffen Krusch and Abera A. Muhamed
Abstract: Harmonic maps that minimise the Dirichlet energy in their homotopy classes are known as lumps. Lump solutions on real projective space are explicitly given by rational maps subject to a certain symmetry requirement. This has consequences for the behaviour of lumps and their symmetries. An interesting feature is that the moduli space of charge three lumps is a $7$-dimensional manifold of cohomogeneity one which can be described as a one-parameter family of symmetry orbits of $D_2$ symmetric maps. In this paper, we discuss the charge three moduli spaces of lumps from two perspectives: discrete symmetries of lumps and the Riemann-Hurwitz formula. We then calculate the metric and find explicit formulas for various geometric quantities. We also discuss the implications for lump decay.
