Title: Analyzing Multi-Field Tunneling With Exact Bounce Solutions
Authors: Aditya Aravind and Brandon S. DiNunno and Dustin Lorshbough and Sonia Paban
Abstract: We study multi-field tunneling using exact solutions for additive potentials. We introduce a binomial potential with non-integer powers that could be considered a generalization of the $4D$ Fubini instanton potential. Using scaling arguments, we show that for multi-field potentials taller and wider barriers may still lead to a smaller bounce action.
