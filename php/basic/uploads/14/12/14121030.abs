Title: Non-minimal fields of the pure spinor string in general curved  backgrounds
Authors: Osvaldo Chandia and Brenno Carlini Vallilo
Abstract: We study the coupling of the non-minimal ghost fields of the pure spinor superstring in general curved backgrounds. The coupling is found solving the consistent relations from the nilpotency of the non-minimal BRST charge.
