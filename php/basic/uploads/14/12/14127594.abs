Title: Supersymmetric Duality in Superloop Space
Authors: Mir Faizal and Tsou Sheung Tsun
Abstract: In this paper we constructed superloop space duality for a four dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with $\mathcal{N} =1$ supersymmetry. This duality reduces to the ordinary loop space duality for the ordinary Yang-Mills theory. It also reduces to the Hodge duality for an abelian gauge theory. Furthermore, the electric charges, which are the sources in the original theory, appear as monopoles in the dual theory. Whereas, the magnetic charges, which appear as monopoles in the original theory, become sources in the dual theory.
