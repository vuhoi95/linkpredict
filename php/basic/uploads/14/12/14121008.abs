Title: Fermions with a bounded and discrete mass spectrum
Authors: F. R. Klinkhamer and L. Yang
Abstract: A mechanism for determining fermion masses in four spacetime dimensions is presented, which uses a scalar-field domain wall extending in a fifth spacelike dimension and a special choice of Yukawa coupling constants. A bounded and discrete fermion mass spectrum is obtained analytically for spinors localized in the fifth dimension. These particular mass values depend on a combination of the absolute value of the Yukawa coupling constant and the parameters of the scalar potential. A similar mechanism for a finite mass spectrum may apply to $(1+1)$--dimensional fermions relevant to condensed matter physics.
