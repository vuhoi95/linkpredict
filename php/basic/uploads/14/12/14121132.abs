Title: OPE for all Helicity Amplitudes
Authors: Benjamin Basso and Joao Caetano and Lucia Cordova and Amit Sever and Pedro Vieira
Abstract: We extend the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) for scattering amplitudes in planar N=4 SYM to account for all possible helicities of the external states. This is done by constructing a simple map between helicity configurations and so-called charged pentagon transitions. These OPE building blocks are generalizations of the bosonic pentagons entering MHV amplitudes and they can be bootstrapped at finite coupling from the integrable dynamics of the color flux tube. A byproduct of our map is a simple realization of parity in the super Wilson loop picture.
