Title: Phenomenology of theories of gravity without Lorentz invariance: the  preferred frame case
Authors: Diego Blas and Eugene Lim
Abstract: Theories of gravitation without Lorentz invariance are candidates of low-energy descriptions of quantum gravity. In this review we will describe the phenomenological consequences of the candidates associated to the existence of a preferred time direction
