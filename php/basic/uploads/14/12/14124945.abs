Title: Zeeman interaction and chiral symmetry breaking by tilted magnetic field  in the (2+1)-dimensional Gross--Neveu model
Authors: K. G. Klimenko and R. N. Zhokhov
Abstract: Magnetic catalysis of the chiral symmetry breaking and other magnetic properties of the (2+1)-dimensional Gross--Neveu model are studied taking into account the Zeeman interaction of spin-1/2 quasi-particles (electrons) with tilted (with respect to a system plane) external magnetic field. The Zeeman interaction is proportional to magnetic moment $\mu_B$ of electrons. It is shown that at $\mu_B\ne 0$ the magnetic catalysis effect is drastically changed in comparison with the $\mu_B= 0$ case.
