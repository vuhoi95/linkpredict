Title: IIB Supergravity and the E6(6) covariant vector-tensor hierarchy
Authors: Franz Ciceri and Bernard de Wit and Oscar Varela
Abstract: IIB supergravity is reformulated with a manifest local USp(8) invariance that makes the embedding of five-dimensional maximal supergravities transparent. In this formulation the ten-dimensional theory exhibits all the 27 one-form fields and 22 of the 27 two-form fields that are required by the vector-tensor hierarchy of the five-dimensional theory. The missing 5 two-form fields must transform in the same representation as a descendant of the ten-dimensional `dual graviton'. The invariant E6(6) symmetric tensor that appears in the vector-tensor hierarchy is reproduced. Generalized vielbeine are derived from the supersymmetry transformations of the vector fields, as well as consistent expressions for the USp(8) covariant fermion fields. Implications are discussed for the consistency of the truncation of IIB supergravity compactified on the five-sphere to maximal gauged supergravity in five space-time dimensions with an SO(6) gauge group.
