Title: Strings, Branes and the Self-dual Solutions of Exceptional Field Theory
Authors: David S. Berman and Felix J. Rudolph
Abstract: It has been shown that membranes and fivebranes are wave-like or monopole-like solutions in some higher dimensional theory. Here the picture is completed by combining the wave and monopole solutions into a single solution of Exceptional Field Theory. This solution solves the twisted self-duality constraint. The 1/2 BPS brane spectrum, consisting of fundamental, solitonic and Dirichlet branes, in ten- and eleven-dimensional supergravity may all be extracted from this single solution of Exceptional Field Theory. The solution's properties such as the singularity structure and its asymptotic behaviour near the core and at infinity are investigated.
