Title: Heavy Quark Potential at Finite Temperature in a Dual Gravity Closer to  Large N QCD
Authors: Binoy Krishna Patra and Himanshu Khanchandani
Abstract: In gauge-gravity duality, the heavy quark potential at finite temperature is usually calculated with the pure AdS background, which does not capture the renormalization group (RG) running in the gauge theory part. In addition, the potential does not contain any confining term in the deconfined phase. Following the Klebanov-Strassler geometry, we employ a geometry, which captures the RG flow similar to QCD, to obtain the heavy quark potential by analytically continuing the string configurations into the complex plane. In addition to the attractive terms, the obtained potential has confining terms both at $T = 0$ and $T \neq 0 $, compared to the calculations usually done in the literature, where only the Coulomb-like term is present in the deconfined phase. The potential also develops an (negative) imaginary part above a critical separation, $r_c (= 0.53 z_h )$. Moreover, our potential exhibits a behavior different from the usual Debye screening obtained from perturbation theory.
