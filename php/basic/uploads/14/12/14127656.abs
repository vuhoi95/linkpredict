Title: Tensor Fields on Self-Dual Warped $AdS_3$ Background
Authors: Mohammad A. Ganjali and Sadegh Sadeghian
Abstract: Considering rank s fields obey first order equation of motion, we study the dynamics of such fields in a 3 dimensional self-dual space-like warped $AdS_3$ black hole background. We argue that in this background, symmetric conditions and gauge constraint can not be satisfied simultaneously. Using new suitable constraint, we find the exact solutions of equation of motion. Then, we obtain the quasi-normal modes by imposing appropriate boundary condition at horizon and infinity.
