Abstract: A number of LHC searches now display intriguing excesses. Most prominently, the measurement of the $W^+W^-$ cross-section has been consistently $\sim 20\%$ higher than the theoretical prediction across both ATLAS and CMS for both 7 and 8 TeV runs. More recently, supersymmetric searches for final states containing two or three leptons have also seen more events than predicted in certain signal regions. We show that a supersymmetric model containing a light stop, winos and binos can consistently match the data. We perform a fit to all measurements and searches that may be sensitive to our model and find a reduction in the log-likelihood of 15.4 compared to the Standard Model which corresponds to 3.5-$\sigma$ once the extra degrees of freedom in the fit are considered.
