Title: Vacuum Energy Sequestering: The Framework and Its Cosmological  Consequences
Authors: Nemanja Kaloper and Antonio Padilla
Abstract: Recently we suggested a reformulation of General Relativity which completely sequesters from gravity {\it all} of the vacuum energy from a protected matter sector, assumed to contain the Standard Model. Here we elaborate further on the mechanism, presenting additional details of how it cancels all loop corrections and renders all contributions from phase transitions automatically small. We also consider cosmological consequences in more detail and show that the mechanism is consistent with a variety of inflationary models that make a universe big and old. We discuss in detail the underlying assumptions behind the dynamics of our proposal, and elaborate on the relationship of the physical interpretation of divergent operators in quantum field theory and the apparent `acausality' which our mechanism seems to entail, which we argue is completely harmless. It is merely a reflection of the fact that any UV sensitive quantity in quantum field theory cannot be calculated from first principles, but is an input whose numerical value must be measured. We also note that since the universe should be compact in spacetime, and so will collapse in the future, the current phase of acceleration with $w_{DE}\approx-1$ is just a transient. This could be tested by future cosmological observations.
