Title: Fermion Fields in BTZ Black Hole Space-Time and Entanglement Entropy
Authors: Dharm Veer Singh and Sanjay Siwach
Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy of fermion fields in BTZ black hole space-time and calculate pre- factor of the leading and sub-leading terms and logarithmic divergence term of the entropy using the discretized model. The leading term is the standard Bekenstein-Hawking area law and sub-leading term corresponds to first quantum corrections in black hole entropy. We also investigate the corrections to entanglement entropy for massive fermion fields in BTZ space-time. The mass term does not affect the area law.
