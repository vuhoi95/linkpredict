Title: Efficient electroweak baryogenesis by black holes
Authors: Georgios Aliferis and Georgios Kofinas and Vasilios Zarikas
Abstract: A novel cosmological scenario, capable to generate the observed baryon number at the electroweak scale for very small CP violating angles, is presented. The proposed mechanism can be applied in conventional FRW cosmology, but becomes extremely efficient due to accretion in the context of early cosmic expansion with high energy modifications. Assuming that our universe is a Randall-Sundrum brane, baryon asymmetry can easily be produced by Hawking radiation of very small primordial black holes. The Hawking radiation reheats a spherical region around every black hole to a high temperature and the electroweak symmetry is restored there. A domain wall is formed separating the region with the symmetric vacuum from the asymmetric region where electroweak baryogenesis takes place. First order phase transition is not needed. The black holes's lifetime is prolonged due to accretion, resulting to strong efficiency of the baryon producing mechanism. The allowed by the mechanism black hole mass range includes masses that are energetically favoured to be produced from interactions around the higher dimensional Planck scale.
