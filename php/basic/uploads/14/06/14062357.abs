Authors: S. H. Hendi and S. Panahiyan and E. Mahmoudi
Abstract: Employing two classes of nonlinear electrodynamics, we obtain topological black hole solutions of Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We investigate geometric properties of the solutions and find that there is an intrinsic singularity at the origin. We investigate the thermodynamic properties of the asymptotically flat black holes and also asymptotically adS solutions. Using suitable local transformation, we generalize static horizon-flat solutions to rotating ones. We discuss their conserved and thermodynamic quantities as well as the first law of thermodynamics. Finally, we calculate the heat capacity of the solutions to obtain a constraint on the horizon radius of stable solutions.
