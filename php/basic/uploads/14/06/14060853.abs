Title: Gravity duals of N=2 SCFTs and asymptotic emergence of the electrostatic  description
Authors: P. Marios Petropoulos and Konstadinos Sfetsos and Konstadinos Siampos
Abstract: We built the first eleven-dimensional supergravity solutions with SO(2,4)xSO(3)xU(1)_R symmetry that exhibit the asymptotic emergence of an extra U(1) isometry. This enables us to make the connection with the usual electrostatics-quiver description. The solution is obtained via the Toda frame of Kahler surfaces with vanishing scalar curvature and SU(2) action.
