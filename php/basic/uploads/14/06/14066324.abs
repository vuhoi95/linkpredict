Title: Smooth thick braneworlds and the Gibbons-Kallosh-Linde no-go theorem
Authors: Marco Dias and J. M. Hoff da Silva and Rold√£o da Rocha
Abstract: After working out the so called braneworld sum rules formalism in order to encompass Gauss-Bonnet terms, the generation of thick branes is proposed, even with a periodic extra dimension, what circumvents the Gibbons-Kallosh-Linde no-go theorem in this context.
