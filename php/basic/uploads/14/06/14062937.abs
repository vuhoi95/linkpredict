Title: Heating up branes in gauged supergravity
Authors: Kevin Goldstein and Suresh Nampuri and Álvaro Véliz-Osorio
Abstract: In this note, we explore the solution space of non-extremal black objects in $4D$ and $5D$ ${\cal N}=2$ gauged supergravity in the presence of fluxes. We present first order rewritings of the $4D$ action for a classes of non-extremal dyonic and electric solutions with electric flux backgrounds. Additionally, we obtain the non-extremal version of the Nernst brane in $AdS_5$ using a simple deformation. Finally, we develop a new technique to deform extremal black solutions in $4D$ to non-extremal solutions by an analysis of the symmetries of the equations of motion.
