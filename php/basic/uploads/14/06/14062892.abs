Title: Localization of abelian gauge fields on thick branes
Authors: Carlos A. Vaquera-Araujo and Olindo Corradini
Abstract: In this work, we explore a mechanism for abelian gauge field localization on thick branes based on a five-dimensional Stueckelberg-like action. A normalizable zero mode is found through the identification of a suitable coupling function between the brane and the gauge field. The same mechanism is studied for the localization of the abelian Kalb--Ramond field.
