Title: Maximally Supersymmetric AdS4 Vacua in N=4 Supergravity
Authors: Jan Louis and Hagen Triendl
Abstract: We study AdS backgrounds of N=4 supergravity in four space-time dimensions which preserve all sixteen supercharges. We show that the graviphotons have to form a subgroup of the gauge group that consists of an electric and a magnetic SO(3)_+ x SO(3)_-. Moreover, these N=4 AdS backgrounds are necessarily isolated points in field space which have no moduli.
