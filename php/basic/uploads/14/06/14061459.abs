Title: A Minimal Supersymmetric Kink Model
Authors: Azadeh Mohammadi and Andr√© Amado
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a minimal supersymmetric soliton model, $\mathcal{N}=1$, in ($1+1$) dimensions in which the bosonic part of the potential presents a $\lambda \phi^4$ coupling. In this system a fermion field is coupled to a pseudoscalar field nonlinearly. As the set of coupled equations of motion of the system is not analytically solvable without considering the weak coupling approximation, we use a numerical method to solve it self-consistently. We obtain the bound energy spectrum, bound states of the system and the corresponding shape of the soliton using a relaxation method, except for the zero mode fermionic state and threshold energies that are possible to solve analytically. With the aid of these results we are able to investigate the strong coupling regime besides the weak coupling one and show how the soliton is affected in both cases. The results we obtain in weak coupling limit are consistent with the ones in the literature considering the soliton as a background field.
