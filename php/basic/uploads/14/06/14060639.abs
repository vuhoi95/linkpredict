Title: Dilatonic Topological Defects in 3+1 Dimensions and their Embeddings
Authors: Nikos Platis and Ioannis Antoniou and Leandros Perivolaropoulos
Abstract: We consider Lagrangians in 3+1 dimensions admitting topological defects where there is an additional coupling between the defect scalar field $\Phi$ and the gauge field kinetic term (eg $B(\vert \Phi \vert^2) F_{\mu \nu}F^{\mu \nu}$). Such a {\it dilatonic} coupling in the context of a static defect, induces a spatially dependent effective gauge charge and effective mass for the scalar field which leads to modified properties of the defect core. In particular, the scale of the core gets modified while the stability properties of the corresponding embedded defects are also affected. These modifications are illustrated for gauged (Nielsen-Olesen) vortices and for gauged ('t Hooft-Polyakov) monopoles. The corresponding dilatonic global defects are also studied in the presence of an external gauge field.
