Title: Spontaneous emission of a two-level static atom coupling with the  electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations outside a high-dimensional Einstein  Gauss-Bonnet black hole
Authors: Ming Zhang and Zhan-Ying Yang and Rui-Hong Yue
Abstract: In present paper, by using the generalized DDC formalism, we investigate the spontaneous excitation of an static atom interacting with electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations outside a EGB black hole in $d$-dimensions. We find that spontaneous excitation does not occur in Boulware vacuum. The Gauss-Bonnet term has no effect on the stability of the atom. Finally, we discuss the contribution of the coupling constant and dimensional factor to the results in three different kinds of spacetime.
