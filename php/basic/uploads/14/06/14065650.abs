Title: Aspects of $C_3$-symmetric calorons from numerical Nahm transform
Authors: Atsushi Nakamula and Nobuyuki Sawado and Koki Takesue
Abstract: Calorons are finite action solutions to the anti-selfdual Yang-Mills equations on $\mathbb{R}^3\times S^1$. They are generally constructed by the so called Nahm construction. We perform the numerical Nahm transform for the Nahm data of 3-calorons with $C_3$-symmetry, which do not have the monopole limits. Dissimilar to the cases of having monopole limits, we can trace the zero-circumference limit of $S^1$.It is found that the action density of the calorons tends to fade away as $S^1$ shrinks.
