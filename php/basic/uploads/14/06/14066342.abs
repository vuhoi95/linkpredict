Title: Elliptic genera of ALE and ALF manifolds from gauged linear sigma models
Authors: Jeffrey A. Harvey and Sungjay Lee and Sameer Murthy
Abstract: We compute the equivariant elliptic genera of several classes of ALE and ALF manifolds using localization in gauged linear sigma models. In the sigma model computation the equivariant action corresponds to chemical potentials for U(1) currents and the elliptic genera exhibit interesting pole structure as a function of the chemical potentials. We use this to decompose the answers into polar terms that exhibit wall crossing and universal terms. We compare our results to previous results on the large radius limit of the Taub-NUT elliptic genus and also discuss applications of our results to counting of BPS world-sheet spectrum of monopole strings in the 5d N=2 super Yang-Mills theory and self-dual strings in the 6d N=(2,0) theories.
