Title: On degenerate models of cosmic inflation
Authors: Rhiannon Gwyn and Gonzalo A. Palma and Mairi Sakellariadou and Spyros Sypsas
Abstract: In this article we discuss the role of current and future CMB measurements in pinning down the model of inflation responsible for the generation of primordial curvature perturbations. By considering a parameterization of the effective field theory of inflation with a modified dispersion relation arising from heavy fields, we derive the dependence of cosmological observables on the scale of heavy physics $\Lambda_{\rm UV}$. Specifically, we show how the $f_{\rm NL}$ non-linearity parameters are related to the phase velocity of curvature perturbations at horizon exit, which is parameterized by $\Lambda_{\rm UV}$. Bicep2 and Planck findings are shown to be consistent with a value $\Lambda_{\rm UV} \sim \Lambda_{\rm GUT}$. However, we find a degeneracy in the parameter space of inflationary models that can only be resolved with a detailed knowledge of the shape of the non-Gaussian bispectrum.
