Title: Black Holes with Intrinsic Spin
Authors: Mirjam Cvetic and Finn Larsen
Abstract: We analyze the general black hole solutions to the four dimensional STU model recently constructed by Chow and Compere. We define a dilute gas limit where the black holes can be interpreted as excited states of an extremal ground state. In this limit we express the black hole entropy and the excitation energy in terms of physical quantities with no need for parametric charges. We discuss a dual microscopic CFT description that incorporates all electric and magnetic charges. This description is recovered geometrically by identification of a near horizon BTZ region. We construct the subtracted geometry with no restrictions on charges by analyzing the scalar wave equation in the full geometry. We determine the matter sources that support the subtracted geometry by studying a scaling limit and show that the general geometry permits a dilute gas description with parameters that we specify.
