Title: Higgs Inflation on Braneworld
Authors: Hongsheng Zhang and Yi Zhang and Xin-Zhou Li
Abstract: We discuss a Higgs inflation model in the warped DGP braneworld background. It generates reasonable primordial perturbations. At the same time with enhanced non-minimal coupling it overcomes the severe problem in the Higgs inflation in 4 dimension, which says that the effective field theory become invalid at an energy scale far below the energy scale for inflation exit. Furthermore we present the constraints for the parameters confront to PLANCK and related observations. PLANCK low-l data almost fixes the inflation energy scale in this Higgs inflation model with specific brane parameters.
