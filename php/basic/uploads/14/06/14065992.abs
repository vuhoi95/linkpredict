Title: Interpolating solution from AdS$_5$ to hyperscaling violating Lifshitz  space-time
Authors: Parijat Dey and Shibaji Roy
Abstract: We construct two interpolating solutions in type II string theory which interpolate between an AdS$_5$ in the UV and a hyperscaling violating three (spatial) dimensional Lifshitz space-time in the IR. The first solution is non-supersymmetric and is obtained from a known intersecting non-supersymmetric D3-brane with chargeless D0-brane solution of type IIB string theory, by restricting some parameters characterizing the solution and going to a new coordinate. In the IR the dilaton is non-constant in general and the metric is three (spatial) dimensional hyperscaling violating Lifshitz with dynamical critical exponent $z=(3+3\gamma)/(3-\gamma)$ and hyperscaling violation exponent $\theta = 12/(3-\gamma)$, where $\gamma$ is a real parameter and can take continuous values from $-1$ to $+1$. At the two extreme values, i.e., for $\gamma = \pm 1$, the dilaton is constant. The second solution is supersymmetric and is obtained from the known F-D2 bound state solution of type IIA string theory by zooming into a particular region of space. In the UV, the proper description is given in a T-dual frame which is AdS$_5$, whereas in the IR, it gives a three dimensional hyperscaling violating Lifshitz with $z=3$ and $\theta=2=d-1$.
