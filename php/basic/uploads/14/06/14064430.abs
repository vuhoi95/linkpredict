Title: Dirac and Faddeev-Jackiw quantization of a five-dimensional  Stüeckelberg theory with a compact dimension
Authors: Alberto Escalante and Moisés Zárate
Abstract: A detailed Hamiltonian analysis for a five-dimensional St{\"{u}}eckelberg theory with a compact dimension is performed. First, we develop a pure Dirac's analysis of the theory, we show that after performing the compactification, the theory is reduced to four-dimensional St{\"{u}}eckelberg theory plus a tower of Kaluza-Klein modes. We develop a complete analysis of the constraints, we fix the gauge and we show that there are present pseudo-Goldstone bosons. Then we quantize the theory by constructing the Dirac brackets. As complementary work, we perform the Faddeev-Jackiw quantization for the theory under study, and we calculate the generalized Faddeev-Jackiw brackets, we show that both the Faddeev-Jackiw and Dirac's brackets are the same. Finally we discuss some remarks and prospects.
