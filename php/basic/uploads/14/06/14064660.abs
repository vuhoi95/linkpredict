Title: Gauge Origin of Discrete Flavor Symmetries in Heterotic Orbifolds
Authors: Florian Beye and Tatsuo Kobayashi and Shogo Kuwakino
Abstract: We show that non-Abelian discrete symmetries in orbifold string models have a gauge origin. This can be understood when looking at the vicinity of a symmetry enhanced point in moduli space. At such an enhanced point, orbifold fixed points are characterized by an enhanced gauge symmetry. This gauge symmetry can be broken to a discrete subgroup by a nontrivial vacuum expectation value of the K\"ahler modulus $T$. Using this mechanism it is shown that the $\Delta(54)$ non-Abelian discrete symmetry group originates from a $SU(3)$ gauge symmetry, whereas the $D_4$ symmetry group is obtained from a $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry.
