Abstract: This work addresses the computation of the propability of fermionic particle pair production in $(d+1)-$ dimensional noncommutative Moyal space. Using the Seiberg-Witten maps that establish relations between noncommutative and commutative field variables, to first order in the noncommutative parameter $\theta$, we derive the probability density of vacuum-vacuum pair production of Dirac particles. The cases of constant electromagnetic, alternating time-dependent and space-dependent electric fields are considered and discussed.
