Abstract: In this paper we exploit the use of symmetries of a physical system so as to characterize algebraically the corresponding solution manifold by means of Noether invariants. This constitutes a necessary preliminary step towards the correct quantization in non-linear cases, where the success of Canonical Quantization is not guaranteed in general. To achieve this task "point symmetries" of the Lagrangian are generally not enough, and the notion of contact transformations is in order: the solution manifold can not be in general parametrized by means of Noether invariants associated with basic point symmetries. The use of the contact structure given by the Poincar\'e-Cartan form permits the definition of the symplectic form on the solution manifold, through some sort of Hamilton-Jacobi transformation. It also provides the required basic symmetries, realized as Hamiltonian vector fields associated with global functions on the solution manifold (thus constituting an inverse of the Noether Theorem), lifted back to the evolution space through the inverse of this Hamilton-Jacobi mapping. In this framework, solutions and symmetries, as a whole, are somehow identified and this correspondence is also kept at a perturbative level. We present non-trivial examples of this interplay between symmetries and solutions pointing out the usefulness of this mechanism in approaching the corresponding quantization. In particular, we achieve the proper generalization of the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra for the non-linear particle sigma model in $S^3$ within this framework, and notice that a subset of the classical symmetries corresponding with this quantizing algebra (those generalizing boosts) are necessarily of non-point character.
