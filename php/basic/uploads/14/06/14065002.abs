Title: Topological Dyons
Authors: Vinod Singh and Buddhi Vallabh Tripathi
Abstract: Using a two potential approach, dyon solutions have been found in the temporal and non-temporal gauges for a non-Abelian theory. Both the charges, electric and magnetic, of the temporal dyon solution are topological, while for the non-temporal case both charges are partially topological.
