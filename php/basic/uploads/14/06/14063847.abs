Title: Quantization of soluble classical constrained systems
Authors: Zahir Belhadi and Ferhat Ménas and Alain Bérard and Herve Mohrbach
Abstract: The derivation of the brackets among coordinates and momenta for classical constrained systems is a necessary step toward their quantization. Here we present a new approach for the determination of the classical brackets which does neither require Dirac's formalism nor the symplectic method of Faddeev and Jackiw. This approach is based on the computation of the brackets between the constants of integration of the exact solutions of the equations of motion. From them all brackets of the dynamical variables of the system can be deduced in a straightforward way.
