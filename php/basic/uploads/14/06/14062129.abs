Title: Intertwining Operator Realization of anti de Sitter Holography
Authors: N. Aizawa and V. K. Dobrev
Abstract: We give a group-theoretic interpretation of relativistic holography as equivalence between representations of the anti de Sitter algebra describing bulk fields and boundary fields. Our main result is the explicit construction of the boundary-to-bulk operators for arbitrary integer spin the framework of representation theory. Further we show that these operators and the bulk-to-boundary operators are intertwining operators. In analogy to the de Sitter case, we show that each bulk field has two boundary (shadow) fields with conjugated conformal weights. These fields are related by another intertwining operator given by a two-point function on the boundary.
