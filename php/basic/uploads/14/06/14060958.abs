Title: Quantum Corrections in String Compactifications on SU(3) Structure  Geometries
Authors: Mariana Grana and Jan Louis and Ulrich Theis and Daniel Waldram
Abstract: We investigate quantum corrections to the classical four-dimensional low-energy effective action of type II string theory compactified on SU(3) structure geometries. Various methods previously developed for Calabi-Yau compactifications are adopted to determine - under some simple assumptions about the low-energy degrees of freedom - the leading perturbative corrections to the moduli space metrics in both alpha' and the string coupling constant. We find - in complete analogy to the Calabi-Yau case - that the corrections take a universal form dependent only on the Euler characteristic of the six-dimensional compact space.
