Title: Multikink solutions and deformed defects
Authors: G. P. de Brito and A. de Souza Dutra
Abstract: At the present work we consider an application of the deformation procedure that enable us to construct, systematically, scalar field models supporting multikinks. We introduce a new deformation function in order to realize this task. We exemplify the procedure with three different starting models already known in the literature, and the resulting deformed models have rich vacua structures which are responsible for the appearance of multikink configurations.
