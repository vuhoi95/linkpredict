Title: Higher-derivative non-Abelian gauge fields via the Faddeev-Jackiw  formalism
Authors: R. Bufalo and B. M. Pimentel
Abstract: In this paper we analyze two higher-derivative theories, the generalized electrodynamics and the Alekseev-Arbuzov-Baikov's effective Lagrangian from the point of view of Faddeev-Jackiw sympletic approach. It is shown that the full set of constraint is obtained directly from the zero-mode eigenvectors, and that they are in accordance with known results from Dirac's theory, a remnant and recurrent issue in the literature. The method shows to be rather economical in relation to the Dirac's one, obviating thus unnecessary classification and calculations. Afterwards, to conclude we construct the transition-amplitude of the non-Abelian theory following a constrained BRST-method.
