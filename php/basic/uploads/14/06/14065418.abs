Title: On the alternative formulation of the three-dimensional noncommutative  superspace
Authors: F. S. Gama and J. R. Nascimento and A. Yu. Petrov
Abstract: In this paper we propose a new version for the noncommutative superspace in 3D. This version is shown to be convenient for performing quantum calculations. In the paper, we use the theory of the chiral superfield as a prototype for possible generalizations, calculating the one-loop two-point function of a chiral supefield and the one-loop low-energy effective action in this theory.
