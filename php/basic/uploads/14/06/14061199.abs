Title: Deconfinement and continuity between thermal and (super) Yang-Mills  theory for all gauge groups
Authors: Mohamed M. Anber and Erich Poppitz and Brett Teeple
Abstract: We study the phase structure of N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on R^3XS^1, with massive gauginos, periodic around the S^1, with Sp(2N) (N>=2), Spin(N) (N>=5), G_2, F_4, E_6, E_7, E_8 gauge groups. As the gaugino mass m is increased, with S^1 size and strong coupling scale fixed, we find a first-order phase transition both for theories with and without a center. This semiclassically calculable transition is driven, as in SU(N) and G_2, arxiv.org/abs/1205.0290 and arxiv.org/abs/1212.1238, by a competition between monopole-instantons and exotic topological "molecules"---"neutral" or "magnetic" bions. We compute the trace of the Polyakov loop and its two-point correlator near the transition. We find a behavior similar to the one observed near the thermal deconfinement transition in the corresponding pure Yang-Mills (YM) theory in lattice studies (whenever available). Our results lend further support to the conjectured continuity, as a function of m, between the quantum phase transition studied here and the thermal deconfinement transition in YM theory. We also study the theta-angle dependence of the transition, elaborate on the importance of the quantum-corrected moduli-space metric at large N, and offer comments for the future.
