Title: Duality and bosonization in Schwinger-Keldysh formulation
Authors: R. E. Gamboa Saraví and C. M. Naón and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We present a path-integral bosonization approach for systems out of equilibrium based on a duality transformation of the original Dirac fermion theory combined with the Schwinger-Keldysh time closed contour technique, to handle the non-equilibrium situation. The duality approach to bosonization that we present is valid for $D \geq 2$ space-time dimensions leading for $D=2$ to exact results. In this last case we present the bosonization rules for fermion currents, calculate current-current correlation functions and establish the connection between the fermionic and bosonic distribution functions in a generic, nonequilibrium situation.
