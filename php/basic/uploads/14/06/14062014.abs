Title: Chiral symmetry breaking as a geometrical process
Authors: Eduardo Bittencourt and Sofiane Faci and MÃ¡rio Novello
Abstract: This article expands for spinor fields the recently developed Dynamical Bridge formalism which relates a linear dynamics in a curved space to a nonlinear dynamics in Minkowski space. Astonishingly, this leads to a new geometrical mechanism to generate a chiral symmetry breaking without mass, providing an alternative explanation for the undetected right-handed neutrinos. We consider a spinor field obeying the Dirac equation in an effective curved space constructed by its own currents. This way, both chiralities of the spinor field satisfy the same dynamics in the curved space. Subsequently, the dynamical equation is re-expressed in terms of the flat Minkowski space and then each chiral component behaves differently. The left-handed part of the spinor field satisfies the Dirac equation while the right-handed part is trapped by a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) type potential.
