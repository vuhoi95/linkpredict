Title: Thermal Fluctuation and Meson Melting: Holographic Approach
Authors: M. Ali-Akbari and Z. Rezaei and A. Vahedi
Abstract: We use gauge/gravity duality to investigate the effect of thermal fluctuations on the dissociation of the quarkonium meson in strongly coupled $(3+1)$-dimensional gauge theories. This is done by studying the instability and probable first order phase transition of a probe D7-brane in the dual gravity theory. We explicitly show that for the Minkowski embeddings with their tips close to the horizon in the background, the long wavelength thermal fluctuations lead to an imaginary term in their action signaling an instability in the system. Due to this instability, a phase transition is expected. On the gauge theory side, it indicates that the quarkonium mesons are not stable and dissociate in the plasma. Identifying the imaginary part of the probe barne action with the thermal width of the mesons, we observe that the thermal width increases as one decreases the mass of the quarks. Also keeping the mass fixed, thermal width increases by temperature as expected.
