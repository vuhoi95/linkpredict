Title: Solvable Discrete Quantum Mechanics: q-Orthogonal Polynomials with |q|=1  and Quantum Dilogarithm
Authors: Satoru Odake and Ryu Sasaki
Abstract: Several kinds of q-orthogonal polynomials with |q|=1 are constructed as the main parts of the eigenfunctions of new solvable discrete quantum mechanical systems. Their orthogonality weight functions consist of quantum dilogarithm functions, which are a natural extension of the Euler gamma functions and the q-gamma functions (q-shifted factorials). The dimensions of the orthogonal spaces are finite. These q-orthogonal polynomials are expressed in terms of the Askey-Wilson polynomials and their certain limit forms.
