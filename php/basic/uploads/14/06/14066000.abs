Title: Comments on Quantum Higgs Vacua
Authors: Jeffrey A. Harvey and David Kutasov and Sungjay Lee
Abstract: We study two-dimensional N=(4,4) supersymmetric gauge theories which do not have classical Higgs branches, but are believed to have isolated quantum Higgs vacua. We provide arguments for the existence of such vacua based on brane dynamics in string theory and the supersymmetric partition sums of the gauge theories.
