Title: Generalized Jackiw-Rebbi Model and Topological Classification of Free  Fermion Insulators
Authors: O. Nganba Meetei and Archana Anandakrishnan
Abstract: We present a new perspective to the classification of topological phases in free fermion insulators by generalizing the Jackiw-Rebbi model to arbitrary dimensions. We show that a generalized Jackiw-Rebbi model where the Dirac mass ($m$) satisfies $m(x)=-m(-x)$ is invariant under a parity transformation ($P$) that relates the $x>0$ half to the $x<0$ half. Determining the form of $P$ gives rise to a Clifford algebra that has been shown to give a complete topological classification of free fermion insulators. Gapless edge states are a natural consequence of our construction and their topological nature can be understood from the fact that all gapless edge states at a given interface transform similarly under $P$ (all odd or all even). A naive non-topological model for states confined to the interface will allow both even and odd states.
