Title: Deformed Neumann model from spinning strings on (AdS_5 x S^5)_Î·
Authors: Gleb Arutyunov and Daniel Medina-Rincon
Abstract: We show that bosonic spinning strings on the \eta-deformed AdS_5 x S^5 background are naturally described as periodic solutions of a novel finite-dimensional integrable system which can be viewed as a deformation of the celebrated Neumann model. For this deformed model we find the Lax representation and the analogue of the Uhlenbeck integrals.
