Title: Monopole-vortex complex at large distances and nonAbelian duality
Authors: Chandrasekhar Chatterjee and Kenichi Konishi
Abstract: We discuss the large-distance approximation of the monopole-vortex complex soliton in a hierarchically broken gauge system, SU(N+1) - > SU(N) x U(1) - > 1, in a color-flavor locked SU(N) symmetric vacuum. The ('t Hooft-Polyakov) monopole of the higher-mass-scale breaking appears as a point and acts as a source of the thin vortex generated by the lower-energy gauge symmetry breaking. The exact color-flavor diagonal symmetry of the bulk system is broken by each individual soliton, leading to nonAbelian orientational CP^{N-1} zeromodes propagating in the vortex worldsheet, well studied in the literature. But since the vortex ends at the monopoles these fluctuating modes endow the monopoles with a local SU(N) charge. This phenomenon is studied by performing the duality transformation in the presence of the CP^{N-1} moduli space. The effective action is a CP^{N-1} model defined on a finite-width worldstrip.
