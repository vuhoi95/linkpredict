Title: Horava-Lifshitz cosmology, entropic interpretation and quark-hadron  phase transition
Authors: F. Kheyri and M. Khodadi and H. R. Sepangi
Abstract: Based on the assumptions of the standard model of cosmology, a phase transition associated with chiral symmetry breaking after the electroweak transition has occurred at approximately $10\mu$ seconds after the Big Bang to convert a plasma of free quarks and gluons into hadrons. We consider such a phase transition in the context of a deformed Horava-Lifshitz cosmology. The Friedmann equation for the deformed Horava-Lifshitz universe is obtained using the entropic interpretation of gravity, proposed by Verlinde. We investigate the effects of the parameter $\omega$ appearing in the theory on the evolution of the physical quantities relevant to a description of the early universe, namely, the energy density and temperature before, during and after the phase transition. Finally, we study the cross-over phase transition in both high and low temperature regions in view of the recent lattice QCD simulations data.
