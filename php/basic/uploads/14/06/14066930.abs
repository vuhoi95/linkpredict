Title: A second look at gauged supergravities from fluxes in M-theory
Authors: Jean-Pierre Derendinger and Adolfo Guarino
Abstract: We investigate reductions of M-theory beyond twisted tori by allowing the presence of KK6 monopoles (KKO6-planes) compatible with N=4 supersymmetry in four dimensions. The presence of KKO6-planes proves crucial to achieve full moduli stabilisation as they generate new universal moduli powers in the scalar potential. The resulting gauged supergravities turn out to be compatible with a weak G2 holonomy at N=1 as well as at some non-supersymmetric AdS4 vacua. The M-theory flux vacua we present here cannot be obtained from ordinary type IIA orientifold reductions including background fluxes, D6-branes (O6-planes) and/or KK5 (KKO5) sources. However, from a four-dimensional point of view, they still admit a description in terms of so-called non-geometric fluxes. In this sense we provide the M-theory interpretation for such non-geometric type IIA flux vacua.
