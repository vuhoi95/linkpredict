Title: Combining Universal and Odd RR Axions for Aligned Natural Inflation
Authors: Xin Gao and Tianjun Li and Pramod Shukla
Abstract: We successfully embed the Kim-Nilles-Peloso (KNP) alignment mechanism for enhancing the axion decay constant in the context of large volume type IIB orientifolds. The flat direction is generated in the plane of ($C_0$-$C_2$) axions corresponding to the involutively even universal axion $C_0$ and odd axion $C_2$, respectively. The moduli stabilization with large volume scheme has been established as well.
