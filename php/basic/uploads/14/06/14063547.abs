Title: The 2D $Îº$-Dirac oscillator
Authors: Fabiano M. Andrade and Edilberto O. Silva
Abstract: In this Letter, 2D Dirac oscillator in the quantum deformed framework generated by the $\kappa$-Poincar\'{e}-Hopf algebra is considered. The problem is formulated using the $\kappa$-deformed Dirac equation. The resulting theory reveals that the energies and wave functions of the oscillator are modified by the deformation parameter.
