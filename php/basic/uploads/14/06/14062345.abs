Title: The Continuous Orbifold of N=2 Minimal Model Holography
Authors: Matthias R. Gaberdiel and Maximilian Kelm
Abstract: For the N=2 Kazama-Suzuki models that appear in the duality with a higher spin theory on AdS_3 it is shown that the large level limit can be interpreted as a continuous orbifold of 2N free bosons and fermions by the group U(N). In particular, we show that the subset of coset representations that correspond to the perturbative higher spin degrees of freedom are precisely described by the untwisted sector of this U(N) orbifold. We furthermore identify the twisted sector ground states of the orbifold with specific coset representations, and give various pieces of evidence in favour of this identification.
