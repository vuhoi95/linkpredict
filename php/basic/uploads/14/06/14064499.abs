Title: Off-shell structure of twisted (2,0) theory
Authors: Ulf Gran and Hampus Linander and Bengt E. W. Nilsson
Abstract: A $Q$-exact off-shell action is constructed for twisted abelian (2,0) theory on a Lorentzian six-manifold of the form $M_{1,5} = C\times M_4$, where $C$ is a flat two-manifold and $M_4$ is a general Euclidean four-manifold. The properties of this formulation, which is obtained by introducing two auxiliary fields, can be summarised by a commutative diagram where the Lagrangian and its stress-tensor arise from the $Q$-variation of two fermionic quantities $V$ and $\lambda^{\mu\nu}$. This completes and extends the analysis in [arXiv:1311.3300].
