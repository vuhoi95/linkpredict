Title: Energy-momentum conservation laws in Finsler/Kawaguchi Lagrangian  formulation
Authors: Takayoshi Ootsuka and Ryoko Yahagi and Muneyuki Ishida and Erico Tanaka
Abstract: We reformulate the standard Lagrangian formalism to a reparameterisation invariant Lagrangian formalism by means of Finsler and Kawaguchi geometry. In our formalism, various types of symmetries that appears in theories of physics are expressed geometrically by symmetries of Finsler (Kawaguchi) metric, and the conservation law of energy-momentum is a part of Euler-Lagrange equations. The application to scalar field, Dirac field, electromagnetic field and general relativity coupled to perfect fluid (added: ver.3) are discussed. By this formalism, we try to propose an alternative definition of energy-momentum current of gravity.
