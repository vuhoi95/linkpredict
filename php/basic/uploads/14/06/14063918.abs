Abstract: We study the timelike geodesics and geodesic deviation for a two-dimensional stringy blackhole spacetime in Schwarzschild gauge. We have analyzed the properties of effective potential along with the structure of the possible orbits for test particles with different settings of blackhole parameters. The exactly solvable geodesic deviation equation is used to obtain corresponding deviation vector. The nature of deviation and tidal force is also examined in view of the behavior of corresponding deviation vector.The results are also compared with an another two-dimensional stringy blackhole spacetime.
