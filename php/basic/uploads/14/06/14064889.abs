Title: Holographic Reconstruction of General Bulk Surfaces
Authors: Bartlomiej Czech and Xi Dong and James Sully
Abstract: We propose a reconstruction of general bulk surfaces in any dimension in terms of the differential entropy in the boundary field theory. In particular, we extend the proof of Headrick et al. to calculate the area of a general class of surfaces, which have a 1-parameter foliation over a closed manifold. The area can be written in terms of extremal surfaces whose boundaries lie on ring-like regions in the field theory. We discuss when this construction has a description in terms of spatial entanglement entropy and suggest lessons for a more complete and covariant approach.
