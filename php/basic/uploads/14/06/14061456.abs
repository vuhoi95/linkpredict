Title: Fermi-bounce cosmology and the fermion curvaton mechanism
Authors: Stephon Alexander and Yi-Fu Cai and Antonino Marciano
Abstract: A nonsingular bouncing cosmology can be achieved by introducing a fermion field with BCS condensation occurring at high energy scales. In this paper we are able to dilute the anisotropic stress near the bounce by means of releasing the gap energy density near the phase transition between the radiation and condensate states. In order to explain the nearly scale-invariant CMB spectrum, another fermion field is required. We investigate one possible curvaton mechanism by involving one another fermion field without condensation where the mass is lighter than the background field. We show that, by virtue of the fermion curvaton mechanism, our model can satisfy the latest cosmological observations very well, and that the fermion species involved may realize a cosmological see-saw mechanism after one finely tunes model parameters.
