Title: Scattering amplitudes in Lifshitz spacetime
Authors: Tomas Andrade and Yang Lei and Simon F. Ross
Abstract: We consider the calculation of scattering amplitudes in field theories dual to Lifshitz spacetimes. These amplitudes provide an interesting probe of the IR structure of the field theory; our aim is to use them to explore the observable consequences of the singularity in the spacetime. We assume the amplitudes can be related by T-duality to a Wilson loop, as in the AdS case, and determine the bulk minimal surfaces for the simplest cusp Wilson loop. We use this to determine the leading IR singularity in the amplitude. We find there is a stronger IR singularity for z >1 than for z=1, with a coefficient which vanishes as z goes to 1.
