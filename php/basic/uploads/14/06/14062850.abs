Title: Gravitational waves with torsion in 3D
Authors: M. Blagojević and B. Cvetković
Abstract: We study gravitational waves with torsion as exact vacuum solutions of three-dimensional gravity with propagating torsion. The new solutions are a natural generalization of the plane-fronted gravitational waves in general relativity with a cosmological constant, in the presence of matter.
