Title: Deformed one-loop amplitudes in N = 4 super-Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Johannes Broedel and Marius de Leeuw and Matteo Rosso
Abstract: We investigate Yangian-invariant deformations of one-loop amplitudes in N = 4 super-Yang-Mills theory employing an algebraic representation of amplitudes. In this language, we reproduce the deformed massless box integral describing the deformed four-point one-loop amplitude and compare different realizations of said amplitude.
