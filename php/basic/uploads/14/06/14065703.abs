Abstract: In this work, we consider the possibility of expanding wormholes in higher-dimensions, which is an important ingredient of modern theories of fundamental physics. An important motivation is that non-trivial topological objects such as microscopic wormholes may have been enlarged to macroscopic sizes in an expanding inflationary cosmological background. Since the Ricci scalar is only a function of time in standard cosmological models, we use this property as a simplifying assumption. More specifically, we consider a particular class of wormhole solutions corresponding to the choice of a spatially homogeneous Ricci scalar. The possibility of obtaining solutions with normal and exotic matter is explored and we find a variety of solutions including those in four dimensions that satisfy the null energy condition (NEC) in specific time intervals. In particular, for five dimensions, we find solutions that satisfy the NEC throughout the respective evolution.
