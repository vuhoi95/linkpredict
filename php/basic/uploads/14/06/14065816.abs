Abstract: We investigate the chaotic behavior of a circular test string in the Lifshitz spacetimes considering the critical exponent $z$ as an external control parameter. It is demonstrated that two primary tools to observe chaos in this system are Poincar\'{e} section and Lyapunov exponent. Finally, the numerical result shows that if $z=1$, the string dynamics is regular, while in a case slightly larger than $z=1$, the dynamics can be irregular and chaotic.
