Title: Thermo-electric transport in gauge/gravity models with momentum  dissipation
Authors: Andrea Amoretti and Alessandro Braggio and Nicola Maggiore and Nicodemo Magnoli and Daniele Musso
Abstract: We present a systematic definition and analysis of the thermo-electric linear response in gauge/gravity systems focusing especially on models with massive gravity in the bulk and therefore momentum dissipation in the dual field theory. A precise treatment of finite counter-terms proves to be essential to yield a consistent physical picture whose hydrodynamic and beyond-hydrodynamics behaviors noticeably match with field theoretical expectations. The model furnishes a possible gauge/gravity description of the crossover from the quantum-critical to the disorder-dominated Fermi-liquid behaviors, as expected in graphene.
