Abstract: We derive the non-perturbative worldsheet S matrix for fundamental excitations of Type IIB superstring theory on AdS_3 x S^3 x T^4 with Ramond-Ramond flux. To this end, we study the off-shell symmetry algebra of the theory and its representations. We use these to determine the S matrix up to scalar factors and we derive the crossing equations that these scalar factors satisfy. Our treatment automatically includes fundamental massless excitations, removing a long-standing obstacle in using integrability to study the AdS_3/CFT_2 correspondence. The present paper contains a detailed derivation of results first announced in arXiv:1403.4543.
