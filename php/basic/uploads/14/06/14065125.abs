Authors: S. Pakuliak and E. Ragoucy and N. A. Slavnov
Abstract: We obtain determinant representations for the form factors of the monodromy matrix entries in quantum integrable models solvable by the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz and possessing $GL(3)$-invariant $R$-matrix. These representations can be used for the calculation of correlation functions in the models of physical interest.
