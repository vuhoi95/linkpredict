Title: Quantum Phase Transitions in Mass-Deformed ABJM Matrix Model
Authors: Louise Anderson and Konstantin Zarembo
Abstract: When mass-deformed ABJM theory is considered on S(3), the partition function of the theory localises and is given by a matrix model. We solve this model at large-N in the decompactification limit, where the radius of the three-sphere is taken to infinity. In this limit, the theory exhibits a rich phase structure with an infinite number of third-order quantum phase transitions accumulating at strong coupling.
