Title: Non-commutativity from exact renormalization group dualities
Authors: Sunandan Gangopadhyay and Frederik G Scholtz
Abstract: Here we demonstrate, firstly, the construction of dualities using the exact renormalization group approach and, secondly, that spatial non-commutativity can emerge as such a duality. This is done in a simple quantum mechanical setting that establishes an exact duality between the commutative and non-commutative quantum Hall systems with harmonic interactions. It is also demonstrated that this link can be understood as a blocking (coarse graining) transformation in time that relates commutative and non-commutative degrees of freedom.
