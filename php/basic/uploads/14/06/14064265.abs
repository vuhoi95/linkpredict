Title: Kinetic Term Anarchy for Polynomial Chaotic Inflation
Authors: Kazunori Nakayama and Fuminobu Takahashi and Tsutomu T. Yanagida
Abstract: We argue that there may arise a relatively flat inflaton potential over super-Planckian field values with an approximate shift symmetry, if the coefficients of the kinetic terms for many singlet scalars are subject to a certain random distribution. The inflaton potential generically contains various shift-symmetry breaking terms, leading to a possibly large deviation of the predicted values of the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio from those of the simple quadratic chaotic inflation. We revisit a polynomial chaotic inflation in supergravity as such.
