Title: Holographic Superconductors in Horava-Lifshitz Gravity
Authors: Kai Lin and Elcio Abdalla and Anzhong Wang
Abstract: We consider holographic superconductors related to the Schwarzschild black hole in the low energy limit of Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz spacetime. The non-relativistic electromagnetic and scalar fields are introduced to construct a holographic superconductor model in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity and the results show that the $\alpha_2$ term plays an important role, modifying the conductivity curve line by means of an attenuation the conductivity.
