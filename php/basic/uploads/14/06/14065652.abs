Title: Noether Symmetry Approach in Gauss-Bonnet Cosmology
Authors: Salvatore Capozziello and Mariafelicia De Laurentis and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: We discuss the Noether Symmetry Approach in the framework of Gauss-Bonnet cosmology showing that the functional form of the $F(R, {\cal G})$ function, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar and ${\cal G}$ is the Gauss-Bonnet topological invariant, can be determined by the presence of symmetries. Besides, the method allows to find out exact solutions due to the reduction of cosmological dynamical system and the presence of conserved quantities. Some specific cosmological models are worked out
