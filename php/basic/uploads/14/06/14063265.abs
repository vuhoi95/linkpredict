Title: A Solution of the Relativistic Schrödinger Equation for the  $δ$-Function Potential in 1-dimensiona with Cutoff Regularization
Authors: M. H. Al-Hashimi and Abouzeid M. Shalaby
Abstract: We study the solution of the relativistic Schr\"odinger equation for a point particle in 1-d under $\delta$-function potential by using cutoff regularization. We show that the problem is renormalizable, and the results are exactly the same as the ones obtained using dimensional regularization.
