Title: T-duality diagram for a weakly curved background
Authors: Ljubica Davidović and Bojan Nikolić and Branislav Sazdović
Abstract: In one of our previous papers we generalized the Buscher T-dualization procedure. Here we will investigate the application of this procedure to the theory of a bosonic string moving in the weakly curved background. We obtain the complete T-dualization diagram, connecting the theories which are the result of the T-dualizations over all possible choices of the coordinates. We distinguish three forms of the T-dual theories: the initial theory, the theory obtained T-dualizing some of the coordinates of the initial theory and the theory obtained T-dualizing all of the initial coordinates. While the initial theory is geometric, all the other theories are non geometric and additionally nonlocal. We find the T-dual coordinate transformation laws connecting these theories and show that the set of all T-dualizations forms an Abelian group.
