Title: Tunneling across the quantum horizon does not resolve the information  paradox
Authors: Avik Roy and Moinul Hossain Rahat
Abstract: Parikh and Wilczek formulated Hawking radiation as quantum tunneling across the event horizon proving the spectrum to be nonthermal. These nonthermality factors emerging due to back reaction effects have been claimed to be responsible for correlations among the emitted quanta. It has been proposed by several authors in literature that these correlations actually carry out information locked in a black hole and hence provide a resolution to the long debated black hole information paradox. This paper demonstrates that this is a fallacious proposition. Finally, it formulates the implications of the no-hair theorem in the context of Parikh-Wilczek spectrum.
