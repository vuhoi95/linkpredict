Title: Ambiguities of the CPT-even aether-like Lorentz-breaking term at the  finite temperature
Authors: T. Mariz and J. R. Nascimento and A. Yu. Petrov and W. Serafim
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the finite temperature behaviour of the CPT-even aether-like Lorentz-breaking term in the extended Lorentz-breaking QED and demonstrate that its ambiguities whose presence has been shown earlier in the zero temperature case stay also at the finite temperature.
