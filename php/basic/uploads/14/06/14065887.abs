Title: Cosmological Solutions in Nonlocal Models
Authors: Alexey S. Koshelev and Sergey Yu. Vernov
Abstract: A non-local modified gravity model with an analytic function of the d'Alembert operator that has been proposed as a possible way of resolving the singularities problems in cosmology is considered. We show that the anzats that is usually used to obtain exact solutions in this model provides a connection with $f(R)$ gravity models.
