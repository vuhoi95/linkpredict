Title: Born-Infeld gravity and its functional extensions
Authors: Sergei D. Odintsov and Gonzalo J. Olmo and D. Rubiera-Garcia
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a family of functional extensions of the (Eddington-inspired) Born-Infeld gravity theory, constructed with the inverse of the metric and the Ricci tensor. We provide a generic formal solution for the connection and an Einstein-like representation for the metric field equations of this family of theories. For particular cases we consider applications to the early-time cosmology and find that non-singular universes with a cosmic bounce are very generic and robust solutions.
