Authors: Yuhma Asano and Goro Ishiki and Shinji Shimasaki
Abstract: We study the gauge/gravity duality between bubbling geometries in type IIA supergravity and gauge theories with SU(2|4) symmetry, which consist of N=4 super Yang-Mills on $R\times S^3/Z_k$, N=8 super Yang-Mills on $R\times S^2$ and the plane wave matrix model. We show that the geometries are realized as field configurations in the strong coupling region of the gauge theories. On the gravity side, the bubbling geometries can be mapped to electrostatic systems with conducting disks. We derive integral equations which determine the charge densities on the disks. On the gauge theory side, we obtain a matrix integral by applying the localization to a 1/4-BPS sector of the gauge theories. The eigenvalue densities of the matrix integral turn out to satisfy the same integral equations as the charge densities on the gravity side. Thus we find that these two objects are equivalent.
