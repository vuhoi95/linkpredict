Title: Higher Poincare Lemma and Integrability
Authors: Getachew Alemu Demessie and Christian Saemann
Abstract: We prove the non-abelian Poincare lemma in higher gauge theory in two different ways. The first method uses a result by Jacobowitz which states solvability conditions for differential equations of a certain type. The second method extends a proof by Voronov and yields the explicit gauge parameters connecting a flat local connective structure to the trivial one. Finally, we show how higher flatness appears as a necessary integrability condition of a linear system which featured in recently developed twistor descriptions of higher gauge theories.
