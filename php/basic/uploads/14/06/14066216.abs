Title: Cosmological evolution of quintessence with a sign-changing interaction  in dark sector
Authors: Ming Zhang and Cheng-Yi Sun and Zhan-Ying Yang and Rui-Hong Yue
Abstract: By analysing the cosmological dynamical system with a dark-sector interaction which changes sign during the cosmological evolution, we find a scaling attractor to help to alleviate the cosmic-coincidence problem. This result shows that this interaction can bring new features to the cosmology.
