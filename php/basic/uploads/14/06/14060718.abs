Title: Chiral fermions as classical massless spinning particles
Authors: C. Duval and P. A. Horvathy
Abstract: Semiclassical chiral fermion models with Berry term are studied in a symplectic framework. In the free case, the system can be obtained from Souriau's model for a relativistic massless spinning particle by "enslaving" the spin. The Berry term is identified with the classical spin two-form of the latter model. The Souriau model carries a natural Poincar\'e symmetry that we highlight, but spin enslavement breaks the boost symmetry. However the relation between the models allows us to derive a Poincare symmetry of unconventional form for chiral fermions. Then we couple our system to an external electromagnetic field. For gyromagnetic ratio $g=0$ we get curious superluminal Hall-type motions; for $g=2$ and in a pure constant magnetic field in particular, we find instead spiraling motions.
