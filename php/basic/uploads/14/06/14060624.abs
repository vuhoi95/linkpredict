Title: Brane cosmology in teleparallel and $f(T)$ gravity
Authors: K. Atazadeh and A. Eghbali
Abstract: We consider the cosmology of a brane-world scenario in the framework of teleparallel and $f(T)$ gravity in a way that matter is localized on the brane. We show that the cosmology of such branes is different from the standard cosmology in teleparallelism. In particular, we obtain a class of new solutions with a constant five-dimensional radius and cosmologically evolving brane in the context of constant torsion $f(T)$ gravity.
