Title: Instanton moduli spaces and $\mathscr W$-algebras
Authors: Alexander Braverman and Michael Finkelberg and Hiraku Nakajima
Abstract: We describe the (equivariant) intersection cohomology of certain moduli spaces ("framed Uhlenbeck spaces") together with some structures on them (such as e.g.\ the Poincar\'e pairing) in terms of representation theory of some vertex operator algebras ("$\mathscr W$-algebras").
