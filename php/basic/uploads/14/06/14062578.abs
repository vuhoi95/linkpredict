Title: Graph Theory and Qubit Information Systems of Extremal Black Branes
Authors: Adil Belhaj and Moulay Brahim Sedra and Antonio Segui
Abstract: Using graph theory based on Adinkras, we consider once again the study of extremal black branes in the framework of quantum information. More precisely, we propose a one to one correspondence between qubit systems, Adinkras and certain extremal black branes obtained from type IIA superstring compactified on T^n. We accordingly interpret the real Hodge diagram of T^n as the geometry of a class of Adinkras formed by 2^n bosonic nodes representing n qubits. In this graphic representation, each node encodes information on the qubit quantum states and the charges of the extremal black branes built on T^n. The correspondence is generalized to n superqubits associated with odd and even geometries on the real supermanifold T^{n|n}. Using a combinatorial computation, general expressions describing the number of the bosonic and the fermionic states are obtained.
