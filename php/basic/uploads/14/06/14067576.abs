Title: Structure functions in deep inelastic scattering from gauge/string  duality beyond single-hadron final states
Authors: Jian-Hua Gao and Zong-Gang Mou
Abstract: We study deep inelastic scattering at large-'t Hooft coupling and finite $x$ from gauge/string duality beyond single-hadron final states which gives the leading large-$N_c$ contribution. Within the supergravity approximation, we calculate the subleading large-$N_c$ contribution by introducing an extra hadron into the final states. We find the contribution from these double-hadron final states will dominate in the Bjorken limit $q^2\rightarrow \infty$ compared with the single-hadron states. We discuss the implications of our results.
