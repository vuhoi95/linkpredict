Title: Cosmological constant as confining U(1) charge in two-dimensional  dilaton gravity
Authors: Daniel Grumiller and Robert McNees and Jakob Salzer
Abstract: The cosmological constant is treated as a thermodynamical parameter in the framework of two-dimensional dilaton gravity. We find that the cosmological constant behaves as a U(1) charge with a confining potential, and that such potentials require a novel Born-Infeld boundary term in the action. The free energy and other thermodynamical quantities of interest are derived, from first principles, in a way that is essentially model-independent. We discover that there is always a Schottky anomaly in the specific heat and explain its physical origin. Finally, we apply these results to specific examples, like Anti-de Sitter-Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black holes, Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black holes and the Jackiw-Teitelboim model.
