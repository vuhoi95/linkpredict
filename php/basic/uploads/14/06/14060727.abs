Abstract: We develop a formalism to construct supersymmetric backgrounds within the superspace formulation for five-dimensional (5D) conformal supergravity given in arXiv:0802.3953. Our approach is applicable to any off-shell formulation for 5D minimal Poincare and anti-de Sitter supergravity theories realized as the Weyl multiplet coupled with two compensators. For those superspace backgrounds which obey the equations of motion for (gauged) supergravity, we naturally reproduce the supersymmetric solutions constructed a decade ago by Gauntlett et al. For certain supersymmetric backgrounds with eight supercharges, we construct a large family of off-shell supersymmetric sigma models such that the superfield Lagrangian is given in terms of the Kahler potential of a real analytic Kahler manifold.
