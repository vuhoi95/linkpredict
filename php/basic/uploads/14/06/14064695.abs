Abstract: In the framework of $Sp(2)$ extended Lagrangian field-antifield BV formalism we study systematically the role of finite field-dependent BRST-BV transformations. We have proved that the Jacobian of a finite BRST-BV transformation is capable of generating arbitrary finite change of the gauge-fixing function in the path integral.
