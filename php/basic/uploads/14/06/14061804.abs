Title: A new spin on entanglement entropy
Authors: Eliot Hijano and Per Kraus
Abstract: We argue that the usual notions of thermodynamic and entanglement entropy have novel analogs in the context of higher spin theories. In particular, the Wald and Ryu-Takayanagi formulas have natural higher spin extensions that we work out and study. On the CFT side, just as standard entanglement entropy in CFT_2 can be computed from twist field correlators, we demonstrate that by introducing corresponding operators carrying higher spin charge we can precisely reproduce our results from the bulk. We also show that the first law for entanglement entropy implies the linearized field equations for the metric and higher spin fields, generalizing recent work on deriving the linearized Einstein equations from the first law.
