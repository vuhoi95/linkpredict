Title: Rotating-Moving D-Branes with Background Fields in the Superstring  Theory
Authors: Farzin Safarzadeh-Maleki and Davoud Kamani
Abstract: Using the boundary state formalism we study rotating and moving D$p$-branes in the presence of the following background fields: Kalb-Ramond, $U(1)$ gauge potential and the tachyon field. The rotation and motion are in the brane volumes. The interaction amplitude of two D$p$-branes will be studied, and specially contribution of the superstring massless modes will be segregated. Because of the tachyon fields, rotations and velocities of the branes, the behavior of the interaction amplitude reveals obvious differences from what is conventional.
