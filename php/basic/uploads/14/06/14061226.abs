Title: String Fluid in Local Equilibrium
Authors: Daniel Schubring and Vitaly Vanchurin
Abstract: We study the solutions of string fluid equations under assumption of a local equilibrium which was previously obtained in the context of the kinetic theory. We show that the fluid can be foliated into non-interacting submanifolds whose equations of motion are exactly that of the wiggly strings considered previously by Vilenkin and Carter. In a special case of negligible statistical variance in either the left or the right-moving directions of microscopic strings, the submanifolds are described by the action of chiral strings proposed by Witten. When both variances vanish the submanifolds are described by the Nambu-Goto action and the string fluid reduces to the string dust introduced by Stachel.
