Title: A Simple Holographic Model of a Charged Lattice
Authors: Francesco Aprile and Takaaki Ishii
Abstract: We use holography to compute the conductivity in an inhomogeneous charged scalar background. We work in the probe limit of the four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory coupled to a charged scalar. The background has zero charge density and is constructed by turning on a scalar source deformation with a striped profile. We solve for fluctuations by making use of a Fourier series expansion. This approach turns out to be useful for understanding which couplings become important in our inhomogeneous background. At zero temperature, the conductivity is computed analytically in a small amplitude expansion. At finite temperature, it is computed numerically by truncating the Fourier series to a relevant set of modes. In the real part of the conductivity along the direction of the stripe, we find a Drude-like peak and a delta function with a negative weight. These features are understood from the point of view of spectral weight transfer.
