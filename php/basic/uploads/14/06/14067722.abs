Title: Revisiting constraints on (pseudo)conformal Universe with Planck data
Authors: G. I. Rubtsov and S. R. Ramazanov
Abstract: We revisit constraints on the (pseudo)conformal Universe from the non-observation of statistical anisotropy in the Planck data. The quadratic maximal likelihood estimator is applied to the Planck temperature maps at frequencies 143 GHz and 217 GHz as well as their cross-correlation. The strongest constraint is obtained in the scenario of the (pseudo)conformal Universe with a long intermediate evolution after conformal symmetry breaking. In terms of the relevant parameter (coupling constant), the limit is h^2 <0.0013 at 95% C.L. (using the cross-estimator). The analogous limit is much weaker in the scenario without the intermediate stage (h^2 \ln \frac{H_0}{\Lambda}<0.52) allowing the coupling constant to be of order one. In the latter case, the non-Gaussianity in the 4-point function appears to be a more promising signature.
