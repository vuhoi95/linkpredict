Title: The Minimal Length and the Quantum Partition Functions
Authors: M. Abbasiyan-Motlaq and Pouria Pedram
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of various physical systems in the framework of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle that implies a minimal length uncertainty proportional to the Planck length. We present a general scheme to analytically calculate the quantum partition function of the physical systems to first order of the deformation parameter based on the behavior of the modified energy spectrum and compare our results with the classical approach. Also, we find the modified internal energy and heat capacity of the systems for the anti-Snyder framework.
