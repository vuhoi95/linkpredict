Title: Measuring motion through relativistic quantum effects
Authors: Aida Ahmadzadegan and Robert B. Mann and Eduardo Martin-Martinez
Abstract: We show that the relativistic signatures on the transition probability of atoms moving through optical cavities are very sensitive to their spatial trajectory. This allows for the use of internal atomic degrees of freedom to measure small time-dependent perturbations in the proper acceleration of an atomic probe, or in the relative alignment of a beam of atoms and a cavity.
