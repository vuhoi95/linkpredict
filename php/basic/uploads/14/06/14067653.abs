Title: Inhomogeneous viscous dark fluid coupled with dark matter in the FRW  universe
Authors: E. Elizalde and V. V. Obukhov and A. V. Timoshkin
Abstract: A cosmological model with an inhomogeneous viscous dark fluid coupled with dark matter in a flat Friedman-Robertson-Walker universe is investigated. The influence of dark matter on the behavior of an inhomogeneous viscous fluid of this kind, responsible for cosmic acceleration and for the appearance of different types of singularities, is analyzed in detail. In particular, the critical points corresponding to the solutions of the background equations in a useful approximation are obtained explicitly.
