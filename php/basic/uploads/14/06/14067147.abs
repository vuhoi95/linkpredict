Title: Multiple Single-Centered Attractors
Authors: Pramod Dominic and Taniya Mandal and Prasanta K. Tripathy
Abstract: In this paper we study spherically symmetric single-centered attractors in N=2 supergravity in four dimensions. The attractor points are obtained by extremising the effective black hole potential in the moduli space. Using the 4D-5D correspondence of critical points of the effective black hole potential we argue the existence of multiple attractors in four dimensions and explicitly construct a pair of multiple solutions in a simple two parameter model. We further obtain explicit examples of two distinct non-supersymmetric attractors in type IIA string theory compactified on K3 X T2 carrying D0-D4-D6 charges. We compute the entropy of these attractors and analyse their stability in detail.
