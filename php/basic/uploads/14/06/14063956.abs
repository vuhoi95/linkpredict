Title: Dyonic string-like solution in a non-Abelian gauge theory with two  potentials
Authors: Buddhi Vallabh Tripathi and Hemwati Nandan and K D Purohit
Abstract: Axially symmetric dyon solutions of a non-Abelian gauge theory model with two potentials are sought. While seeking axially symmetric (flux tube like solutions) for the model, we stumbled upon an exact solution which represents an infinite string-like dyonic configuration with cylindrical symmetry.
