Title: Holographic Signatures of Cosmological Singularities
Authors: Netta Engelhardt and Thomas Hertog and Gary T. Horowitz
Abstract: To gain insight in the quantum nature of cosmological singularities, we study anisotropic Kasner solutions in gauge/gravity duality. The dual description of the bulk evolution towards the singularity involves N = 4 super Yang-Mills on the expanding branch of deformed de Sitter space and is well defined. We compute two-point correlators of Yang-Mills operators of large dimensions using spacelike geodesics anchored on the boundary. The correlators show a strong signature of the singularity around horizon scales and decay at large boundary separation at different rates in different directions. More generally, the boundary evolution exhibits a process of particle creation similar to that in inflation. This leads us to conjecture that information on the quantum nature of cosmological singularities is encoded in long-wavelength features of the boundary wave function.
