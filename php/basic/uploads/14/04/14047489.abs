Authors: Hai Lin and K. Saifullah and Shing-Tung Yau
Abstract: We consider spin-3/2 particles on the background of general accelerating black holes and C-metric. The Rarita-Schwinger equations of spin-3/2 particles are analyzed on these backgrounds. The emission and absorption probabilities of the spin-3/2 particles on these spacetimes are calculated. These backgrounds which we analyze contain both black hole horizon and acceleration horizon, and have general electric and magnetic charges, rotation, and acceleration parameter. The properties of the spin-3/2 field near the acceleration horizon are also computed.
