Abstract: We discuss the extended BRST and anti-BRST symmetry (including shift symmetry) in the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formulation for the Chern-Simons (CS) theories in $(2+1)$ spacetime dimensions. Further we develop the superspace description of BV formulation for such theories. Interestingly, the extended BRST invariant CS theories can be described in superspace in covariant manner with the help of one more (Grassmann) coordinate. However, a superspace with two Grassmann coordinates are required for a manifestly covariant formulation of the extended BRST and extended anti-BRST invariant actions for these theories.
