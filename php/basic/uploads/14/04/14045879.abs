Title: Large tensor-to-scalar ratio from Composite Inflation
Authors: Phongpichit Channuie and Khamphee Karwan
Abstract: The claimed detection of the BICEP2 experiment on the primordial B-mode of cosmic microwave background polarization suggests that cosmic inflation possibly takes place at the energy around the grand unified theory scale given a constraint on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. i.e., $r\simeq 0.20$. In this report, we revisit single-field (slow-roll) composite inflation and show that, with the proper choice of parameters and sizeable number of e-foldings, a large tensor-to-scalar ratio consistent with the recent BICEP2 results can be significantly produced with regard to the composite paradigms.
