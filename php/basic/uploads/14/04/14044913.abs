Title: Nonlinearity in Electro- and Magneto-statics with and without External  Field
Authors: T. C. Adorno and Caio Costa and D. M. Gitman and A. E. Shabad
Abstract: Due to the nonlinearity of QED, a static charge becomes a magnetic dipole if placed in a magnetic field. Already without external field, the cubic Maxwell equation for the field of a point charge has a soliton solution with a finite field energy. Equations are given for self-coupling dipole moments. Any theoretically found value for a multipole moment of a baryon or a meson should be subjected to nonlinear renormalization.
