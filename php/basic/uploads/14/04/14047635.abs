Title: U-dual branes and mixed symmetry tensor fields
Authors: Athanasios Chatzistavrakidis and Fridrik Freyr Gautason
Abstract: We review and explain the relation between U-dual branes in string theory and mixed symmetry tensors of various degrees. In certain cases these mixed symmetry tensors can be related to diverse types of fluxes that play an important role in compactifications of string theory.
