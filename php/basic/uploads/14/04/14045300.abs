Title: $\mathcal{N}=1$ Superconformal Blocks for General Scalar Operators
Authors: Zuhair U. Khandker and Daliang Li and David Poland and David Simmons-Duffin
Abstract: We use supershadow methods to derive new expressions for superconformal blocks in 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories. We analyze the four-point function $\langle\mathcal{A}_1 \mathcal{A}_2^\dagger \mathcal{B}_1 \mathcal{B}_2^\dagger\rangle$, where $\mathcal{A}_i$ and $\mathcal{B}_i$ are scalar superconformal primary operators with arbitrary dimension and $R$-charge and the exchanged operator is neutral under $R$-symmetry. Previously studied superconformal blocks for chiral operators and conserved currents are special cases of our general results.
