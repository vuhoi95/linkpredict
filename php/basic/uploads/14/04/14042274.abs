Abstract: In this follow-up to our paper from 2005, we briefly discuss the implications of the apparent detection of B modes in the Cosmic Microwave Background for the issues raised in that paper. We argue that under the assumptions of eternal inflation, there is now stronger support for the detectability of a Coleman-De Luccia bubble nucleation event in our past. In particular, the odds that the spatial curvature of the universe is large enough to be detectable by near future experiments are increased.
