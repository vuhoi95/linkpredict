Title: Lorentz Invariance in Shape Dynamics
Authors: S. Carlip and H. Gomes
Abstract: Shape dynamics is a reframing of canonical general relativity in which time reparametrization invariance is "traded" for a local conformal invariance. We explore the emergence of Lorentz invariance in this model in three contexts: as a maximal symmetry, an asymptotic symmetry, and a local invariance.
