Title: Pure Geometric Field Theory: Description of Gravity and Material  Distribution
Authors: M. I. Wanas and Nabil L. Youssef and W. El Hanafy
Abstract: A field theory is constructed in the context of parameterized absolute parallelism\linebreak geometry. The theory is shown to be a pure gravity one. It is capable of describing the gravitational field and a material distribution in terms of the geometric structure of the geometry used (the parallelization vector fields). Three tools are used to attribute physical properties to the geometric objects admitted by the theory. Poisson and Laplace equations are obtained in the linearized version of the theory. The spherically symmetric solution of the theory, in free space, is found to coincide with the Schwarzschild exterior solution of the general theory of relativity. The theory respects the weak equivalence principle in free space only. Gravity and material distribution are not minimally coupled.
