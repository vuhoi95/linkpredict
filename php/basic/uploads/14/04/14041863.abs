Title: Spectral Measures for $G_2$
Authors: David E. Evans and Mathew Pugh
Abstract: Spectral measures provide invariants for braided subfactors via fusion modules. In this paper we study joint spectral measures associated to the rank two Lie group $G_2$, including the McKay graphs for the irreducible representations of $G_2$ and its maximal torus, and fusion modules associated to all known $G_2$ modular invariants.
