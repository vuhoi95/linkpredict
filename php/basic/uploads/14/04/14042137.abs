Title: Nonlocal quantum gravity and M-theory
Authors: Gianluca Calcagni and Leonardo Modesto
Abstract: We construct a ultraviolet completion of the bosonic sector of 11-dimensional supergravity motivated by string field theory. We start from a general class of theories characterized by an entire nonpolynomial form factor which allows one to avoid new poles in the propagator and improves the high-energy behavior of the loops amplitudes. Comparing these models with effective string field theory, a unique form factor is selected out. In view of this, we modify 10-dimensional supergravity and finally get a ultraviolet completion of 11-dimensional supergravity by an oxidation process. The result is a candidate for a finite and unitary particle-field limit of M-theory.
