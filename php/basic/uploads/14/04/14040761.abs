Title: Thermal Spectral Function and Deconfinement Temperature in Bulk  Holographic AdS/QCD with Back Reaction of Bulk Vacuum
Authors: Ling-Xiao Cui and Zhen Fang and Yue-Liang Wu
Abstract: Based on the IR-improved bulk holographic AdS/QCD model which provides a consistent prediction for the mass spectra of resonance scalar, pseudoscalar, vector and axial vector mesons, we investigate its finite temperature behavior. By analyzing the spectral function of mesons and fitting it with a Breit-Wigner form, we perform an analysis for the critical temperature of mesons. The back-reaction effects of bulk vacuum are considered, the thermal mass spectral function of resonance mesons is calculated based on the back-reaction improved action. A reasonable melting temperature is found to be $T_c \simeq 150 \pm 7$ MeV, which is consistent with the recent results from lattice QCD simulations.
