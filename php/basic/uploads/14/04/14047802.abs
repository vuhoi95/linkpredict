Title: Rational Curves and (0,2)-Deformations
Authors: Paul S. Aspinwall and Benjamin Gaines
Abstract: We compare the count of (0,2)-deformation moduli fields for N=(2,2) conformal field theories on orbifolds and sigma-models on resolutions of the orbifold. The latter involves counting deformations of the tangent sheaf. We see there is generally a discrepancy which is expected to be explained by worldsheet instanton corrections coming from rational curves in the orbifold resolution. We analyze the rational curves on the resolution to determine such corrections and discover that irreducible toric rational curves account for some, but not all, of the discrepancy. In particular, this proves that there must be worldsheet instanton corrections beyond those from smooth isolated rational curves.
