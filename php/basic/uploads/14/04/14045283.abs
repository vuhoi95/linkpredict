Title: $Î²$-deformation on a slanted torus and deformed pp-wave
Authors: Ariunzul Dagvadorj and Sunyoung Shin
Abstract: We discuss the $\beta$-deformation of $AdS_5\times S^5$ which incorporates the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ symmetry of the type IIB theory. The axion-dilaton is identified with a two-torus from an eleven dimensional viewpoint. We consider the null geodesic with equal component angular momenta to take the Penrose limit of the deformed $AdS_5\times S^5$. We study the bosonic part of the string sigma model and the spectrum of the string in the pp-wave background.
