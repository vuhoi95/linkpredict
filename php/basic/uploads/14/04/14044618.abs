Title: Universal Topological Data for Gapped Quantum Liquids in Three  Dimensions and Fusion Algebra for Non-Abelian String Excitations
Authors: Heidar Moradi and Xiao-Gang Wen
Abstract: Recently we conjectured that a certain set of universal topological quantities characterize topological order in any dimension. Those quantities can be extracted from the universal overlap of the ground state wave functions. For systems with gapped boundaries, these quantities are representations of the mapping class group $MCG(\mathcal M)$ of the space manifold $\mathcal M$ on which the systems lives. We will here consider simple examples in three dimensions and give physical interpretation of these quantities, related to fusion algebra and statistics of particle and string excitations. In particular, we will consider dimensional reduction from 3+1D to 2+1D, and show how the induced 2+1D topological data contains information on the fusion and the braiding of non-Abelian string excitations in 3D. These universal quantities generalize the well-known modular $S$ and $T$ matrices to any dimension.
