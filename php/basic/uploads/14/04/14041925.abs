Authors: Luis F. Alday and Martin Fluder and Paul Richmond and James Sparks
Abstract: We present the gravity dual of large N supersymmetric gauge theories on a squashed five-sphere. The one-parameter family of solutions is constructed in Euclidean Romans F(4) gauged supergravity in six dimensions, and uplifts to massive type IIA supergravity. By renormalizing the theory with appropriate counterterms we evaluate the renormalized on-shell action for the solutions. We also evaluate the large N limit of the gauge theory partition function, and find precise agreement.
