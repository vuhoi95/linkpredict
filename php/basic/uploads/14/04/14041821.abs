Title: BICEP2 implications for single-field slow-roll inflation revisited
Authors: Stefan Antusch and David Nolde
Abstract: It is generally believed that in single-field slow-roll inflation, a large tensor-to-scalar ratio $r > 0.1$ requires inflaton field values close to or above the Planck scale. Recently, it has been claimed that $r > 0.15$ can be achieved with much smaller inflaton field values $\Delta \phi < M_{Pl}/10$. We show that in single-field slow-roll inflation, it is impossible to reconcile $r > 0.1$ with such small field values, independently of the form of the potential, and that the recent claim to the contrary is based on an invalid approximation. We conclude that the result of the BICEP2 measurement of $r > 0.1$, if confirmed, truly has the potential to rule out small-field models of single-field slow-roll inflation.
