Title: The Simple Single Field Inflation Models and the Running of Spectral  Index
Authors: Qing Gao and Yungui Gong and Tianjun Li and Ye Tian
Abstract: The BICEP2 experiment confirms the existence of primordial gravitational wave with the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r=0$ ruled out at $7\sigma$ level. The consistency of this large value of $r$ with the {\em Planck} data requires a large negative running $n'_s$ of the scalar spectral index. Herein we propose two types of the single field inflation models with simple potentials to study the possibility of the consistency of the models with the BICEP2 and {\em Planck} observations. One type of model suggested herein is realized in the supergravity model building. These models fail to provide the needed $n'_s$ even though both can fit the tensor-to-scalar ratio and spectral index.
