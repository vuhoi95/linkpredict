Title: N$^3$LO Higgs and Drell-Yan production at threshold: the one-loop  two-emission contribution
Authors: Ye Li and Andreas von Manteuffel and Robert M. Schabinger and Hua Xing Zhu
Abstract: In this paper, we study phenomenologically interesting soft radiation distributions in massless QCD. Specifically, we consider the emission of two soft partons off of a pair of light-like Wilson lines, in either the fundamental or the adjoint representation, at next-to-leading order. Our results are an essential component of the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order threshold corrections to both Higgs boson production in the gluon fusion channel and Drell-Yan lepton production. Our calculations are consistent with the recently published results for Higgs boson production. As a non-trivial cross-check on our analysis, we rederive a recent prediction for the Drell-Yan threshold cross section using a completely different strategy. Our results are compact, valid to all orders in the dimensional regularization parameter, and expressed in terms of pure functions.
