Title: Quantized gravitomagnetic charges from WIMT: cosmological consequences
Authors: Jesús Martín Romero and Mauricio Bellini
Abstract: Using the formalism of Weitzenb\"ock induced matter theory (WIMT) we calculate the gravito-magnetic charge on a topological string which is induced through a foliation on a five-dimensional (5D) gravito-electromagnetic vacuum defined on a 5D Ricci-flat metric, which produces a symmetry breaking on an axis. We obtain the resonant result that the quantized charges are induced on the effective four-dimensional hypersurface. This quantization describes the behavior of a test gravito-electric charge in the vicinity of a point gravito-magnetic monopole, both geometrically induced from a 5D vacuum. We demonstrate how gravito-magnetic monopoles would decrease exponentially during the inflationary expansion of the universe.
