Title: Rotating traversable wormholes in a noncommutative space and the energy  conditions
Authors: Everton M. C. Abreu and NÃ©lio Sasaki
Abstract: It is a very well known fact that the energy conditions concerning traversable wormhole (WH) solutions of Einstein equations are violated. Consequently, attempts to avoid the violation of the energy conditions constitutes one of the main areas of research in WH physics. On the other hand, the current literature shows us that noncommutativity is one of the most promising candidates to help us to understand the physics of the early Universe. However, since noncommutativity does not change the commutative results, we also can expect that energy conditions violation near the throat must occur. We will show here that the violation of the energy conditions, described in a noncommutative space-time, has fixed conditions on the angular momentum of a rotating WH with constant angular velocity. Also, we have established a new theoretical bound on the NC constant, $\theta$, as a function of some WH parameters.
