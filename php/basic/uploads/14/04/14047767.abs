Title: New String Theories And Their Generation Number
Authors: Arel Genish and Doron Gepner
Abstract: New heterotic string theories in four dimensions are constructed by tensoring a nonstandard SCFT along with some minimal SCFT's. All such theories are identified and their particle generation number is found. We prove that from the infinite number of new heterotic string theories only the {6} theory predicts three generations as seen in nature which makes it an interesting candidate for further study.
