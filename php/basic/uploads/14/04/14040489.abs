Title: Approaching conformal window of $O(n)\times O(m)$ symmetric  Landau-Ginzburg models from conformal bootstrap
Authors: Yu Nakayama and Tomoki Ohtsuki
Abstract: $O(n) \times O(m)$ symmetric Landau-Ginzburg models in $d=3$ dimension possess a rich structure of the renormalization group and its understanding offers a theoretical prediction of the phase diagram in frustrated spin models with non-collinear order. Depending on $n$ and $m$, they may show chiral/anti-chiral/Heisenberg/Gaussian fixed points within the same universality class. We approach all the fixed points in the conformal bootstrap program by examining the bound on the conformal dimensions for scalar operators as well as non-conserved current operators with consistency crosschecks. For large $n/m$, we show strong evidence for the existence of four fixed points by comparing the operator spectrum obtained from the conformal bootstrap program with that from the large $n/m$ analysis. We propose a novel non-perturbative approach to the determination of the conformal window in these models based on the conformal bootstrap program. From our numerical results, we predict that for $m=3$, $n=7\sim 8$ is the edge of the conformal window for the anti-chiral fixed points.
