Title: Topological Inflation with Large Tensor-to-scalar Ratio
Authors: Yu-Chieh Chung and Chunshan Lin
Abstract: BICEP2's detection on the primordial B-mode of CMB polarization suggests that inflation occurred around GUT scale, with the tensor-to-scalar ratio r~0.2. Inspired by this discosvery, we study the topological inflation which was driven by a double/single/no well potential. We show that with proper choice of parameters, all these three types of topological inflationary models could be consistent with the constraints from current observations.
