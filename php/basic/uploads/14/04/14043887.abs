Title: Anomaly polynomial of E-string theories
Authors: Kantaro Ohmori and Hiroyuki Shimizu and Yuji Tachikawa
Abstract: We determine the anomaly polynomial of the E-string theory and its higher-rank generalizations, that is, the 6d $\mathcal{N} =(1, 0)$ superconformal theories on the worldvolume of one or multiple M5-branes embedded within the end-of-the-world brane with $E_8$ symmetry.
