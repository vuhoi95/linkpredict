Title: Stable Bianchi III attractor in $U(1)_R$ gauged supergravity
Authors: Karthik Inbasekar and Rickmoy Samanta
Abstract: Bianchi attractors are homogeneous but anisotropic extremal black brane horizons. We study the $AdS_3 \times \mathbb{H}^2$ solution which is a special case of Bianchi type III in a $U(1)_R$ gauged supergravity. For a wide range of values for certain free parameters in gauged supergravity, there exist a large class of solutions that satisfy conditions for the attractor mechanism to hold. We investigate the response of the solution against linearized fluctuations of the scalar field. The sufficient conditions for the attractor mechanism ensure that there exist a solution for the scalar fluctuation which dies out at the horizon. Furthermore, we solve for the gauge field and metric fluctuations that are sourced by scalar fluctuations and show that they are well behaved near the horizon. Thus, we have an example of a stable Bianchi attractor in gauged supergravity. We also analyze the Killing spinor equations of gauged supergravity in the background of our solution. We find that a radial Killing spinor consistent with the Bianchi III symmetry breaks supersymmetry.
