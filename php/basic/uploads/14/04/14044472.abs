Title: On Quantization of AdS3 Gravity I: Semi-Classical Analysis
Authors: M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari and Hossein Yavartanoo
Abstract: In this work we explore ideas in quantizing AdS$_3$ Einstein gravity. We start with the most general solution to the 3d gravity theory which respects Brown-Henneaux boundary conditions. These solutions are specified by two holomorphic functions and satisfy simple superposition rule. These geometries generically have a bifurcate Killing horizon (with a noncompact bifurcation curve) which is not an event horizon and are hence not black holes. Nonetheless, there are superpositions of these geometries which have event horizon. We propose to view these geometries as "semiclassical fuzzball microstates" of BTZ black holes appearing as superposition of these geometries. The details of quantization of these semiclassical microstates will be discussed in an upcoming work.
