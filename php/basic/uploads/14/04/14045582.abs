Title: Deformed Hidden Conformal Symmetry for Rotating Black Holes
Authors: A. M. Ghezelbash and H. M. Siahaan
Abstract: The generic non-extremal Kerr-Newman black holes are holographically dual to hidden conformal field theories in two different pictures. The two pictures can be merged together to the CFT duals in general picture that are generated by $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ modular group. We find some extensions of the conformal symmetry generators that yield an extended local family of $SL(2,\mathbb{R})_L \times SL(2,\mathbb{R})_R$ hidden conformal symmetries for the Kerr-Newman black holes parameterized by one deformation parameter. The family of deformed hidden conformal symmetry for Kerr-Newman black holes also provides a set of deformed hidden conformal generators for the charged Reissner-Nordstrom black holes. The set of deformed hidden conformal generators reduce to the hidden $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ conformal generators for the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole for specific value of deformation parameter. We also find agreement between the macroscopic and microscopic entropy and absorption cross section of scalars for the Kerr-Newman black hole by considering the appropriate temperatures and central charges for the deformed CFTs.
