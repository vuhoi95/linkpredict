Abstract: In this work, we study an inflationary scenario in the presence of Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG). We show that in Einstein gravity, GCG is not a suitable candidate for inflation; but in a five dimensional brane world scenario, it can work as a viable inflationary model. We calculate the relevant quantities such as $n_{s}$, $r$ and $A_{s}$ related to the primordial scalar and tensor fluctuations, and using their recent bounds from Planck and BICEP2, we constrain the model parameters as well as the five-dimensional Planck mass. But as a slow-roll inflationary model with a power-law type scalar primordial power spectrum, GCG as an inflationary model can not resolve the tension between results from BICEP2 and Planck with a concordance $\Lambda$CDM Universe. We show that going beyond the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model and incorporating more general dark energy behaviour, this tension may be eased. We also obtain the constraints on the $n_{s}$ and $r$ and the GCG model parameters using Planck+WP+BICEP2 data considering the CPL dark energy behaviour.
