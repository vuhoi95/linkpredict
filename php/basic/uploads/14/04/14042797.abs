Title: Hamiltonian Approach to QCD in Coulomb Gauge: Perturbative Treatment of  the Quark Sector
Authors: Davide R. Campagnari and Hugo Reinhardt
Abstract: We study the static gluon and quark propagator of the Hamiltonian approach to Quantum Chromodynamics in Coulomb gauge in one-loop Rayleigh--Schr\"odinger perturbation theory. We show that the results agree with the equal-time limit of the four-dimensional propagators evaluated in the functional integral (Lagrangian) approach.
