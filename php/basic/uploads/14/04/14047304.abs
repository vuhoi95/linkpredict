Title: Nonassociative Field Theory on Non-Geometric Spaces
Authors: Dionysios Mylonas and Richard J. Szabo
Abstract: We describe quasi-Hopf twist deformations of flat closed string compactifications with non-geometric R-flux using a suitable cochain twist, and construct nonassociative deformations of fields and differential calculus. We report on our new findings in using this formalism to construct perturbative nonassociative field theories on these backgrounds. We describe the modifications to the usual classification of Feynman diagrams into planar and non-planar graphs. The example of phi(4) theory is studied in detail and the one-loop contributions to the two-point function are calculated.
