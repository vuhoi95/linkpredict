Title: Duality Defects
Authors: Abhijit Gadde and Sergei Gukov and Pavel Putrov
Abstract: We propose a unified approach to a general class of codimension-2 defects in field theories with non-trivial duality symmetries and discuss various constructions of such "duality defects" in diverse dimensions. In particular, in d=4 we propose a new interpretation of the Seiberg-Witten u-plane by "embedding" it in the physical space-time: we argue that it describes a BPS configuration of two duality defects (at the monopole/dyon points) and propose its vast generalization based on Lefschetz fibrations of 4-manifolds.
