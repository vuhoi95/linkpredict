Title: W Symmetry in six dimensions
Authors: Christopher Beem and Leonardo Rastelli and Balt C. van Rees
Abstract: Six-dimensional conformal field theories with $(2,0)$ supersymmetry are shown to possess a protected sector of operators and observables that are isomorphic to a two-dimensional chiral algebra. We argue that the chiral algebra associated to a $(2,0)$ theory labelled by the simply-laced Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is precisely the W algebra of type $\mathfrak{g}$, for a specific value of the central charge. Simple examples of observables that are made accessible by this correspondence are the three-point functions of half-BPS operators. For the $A_n$ series, we compare our results at large $n$ to those obtained using the holographic dual description and find perfect agreement. We further find protected chiral algebras that appear on the worldvolumes of codimension two defects in $(2,0)$ SCFTs. This construction has likely implications for understanding the microscopic origin of the AGT correspondence.
