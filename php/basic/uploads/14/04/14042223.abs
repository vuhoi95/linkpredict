Abstract: In a very recent manuscript [arXiv:1403.6035], Castro and Oliveira have commented on our recently published paper [2]. Their main criticism is that we have used an improper nonminimal interaction term. Regarding their work, we wish to mention two points. 1. We have started the paper based on the work of Kozak et al. [3] which has successfully discussed the deuteron-nucleus scattering. 2. The second point is that we have used in our calculations \b{eta}0 and not (which preserves the current conservation). Therefore, the content of our work is correct.
