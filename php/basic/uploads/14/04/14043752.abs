Title: Bipartite Field Theories, Cluster Algebras and the Grassmannian
Authors: Sebastian Franco and Daniele Galloni and Alberto Mariotti
Abstract: We review recent progress in Bipartite Field Theories. We cover topics such as their gauge dynamics, emergence of toric Calabi-Yau manifolds as master and moduli spaces, string theory embedding, relationships to on-shell diagrams, connections to cluster algebras and the Grassmannian, and applications to graph equivalence and stratification of the Grassmannian.
