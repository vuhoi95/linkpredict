Abstract: The Gribov-Zwanziger framework accounting for the existence of Gribov copies is extended to N=1 Super Yang--Mills theories quantized in the Landau gauge. We show that the restriction of the domain of integration in the Euclidean functional integral to the first Gribov horizon can be implemented in a way to recover non-perturbative features of N=1 Super Yang--Mills theories, namely: the existence of the gluino condensate as well as the vanishing of the vacuum energy.
