Title: Equations of motion in scalar-tensor theories of gravity: A covariant  multipolar approach
Authors: Yuri N. Obukhov and Dirk Puetzfeld
Abstract: We discuss the dynamics of extended test bodies for a large class of scalar-tensor theories of gravitation. A covariant multipolar Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon type of approach is used to derive the equations of motion in a systematic way for both Jordan and Einstein formulations of these theories. The results obtained provide the framework to experimentally test scalar-tensor theories by means of extended test bodies.
