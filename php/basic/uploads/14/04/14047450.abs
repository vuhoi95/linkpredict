Title: On the gauge dependence of the Standard Model vacuum instability scale
Authors: Luca Di Luzio and Luminita Mihaila
Abstract: After reviewing the calculation of the Standard Model one-loop effective potential in a class of linear gauges, we discuss the physical observables entering the vacuum stability analysis. While the electroweak-vacuum-stability bound on the Higgs boson mass can be formally proven to be gauge independent, the field value at which the effective potential turns negative (the so-called instability scale) is a gauge dependent quantity. By varying the gauge-fixing scheme and the gauge-fixing parameters in their perturbative domain, we find an irreducible theoretical uncertainty of at least two orders of magnitude on the scale at which the Standard Model vacuum becomes unstable.
