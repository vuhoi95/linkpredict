Title: Pseudo Hermitian interactions in the Dirac Equation
Authors: Orlando Panella and Pinaki Roy
Abstract: We consider $(2+1)$ dimensional massless Dirac equation in the presence of complex vector potentials. It is shown that such vector potentials (leading to complex magnetic fields) can produce bound states and the Dirac Hamiltonians are $\eta$-pseudo Hermitian. Some examples have been explicitly worked out.
