Authors: JÃ¼rgen Fuchs and Jan Priel and Christoph Schweigert and Alessandro Valentino
Abstract: Symmetries of three-dimensional topological field theories are naturally defined in terms of invertible topological surface defects. Symmetry groups are thus Brauer-Picard groups. We present a gauge theoretic realization of all symmetries of abelian Dijkgraaf-Witten theories. The symmetry group for a Dijkgraaf-Witten theory with gauge group a finite abelian group $A$, and with vanishing 3-cocycle, is generated by group automorphisms of $A$, by automorphisms of the trivial Chern-Simons 2-gerbe on the stack of $A$-bundles, and by partial e-m dualities. We show that transmission functors naturally extracted from extended topological field theories with surface defects give a physical realization of the bijection between invertible bimodule categories of a fusion category and braided auto-equivalences of its Drinfeld center. The latter provides the labels for bulk Wilson lines; it follows that a symmetry is completely characterized by its action on bulk Wilson lines.
