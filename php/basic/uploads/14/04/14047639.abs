Title: Symmetry breaking caused by large R-charge
Authors: Akinori Tanaka and Akio Tomiya and Takuya Shimotani
Abstract: We discuss the gauge symmetry breaking via the Hosotani mechanism by using exact results on supersymmetric gauge theories based on the localization method. We use the theories on S^2 x S^1 Euclidean space, and study how the effective potential for the Wilson line phase varies by running an imaginary chemical potential. In order to break the symmetry, we find that large R-charge is necessary. With such large R-charge, we study the phase structure of the theory. In addition, we observed that a finite size effect on our curved space when we take R-charge is not so large.
