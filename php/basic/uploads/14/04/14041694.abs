Authors: Matteo Beccaria and Constantin Candu and Matthias R. Gaberdiel
Abstract: The most general large ${\cal N}=4$ superconformal ${\cal W}_{\infty}$ algebra, containing in addition to the superconformal algebra one supermultiplet for each integer spin, is analysed in detail. It is found that the ${\cal W}_{\infty}$ algebra is uniquely determined by the levels of the two $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ algebras, a conclusion that holds both for the linear and the non-linear case. We also perform various cross-checks of our analysis, and exhibit two different types of truncations in some detail.
