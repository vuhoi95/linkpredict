Title: Inflation After False Vacuum Decay: New Evidence from BICEP2
Authors: Raphael Bousso and Daniel Harlow and Leonardo Senatore
Abstract: Last year we argued that if slow-roll inflation followed the decay of a false vacuum in a large landscape, the steepening of the scalar potential between the inflationary plateau and the barrier generically leads to a potentially observable suppression of the scalar power spectrum at large distances. Here we revisit this analysis in light of the recent BICEP2 results. Assuming that both the BICEP2 B-mode signal and the Planck analysis of temperature fluctuations hold up, we find that the data now discriminate more sharply between our scenario and $\Lambda$CDM. Nonzero tensor modes exclude standard $\Lambda$CDM with notable but not yet conclusive confidence: at $\sim 3.8\,\sigma$ if $r\approx0.2$, or at $\sim 3.5\,\sigma$ if $r=0.15$. Of the two steepening models of our previous work, one is now ruled out by existing bounds on spatial curvature. The other entirely reconciles the tension between BICEP2 and Planck. Upcoming $EE$ polarization measurements have the potential to rule out unmodified $\Lambda$CDM decisively. Next generation Large Scale Structure surveys can further increase the significance. More precise measurements of $BB$ at low $\ell$ will help distinguish our scenario from other explanations. If steepening is confirmed, the prospects for detecting open curvature increase but need not be large.
