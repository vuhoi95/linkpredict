Title: AdS pure spinor superstring in constant backgrounds
Authors: Osvaldo Chandia and L. Ibiapina Bevilaqua and Brenno Carlini Vallilo
Abstract: In this paper we study the pure spinor formulation of the superstring in $AdS_5\times S^5$ around point particle solutions of the classical equations of motion. As a particular example we quantize the pure spinor string in the BMN background.
