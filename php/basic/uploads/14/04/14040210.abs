Title: Supersymmetric backgrounds from 5d N=1 supergravity
Authors: Yosuke Imamura and Hiroki Matsuno
Abstract: We construct curved backgrounds with Euclidean signature admitting rigid supersymmetry by using a 5d N=1 off-shell Poincare supergravity. We solve the conditions for the background Weyl multiplet and vector multiplets that preserve at least one supersymmetry parameterized by a symplectic Majorana spinor, and represent the solution in terms of several independent fields. We also show that the partition function does not depends on the local degrees of freedom of the background fields. Namely, as far as we focus on a single coordinate patch, we can freely change the independent fields by combining Q-exact deformations and gauge transformations. We also discuss realization of several known examples of supersymmetric theories in curved backgrounds by using the supergravity.
