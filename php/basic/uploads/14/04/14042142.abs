Authors: T. Golanbari and A. Mohammadi and Kh. Saaidi
Abstract: A DGP brane-world framework is picked out to study quark-hadron phase transition problem. The model also includes a bulk scalar field in agreement with string theory prediction. The work is performed utilizing two formalisms as: smooth crossover approach and first order approach, and the results are plotted for both branches of DGP model. General behavior of temperature is the same in these two approaches and it decrease by passing time and expanding Universe. Phase transition occurs at about micro-second after the big bang. The results show that transition time depends on brane tension value in which larger brane tension comes to earlier transition time.
