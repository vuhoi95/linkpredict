Title: Neighbourhoods of Isolated Horizons and their stationarity
Authors: Jerzy Lewandowski and Tomasz Pawlowski
Abstract: A distinguished (invariant) Bondi-like coordinate system is defined in the spacetime neighbourhood of a non-expanding horizon of arbitrary dimension via geometry invariants of the horizon. With its use, the radial expansion of a spacetime metric about the horizon is provided and the free data needed to specify it up to given order are determined in spacetime dimension $4$. For the case of an electro-vacuum horizon in $4$-dimensional spacetime the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a Killing field at its neighbourhood are identified as differential conditions on the horizon data and data on null surface transversal to the horizon.
