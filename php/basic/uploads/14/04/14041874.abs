Title: Self-interacting boson stars with a single Killing vector field in  Anti-de Sitter
Authors: Yves Brihaye and Betti Hartmann and JÃ¼rgen Riedel
Abstract: We construct rotating boson stars in (4+1)-dimensional asymptotically Anti-de Sitter space-time (aAdS) with two equal angular momenta that are composed out of a massive and self-interacting scalar field. These solutions possess a single Killing vector field. We construct explicit solutions of the equations in the case of a fixed AdS background and vanishing self-coupling of the scalar field. These are the generalizations of the oscillons discussed in the literature previously now taking the mass of the scalar field into account. We study the evolution of the spectrum of massive oscillons when taking backreaction and/or the self-coupling into account numerically. We observe that very compact boson stars possess an ergoregion.
