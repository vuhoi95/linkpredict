Title: Sub-Planckian inflation & large tensor to scalar ratio with $r\geq 0.1$
Authors: Sayantan Choudhury and Anupam Mazumdar
Abstract: We categorically point out why the analysis of arXiv:1404.1821 [hep-ph] is incorrect. Here we explicitly show why the sub-Planckian field excursion of the inflaton field can yield large observable tensor-to-scalar ratio, which satisfies both Planck and BICEP constraints.
