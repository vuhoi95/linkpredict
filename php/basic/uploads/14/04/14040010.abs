Abstract: We investigate whether there are unitary families of W-algebras with spin one fields in the natural example of the Feigin-Semikhatov W^(2)_n-algebra. This algebra is conjecturally a quantum Hamiltonian reduction corresponding to a non-principal nilpotent element. We conjecture that this algebra admits a unitary real form for even n. Our main result is that this conjecture is consistent with the known part of the operator product algebra, and especially it is true for n=2 and n=4. Moreover, we find certain ranges of allowed levels where a positive definite inner product is possible. We also find a unitary conformal field theory for every even n at the special level k+n=(n+1)/(n-1). At these points, the W^(2)_n-algebra is nothing but a compactified free boson. This family of W-algebras admits an 't Hooft limit that is similar to the original minimal model 't Hooft limit. Further, in the case of n=4, we reproduce the algebra from the higher spin gravity point of view. In general, gravity computations allow us to reproduce some leading coefficients of the operator product.
