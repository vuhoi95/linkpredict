Title: Gray-body factor and infrared divergences in 1D BEC acoustic black holes
Authors: Paul R. Anderson and Roberto Balbinot and Alessandro Fabbri and Renaud Parentani
Abstract: It is shown that the gray-body factor for a one-dimensional elongated Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) acoustic black hole with one horizon does not vanish in the low-frequency ($\omega\to 0$) limit. This implies that the analog Hawking radiation is dominated by the emission of an infinite number ($\frac{1}{\omega}$) of soft phonons in contrast with the case of a Schwarzschild black hole where the gray-body factor vanishes as $\omega\to 0$ and the spectrum is not dominated by low-energy particles. The infrared behaviors of certain correlation functions are also discussed.
