Title: Aligned Natural Inflation in String Theory
Authors: Cody Long and Liam McAllister and Paul McGuirk
Abstract: We propose a scenario for realizing super-Planckian axion decay constants in Calabi-Yau orientifolds of type IIB string theory, leading to large-field inflation. Our construction is a simple embedding in string theory of the mechanism of Kim, Nilles, and Peloso, in which a large effective decay constant arises from alignment of two smaller decay constants. The key ingredient is gaugino condensation on magnetized or multiply-wound D7-branes. We argue that, under very mild assumptions about the topology of the Calabi-Yau, there are controllable points in moduli space with large effective decay constants.
