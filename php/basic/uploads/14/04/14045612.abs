Title: Born-Infeld Gravity Revisited
Authors: M. R. Setare and M. Sahraee
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the behavior of linearized gravitational excitation in the Born-Infeld Gravity in $AdS_3$ space. We obtain the linearized equation of motion and show that this higher order gravity propagate two gravitons, massless and massive, on the $AdS_3$ background. In contrast to the $R^2$ models, such as TMG or NMG, Born-Infeld Gravity does not have a critical point for any regular choice of parameters. So the logarithmic solution is not a solution of this model, due to this one can not find a logarithmic conformal field theory as a dual model for Born-Infeld Gravity.
