Title: Quadratic Chaotic Inflation from Higgs Inflation
Authors: Ichiro Oda and Takahiko Tomoyose
Abstract: Stimulated with the recent discovery of B-mode by BICEP2, we discuss the relation between a Higgs inflation and a chaotic inflation with quadratic potential. Starting with a generalized Higgs inflation model, we derive a condition for obtaining the quadratic chaotic inflation. It is shown that the running of the Higgs self-coupling constant in the Jordan frame plays a decisive role when the generalized Higgs inflation model coincides with the Higgs inflation model in a small-field limit.
