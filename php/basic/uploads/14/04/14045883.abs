Title: Phase Transitions in Models with Discrete Symmetry
Authors: V. G. Ksenzov and A. I. Romanov
Abstract: We investigate a class of models with a massless fermion and a self-interacting scalar field with the Yukawa interaction between these two fields. The models considered are formulated in two and four spacetime dimensions and possess a discrete symmetry. We calculate the chiral condensates are calculated in the one-loop approximation. We show that the models have a phase transitions as a function of the coupling constants.
