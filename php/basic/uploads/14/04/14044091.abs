Title: Evidence for a New Soft Graviton Theorem
Authors: Freddy Cachazo and Andrew Strominger
Abstract: The single-soft-graviton limit of any quantum gravity scattering amplitude is given at leading order by the universal Weinberg pole formula. Gauge invariance of the formula follows from global energy-momentum conservation. In this paper evidence is given for a conjectured universal formula for the finite subleading term in the expansion about the soft limit, whose gauge invariance follows from global angular momentum conservation. The conjecture is non-trivially verified for all tree-level graviton scattering amplitudes using a BCFW recursion relation. One hopes to understand this infinity of new soft relations as a Ward identity for a new superrotation Virasoro symmetry of the quantum gravity S-matrix.
