Abstract: We have studied BPS vortices in a CPT-odd and Lorentz-violating Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Higgs (MCSH) electrodynamics attained from the dimensional reduction of the Carroll-Field-Jackiw-Higgs model. The Lorentz-violating parameter induces a pronounced behavior at origin (for the magnetic/electric fields and energy density) which is absent in the MCSH vortices. For some combination of the Lorentz-violating coefficients there always exist a sufficiently large winding number $n_{0}$ such that for all $% |n|\geq |n_{0}|$ the magnetic field flips its signal, yielding two well defined regions with opposite magnetic flux. However, the total magnetic flux remains quantized and proportional to the winding number.
