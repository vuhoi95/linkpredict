Abstract: The appearance of inner brane structure is an interesting issue in domain wall {brane model}. Because such structure usually leads to quasilocalized modes of various kinds of bulk fields. In this paper, we construct a domain wall brane model by using a scalar field $\phi$, which couples to its kinetic term. The inner brane structure emerges as the scalar-kinetic coupling increases. With such brane structure, we show that it is possible to obtain gravity resonant modes in both tensor and scalar sectors. The number of the resonant modes depends on the vacuum expectation value of $\phi$ and the form of scalar-kinetic coupling. The correspondence between our model and the canonical one is also discussed. The noncanonical and canonical background scalar fields are connected by an integral equation, while the warp factor remains the same. Via this correspondence, the canonical and noncanonical models share the same linear perturbation spectrum. So the gravity resonances {obtained} in the noncanonical frame can also be obtained in the standard model. However, due to the inequivalence between the corresponding background scalar solutions, the localization condition for the left-chiral fermion zero mode can be largely different in different frames. Our estimate shows that the magnitude of the Yukawa coupling in the noncanonical frame might be hundreds times larger than the one in the canonical frame, if one demands the localization of the left-chiral fermion zero mode as well as the appearance of a few gravity resonance modes.
