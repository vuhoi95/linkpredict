Title: General dissipative coefficient in warm intermediate inflation in loop  quantum cosmology in light of Planck and BICEP2
Authors: Ram√≥n Herrera and Marco Olivares and Nelson Videla
Abstract: In this paper, we study a warm intermediate inflationary model with a general form for the dissipative coefficient $\Gamma(T,\phi)=C_\phi\,T^{m}/\phi^{m-1}$ in the context of loop quantum cosmology. We examine this model in the weak and strong dissipative regimes. In general, we discuss in great detail the characteristics of this model in the slow-roll approximation. Also, we assume that the modifications to perturbation equations result exclusively from Hubble rate. In this approach, we use recent astronomical observations from Planck and BICEP2 experiments to restrict the parameters in our model.
