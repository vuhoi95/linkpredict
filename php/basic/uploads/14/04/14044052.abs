Title: Spin(7) duality for N=1 CS-matter theories
Authors: Antonio Amariti and Davide Forcella
Abstract: In this paper we propose a duality for non-holomorphic N=1 CS-matter theories living on M2 branes probing Spin(7) cones. We call this duality Spin(7) duality. Two theories are named Spin(7) dual if they have the same moduli space: a real Spin(7) cone with base a weak G_2 manifold, and they are hence holographic dual to the same AdS_4 x G_2 M theory solution. We provide a systematic way to generate these dualities, derived by combining toric duality for N=2 CS-matter theories and generalized non-holomorphic orientifold projections to N=1. Brane construction, AdS/CFT correspondence, and the computation of the moduli space support our proposal at the classical level and provide some arguments at the quantum strong coupling regime. The relation with Seiberg-like duality is also analyzed.
