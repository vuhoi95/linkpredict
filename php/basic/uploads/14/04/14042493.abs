Title: Compact Structures in Standard Field Theory
Authors: D. Bazeia and L. Losano and M. A. Marques and R. Menezes
Abstract: We investigate the presence of static solutions in models described by real scalar field in two-dimensional spacetime. After taking advantage of a procedure introduced sometime ago, we solve intricate nonlinear ordinary differential equations and illustrate how to find compact structures in models engendering standard kinematics. In particular, we study linear stability and show that all the static solutions we have found are linearly stable.
