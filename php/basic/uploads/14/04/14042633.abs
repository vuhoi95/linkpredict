Title: ABJM theory in Batalin-Vilkovisky formulation
Authors: Sudhaker Upadhyay and Diptarka Das
Abstract: We analyze the quantum ABJM theory on ${\cal N} = 1$ superspace in different gauges. We study the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formulation for this model. By developing field/antifield dependent BRST transformation we establish connection between the two different solutions of the quantum master equation within the BV formulation.
