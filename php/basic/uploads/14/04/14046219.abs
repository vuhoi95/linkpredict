Title: Ambitwistor strings in 4-dimensions
Authors: Yvonne Geyer and Arthur E. Lipstein and Lionel J. Mason
Abstract: We develop ambitwistor string theories for 4 dimensions to obtain new formulae for tree-level gauge and gravity amplitudes with arbitrary amounts of supersymmetry. Ambitwistor space is the space of complex null geodesics in complexified Minkowski space, and in contrast to earlier ambitwistor strings, we use twistors rather than vectors to represent this space. Although superficially similar to the original twistor string theories of Witten, Berkovits and Skinner, these theories differ in the assignment of worldsheet spins of the fields, rely on both twistor and dual twistor representatives for the vertex operators, and use the ambitwistor procedure for calculating correlation functions. Our models are much more flexible, no longer requiring maximal supersymmetry, and the resulting formulae for amplitudes are simpler, having substantially reduced moduli. These are supported on the solutions to the scattering equations refined according to MHV degree and can be checked by comparison with corresponding formulae of Witten and of Cachazo and Skinner.
