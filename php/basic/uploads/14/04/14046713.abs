Title: On Geometric Scaling of Light-Like Wilson Polygons: Higher Orders in  $Î±_s$
Authors: T. Mertens and I. Cherednikov
Abstract: We address the scaling behaviour of contour-shape-dependent ultra-violet singularities of the light-like cusped Wilson loops in Yang-Mills and ${\cal N} = 4$ super-Yang-Mills theories in the higher orders of the perturbative expansion. We give the simple arguments to support the idea that identifying of a special type of non-local infinitesimal shape variations of the light-like Wilson polygons with the Fr\'echet differentials results in the combined geometric and renormalization-group evolution equation, which is applicable beyond the leading order exponentiated Wilson loops.
