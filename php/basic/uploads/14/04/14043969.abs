Title: Gauge Theory of Maxwell-Weyl Group
Authors: O. Cebecioğlu and S. Kibaroğlu
Abstract: Starting from Maxwell-Weyl algebra we found the transformation rules for generalized space-time coordinates and the differential realization of corresponding generators. By treating local gauge invariance of Maxwell-Weyl group, we presented the Einstein-Cartan-Weyl gravity with the additional terms containing the gauge fields associated with the antisymmetric generators.
