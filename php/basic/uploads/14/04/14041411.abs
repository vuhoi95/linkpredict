Title: Conformal Mass in AdS gravity
Authors: Dileep P. Jatkar and Georgios Kofinas and Olivera Miskovic and Rodrigo Olea
Abstract: We show that the Ashtekar-Magnon-Das (AMD) mass and other conserved quantities are equivalent to the Kounterterm charges in the asymptotically AdS spacetimes that satisfy the Einstein equations, if we assume the same asymptotic fall-off behavior of the Weyl tensor as considered by AMD. This therefore implies that, in all dimensions, the conformal mass can be directly derived from the bulk action and the boundary terms, which are written in terms of the extrinsic curvature.
