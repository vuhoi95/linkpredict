Title: Has the Goldstone theorem been revisited?
Authors: A. Guerrieri and A. Pilloni
Abstract: A recent paper (arXiv:1404.5619) claimed the presence of a loophole in the current-algebra proof of Goldstone Theorem. The enforcing of manifest covariance would lead to contradictory results also in scalar theory. We show that the argument proposed is not in contradiction with covariance, thus not invalidating the theorem. Moreover, the counterexample proposed of a scalar operator with a non-zero vacuum expectation value in an unbroken theory is ill-defined.
