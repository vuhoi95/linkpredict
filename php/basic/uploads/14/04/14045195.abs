Title: Updated limits on extra dimensions through torsion and LHC data
Authors: Oscar Castillo-Felisola and Cristobal Corral and Ivan Schmidt and Alfonso R. Zerwekh
Abstract: It is well known that inclusion of torsion in the gravitational formalism, leads to four-fermion interactions. Although the coupling constant of this interaction is strongly suppressed in four dimensions, its value is enhanced in models with $n$ extra dimensions. In this context, we reinterpret the recent limits established by LHC experiments to four-fermion contact interactions, to set bounds on the size of the extra dimensions. For $n=2$, the limits are comparable to those in the literature, while for $n\ge 3$ the volume of the extra dimensions is strongly constrained.
