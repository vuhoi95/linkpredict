Title: Spectral Measures for $Sp(2)$
Authors: David E. Evans and Mathew Pugh
Abstract: Spectral measures provide invariants for braided subfactors via fusion modules. In this paper we study joint spectral measures associated to the compact connected rank two Lie group $SO(5)$ and its double cover the compact connected, simply-connected rank two Lie group $Sp(2)$, including the McKay graphs for the irreducible representations of $Sp(2)$ and $SO(5)$ and their maximal tori, and fusion modules associated to the $Sp(2)$ modular invariants.
