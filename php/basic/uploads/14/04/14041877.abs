Title: Spectral measures associated to rank two Lie groups and finite subgroups  of $GL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
Authors: David E. Evans and Mathew Pugh
Abstract: Spectral measures for fundamental representations of the rank two Lie groups $SU(3)$, $Sp(2)$ and $G_2$ have been studied. Since these groups have rank two, these spectral measures can be defined as measures over their maximal torus $\mathbb{T}^2$ and are invariant under an action of the corresponding Weyl group, which is a subgroup of $GL(2,\mathbb{Z})$. Here we consider spectral measures invariant under an action of the other finite subgroups of $GL(2,\mathbb{Z})$. These spectral measures are all associated with fundamental representations of other rank two Lie groups, namely $\mathbb{T}^2=U(1) \times U(1)$, $U(1) \times SU(2)$, $U(2)$, $SU(2) \times SU(2)$, $SO(4)$ and $PSU(3)$.
