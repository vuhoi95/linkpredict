Title: Extra Dimensions, Dual Relation and the Cosmological Constant
Authors: Yong-Chang Huang and LiuJi Li
Abstract: We consider a general n dimensional manifold, which is a direct product manifold of $M^4 \times M^{n-4}$ representing our universe and extra spatial dimensions. From Einstein-Hilbert action of the manifold, we deduce effective 4 dimensional Fridemann equations. Matching it with the normal Fridemann equations with the cosmological constant, we give an expression of the cosmological constant, and the expression under different conditions are discussed. Also according to a deduced relation, we reveal a connection between Hubble parameter and extra dimensions. In this regard, we take into account all possible states of extra dimension which are consistent with current experimental result as well.
