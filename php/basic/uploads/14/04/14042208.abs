Title: Codification Volume of an operator algebra and its irreversible growth  through thermal processes
Authors: Javier M. Magan and Simone Paganelli
Abstract: Given a many-body system, we define a quantity, the Codification Volume of an operator algebra, which measures the size of the subspace with whom a given algebra is correlated. We explicitly calculate it for some limit cases, including vacuum states of local Hamiltonians and random states taken from the Haar ensemble. We argue that this volume should grow irreversibly in a thermalization process, and illustrate it numerically on a non-integrable quantum spin chain.
