Title: Diffusion on $Îº$-Minkowski space
Authors: Michele Arzano and Tomasz Trzesniewski
Abstract: We study the spectral dimension associated with diffusion processes on Euclidean $\kappa$-Minkowski space. We start by describing a geometric construction of the "Euclidean" momentum group manifold related to $\kappa$-Minkowski space. On such space we identify various candidate Laplacian functions, i.e. deformed Casimir invariants, and calculate the corresponding spectral dimension for each case. The results obtained show a variety of running behaviours for the spectral dimension according to the choice of deformed Laplacian, from dimensional reduction to super-diffusion.
