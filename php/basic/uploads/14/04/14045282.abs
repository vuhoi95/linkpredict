Title: Hydrodynamics in black brane with hyperscaling violation metric  background
Authors: Jafar Sadeghi and Ali Asadi
Abstract: In this paper we consider a metric with hyperscaling violation on black brane background. In this background we calculate the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density with hydrodynamics information. The calculation of this quantity lead us to constraint $\theta$ as $3\leq\theta<4$, and $\theta\leq0$. In that case we show that the quantity of $\frac{\eta}{s}$ not dependent to hyperscaling violation parameter $\theta.$ Our results about ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density in direct of $QCD$ point of view agree with other works in literature as $1/4\pi$.
