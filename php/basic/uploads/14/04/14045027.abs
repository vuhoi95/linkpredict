Title: Anisotropic plasma at finite $U(1)$ chemical potential
Authors: Long Cheng and Xian-Hui Ge and Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: We present a type IIB supergravity solution dual to a spatially anisotropic $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills plasma at finite $U(1)$ chemical potential and finite temperature. The effective five-dimensional gravitational theory is a consistent Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-Axion truncation of the gauged supergravity. We obtain the solutions both numerically and analytically. We study the phase structure and thermodynamic instabilities of the solution, and find new instabilities independent of the renormalization scheme.
