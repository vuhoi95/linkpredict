Title: An Improved Inertia Principle
Authors: Rodrigo Medina and J. Stephany
Abstract: We show that for isolated relativistic systems with spin the conservation of total angular momentum implies that, instead of the center of mass, it is a modified center of mass and spin which behaves inertially. This requires a change in the the statement of the Principle of Inertia.
