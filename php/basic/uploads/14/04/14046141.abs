Title: Predictions on mass of Higgs portal scalar dark matter from Higgs  inflation and flat potential
Authors: Yuta Hamada and Hikaru Kawai and Kin-ya Oda
Abstract: We consider the Higgs portal $Z_2$ scalar model as the minimal extension of the Standard Model (SM) to incorporate the dark matter. We find that the dark matter mass is bounded to be lighter than 1000\,GeV within the framework that we have proposed earlier, where the Higgs inflation occurs above the SM cutoff $\Lambda$, thanks to the fact that the Higgs potential becomes much smaller than its typical value in the SM: $V\ll\Lambda^4$. We can further fix the dark matter mass to be $400\text{GeV}< m_\text{DM}<470\text{GeV}$ if we impose that the cutoff is at the string scale $\Lambda\sim10^{17}\text{GeV}$ and that the Higgs potential becomes flat around $\Lambda$, as is required by the multiple point principle or by the Higgs inflation at the critical point. This prediction is testable by the dark matter detection experiments in the near future. In this framework, the dark matter and top quark masses are strongly correlated, which is also testable.
