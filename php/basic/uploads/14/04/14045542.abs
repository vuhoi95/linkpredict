Authors: T. Prudencio and T. M. Rocha Filho and A. E. Santana
Abstract: Thermofield dynamics (TFD) approach is a real time quantum field method for dealing with finite temperature quantum states in a purified version of usual density operator formalism at finite temperature. In the domain of quantum information, TFD represents a quite promising direction for dealing with qubits under thermal influence and can also be associated to Gaussian states. Here, we propose a generalized TFD mean expectation for the case of thermofield qubits considering the action of gate operators. We propose quantum teleportation protocols involving thermofield states, considering thermal-to-thermal and thermal-to-non-thermal transfering cases. In particular, we discuss the case in which Alice and Bob are at different temperatures. Action of gate operators on the result of the Mandel parameter for thermofields and on Gibbs-like density operators are also discussed. The no-cloning and non-broadcasting theorems in TFD are also considered and cases of superposed thermofield states and maps connecting thermofield vacua at different temperatures are also addressed and associated to metastable and non-equilibrium scenarios.
