Title: Natural Inflation in Supergravity and Beyond
Authors: Renata Kallosh and Andrei Linde and Bert Vercnocke
Abstract: Supergravity models of natural inflation and its generalizations are presented. These models are special examples of the class of supergravity models proposed in arXiv:1008.3375 and arXiv:1011.5945, which have a shift symmetric K\"ahler potential, superpotential linear in goldstino, and stable Minkowski vacua. We present a class of supergravity models with arbitrary potentials modulated by sinusoidal oscillations, similar to the potentials associated with axion monodromy models. We show that one can implement natural inflation in supergravity even in the models of a single axion field with axion parameters O(1). We also discuss the irrational axion landscape in supergravity, which describes a potential with infinite number of stable Minkowski and metastable dS minima.
