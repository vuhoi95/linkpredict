Title: Critical $O(N)$ Models in $6-Îµ$ Dimensions
Authors: Lin Fei and Simone Giombi and Igor R. Klebanov
Abstract: We revisit the classic $O(N)$ symmetric scalar field theories in $d$ dimensions with interaction $(\phi^i \phi^i)^2$. For $2<d<4$ these theories flow to the Wilson-Fisher fixed points for any $N$. A standard large $N$ Hubbard-Stratonovich approach also indicates that, for $4<d<6$, these theories possess unitary UV fixed points. We propose their alternate description in terms of a theory of $N+1$ massless scalars with the cubic interactions $\sigma \phi^i \phi^i$ and $\sigma^3$. Our one-loop calculation in $6-\epsilon$ dimensions shows that this theory has an IR stable fixed point at real values of the coupling constants for $N>1038$. We show that the $1/N$ expansions of various operator scaling dimensions match the known results for the critical $O(N)$ theory continued to $d=6-\epsilon$. These results suggest that, for sufficiently large $N$, there are 5-dimensional unitary $O(N)$ symmetric interacting CFT's; they should be dual to the Vasiliev higher-spin theory in AdS$_6$ with alternate boundary conditions for the bulk scalar. Using these CFT's we provide a new test of the 5-dimensional $F$-theorem, and also find a new counterexample for the $C_T$ theorem.
