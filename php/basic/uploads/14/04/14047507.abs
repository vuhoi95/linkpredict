Title: Odd Parity Transport In Non-Abelian Superfluids From Symmetry Locking
Authors: Carlos Hoyos and Bom Soo Kim and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We consider relativistic non-Abelian superfluids, where the expectation value of the global symmetry currents relate space and internal indices, thus creating a "locked" phase. Locking a superfluid with SU(2) internal symmetry in 2+1 dimensions breaks parity spontaneously, and introduces parity-odd terms in the constitutive relations. We show that there are qualitatively different extensions of the rest frame locking to non-zero velocities. We construct the resulting superfluid hydrodynamics up to the first derivative order. Using an expansion close to the critical point, we estimate the ratio of the Hall viscosity and the angular momentum density. Our general hydrodynamic results are compatible with the holographic p-wave calculations in arXiv:1311.4882.
