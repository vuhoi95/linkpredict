Title: Non-Gaussianity after BICEP2
Authors: Guido D'Amico and Matthew Kleban
Abstract: We analyze primordial non-Gaussianity in single field inflationary models when the tensor/scalar ratio is large. Our results show that detectable levels of non-Gaussianity $f_{NL} \sim 50$ are still possible in the simplest class of models described by the effective theory of inflation. However, the shape is very tightly constrained, making a sharp prediction that could be confirmed or falsified by a future detection of non-Gaussianity.
