Abstract: We present explicit computations and conjectures for $2 \to 2$ scattering matrices in large $N$ {\it $U(N)$} Chern-Simons theories coupled to fundamental bosonic or fermionic matter to all orders in the 't Hooft coupling expansion. The bosonic and fermionic S-matrices map to each other under the recently conjectured Bose-Fermi duality after a level-rank transposition. The S-matrices presented in this paper may be regarded as relativistic generalization of Aharonov-Bohm scattering. They have unusual structural features: they include a non analytic piece localized on forward scattering, and obey modified crossing symmetry rules. We conjecture that these unusual features are properties of S-matrices in all Chern-Simons matter theories. The S-matrix in one of the exchange channels in our paper has an anyonic character; the parameter map of the conjectured Bose-Fermi duality may be derived by equating the anyonic phase in the bosonic and fermionic theories.
