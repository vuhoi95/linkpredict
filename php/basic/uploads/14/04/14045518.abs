Title: Axion monodromy inflation with sinusoidal corrections
Authors: Tatsuo Kobayashi and Osamu Seto and Yuya Yamaguchi
Abstract: We study the axion monodromy inflation with a non-perturbatively generated sinusoidal term. The potential form is a mixture between the natural inflation and the axion monodromy inflation potentials. The sinusoidal term is subdominant in the potential, but leaves significant effects on the resultant fluctuation generated during inflation. A larger tensor-to-scalar ratio can be obtained in our model. We study two scenarios, single inflation scenario and the double inflation scenario. In the first scenario, the axion monodromy inflation with a sufficient number of e-fold generates a larger tensor-to-scalar ratio about $0.1 - 0.15$ but also a tiny running of spectral index. In the second scenario of double inflation, axion monodromy inflation is its first stage and, we assume another inflation follows. In this case, our model can realize a larger tensor-to-scalar ratio and a large negative running of spectral index simultaneously.
