Title: Holographic Bilayer/Monolayer Phase Transitions
Authors: Veselin G. Filev and Matthias Ihl and Dimitrios Zoakos
Abstract: In the present work, we discuss the phase structure of bilayer and monolayer phases in the (2+1)-dimensional defect field theory whose gravity dual is obtained by embedding D5/anti-D5 probe flavour branes in the singular conifold. We study in detail the embedding equations and compare the free energies of the resulting configurations at non-zero temperature and external magnetic field perpendicular to the defects. Moreover, we analyse the meson spectrum and confirm the stability of the single bilayer solution.
