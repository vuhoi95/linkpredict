Title: Multiparticle SYM equations of motion and pure spinor BRST blocks
Authors: Carlos R. Mafra and Oliver Schlotterer
Abstract: In this paper a multiparticle generalization of linearized ten-dimensional super Yang--Mills superfields is proposed. Their equations of motions are shown to take the same form as in the single-particle case, supplemented by contact terms. A recursive construction of these superfields is inspired by the iterated OPEs among massless vertex operators in the pure spinor formalism. An enlarged set of BRST-covariant pure spinor blocks is then defined in a streamlined fashion and combined to multiparticle vertex operators. The latter can be used to universally describe tree-level subdiagrams in the perturbative open and closed superstring, regardless of the loop order. The inherent symmetries of the multiparticle superfields are reproduced by structure constants of the gauge group, hinting a natural appearance of the BCJ-duality between color and kinematics in the fundamentals of super Yang--Mills theory. We present one-loop applications where known scalar cohomology objects are systematically recomputed and a novel vector cohomology particularly relevant to the closed string is constructed for arbitrary multiplicity.
