Title: Maxwell field with Torsion
Authors: R. Fresneda and M. C. Baldiotti and T. S. Pereira
Abstract: We propose a generalizing gauge-invariant model of propagating torsion which couples to the Maxwell field and to charged particles. As a result we have an Abelian gauge invariant action which leads to a theory with nonzero torsion and which is consistent with available experimental data.
