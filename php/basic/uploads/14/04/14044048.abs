Title: Electromagnetic response of strongly coupled plasmas
Authors: Davide Forcella and Andrea Mezzalira and Daniele Musso
Abstract: We present a thorough analysis of the electromagnetic response of strongly coupled neutral plasmas described by the gauge/gravity correspondence. The coupling of the external electromagnetic field with the tower of quasi-normal modes of the plasmas supports the presence of various electromagnetic modes with different properties. Among them we underline the existence of negative refraction with low dissipation for a transverse non-hydrodynamical mode. Previous hydrodynamical approaches have shown the ubiquitous character of negative refraction in charged plasmas and the absence thereof in neutral plasmas. Our results here extend the analysis for neutral plasmas beyond the hydrodynamical regime. As an application of these new insights we briefly discuss the case of the quark gluon plasma in the temperature dominated regime.
