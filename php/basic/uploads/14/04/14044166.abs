Title: Second order perturbations of relativistic membranes in curved spacetime
Authors: V. Kiosses and A. Nicolaidis
Abstract: A manifestly covariant equation is derived to describe the second order perturbations in topological defects and membranes on arbitrary curved background spacetimes. This, on one hand, generalizes work on macroscopic strings in Minkowski spacetime and introduces a framework for studing in a precise manner membranes behavior near the black hole horizon and on the other hand, introduces a more general framework for examining the stability of topological defects in curved spacetimes.
