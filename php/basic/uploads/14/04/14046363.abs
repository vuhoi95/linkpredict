Authors: Abhishek Chowdhury and Rajesh Kumar Gupta and Shailesh Lal and Milind Shyani and Somyadip Thakur
Abstract: We compute logarithmic corrections to the twisted index $B^g_6$ in four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=4$ and $\mathcal{N}=8$ string theories using the framework of the Quantum Entropy Function. We find that these vanish, matching perfectly with the large--charge expansion of the corresponding microscopic expressions.
