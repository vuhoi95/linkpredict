Title: $κ$-Deformations and Extended $κ$-Minkowski Spacetimes
Authors: Andrzej Borowiec and Anna Pachol
Abstract: We extend our previous study of Hopf-algebraic $\kappa$-deformations of all inhomogeneous orthogonal Lie algebras ${\rm iso}(g)$ as written in a tensorial and unified form. Such deformations are determined by a vector $\tau$ which for Lorentzian signature can be taken time-, light- or space-like. We focus on some mathematical aspects related to this subject. Firstly, we describe real forms with connection to the metric's signatures and their compatibility with the reality condition for the corresponding $\kappa$-Minkowski (Hopf) module algebras. Secondly, $h$-adic vs $q$-analog (polynomial) versions of deformed algebras including specialization of the formal deformation parameter $\kappa$ to some numerical value are considered. In the latter the general covariance is lost and one deals with an orthogonal decomposition. The last topic treated in this paper concerns twisted extensions of $\kappa$-deformations as well as the description of resulting noncommutative spacetime algebras in terms of solvable Lie algebras. We found that if the type of the algebra does not depend on deformation parameters then specialization is possible.
