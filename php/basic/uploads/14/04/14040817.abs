Title: Flux-induced Soft Terms on Type IIB/F-theory Matter Curves and  Hypercharge Dependent Scalar Masses
Authors: Pablo G. Camara and Luis E. Ibanez and Irene Valenzuela
Abstract: Closed string fluxes induce generically SUSY-breaking soft terms on supersymmetric type IIB orientifold compactifications with D3/D7 branes. This was studied in the past by inserting those fluxes on the DBI+CS actions for adjoint D3/D7 fields, where D7-branes had no magnetic fluxes. In the present work we generalise those computations to the phenomenologically more relevant case of chiral bi-fundamental fields laying at 7-brane intersections and F-theory local matter curves. We also include the effect of 7-brane magnetic flux as well as more general closed string backgrounds, including the effect of distant (anti-)D3-branes. We discuss several applications of our results. We find that squark/slepton masses become in general flux-dependent in F-theory GUT's. Hypercharge-dependent non-universal scalar masses with a characteristic sfermion hierarchy m_E^2 < m_L^2 < m_Q^2 < m_D^2 < m_U^2 are obtained. There are also flavor-violating soft terms both for matter fields living at intersecting 7-branes or on D3-branes at singularities. They point at a very heavy sfermion spectrum to avoid FCNC constraints. We also discuss the possible microscopic description of the fine-tuning of the EW Higgs boson in compactifications with a MSSM spectrum.
