Title: Spectral Measures for $G_2$ II: finite subgroups
Authors: David E. Evans and Mathew Pugh
Abstract: Joint spectral measures associated to the rank two Lie group $G_2$, including the representation graphs for the irreducible representations of $G_2$ and its maximal torus, nimrep graphs associated to the $G_2$ modular invariants have been studied. In this paper we study the joint spectral measures for the McKay graphs of finite subgroups of $G_2$.
