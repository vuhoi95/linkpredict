Title: Nambu-Goldstone bosons and the Higgs mechanism without Lorentz  invariance: Analysis based on constrained-system theory
Authors: Shinya Gongyo and Shintaro Karasawa
Abstract: First, we develop the counting rule for Nambu-Goldstone bosons to the system including two-time derivative terms. In this case, the type-II Nambu-Goldstone bosons may appear along with the massive Nambu-Goldstone ones. The number of the bosons is not reduced in contrast to the system without two-time derivative terms. We also investigate the reduction of the degrees of freedom from the perspective of the Dirac-Bergmann theory of constraints and reproduce the counting rule for Nambu-Goldstone bosons without Lorentz invariance. Then, we construct the generic Higgs model and study a Higgs phenomenon with these Nambu-Goldstone bosons on the basis of the Dirac-Bergmann theory. We show that the gauge fields in this system absorb all of the Nambu-Goldstone bosons such as the type-I, type-II and massive ones.
