Title: String Perturbation Theory Around Dynamically Shifted Vacuum
Authors: Roji Pius and Arnab Rudra and Ashoke Sen
Abstract: In some string theories, e.g. SO(32) heterotic string theory on Calabi-Yau manifolds, a massless field with a tree level potential can acquire a tachyonic mass at the one loop level, forcing us to quantize the theory around a new background that is not a solution to the classical equations of motion and hence is not described by a conformally invariant world-sheet theory. We describe a systematic procedure for carrying out string perturbation theory around such backgrounds.
