Title: Noncommutative SO(2,3) gauge theory and noncommutative gravity
Authors: Marija Dimitrijevic and Voja Radovanovic
Abstract: In this paper noncommutative gravity is constructed as a gauge theory of the noncommutative SO(2,3) group, while the noncommutativity is canonical (constant). The Seiberg-Witten map is used to express noncommutative fields in terms of the corresponding commutative fields. The commutative limit of the model is the Einstein-Hilbert action with the cosmological constant term and the topological Gauss-Bonnet term. We calculate the second order correction to this model and obtain terms that are of zeroth to fourth power in the curvature tensor and torsion. Trying to relate our results with $f(R)$ and $f(T)$ models, we analyze different limits of our model. In the limit of big cosmological constant and vanishing torsion we obtain a $x$-dependent correction to the cosmological constant, i.e. noncommutativity leads to a $x$-dependent cosmological constant. We also discuss the limit of small cosmological constant and vanishing torsion and the teleparallel limit.
