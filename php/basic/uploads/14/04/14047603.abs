Title: Exact Collapse Solutions in D=4, N=4 Gauged Supergravity and Their  Generalizations
Authors: H. Lu and Xuefeng Zhang
Abstract: We construct an exact time-dependent solution in $D=4$, ${\cal N}=4$ gauged supergravity, where the gauge fields of the $U(1)\times U(1)$ subgroup of the $SO(4)$ carry independent conserved charges. The solution describes a decaying white hole that settles down to the final state as a static charged black hole. We analyze the global structure and lift the solution back to $D=11$ supergravity. We further extend the theory by adding an extra term in the scalar potential and obtain a more general class of collapse solutions. The result constitutes a charged generalization of the Roberts solution and the dynamical scalar-hairy black hole solutions that have been very recently found by us. The generalized Roberts solutions demonstrate that a scalar coupled to gravity can be unstable even when it is confined by a scalar potential with a fixed point.
