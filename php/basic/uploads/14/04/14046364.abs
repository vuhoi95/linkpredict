Title: Natural solution in the refined Gribov-Zwanziger theory
Authors: D. J. Thelan and J. A. Gracey
Abstract: We analyse the one loop effective action of the Gribov-Zwanziger Lagrangian and use the local composite operator formalism to include the most general Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) dimension two mass operator for the localizing ghost fields. We show that the energetically favourable colour channel corresponds to what is known as the R direction.
