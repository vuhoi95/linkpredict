Title: Coherent states and quantum numbers for twist-deformed oscillator model
Authors: Marcin Daszkiewicz and Cezary J. Walczyk
Abstract: The coherent states for twist-deformed oscillator model provided in article [1] are constructed. Besides, it is demonstrated that the energy spectrum of considered model is labeled by two quantum numbers - by so-called main and azimutal quantum numbers respectively.
