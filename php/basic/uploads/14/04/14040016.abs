Title: Revisiting Soliton Contributions to Perturbative Amplitudes
Authors: Constantinos Papageorgakis and Andrew B. Royston
Abstract: It is often said that soliton contributions to perturbative processes in QFT are exponentially suppressed by a form factor. We provide a derivation of this form factor by studying the soliton-antisoliton pair production amplitude for a class of scalar theories with generic soliton moduli. This reduces to the calculation of a matrix element in the quantum mechanics on the soliton moduli space. We investigate the conditions under which the latter leads to suppression. Extending this framework to instanton-solitons in five-dimensional Yang-Mills theory leaves open the possibility that such contributions will not be suppressed.
