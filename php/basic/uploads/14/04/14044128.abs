Title: Three-Point Functions and su(1|1) Spin Chains
Authors: Joao Caetano and Thiago Fleury
Abstract: We compute three-point functions of general operators in the su(1|1) sector of planar N = 4 SYM in the weak coupling regime, both at tree-level and one-loop. Each operator is represented by a closed spin chain Bethe state characterized by a set of momenta parameterizing the fermionic excitations. At one-loop, we calculate both the two-loop Bethe eigenstates and the relevant Feynman diagrams for the three-point functions within our setup. The final expression for the structure constants is surprisingly simple and hints at a possible form factor based approach yet to be unveiled.
