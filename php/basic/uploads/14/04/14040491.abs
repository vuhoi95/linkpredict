Title: Form factors of the half-infinite XXZ spin chain with a triangular  boundary
Authors: P. Baseilhac and T. Kojima
Abstract: The half-infinite XXZ spin chain with a triangular boundary is considered in the massive regime. Two integral representations of form factors of local operators are proposed using bosonization. Sufficient conditions such that the expressions for triangular boundary conditions coincide with those for diagonal boundary conditions are identified. The expressions are compared with known results upon specializations.Using the spin-reversal property which relates the Hamiltonian with upper and lower triangular boundary conditions, new identities between multiple integrals of infinite products are extracted.
