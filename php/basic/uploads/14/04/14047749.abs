Title: Subleading soft theorem in arbitrary dimension from scattering equations
Authors: Burkhard U. W. Schwab and Anastasia Volovich
Abstract: We investigate the new soft graviton theorem recently proposed in arXiv:1404.4091. We use the CHY formula to prove this universal formula for both Yang-Mills theory and gravity scattering amplitudes at tree level in arbitrary dimension.
