Title: Bicharacteristics and Fourier integral operators in Kasner spacetime
Authors: Emmanuele Battista and Elisabetta Di Grezia and Giampiero Esposito
Abstract: The scalar wave equation in Kasner spacetime is solved, first for a particular choice of Kasner parameters, by relating the integrand in the wave packet to the Bessel functions. An alternative integral representation is also displayed, which relies upon the method of integration in the complex domain for the solution of hyperbolic equations with variable coefficients. In order to study the propagation of wave fronts, we integrate the equations of bicharacteristics which are null geodesics, and we are able to express them, for the first time in the literature, with the help of elliptic integrals for another choice of Kasner parameters. For generic values of the three Kasner parameters, the solution of the Cauchy problem is built through a pair of integral operators, where the amplitude and phase functions in the integrand solve a coupled system of partial differential equations. The first is the so-called transport equation, whereas the second is a nonlinear equation that reduces to the eikonal equation if the amplitude is a slowly varying function. Remarkably, the analysis of such a coupled system is proved to be equivalent to building first an auxiliary covariant vector having vanishing divergence, while all nonlinearities are mapped into solving a covariant generalization of the Ermakov-Pinney equation for the amplitude function. Last, from a linear set of equations for the gradient of the phase one recovers the phase itself. This is the parametrix construction that relies upon Fourier-Maslov integral operators, but with a novel perspective on the nonlinearities in the dispersion relation. Furthermore, the Adomian method for nonlinear partial differential equations is applied to generate a recursive scheme for the evaluation of the amplitude function in the parametrix.
