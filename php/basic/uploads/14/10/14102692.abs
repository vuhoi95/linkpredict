Title: Effect of the Minimal Length on Bose-Einstein Condensation in the  Relativistic Ideal Bose Gas
Authors: Xiuming Zhang and Chi Tian
Abstract: Based on the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP), the critical temperature and the Helmholtz free energy of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in the relativistic ideal Bose gas are investigated. At the non-relativistic limit and the ultra-relativistic limit, we calculate the analytical form of the shifts of the critical temperature and the Helmholtz free energy caused by weak quantum gravitational effects. The exact numerical results of these shifts are obtained. Quantum gravity effects lift the critical temperature of BEC. By measuring the shift of the critical temperature, we can constrain the deformation parameter $\beta_0$. Furthermore, at lower densities, omitting quantum gravitational effects may lead to a metastable state while at sufficiently high densities, quantum gravitational effects tend to make BEC unstable. Using the numerical methods, the stable-unstable transition temperature is found.
