Title: Vectorial AdS_5/CFT_4 duality for spin-one boundary theory
Authors: M. Beccaria and A. A. Tseytlin
Abstract: We consider an example of vectorial AdS_5/CFT_4 duality when the boundary theory is described by N free complex or real Maxwell fields. It is dual to a particular ("type C") higher spin theory in AdS_5 containing fields in special mixed-symmetry representations. We extend the study of this theory in arXiv:1410.3273 by deriving the expression for the large N limit of the corresponding singlet-sector partition function on S^1 x S^3. We find that in both complex U(N) and real O(N) invariant cases the form of the one-particle partition function is as required by the AdS/CFT duality. We also demonstrate the matching of the Casimir energy on S^3 by assuming an integer shift in the bulk theory coupling.
