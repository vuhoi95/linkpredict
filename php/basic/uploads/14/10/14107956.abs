Title: Monte Carlo Computation of Spectral Density Function in Real-Time Scalar  Field Theory
Authors: Navid Abbasi and Ali Davody
Abstract: Non-perturbative study of "real-time" field theories is difficult due to the sign problem. We use Bold Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations to study the real-time $\phi^4$ theory in $d=4$ beyond the perturbative regime. Combining SD equations in a particular way, we derive a non-linear integral equation for the two-point function. Then we introduce a new method by which one can analytically perform the momentum part of loop integrals in this equation. The price we must pay for such simplification is to numerically solve a non-linear integral equation for the spectral density function. Using Bold diagrammatic Monte Carlo method we find non-perturbative spectral function of theory and compare it with the one obtained from perturbation theory. At the end we utilize our Monte Carlo result to find the full vertex function as the basis for the computation of real-time scattering amplitudes.
