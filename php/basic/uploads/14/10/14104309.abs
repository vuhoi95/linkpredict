Title: Doubled Conformal Compactification
Authors: Zhao Yong Sun and Yu Tian
Abstract: We use Weyl transformations between the Minkowski spacetime and dS/AdS spacetime to show that one cannot well define the electrodynamics globally on the ordinary conformal compactification of the Minkowski spacetime (or dS/AdS spacetime), where the electromagnetic field has a sign factor (and thus is discountinuous) at the light cone. This problem is intuitively and clearly shown by the Penrose diagrams, from which one may find the remedy without too much difficulty. We use the Minkowski and dS spacetimes together to cover the compactified space, which in fact leads to the doubled conformal compactification. On this doubled conformal compactification, we obtain the globally well-defined electrodynamics.
