Title: An alternative scenario for critical scalar field collapse in $AdS_3$
Authors: G. Clement and A. Fabbri
Abstract: In the context of gravitational collapse and black hole formation, we reconsider the problem to describe analytically the critical collapse of a massless and minimally coupled scalar field in $2+1$ gravity.
