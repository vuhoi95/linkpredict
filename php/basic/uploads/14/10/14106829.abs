Title: Quintic threefolds and Fano elevenfolds
Authors: Ed Segal and Richard P. Thomas
Abstract: The derived category of coherent sheaves on a general quintic threefold is a central object in mirror symmetry. We show that it can be embedded into the derived category of a certain Fano elevenfold. Our proof also generates related examples in different dimensions.
