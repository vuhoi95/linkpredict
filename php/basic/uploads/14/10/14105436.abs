Title: From algebraic curve to minimal surface and back
Authors: Michael Cooke and Nadav Drukker
Abstract: We derive the Lax operator for a very large family of classical minimal surface solutions in $AdS_3$ describing Wilson loops in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory. These solutions, constructed by Ishizeki, Kruczenski and Ziama, are associated with a hyperellictic surface of odd genus. We verify that the algebraic curve derived from the Lax operator is indeed none-other than this hyperelliptic surface.
