Title: Graviton modes in multiply warped geometry
Authors: Mathew Thomas Arun and Debajyoti Choudhury and Ashmita Das and Soumitra SenGupta
Abstract: The negative results in the search for Kaluza-Klein graviton modes at the LHC, when confronted with the discovery of the Higgs, has been construed to have severely limited the efficacy of the Randall-Sundrum model as an explanation of the hierarchy problem. We show, though, that the presence of multiple warping offers a natural resolution of this conundrum through modifications in both the graviton spectrum and their couplings to the Standard Model fields.
