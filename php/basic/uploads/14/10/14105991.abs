Title: Scattering matrices in the sl(3) twisted Yangian
Authors: Jean Avan and Anastasia Doikou and Nikos Karaiskos
Abstract: A quantum spin chain with non-conventional boundary conditions is studied. The distinct nature of these boundary conditions arises from the conversion of a soliton to an anti-soliton after being reflected to the boundary, hence the appellation soliton non-preserving boundary conditions. We focus on the simplest non-trivial case of this class of models based on the twisted Yangian quadratic algebra. Our computations are performed through the Bethe ansatz equations in the thermodynamic limit. We formulate a suitable quantization condition describing the scattering process and proceed with explicitly determining the bulk and boundary scattering amplitudes. The energy and quantum numbers of the low lying excitations are also derived.
