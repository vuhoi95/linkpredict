Title: Long String Dynamics in Pure Gravity on AdS$_3$
Authors: Jihun Kim and Massimo Porrati
Abstract: We study the classical dynamics of a completion of pure AdS gravity in 3D, whose only degrees of freedom are boundary gravitons and long strings. We argue that the best regime for describing pure gravity is that of "heavy" strings, for which back-reaction effects on the metric must be taken into account. We show that once back-reaction is properly accounted for, regular finite-energy states are produced by heavy strings even in the infinite-tension limit. Such a process is similar to, but different from, nucleation of space out of a "bubble of nothing."
