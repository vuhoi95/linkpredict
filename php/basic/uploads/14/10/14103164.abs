Abstract: We propose here a static and axisymmetric braneworld in six dimensions as a string-like model extension. For a subtle warp function, this scenario provides near brane corrections. By varying the bulk cosmological constant, we obtain a source which passes through different phases. The solution is defined both for the interior as for the exterior of the string and satisfies the weak energy condition. Smooth gravitational massless mode is localized on the brane which core is displaced from the origin. In contrast to the thin string model, the massive solutions have high amplitude near the brane. By means of an analogue quantum potential analysis, we show that s-waves gravitational Kaluza-Klein modes are permissible as resonant states.
