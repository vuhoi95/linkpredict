Title: Quantum Gravitational Correction and MOND Theory in the Holographic  Equipartition Scenario
Authors: Everton M. C. Abreu and Jorge Ananias Neto and Albert C. R. Mendes
Abstract: In this paper, by using Verlinde's formalism and a modified Padmanabhan's prescription, we have obtained the lowest order quantum correction to the gravitational acceleration and MOND-type theory by considering a nonzero difference between the number of bits of the holographic screen and number of bits of the holographic screen that satisfy the equipartition theorem. We will also carry out a phase transition and critical phenomena analysis in MOND-type theory where critical exponents are obtained.
