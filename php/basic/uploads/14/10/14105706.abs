Title: Remnant for all Black Objects due to Gravity's Rainbow
Authors: Ahmed Farag Ali and Mir Faizal and Mohammed M. Khalil
Abstract: We argue that a remnant is formed for all black objects in gravity's rainbow. This will be based on the observation that a remnant depends critically on the structure of the rainbow functions, and this dependence is a model independent phenomena. We thus propose general relations for the modified temperature and entropy of all black objects in gravity's rainbow. We explicitly check this to be the case for Kerr, Kerr-Newman-dS, charged-AdS, and higher dimensional Kerr-AdS black holes. We also try to argue that a remnant should form for black Saturn in gravity's rainbow. This work extends our previous results on remnants of Schwarzschild black holes [ arXiv:1402.5320] and black rings [arXiv:1409.5745].
