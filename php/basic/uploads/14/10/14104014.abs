Title: Bi-Local Field in Gravitational Shock Wave Background
Authors: Naohiro Kanda and Shigefumi Naka
Abstract: The particles with almost light velocity are able to be sources of the shock-wave gravity (SWG). Then, for ultra-high-energy particles, there exist two-body scatterings such that one particle is scattered from the gravitational background produced by another particle. Since the spacetime of SWG is closely related to a pp-wave solution of AdS-type background, this type of interaction is also interesting in AdS dual gauge theories. From those viewpoints, the scattering of point particles or strings by the SWG were studied. In this paper, we study the case of the bi-local models, which are simple relativistic bound systems having a close relation with specific modes of open strings. In particular, we analyze the bound-state effect on the scattering amplitudes, which describe the interaction between this model and SWG.
