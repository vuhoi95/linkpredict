Abstract: In the probe limit, we numerically construct a holographic p-wave superfluid model in the 4D and 5D AdS black holes coupled to a Maxwell-complex vector field. We find that, for the condensate with the fixed superfluid velocity, the results are similar to the s-wave cases in both 4D and 5D spacetimes. In particular, "The Cave of Winds" and the phase transition always being the second order take place in the 5D case. Moreover, we find the second-first order translating point $\frac{S_y}{\mu}$ increases with the mass squared. Furthermore, for the supercurrent with the fixed temperature, the results agree with the GL prediction near the critical temperature. In addition, this complex vector superfluid model is still a generalization of the SU(2) superfluid model, and also provides a holographic realization of the $He_3$ superfluid system.
