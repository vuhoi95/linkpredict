Abstract: Reciprocity is shown so far only when the scattering potential is either real or parity symmetric complex. We extend this result for parity violating complex potential by considering several explicit examples: (i) we show reciprocity for a PT symmetric (hence parity violating) complex potential which admits penetrating state solutions analytically for all possible values of incidence energy and (ii) reciprocity is shown to hold at certain discrete energies for two other parity violating complex potentials.
