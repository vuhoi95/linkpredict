Abstract: A scalar--tensor theory of gravity, containing an arbitrary coupling function $F(\phi)$ and a general potential $V(\phi)$, is considered in the context of a spatially flat FLRW model. The use of reparametrization invariance enables a particular lapse parametrization in which the mini--superspace metric completely specifies the dynamics of the system. A requirement of existence of the maximal possible number of autonomous integrals of motion is imposed. This leads to a flat mini--superspace metric realized by a particular relation between the coupling function and the potential. The space of solutions is completely described in terms of the three autonomous integrals of motion constructed by the Killing fields of the mini--supermetric and an additional rheonomous emanating from the homothetic field. The solutions contain the arbitrary function which remains after the imposition of the relation between $F(\phi)$ and $V(\phi)$. To exemplify the use of the general results, we select some particular cases and study their physical implications through an effective energy--momentum tensor, which tends out to be that of a perfect fluid.
