Abstract: We study the dynamics of a quantum critical boson coupled to a Fermi surface in intermediate energy regimes where the Landau damping of the boson can be parametrically controlled, either via large Fermi velocity or by large N techniques. We focus on developing a systematic approach to studying the BCS instability, including careful treatment of the enhanced log^2 and log^3 singularities which appear already at 1-loop. We also treat possible instabilities to charge density wave (CDW) formation, and compare the scales Lambda_{BCS} and Lambda_{CDW} of the onset of the instabilities in different parametric regimes. We address the question of whether the dressing of the fermions into a non-Fermi liquid via interactions with the order parameter field can happen at energies > Lambda_{BCS}, Lambda_{CDW}.
