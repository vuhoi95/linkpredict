Title: Noether symmetry in Horndeski Lagrangian
Authors: Davood Momeni and Ratbay Myrzakulov
Abstract: The Noether symmetry issue for Horndeski Lagrangian has been studied. We have been proven a series of theorems about the form of Noether conserved charge (current) for irregular (not quadratic) dynamical systems. Special attentions have been made on Horndeski Lagrangian. We have been proven that for Horndeski Lagrangian always is possible to find a way to make symmetrization.
