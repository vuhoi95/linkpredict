Title: Siklos waves with torsion in 3D
Authors: M. Blagojević and B. Cvetković
Abstract: Starting from the Siklos waves in general relativity with a cosmological constant, interpreted as gravitational waves on the anti-de Sitter background, a new class of exact torsion waves is constructed in the framework of three-dimensional gravity with propagating torsion. In the asymptotic limit, the geometry of torsion waves takes the anti-de Sitter form. In the sector with massless torsion modes, we found a set of asymptotic conditions that leads to the conformal asymptotic symmetry.
