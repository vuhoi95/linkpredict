Title: Testing volume independence of SU(N) pure gauge theories at large N
Authors: Antonio Gonzalez-Arroyo and Masanori Okawa
Abstract: In this paper we present our results concerning the dependence of Wilson loop expectation values on the size of the lattice and the rank of the SU(N) gauge group. This allows to test the claims about volume independence in the large N limit, and the crucial dependence on boundary conditions. Our highly precise results provide strong support for the validity of the twisted reduction mechanism and the TEK model, provided the fluxes are chosen within the appropriate domain.
