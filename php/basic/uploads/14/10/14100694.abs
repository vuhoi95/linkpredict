Abstract: The nonlinear stability of Kerr-Newman black holes (KNBHs) is investigated by performing numerical simulations within the full Einstein-Maxwell theory. We take as initial data a KNBH with mass $M$, angular momentum to mass ratio $a$ and charge $Q$. Evolutions are performed to scan this parameter space within the intervals $0\le a/M\le 0.994$ and $0\le Q/M\le 0.996$, corresponding to an extremality parameter $a/a_{\rm max}$ ($a_{\rm max} \equiv \sqrt{M^2-Q^2}$) ranging from $0$ to $0.995$. These KNBHs are evolved, together with a small bar-mode perturbation, up to a time of order $120M$. Our results suggest that for small $Q/a$, the quadrupolar oscillation modes depend solely on $a/a_{\rm max}$, a universality also apparent in previous perturbative studies in the regime of small rotation. Using as a stability criterion the absence of significant relative variations in the horizon areal radius and BH spin, we find no evidence for any developing instability.
