Title: Rotating Ayón-Beato-García black hole as a particle accelerator
Authors: Sushant G. Ghosh and Pankaj Sheoran and Muhammed Amir
Abstract: We study the collision of two particles with equal masses moving in the equatorial plane near horizon of the rotating regular Ay\'on-Beato-Garc\'ia (ABG) black hole (BH) and calculate the center-of-mass (CM) energy for the colliding particles for both extremal and non-extremal cases. It turns out that CM energy depends not only on rotation parameter $a$ but also on charge $Q$. Particularly for the extremal rotating regular ABG BH, CM energy of two colliding particles could be arbitrarily high for critical angular momentum of particles. Furthermore, we also show that, for a non-extremal BH, there exist a finite upper limit of CM energy, which changes with charge $Q$. A comparison, with Kerr and Kerr-Newman black holes, is included.
