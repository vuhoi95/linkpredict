Title: Non-minimally Coupled Tachyon Field in Teleparallel Gravity
Authors: Behnaz Fazlpour and Ali Banijamali
Abstract: We perform a full investigation on dynamics of a new dark energy model in which the four-derivative of a non-canonical scalar field (tachyon) is non-minimally coupled to the vector torsion. Our analysis is done in the framework of teleparallel equivalent of general relativity which is based on torsion instead of curvature. We show that in our model there exists a late-time scaling attractor (point $P_{4}$), corresponding to an accelerating universe with the property that dark energy and dark matter densities are of the same order. Such a point can help to alleviate the cosmological coincidence problem. Existence of this point is the most significant difference between our model and another model in which a canonical scalar field (quintessence) is used instead of tachyon field.
