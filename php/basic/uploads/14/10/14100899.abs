Title: The holographic supersymmetric Renyi entropy in five dimensions
Authors: Luis F. Alday and Paul Richmond and James Sparks
Abstract: We compute the supersymmetric Renyi entropy across an entangling three-sphere for five-dimensional superconformal field theories using localization. For a class of USp(2N) gauge theories we construct a holographic dual 1/2 BPS black hole solution of Euclidean Romans F(4) supergravity. The large N limit of the gauge theory results agree perfectly with the supergravity computations.
