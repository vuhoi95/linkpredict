Title: On the spin-2 Kaluza-Klein spectrum of AdS4 x S2(B4)
Authors: Jean-Marc Richard and Robin Terrisse and Dimitrios Tsimpis
Abstract: We perform a numerical study of the four-dimensional spin-2 Kaluza-Klein spectrum of supersymmetric AdS$_4\times S^2(\mathcal{B}_4)$ vacua and show that they do not exhibit scale separation. Our methods are generally applicable to similar problems where the compactification geometry is not known analytically, hence an analytic treatment of the spectrum of Kaluza-Klein masses is not available.
