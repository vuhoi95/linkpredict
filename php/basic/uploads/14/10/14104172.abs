Authors: Ali R. Amani and A. Samiee-Nouri
Abstract: In this paper, we have considered $F(R,T)$ gravity as a linear function of the curvature and torsion scalars and interacted it with logarithmic entropy corrected holographic dark energy to evaluate cosmology solutions. The model has been investigated by FRW metric, and then the energy density and the pressure of dark energy have calculated. Also we obtained equation of state (EoS) parameter of dark energy and has plotted it with respect to both variable of cosmic time and $e$-folding number. Finally, we have described the scenario in three status: early, late and future time by $e$-folding number.
