Title: Supersymmetric RÃ©nyi Entropy in Five Dimensions
Authors: Naofumi Hama and Tatsuma Nishioka and Tomonori Ugajin
Abstract: We introduce supersymmetric R\'enyi entropies for $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories in five dimensions. The matrix model representation is obtained using the localization method and the large-$N$ behavior is studied. The gravity dual is a supersymmetric charged topological AdS$_6$ black hole in the Romans $F(4)$ supergravity. The variation of the supersymmetric R\'enyi entropy due to the insertion of a BPS Wilson loop is computed. We find perfect agreements between the large-$N$ and the dual gravity computations both with and without the Wilson loop operator.
