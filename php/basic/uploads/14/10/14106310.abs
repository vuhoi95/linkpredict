Title: A Twistorial Approach to Integrability in N=4 SYM
Authors: Laura Koster and Vladimir Mitev and Matthias Staudacher
Abstract: While the achievements in the study of N=4 Super Yang-Mills through the application of integrability are impressive, the precise origins of the exact solvability remain shrouded in mystery. In this note, we propose that viewing the problem through the lens of twistor theory should help to clarify the reasons for integrability. We illustrate the power of this approach by rederiving the model's one-loop spin chain dilatation operator in the SO(6) sector.
