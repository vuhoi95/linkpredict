Title: Spin-torsion coupling and gravitational moments of Dirac fermions:  theory and experimental bounds
Authors: Yuri N. Obukhov and Alexander J. Silenko and Oleg V. Teryaev
Abstract: We discuss the quantum dynamics of the Dirac fermion particle in a gauge gravitational field. The minimal as well as the Pauli-type nonminimal coupling of a fermion with external fields is studied, bringing into consideration the notions of the translational and the Lorentz gravitational moments. The anomalous gravitomagnetic and gravitoelectric moments are ruled out on the basis of the covariance arguments. We derive the general Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation for an arbitrary configuration of the gauge gravitational field without assuming it weak. Making use of the Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonian for the Dirac particle coupled to magnetic field in a noninertial reference system, we analyze the recent experimental data and obtain bounds on the spacetime torsion.
