Title: Shock waves in Lifshitz-like spacetimes
Authors: I. Ya. Aref'eva and A. A. Golubtsova
Abstract: We construct shock waves for Lifshitz-like geometries in four- and five-dimensional effective theories as well as in D3-D7 and D4-D6 brane systems. The solutions to the domain wall profile equations are found. Further, the study makes a connection with the implications for the quark-gluon plasma formation in heavy-ion collisions. According to the holographic approach, the multiplicity of particles produced in heavy-ion collisions can be estimated by the area of the trapped surface formed in shock wave collisions. We calculate the areas of trapped surfaces in the geometry of two colliding Lifshitz domain walls. Our estimates show that for five-dimensional cases with certain values of the critical exponent the dependence of multiplicity on the energy of colliding ions is rather close to the experimental data ${\cal M} \sim s^{\,0.15}$ observed at RHIC and LHC.
