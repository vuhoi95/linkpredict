Title: Unravelling Holographic Entanglement Entropy in Higher Spin Theories
Authors: Alejandra Castro and Eva Llabr√©s
Abstract: There are two proposals that compute holographic entanglement entropy in AdS$_3$ higher spin theories based on $SL(N,\mathbb{R})$ Chern-Simons theory. We show explicitly that these two proposals are equivalent. We also designed two methods that solve systematically the equations for arbitrary $N$. For finite charge backgrounds in AdS$_3$, we find exact agreement between our expressions and the short interval correction of the entanglement entropy for an excited state in a CFT$_2$.
