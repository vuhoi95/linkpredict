Title: Dynamical generation of the weak and Dark Matter scales from strong  interactions
Authors: Oleg Antipin and Michele Redi and Alessandro Strumia
Abstract: Assuming that mass scales arise in nature only via dimensional transmutation, we extend the dimension-less Standard Model by adding vector-like fermions charged under a new strong gauge interaction. Their non-perturbative dynamics generates a mass scale that is transmitted to the elementary Higgs boson by electro-weak gauge interactions. In its minimal version the model has the same number of parameters as the Standard Model, predicts that the electro-weak symmetry gets broken, predicts new-physics in the multi-TeV region and is compatible with all existing bounds, provides two Dark Matter candidates stable thanks to accidental symmetries: a composite scalar in the adjoint of SU(2)_L and a composite singlet fermion; their thermal relic abundance is predicted to be comparable to the measured cosmological DM abundance. Some models of this type allow for extra Yukawa couplings; DM candidates remain even if explicit masses are added.
