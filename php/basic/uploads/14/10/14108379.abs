Title: Holographic superconductors with Weyl corrections
Authors: Davood Momeni and Muhammad Raza and Ratbay Myrzakulov
Abstract: A quick review on the analytical aspects of holographic superconductors (HSC) with Weyl corrections has been presented. Mainly we focus on matching method and variations approaches. Different types of such HSC have been investigated, s-wave, p-wave and St\'{u}ckelberg ones. We also review the fundamental construction of a p-wave type , in which the non-Abelian gauge field is coupled to the Weyl tensor. The results are compared from numerics to analytical results.
