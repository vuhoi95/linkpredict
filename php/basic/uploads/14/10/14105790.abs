Title: Analyzing the squeezed state generated by a twist deformation
Authors: Benjamin A. Burrington and Samir D. Mathur and Amanda W. Peet and Ida G. Zadeh
Abstract: The D1D5 CFT has provided a useful microscopic model for studying black holes. The coupling in this theory is a twist deformation whose action on the vacuum generates a squeezed state. We give a new derivation of the expression for this squeezed state using the conformal Ward identity; this derivation provides an insight into several features of the state. We also examine the squeezed state in a continuum limit where we describe it in terms of position space correlations created by the twist.
