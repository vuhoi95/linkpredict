Title: Loop quantization of a 3D Abelian BF model with sigma-model matter
Authors: Diego C. M. Mendon√ßa and Olivier Piguet
Abstract: The main goal of this work is to explore the symmetries and develop the dynamics associated to a 3D Abelian BF model coupled to scalar fields submitted to a sigma model like constraint, at the classical and quantum levels. We apply to the present model the techniques of Loop Quantum Gravity, construct its physical Hilbert space and its observables.
