Title: Coexistence and competition of ferromagnetism and p-wave  superconductivity in holographic model
Authors: Rong-Gen Cai and Run-Qiu Yang
Abstract: By combining a holographic p-wave superconductor model and a holographic ferromagnetism model, we study the coexistence and competition of ferromagnetism and p-wave superconductivity. It is found that the results depend on the self-interaction of magnetic moment of the complex vector field and which phase appears first. In the case that the ferromagnetic phase appears first, if the interaction is attractive, the system shows the ferromagnetism and superconductivity can coexist in low temperatures. If the interaction is repulsive, the system will only be in a pure ferromagnetic state. In the case that the superconducting phase appears first, the attractive interaction will leads to a magnetic p-wave superconducting phase in low temperatures. If the interaction is repulsive, the system will be in a pure p-wave superconducting phase or ferromagnetic phase when the temperature is lowered.
