Title: Worldsheet instantons and (0,2) linear models
Authors: Marco Bertolini and M. Ronen Plesser
Abstract: We study the stability of heterotic compactifications described by (0,2) gauged linear sigma models with respect to worldsheet instanton corrections to the space-time superpotential following the work of Beasley and Witten. We show that generic models elude the vanishing theorem proved there, and may not determine supersymmetric heterotic vacua. We then construct a subclass of linear models for which a vanishing theorem holds, generating an extensive list of consistent heterotic backgrounds.
