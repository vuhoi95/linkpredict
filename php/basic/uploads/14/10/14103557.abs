Title: The f(R) Gravity Function of the Linde Quintessence
Authors: Sergei V. Ketov and Natsuki Watanabe
Abstract: We calculate the f(R) gravity function in the dual gravity description of the quintessence model with a quadratic (Linde) scalar potential and a positive cosmological constant. We find that in the large curvature regime relevant to chaotic inflation in early Universe, the dual f(R) gravity is well approximated by the (matter) loop-corrected Starobinsky inflationary model. In the small curvature regime relevant to dark energy in the present Universe, the f(R) gravity function reduces to the Einstein-Hilbert one with a positive cosmological constant.
