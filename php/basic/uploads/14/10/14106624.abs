Title: Unification of Coupling Constants, Dimension six Operators and the  Spectral Action
Authors: Agostino Devastato and Fedele Lizzi and Carlos Valcarcel Flores and Dmitri Vassilevich
Abstract: We investigate whether inclusion of dimension six terms in the Standard Model lagrangean may cause the unification of the coupling constants at a scale comprised between 10^14 and 10^17 GeV. Particular choice of the dimension 6 couplings is motivated by the spectral action. Given the theoretical and phenomenological constraints, as well as recent data on the Higgs mass, we find that the unification is indeed possible, with a lower unification scale slightly favoured.
