Title: Note on "Finite Field-Energy and Interparticle Potential in Logarithmic  Electrodynamics"
Authors: D. Gitman and A. Shabad
Abstract: We propose an identification of the free parameter in the model of nonlinear electrodynamics proposed in P. Gaete and J. Helayel-Neto, Eur. Phys. J. C 74, 2816 (2014) by equating the second term in the power expansion of its Lagrangian with that in the expansion of the Heiseberg-Euler Lagrangian. The resulting value of the field-energy of a point-like charge makes 0.988 of the electron mass, if the charge is that of the electron.
