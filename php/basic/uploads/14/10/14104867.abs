Title: F-theory on singular spaces
Authors: Andres Collinucci and Raffaele Savelli
Abstract: We propose a framework for treating F-theory directly, without resolving or deforming its singularities. This allows us to explore new sectors of gauge theories, including exotic bound states such as T-branes, in a global context. We use the mathematical framework known as Eisenbud's matrix factorizations for hypersurface singularities. We display the usefulness of this technique by way of examples, including affine singularities of both conifold and orbifold type, as well as a class of full-fledged compact elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau fourfolds.
