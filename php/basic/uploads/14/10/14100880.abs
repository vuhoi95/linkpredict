Title: A Skyrme model approach to the spin-orbit force
Authors: C. J. Halcrow and N. S. Manton
Abstract: The spin-orbit force is a vital tool in describing finite nuclei and nucleon interactions; however its microscopic origin is not fully understood. In this paper we study a model inspired by Skyrmions which provides a classical explanation of the force. To simplify the calculations the Skyrmions are approximated as two-dimensional rigid discs which behave like quantum cogwheels.
