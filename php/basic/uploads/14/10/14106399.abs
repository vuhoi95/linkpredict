Title: Negative magnetoresistivity in chiral fluids and holography
Authors: Karl Landsteiner and Yan Liu and Ya-Wen Sun
Abstract: In four dimensions Weyl fermions possess a chiral anomaly which leads to several special features in the transport phenomena, such as the negative longitudinal magnetoresistivity. In this paper, we study its inverse, the longitudinal magnetoconductivity, in the case of a chiral anomalous system with a background magnetic field B using the linear response method in the hydrodynamic limit and from holography. Our hydrodynamic results show that in general we need to have energy, momentum and charge dissipations to get a finite DC longitudinal magnetoconductivity due to the existence of the chiral anomaly. Applying the formula that we get from hydrodynamics to the holographic system in the probe limit, we find that the result in the hydrodynamic regime matches that calculated from holography via Kubo formula. The holographic result shows that in an intermediate regime of B there is naturally a negative magnetoresistivity which decreases as 1/B. At small B direct calculations in the holographic system suggest that holography provides a new explanation for the small B positive magnetoresistivity behavior seen in experiment, i.e. the small B behavior comes from the quantum critical conductivity being affected by the chiral anomaly.
