Title: Geometry and Topology of String Junctions
Authors: Antonella Grassi and James Halverson and Julius L. Shaneson
Abstract: We study elliptic fibrations by analyzing suitable deformations of the fibrations and vanishing cycles. We introduce geometric string junctions and describe some of their properties. We show how the structure of the geometric string junctions is naturally related to the Lie algebra structures of the associated singularities. One application in physics is in F-theory, where our novel approach connecting deformations and Lie algebras describes the structure of generalized type IIB seven-branes and string junction states which end on them.
