Title: Yang-Mills like instantons in eight and seven dimensions
Authors: E. K. Loginov and E. D. Loginova
Abstract: We consider a gauge theory in which a nonassociative Moufang loop takes the place of a structure group. We construct Belavin-Polyakov-Schwartz-Tyupkin (BPST) and t'Hooft like instanton solutions of the gauge theory in seven and eight dimensions.
