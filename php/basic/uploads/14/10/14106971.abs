Title: Parallel software for lattice N=4 supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory
Authors: David Schaich and Thomas DeGrand
Abstract: We present new parallel software, SUSY LATTICE, for lattice studies of four-dimensional $\mathcal N = 4$ supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory with gauge group SU(N). The lattice action is constructed to exactly preserve a single supersymmetry charge at non-zero lattice spacing, up to additional potential terms included to stabilize numerical simulations. The software evolved from the MILC code for lattice QCD, and retains a similar large-scale framework despite the different target theory. Many routines are adapted from an existing serial code, which SUSY LATTICE supersedes. This paper provides an overview of the new parallel software, summarizing the lattice system, describing the applications that are currently provided and explaining their basic workflow for non-experts in lattice gauge theory. We discuss the parallel performance of the code, and highlight some notable aspects of the documentation for those interested in contributing to its future development.
