Title: Drag force in strongly coupled, anisotropic plasma at finite chemical  potential
Authors: Somdeb Chakraborty and Najmul Haque
Abstract: We employ methods of gauge/string duality to analyze the drag force on a heavy quark moving through a strongly coupled, anisotropic \mathcal{N}=4, SU(N) super Yang- Mills plasma in the presence of a finite U(1) chemical potential. We present numerical results valid for any value of the anisotropy parameter and the U(1) charge density and arbitrary direction of the quark velocity with respect to the direction of anisotropy. In the small anisotropy limit we are also able to furnish analytical results.
