Title: Factorization of Mellin amplitudes
Authors: Vasco Gonçalves and João Penedones and Emilio Trevisani
Abstract: We introduce Mellin amplitudes for correlation functions of $k$ scalar operators and one operator with spin in conformal field theories (CFT) in general dimension. We show that Mellin amplitudes for scalar operators have simple poles with residues that factorize in terms of lower point Mellin amplitudes, similarly to what happens for scattering amplitudes in flat space. Finally, we study the flat space limit of Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space, in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, and generalize a formula relating CFT Mellin amplitudes to scattering amplitudes of the bulk theory, including particles with spin.
