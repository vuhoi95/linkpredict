Title: Entanglement Entropy for Relevant and Geometric Perturbations
Authors: Vladimir Rosenhaus and Michael Smolkin
Abstract: We continue the study of entanglement entropy for a QFT through a perturbative expansion of the path integral definition of the reduced density matrix. The universal entanglement entropy for a CFT perturbed by a relevant operator is calculated to second order in the coupling. We also explore the geometric dependence of entanglement entropy for a deformed planar entangling surface, finding surprises at second order.
