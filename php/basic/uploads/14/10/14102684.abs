Abstract: We construct an effective field theory for the 2d spineless p-wave paired superconductor that faithfully describes the topological properties of the bulk state, and also provides a model for the subgap states at vortex cores and edges. In particular it captures the topologically protected zero modes and has the correct ground state degeneracy on the torus. We also show that our effective field theory becomes a topological field theory in a well defined scaling limit and that the vortices have the expected non-abelian braiding statistics.
