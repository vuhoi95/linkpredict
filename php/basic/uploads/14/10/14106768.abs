Title: Remarks on Gribov mechanism on N=1 Supersymmetric 3D theories and the  possibility of obtaining Gribov from one ABJM like Theory
Authors: M. M. Amaral and V. E. R. Lemes
Abstract: Some remarks on Gribov mechanism on N=1 Supersymmetric 3D theories are presented. The two point correlation function is analysed and the possibility of obtaining the confining Gribov regime is discussed. Also the possibility of obtaining Gribov behaviour in ABJM due to a symmetry breaking is presented.
