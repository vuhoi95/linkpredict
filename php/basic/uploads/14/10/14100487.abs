Title: Matrix model holography
Authors: Thomas Ortiz and Henning Samtleben and Dimitrios Tsimpis
Abstract: We set up the formalism of holographic renormalization for the matter-coupled two-dimensional maximal supergravity that captures the low-lying fluctuations around the non-conformal D0-brane near-horizon geometry. As an application we compute holographically one- and two-point functions of the BFSS matrix quantum mechanics and its supersymmetric $SO(3)\times SO(6)$ deformation.
