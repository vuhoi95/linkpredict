Abstract: We construct a holographic model for a fermionic system on Q-lattice and compute the spectral function in the presence of a dipole coupling. Both key features of doped Mott insulators, the dynamical generation of a gap and spectral weight transfer, are observed when adjusting the value of the coupling parameter $p$. Of particular interest is that when the background is in a deep insulating phase, the Mott gap opens much easier with a smaller coupling parameter in comparison with a metallic background. The effects of lattice parameters on the width of the gap $\Delta/\mu$ are studied and a turning point is observed near the critical regime of metal-insulator transitions of the background. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of the spectral function is studied. Finally, we also observe that the anisotropic Q-lattice generates anisotropic peaks with different magnitudes, indicating that insulating and metallic phases arise in different directions.
