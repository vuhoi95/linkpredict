Title: Neutral Naturalness from the Orbifold Higgs
Authors: Nathaniel Craig and Simon Knapen and Pietro Longhi
Abstract: We present a general class of natural theories in which the Higgs is a pseudo-goldstone boson in an orbifolded gauge theory. The symmetry protecting the Higgs at low energies is an accidental global symmetry of the quadratic action, rather than a full continuous symmetry. The lightest degrees of freedom protecting the weak scale carry no Standard Model (SM) quantum numbers and interact with visible matter principally through the Higgs portal. We find that the twin Higgs is the simplest example of an orbifold Higgs. This opens the door to the systematic study of "neutral naturalness": natural theories with SM-neutral states that are as yet untested by the LHC.
