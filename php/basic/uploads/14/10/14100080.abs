Title: Higher Spin Currents in Orthogonal Wolf Space
Authors: Changhyun Ahn and Jinsub Paeng
Abstract: For the N=4 superconformal coset theory by [SO(N+4)/SO(N) x SU(2)] x U(1) (that contains an orthogonal Wolf space) with N=4, the N=2 WZW affine current algebra is obtained. The 16 generators (or 11 generators) of the large N=4 linear (or nonlinear) superconformal algebra are described by these WZW affine currents explicitly. Along the line of large N=4 holography, the extra 16 currents with spins (2,5/2,5/2, 3), (5/2, 3, 3, 7/2), (5/2, 3, 3, 7/2), and (3, 7/2, 7/2, 4) are obtained in terms of the WZW affine currents. The lowest spin of this N=4 multiplet is two rather than one which is for an unitary Wolf space. The operator product expansions (OPEs) between the above 11 currents and these extra 16 higher spin currents are found explicitly.
