Title: Gauge Theories and Dessins d'Enfants: Beyond the Torus
Authors: Sownak Bose and James Gundry and Yang-Hui He
Abstract: Dessin d'Enfants on elliptic curves are a powerful way of encoding doubly-periodic brane tilings, and thus, of four-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories whose vacuum moduli space is toric, providing an interesting interplay between physics, geometry, combinatorics and number theory. We discuss and provide a partial classification of the situation in genera other than one by computing explicit Belyi pairs associated to the gauge theories. Important also is the role of the Igusa and Shioda invariants that generalise the elliptic $j$-invariant.
