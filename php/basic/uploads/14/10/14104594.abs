Title: Chiral Ring of Strange Metals: The Multicolor Limit
Authors: Mikhail Isachenkov and Ingo Kirsch and Volker Schomerus
Abstract: The low energy limit of a dense 2D adjoint QCD is described by a family of ${\cal N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetric coset conformal field theories. In previous work we constructed chiral primaries for a small number $N < 6$ of colors. Our aim in the present note is to determine the chiral ring in the multicolor limit where $N$ is sent to infinity. We shall find that chiral primaries are labeled by partitions and identify the ring they generate as the ring of Schur polynomials. Our findings impose strong constraints on the possible dual description through string theory in an $AdS_3$ compactification.
