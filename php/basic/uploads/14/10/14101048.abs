Title: Deriving Veneziano Model in a Novel String Field Theory Solving String  Theory by Liberating Right and Left Movers
Authors: Holger B. Nielsen and Masao Ninomiya
Abstract: Bosonic string theory with the possibility for an arbitrary number of strings - i.e. a string field theory - is formulated by a Hilbert space (a Fock space), which is just that for massless noninteracting scalars. We earlier presented this novel type of string field theory, but now we show that it leads to scattering just given by the Veneziano model amplitude. Generalization to strings with fermion modes would presumably be rather easy. It is characteristic for our formulation /model that: 1) We have thrown away some null set of information compared to usual string field theory, 2)Formulated in terms of our \objects" (= the non-interacting scalars) there is no interaction and essentially no time development(Heisenberg picture), 3) so that the S-matrix is in our Hilbert space given as the unit matrix, S=1, and 4) the Veneziano scattering amplitude appear as the overlap between the initial and the final state described in terms of the \objects". 5) The integration in the Euler beta function making up the Veneziano model appear from the summation over the number of \objects" from one of the incoming strings which goes into a certain one of the two outgoing strings. A correction from Weyl anomaly is needed to get the correct form of the Veneziano amplitude and it only fits for 26 dimensions.
