Title: Natural Inflation from Near Alignment in Heterotic String Theory
Authors: Tibra Ali and S. Shajidul Haque and Vishnu Jejjala
Abstract: We propose a model for large field inflation in heterotic string theory. The construction applies the near alignment mechanism of Kim, Nilles, and Peloso. By including gaugino condensates and world-sheet instanton non-perturbative effects, we obtain a large effective axion decay constant.
