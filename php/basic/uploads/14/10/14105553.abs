Title: New massive spin two model on curved space-time
Authors: Satoshi Akagi and Yuichi Ohara and Shin'ichi Nojiri
Abstract: We have proposed a new ghost-free model with interactions of massive spin two particles in Phys.\ Rev.\ D {\bf 90} (2014) 043006 [arXiv:1402.5737 [hep-th]]. Although the model is ghost-free on the Minkowski space-time, it is not obvious whether or not this desirable property is preserved on curved space-time. In fact, Buchbinder et al. already pointed out that the Fierz-Pauli theory is not ghost-free on curved space-time without non-minimal coupling terms. In this paper, we construct a new theory of massive spin two particles with non-minimal coupling on curved space-time and show that the model can be ghost-free. Furthermore, we propose new non-minimal coupling terms.
