Abstract: Quantumness and separability criteria for continuous variable systems are discussed for the case of a noncommutative (NC) phase-space. In particular, the quantum nature and the entanglement configuration of NC two-mode Gaussian states are examined. Two families of covariance matrices describing standard quantum mechanics (QM) separable states are deformed into a NC QM configuration and then investigated through the positive partial transpose criterium for identifying quantum entanglement. It is shown that the entanglement of Gaussian states may be exclusively induced by switching on the NC deformation. Extensions of some preliminary results are presented.
