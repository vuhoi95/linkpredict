Title: On the Singularity Structure of Maximally Supersymmetric Scattering  Amplitudes

Abstract: We present evidence that loop amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric $\mathcal{N}=4$ Yang-Mills (SYM) beyond the planar limit share some of the remarkable structures of the planar theory. In particular, we show that through two loops, the four-particle amplitude in full $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM has only logarithmic singularities and is free of any poles at infinity---properties closely related to uniform transcendentality and the UV-finiteness of the theory. We also briefly comment on implications for maximal ($\mathcal{N}=8$) supergravity.
