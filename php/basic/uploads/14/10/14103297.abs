Title: The melting of charmonium in a magnetic field from an effective AdS/QCD  model
Authors: David Dudal and Thomas G. Mertens
Abstract: We study the influence of a background magnetic field on the melting of the J/psi vector meson by introducing a Born-Infeld modification of the soft-wall model. Out of the three polarizations of the massive vector meson, we find that the longitudinal one (parallel to the applied magnetic field) melts only at an even higher temperature than the deconfinement temperature, whereas the two transverse polarizations melt at a lower temperature than in the absence of a magnetic field. We also conduct a preliminary investigation of the effect of the magnetic field on the heavy quark diffusion coefficient, showing an increased diffusion constant for the longitudinal polarization with respect to the transverse polarizations.
