Title: Deformations of Coisotropic Submanifolds in Abstract Jacobi Manifolds
Authors: Hông Vân Lê and Yong-Geun Oh and Alfonso G. Tortorella and Luca Vitagliano
Abstract: In this paper, using the Atiyah algebroid and first order multi-differential calculus on non-trivial line bundles, we attach an $L_\infty$-algebra to any coisotropic submanifold $S$ in an abstract (or Kirillov's) Jacobi manifold. Our construction generalizes and unifies analogous constructions in symplectic, Poisson case, and locally conformal symplectic geometry. As a new special case, we attach an $L_\infty$-algebra to any coisotropic submanifold in a contact manifold, including Legendrian submanifolds. The $L_\infty$-algebra of a coisotropic submanifold $S$ governs the (formal) deformation problem of $S$.
