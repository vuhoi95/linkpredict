Title: Inflation in scale-invariant theories of gravity
Authors: Massimiliano Rinaldi and Guido Cognola and Luciano Vanzo and Sergio Zerbini
Abstract: Thanks to the Planck Collaboration, we know the value of the scalar spectral index of primordial fluctuations with unprecedented precision. In addition, the joint analysis of the data from Planck, BICEP2, and KEK has further constrained the value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ so that chaotic inflationary scenarios seem to be disfavoured. Inspired by these results, we look for a model that yields a value of $r$ that is larger than the one predicted by the Starobinsky model but is still within the new constraints. We show that purely quadratic, renormalizable, and scale-invariant gravity, implemented by loop-corrections, satisfies these requirements.
