Title: Super-inflation and generation of first order vector perturbations in  ELKO
Authors: Abhishek Basak and S. Shankaranarayanan
Abstract: In this work we construct a model where the first order vector perturbations can be generated during inflationary expansion. For the non-standard spinors, known as ELKO, we show that the components of the first order perturbed energy-momentum tensor of the ELKO is non-zero for pure vector part of the metric perturbation ($B_{i}$). We show that vector perturbations do not decay in the super-Hubble scale and for a specific super-inflation background model we show that the vector perturbations are nearly scale invariant, while its amplitude is smaller than the primordial scalar perturbations. We also comment on the generation of vorticity.
