Abstract: We construct a new SO(3)$\times$SO(3) invariant non-supersymmetric solution of the bosonic field equations of $D=11$ supergravity from the corresponding stationary point of maximal gauged $N=8$ supergravity by making use of the non-linear uplift formulae for the metric and the 3-form potential. The latter are crucial as this solution appears to be inaccessible to traditional techniques of solving Einstein's field equations, and is arguably the most complicated closed form solution of this type ever found. The solution is also a promising candidate for a stable non-supersymmetric solution of M-theory uplifted from gauged supergravity. The technique that we present here may be applied more generally to uplift other solutions of gauged supergravity.
