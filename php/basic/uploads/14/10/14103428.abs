Title: Isometry Group Orbit Quantization of Spinning Strings in AdS_3 x S^3
Authors: Martin Heinze and George Jorjadze and Luka Megrelidze
Abstract: Describing the bosonic AdS_3 x S^3 particle and string in SU(1,1) x SU(2) group variables, we provide a Hamiltonian treatment of the isometry group orbits of solutions via analysis of the pre-symplectic form. For the particle we obtain a one-parameter family of orbits parameterized by creation-annihilation variables, which leads to the Holstein-Primakoff realization of the isometry group generators. The scheme is then applied to spinning string solutions characterized by one winding number in AdS_3 and two winding numbers in S^3. We find a two-parameter family of orbits, where quantization again provides the Holstein-Primakoff realization of the symmetry generators with an oscillator type energy spectrum. Analyzing the minimal energy at strong coupling we verify the spectrum of short strings at special values of winding numbers.
