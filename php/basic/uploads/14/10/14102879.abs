Title: Multiple backreacted flavour branes
Authors: Veselin G. Filev and Dimitrios Zoakos
Abstract: We construct a novel supergravity background holographically dual to the flavoured N=1 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We consider flavours of different masses that produce spherical cavities with radii corresponding to the quark masses. The positive beta function blows at some large radial distance corresponding to the Landau pole of the theory. We explore the Wilson loop between two families of light and heavy quarks and observe a screening of the heavy light potential.
