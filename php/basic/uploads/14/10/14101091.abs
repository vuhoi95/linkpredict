Title: On the gluon operator effective potential in holographic Yang-Mills  theory
Authors: Elias Kiritsis and Wenliang Li and Francesco Nitti
Abstract: The holographic formalism is applied to the calculation of the effective potential for the scalar glueball operator. Three different versions of this operator are defined, and for each we compute the associated effective potential and discuss its properties and scheme ambiguities. Contact is made to earlier attempts to guess this effective potential from the conformal anomaly. We apply our results to the Improved Holographic QCD model calculating the glueball condensate.
