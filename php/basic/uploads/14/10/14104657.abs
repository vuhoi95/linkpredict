Title: Cosmological three-coupled scalar theory for the dS/LCFT correspondence
Authors: Yun Soo Myung and Taeyoon Moon
Abstract: We investigate cosmological perturbations generated during de Sitter inflation in the three-coupled scalar theory. This theory is composed of three coupled scalars ($\phi_p,p=1,2,3$) to give a sixth-order derivative scalar theory for $\phi_3$, in addition to tensor. Recovering the power spectra between scalars from the LCFT correlators in momentum space indicates that the de Sitter/logarithmic conformal field theory (dS/LCFT) correspondence works in the superhorizon limit. We use LCFT correlators derived from the dS/LCFT differentiate dictionary to compare cosmological correlators (power spectra) and find also LCFT correlators by making use of extrapolate dictionary. This is because the former approach is more conventional than the latter. A bulk version dual to the truncation process to find a unitary CFT in the LCFT corresponds to selecting a physical field $\phi_2$ with positive norm propagating on the dS spacetime.
