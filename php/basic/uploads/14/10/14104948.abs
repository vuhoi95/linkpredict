Title: Tachyon Condensation on a Nonstationary D$p$-brane with Background  Fields in Superstring Theory
Authors: Farzin Safarzadeh-Maleki and Davoud Kamani
Abstract: Using the boundary state formalism we obtain the partition function corresponding to a dynamical (rotating-moving) D$p$-brane in the presence of electromagnetic and tachyonic background fields in the superstring theory. The instability of such D$p$-brane due to the tachyon condensation is investigated.
