Title: Branes from Light: Embeddings and Energetics for Symmetric $k$-Quarks in  $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM
Authors: Bartomeu Fiol and Alberto Guijosa and Juan F. Pedraza
Abstract: We construct the D3-brane dual to a $k$-quark of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory in the totally symmetric representation of $SU(N)$, undergoing arbitrary motion. Our method of construction generalizes previous work by Mikhailov, and proceeds by shooting light rays inward from the anti-de Sitter boundary, to trace out the brane embedding. We expect this method to have wider relevance, and provide evidence for this by showing that it correctly reproduces the known D5-brane embeddings dual to totally antisymmetric $k$-quarks. As an application of our solutions, we compute the energy of the D3-brane and extract from it the $k$-quark's intrinsic energy and rate of radiation. The result matches expectations based on previous calculations, and makes contact with the exact Bremsstrahlung function for the fundamental representation.
