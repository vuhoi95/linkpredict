Title: One,Two,Zero: Scales of Strong Interactions
Authors: M. P. Lombardo and K. Miura and T. J. Nunes da Silva and E. Pallante
Abstract: We discuss our results on QCD with a number of fundamental fermions ranging from zero to sixteen. These theories exhibit a wide array of fascinating phenomena which have been under close scrutiny, especially in recent years, first and foremost is the approach to conformality. To keep this review focused, we have chosen scale generation, or lack thereof as a guiding theme, however the discussion will be set in the general framework of the analysis of the phases and phase transitions of strong interactions at zero and nonzero temperature.
