Title: Domain walls coupled to matter: the symmetron example
Authors: Claudio Llinares and Levon Pogosian
Abstract: We study properties of domain walls in the symmetron model, in which the scalar gravitational degree of freedom decouples from matter in regions of high density, and exhibits a spontaneously broken $Z_2$ symmetry at low densities. The non-minimal coupling of the scalar to matter leads to a host of interesting properties of the domain walls that are not present in minimally coupled theories. We estimate the cosmological energy fraction in domain walls and find that this leads to an upper bound on the redshift of the symmetry breaking. We also show that a spherical symmetron wall can remain stable if it is "pinned" on matter halos and derive a criterion for the stability. In addition, we present results of numerical simulations of representative interactions between domain walls and matter over-densities.
