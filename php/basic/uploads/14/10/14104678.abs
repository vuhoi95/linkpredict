Title: $PT$ symmetry and a dynamical realization of the SU(1,1) algebra
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Pradip Mukherjee
Abstract: We show that the elementary modes of the planar harmonic oscillator can be quantised in the framework of quantum mechanics based on pseudo-hermitian hamiltonians. These quantised modes are demonstrated to act as dynamical structures behind a new Jordan - Schwinger realization of the SU(1,1) algebra. This analysis complements the conventional Jordan - Schwinger construction of the SU(2) algebra based on hermitian hamiltonians of a doublet of oscillators.
