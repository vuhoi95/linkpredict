Title: Electrical Conductivity of Dense Quark Matter with Fluctuations and  Magnetic Field Included
Authors: B. O. Kerbikov and M. A. Andreichikov
Abstract: We investigate the electrical conductivity(EC) of dense quark matter in the vicinity of the phase transition line. We show that: (i) At high density the Drude EC does not depend on the magnetic field up to $eB \sim 10^{19} \ G$. (ii) In the precritical region the fluctuation EC (paraconductivity) dominates over the Drude one.
