Title: Why has spacetime torsion such negligible effect on our universe?
Authors: Ashmita Das and Biswarup Mukhopadhyaya and Soumitra SenGupta
Abstract: We attempt an answer to the question as to why the evolution of four-dimensional universe is governed by spacetime curvature but not torsion. An answer is found if there is an additional compact spacelike dimension with a warped geometry, with torsion caused by a Kalb-Ramond (KR) antisymmetric tensor field in the bulk. Starting from a Randall-Sundrum type of warped extra dimension, and including the inevitable back reaction ensuing from the radius stabilization mechanism, we show that there is always an extra exponential suppression of the KR field on the four-dimensional projection that constitutes our visible universe. The back reaction is found to facilitate the process of such suppression.
