Title: Hydrogen and muonic-Hydrogen Atomic Spectra in Non-commutative  Space-Time
Authors: M. Haghighat and M. Khorsandi
Abstract: Comparing electronic Hydrogen with muonic Hydrogen shows that the discrepancy in measurement of the Lamb shift in the both systems are relatively of order of $(\frac{m_\mu}{m_e})^{4-5}$. We explore the spectrum of Hydrogen atom in noncommutative $QED$ to compare the noncommutative effects on the both bound states. We show that in the Lorentz violating noncommutative QED the ratio of NC-corrections is $(\frac{m_\mu}{m_e})^3$ while in the Lorentz conserving NCQED is $(\frac{m_\mu}{m_e})^5$. An uncertainty about $1 \,Hz\ll 3\,kHz$ in the Lamb shift of Hydrogen atom leads to an NC correction about $10 \,MHz$ in the Lorentz violating noncommutative QED and about $400 \,GHz$ in the Lorentz conserving noncommutative QED.
