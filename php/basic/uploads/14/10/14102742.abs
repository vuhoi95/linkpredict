Title: N=2 quiver gauge theories on A-type ALE spaces
Authors: Ugo Bruzzo and Francesco Sala and Richard J. Szabo
Abstract: We survey and compare recent approaches to the computation of the partition functions and correlators of chiral BPS observables in $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories on ALE spaces based on quiver varieties and the minimal resolution $X_k$ of the $A_{k-1}$ toric singularity $\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_k$, in light of their recently conjectured duality with two-dimensional coset conformal field theories. We review and elucidate the rigorous constructions of gauge theories for a particular family of ALE spaces, using their relation to the cohomology of moduli spaces of framed torsion free sheaves on a suitable orbifold compactification of $X_k$. We extend these computations to generic $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal quiver gauge theories, obtaining in these instances new constraints on fractional instanton charges, a rigorous proof of the Nekrasov master formula, and new quantizations of Hitchin systems based on the underlying Seiberg-Witten geometry.
