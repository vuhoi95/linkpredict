Title: N=2 Einstein-Yang-Mills' static two-center solutions
Authors: Pablo Bueno and Patrick Meessen and Tomas Ortin and Pedro F. Ramirez
Abstract: We construct bona fide one- and two-center supersymmetric solutions to N=2, d=4 supergravity coupled to SU(2) non-Abelian vector multiplets. The solutions describe black holes and global monopoles alone or in equilibrium with each other and exhibit non-Abelian hairs of different kinds.
