Title: Center of mass, spin supplementary conditions, and the momentum of  spinning particles
Authors: L. Filipe Costa and José Natário
Abstract: We discuss the problem of defining the center of mass in general relativity and the so-called spin supplementary condition. The different spin conditions in the literature, their physical significance, and the momentum-velocity relation for each of them are analyzed in depth. The reason for the non-parallelism between the velocity and the momentum, and the concept of "hidden momentum", are dissected. It is argued that the different solutions allowed by the different spin conditions are equally valid descriptions for the motion of a given test body, and their equivalence is shown to dipole order in curved spacetime. These different descriptions are compared in simple examples.
