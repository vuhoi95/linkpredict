Title: Horizon universality and anomalous conductivities
Authors: Umut Gursoy and Javier Tarrio
Abstract: We show that the value of chiral conductivities associated with anomalous transport is universal in a general class of strongly coupled quantum field theories. Our result applies to theories with no dynamical gluon fields and admitting a gravitational holographic dual in the large N limit. On the gravity side the result follows from near horizon universality of the fluctuation equations, similar to the holographic calculation of the shear viscosity.
