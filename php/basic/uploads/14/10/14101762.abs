Title: Perspective on completing natural inflation
Authors: Ki-Young Choi and Jihn E. Kim and Bumseok Kyae
Abstract: We present a perspective on the inflation paths in 2-, 3-,,, N-flation models based on the ultraviolet completion in heterotic string theory, where a number of grand unification scale axions are used. The number of non-Abelian gauge groups for a natural inflation is restricted in string compactification, and we argue that the most plausible completion of natural inflation from a theory perspective is the 2-flation.
