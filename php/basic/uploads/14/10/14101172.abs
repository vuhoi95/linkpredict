Title: Holographic Accelerated Heavy Quark-Anti-Quark Pair
Authors: Veronika E. Hubeny and Gordon W. Semenoff
Abstract: The problem of a heavy quark-anti-quark pair which have constant eternal acceleration in opposite directions in the vacuum of deconfined maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory is studied both in perturbation theory and at strong coupling using AdS/CFT. Perturbation theory is summed to obtain what is conjectured to be an exact result. It is shown to agree with a particular prescription for computing the disc amplitude in the string theory dual and it yields a value $s=\sqrt{\lambda}$ for the entanglement entropy of the quark and anti-quark.
